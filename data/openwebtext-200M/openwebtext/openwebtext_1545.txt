So I do n't know if you knew this or not but I threw an Easter bash yesterday that would have made the Apostles proud .
Provided the Apostles would be cool with me passing out in my closet at 7:30 with an apartment full of people .
Long story short : I 'm blogging from the bathroom today .
Anyway , this is a picture of Russian Dragon Man .
I call him dragon man because his back is tattooed all scaly and he has fang implants and dragon - eye nipples .
You 're gonna need to hit the jump to see all the action though so go ahead and do that .
But a word of advice : you 're gonna regret it .
Hit the jump for the rest of the cannot - be- unseen awesomeness .

China reported its first monthly trade deficit since 2004 , coming in at $ 7.2 billion .
This deficit will likely to prove temporary as the numbers are n't seasonally adjusted and as China 's exports ( and trade surplus ) is highest in the second half of the year , when Chinese manufacturers delivers toys and other Christmas - related goods .
Even so , the trend is clearly for the Chinese surplus to fall , contrary to the predictions of some so - called trade experts .
This will likely ease the attacks on the Chinese currency peg .
I should in this context comment on the fact that some people have argued that this deficit is too convenient to be true and that the Chinese statistical authorities are " cooking the books " on this issue to ease foreign attack on the currency peg .
While it can't be ruled out that Chinese authorities have manipulated the numbers slightly , the larger picture is highly unlikely to be false .
Why ?
Well , because trade numbers are reported by both the export nation and the import nation .
If China were to report a $ 7.2 billion deficit even though in reality they had a surplus , we would see a big discrepancy relative to numbers reported by China 's trading partners .
For this reason , it is much more difficult to get away with manipulating trade statistics than other statistics .
Knowing this , Chinese statistical authorities will in order to ensure their credibility refrain from any significant manipulation .
Meaning that the reported trade numbers are likely to be basically correct , with at most only minor deviations from the real numbers ( or at least minor intentional deviations ) .

The Zune HD may not have set the MP3 player market on fire , exactly , but it 's a quality piece of hardware with a slick and attractive user interface .
It 's also a platform that developers can write games for .
Unfortunately , third party games on the Zune are restricted in what they can do ; they must be developed using Microsoft 's .
NET - based XNA Framework .
This would n't normally be a problem , as XNA usually offers high - performance Direct3D graphics .
However , on the Zune HD , XNA supports only simple 2D graphics , and no hardware accelerated 3D .
The result is lackluster graphical performance , even though the NVIDIA Tegra powering the Zune HD is highly capable .
The restricted environment also prevented third - party applications from accessing the Internet through the device 's WiFi connection .
Enter the OpenZDK .
Through exploiting a flaw in the Zune 's firmware , it 's possible to run native applications on the Zune .
This exposes the full power of the Zune 's hardware to developers : most importantly , programs can use the widespread OpenGL ES 2.0 API ( the same 3D API that the iPhone supports ) to exploit all the capabilities of the Tegra chip .
This in turn allows third - party applications to achieve the same quality as Microsoft 's own Zune games like Project Gotham Racing : Ferrari Edition .
As those Microsoft - published games demonstrated , the Zune HD hardware is more than capable of providing a first - rate gaming experience .
PGR , in particular , is both fun and extremely good - looking .
Until now , however , the restrictions on third - party developers have left that power largely untapped .
It should be fairly easy for developers to get up to speed on native development with the ZDK .
The Zune HD operating system is based on Windows CE 6 ( as will be the forthcoming Windows Phone 7 platform ) , so development and deployment is quite easy : this is a widely supported and well understood OS .
OpenGL likewise is something familiar to a lot of game developers .
However , the fun may not last long .
Just as Apple has fixed exploits allowing jailbreaks on the iPhone , Microsoft might well choose to fix the exploit ( or exploits ) that are being used to enable native Zune development .
In many ways , this would be a pity .
The Zune HD clearly has a lot of potential : it 's too bad that it requires hacks to live up to it .
Lonesome Hobo Economics :
… Kind ladies and kind gentlemen …
Once I was very prosperous
There was nothing I did lack
I had fourteen carat gold , in my mouth ,

But I did not trust my brother
I carried him to blame
Which led me to my fatal doom
To wander off in shame .

The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Goldman Sachs with massive fraud .
The golden boys , the guys with so many connections they could NOT lose , the ones that played the big games at the top , whose true dimensions of gangsterish culture even Hollywood has not , despite thousands of attempts , yet fully captured .
Them .
Here ’s the smoking gun email :
“ At the same time , GS& Co recognized that market conditions were presenting challenges to the successful marketing of CDO transactions backed by mortgage - related securities .
For example , portions of an email in French and English sent by Tourre to a friend on January 23 , 2007 stated , in English translation where applicable : ‘ More and more leverage in the system , The whole building is about to collapse anytime now … Only potential survivor , the fabulous Fab[rice Tourre ] … standing in the middle of all these complex , highly leveraged , exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstrosities !!!’
Similarly , an email on February 11 , 2007 to Tourre from the head of the GS& Co structured product correlation trading desk stated in part , ‘ the cdo biz is dead we do n’t have a lot of time left . ' ”
It turns out they sold billions of dollars of dubiously rated securities to their customers while privately using hedge funds and credit default swaps to bet even more money – the fees they collected and their own money – that their foolish customers would likely be wiped out !
This is called “ going broke for profit ” in a famous study by George Akerlof and Paul Romer on why bailouts can encourage gangsterish activity in the most “ high - minded and prudent people ” ( Alan Greenspan ’s affectionate salute to the bankers ’ mentality ) .
Not only that , Goldman made another fabulous getaway .
They persuaded the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department that regardless of whatever else may happen to companies like insurance giant AIG , the money owed Goldman would be paid in full , by taxpayer dollars if necessary .
It looked like they were going to sail untouched through the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s .
Once client alone , Paulson & Company , cost investors close to $ 1 billion in mortgage - backed securities while investing heavily in a hedge fund , to capitalize on the housing bust .
As noted above , the Goldman executive accused of shepherding the deal boasted about the “ exotic trades ” he created “ without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstrosities !!! ”
The news sent Goldman Sachs shares and the stock market reeling as the SEC said other financial deals related to the meltdown continue to be investigated .
Goldman Sachs denied the allegations .
In a statement , it called the SEC ’s charges “ completely unfounded in law and fact ” and said it will contest them .
Of course the real crime of Goldman Sachs – buying the U.S. government through lobbying and placing former executives as appointees in high places – is not yet exposed .
Like CEO Blankenship of Massey Energy , who blatantly bought one , possibly two , state Supreme Court justices to put itself beyond law enforcement , the Hobo would like to see both him and Goldman CEO Blankfein doing the “ perp ” walk for supreme corruption .
The case highlights the urgent need to bear down on financial reform , and put the shadow banking system which permitted the fraud under firm public control and regulation .
Goldman is the argument par exemplar for also breaking up the big banks , and especially the investment houses .
It can be argued that Goldman effectively captured the government regulators of the past 20 years – it will be harder for any regulatory regime to enforce the public interest when the regulate - ee has 10 times the resources of the regulator !

The cloud of volcanic ash drifting across Europe is continuing to make much of the continent a no - fly zone this week .
It is still unclear how long that disruption will last , but the longer flights are grounded , the greater the impact will be on businesses and the wider economy .
AIRLINES
The most direct casualty of the ash is the airline industry .
The International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) estimates that airlines are collectively losing £ 130 m per day in lost revenues .
If the disruption persists for several weeks , total losses could run into billions , having a catastrophic effect on an industry already set to lose £ 1.4 bn this year .
Travel companies are also losing out .
TUI , the owner of First Choice and Thomson and Europe 's biggest travel operator , says it is losing between £ 5 m and £ 6 m a day .
The Prime Minister Gordon Brown admitted the problem was so serious that financial help for airlines would be considered .
OTHER TRANSPORT
Other transport companies are benefiting as passengers look for alternatives to flying .
Ferry services have benefited from the flight restrictions Eurostar in particular has seen huge demand from passengers since the disruption began on Thursday .
The company said it carried 50,000 extra passengers on Thursday and Friday - an increase of nearly a third - with services effectively full .
Over the weekend , it began laying on extra services , with six extra trains planned for Monday .
Train services between Scotland and the south of England are also reporting a big rise in passenger numbers , as are cross - channel ferry companies .
P&O ferries says its services between Spain , France , Holland and the UK are currently either full or close to full , with extra staff drafted in to the call centre to handle the huge volume of calls .
TOURISM
The impact on the tourism industry is expected to be relatively small , if the disruption lasts no longer than a few days .
As Howard Archer , chief UK and Europe Economist at IHS Global Insight , points out , it is currently not a peak time for tourism in Europe .
Although the tourism industry will lose money from customers unable to make the trip , stranded passengers unable to return home will also be forced to spend more money than expected - offsetting some of those losses .
Prolonged disruption could have a much greater impact on tourism , however , especially in the run-up to the busier summer months .
That would also be bad timing for Greece in particular , as its struggling economy is heavily reliant on tourists arriving by air .
IMPORTS AND EXPORTS
International trade relies more heavily on road , rail and sea freight than it does on air freight .
For example , just 1 % of the UK 's trade , by volume , is carried by air .
But the disruption has caused real problems for those trading perishable goods , including food and flowers , which depend on air freight .
Exporters of perishable goods , such as flowers , are being badly affected Food exports from Africa and the Caribbean are among those hit , with reports of Kenyan farmers being forced to dump stocks of fresh food and flowers destined for European consumers .
According to a report in Kenya 's Daily Nation newspaper , the Kenyan economy is losing $ 3.8 m a day as a result of flight cancellations to Europe .
That scale of losses is expected to be repeated in agriculture - based economies across Africa and South America .
Supermarkets ' supplies of some fresh produce could soon be affected , though no problems have yet been reported by UK retailers .
Meanwhile , carmaker Nissan has also announced a one - day suspension of production of three of its models in Japan because it has been unable to import parts from the Irish Republic .
OTHER BUSINESS COSTS
Businesses are also expected to lose money through cancelled meetings , stranded staff , and delays to air mail .
Productivity in the UK is expected to suffer due to workers being unable to return to work , according to the Centre for Economic and Business Research ( CEBR ) .
Meanwhile , major courier companies FedEx , DHL and TNT have reported delays and disruption to their services .
ECONOMIC GROWTH
In the short - term , the overall economic impact of the disruption is expected to be minimal .
But a prolonged period without air transport could have a detrimental effect on European economies just as they are emerging from a damaging recession , some economists warn .
A drop of between 1 % and 2 % for European economies is not being ruled out .
" That would mean a lot of European countries would n't get any growth this year , " said Chatham House senior economic fellow Vanessa Rossi .
" But the problem is , it is incredibly hard to predict what will happen .
Even the geologists can't tell us . "

The taxi driver ’s face brightened up when my husband and I arrived at the dingy Guilin airport in southern China on the last flight in from Shanghai .
We were exhausted from traveling by plane and train every couple of days .
The drive to Yangshuo , where the mountain peaks are shaped like gumdrops , would take an hour and a half .
“ You ’re Chinese , ” she said .
She was short and wore baggy clothes .
“ You speak Chinese ? ”
“ Yi dian , ” I said .
One drop .
A little .
After traveling in China for more than a week , my language skills had improved somewhat .
I could make small talk , though I would struggle in an argument .
But Yi dian was invitation enough for the cabby to start chatting .
We started down a steep , dark gravel road , the tiny car shaking .
“ Is this the exit ? ” I asked , adjusting my seat belt and holding onto the vibrating door handle .
“ This will save money , ” the cabby said , evading the toll .
A shortcut to save money .
I understood .
Like my parents , the cabby was penny - pinching .
My parents , kin to many who came of age in war and its aftermath , have n’t shaken the memory of want .
We were “ not cheap , ” Mom had insisted .
“ Thrift .
We are thrift . ”

Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D - Wash . ) is not pleased with the way the chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee is being treated .
Gender politics hits financial debate
As if derivatives were n’t hard enough to comprehend — and regulate — add a little gender politics .
That ’s what surfaced in last Thursday ’s closed - door Democratic Policy Committee meeting when Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D - Wash . ) called out the Senate old boys for seeming to brush off the new girl on the financial reform block : Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Blanche Lincoln ( D - Ark . ) .
Advertisement
Resentment had been building already over the fact that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner never met with Lincoln on her derivative bill prior to her markup last week .
And as described by two persons in the room , Cantwell served notice that it would be a big political mistake if Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd ( D - Conn . ) did n’t alter his package to blend in major portions of Lincoln ’s work product .
“ It was tough , pointed , ” said one observer .
“ It was about jurisdiction but also gender . ”
Monday ’s joint announcement by Dodd and Lincoln of agreement on that chapter brought a measure of peace , and the two senators had a pleasant exchange on the floor .
But Cantwell forced into the open genuine tension between the two camps over the substance of the regulations — and Lincoln ’s new status as a player .
“ She ’s one tough lady too , ” Lincoln told POLITICO .
“ I think she was feeling a lot of the same sentiments that a lot of us were ”
Asked about the treatment of Lincoln , Cantwell singled out Geithner : “ The treasury secretary did n’t meet with her until after the bill was passed out of the committee …
It ’s important to go back and realize that we deregulated the derivatives , preventing the CFDC [ Commodity Futures Trading Commission ] from doing their job , and a big part of getting this right is to go back and make sure derivatives are properly overseen by that agency . ”
“ So why someone would skip out , not talking to her about it .
It seems to me that would be a mistake . ”
“ Treasury has been working closely with the Agriculture Committee throughout the process , ” said a spokesman for the department .
But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) told POLITICO that he also thought Geithner had erred by not meeting with the chairwoman earlier .
“ Absolutely , he should have been up and talked to her , ” Reid said .
“ She ’s the chairman of the committee .
Absolutely . ”
Dodd ’s office had no comment , stung by the incident and wanting to move on and focus on the joint letter .
But the derivatives chapter remains an area of dispute with Republicans and in some cases Treasury — and may not be so easy to put behind .
“ I do n’t have any beef with Reid .
He ’s doing a good job .
I have concern about other people , ” Cantwell said .
“ I want to make sure that both committee bills get integrated .
It ’s not just one committee .
You have two bills and you should respect both . ”
Cantwell herself has long favored tougher regulations for derivatives ; and although not on Senate Agriculture , she was an influence on Lincoln and encouraged her “ get tough ” regulatory stance .
Cantwell also brings her own experience with Congress ’s old boy network :
She was one of several House Democratic women who lost their seats in 1994 after backing President Clinton ’s agenda while their male colleagues often played it safer .
Going home from Congress , she next made millions in the high tech boom , money she used to win a seat in the Senate , where ironically one of the first crises she faces was derivative driven : Enron ’s energy - swaps scandal in 2001 - 2002 and its impact on West Coast states like Washington .
In Lincoln ’s case , she had been widely anticipated to play it safe on regulatory reform by producing an industry - friendly bill last week .
An earlier draft sent to Banking indicated as much , but she swung left before the markup , producing a bill far stricter than the House - passed version .
In fact , the administration takes some credit for this shift — something she appears to resent .
But in any case she now finds herself championing some of the toughest positions taken by her party — going even beyond the so - called Volcker rule espoused by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , an adviser to President Barack Obama .
Her skeptics suggest she has swung with the political currents at home where she faces a primary challenge from the left next month .
But she would argue that she ’s a “ farmer ’s daughter ” following common sense .
“ You know there are some of us really want to tackle this problem and we ’ve been working hard to do it , " she said Monday night “ Although a lot of people think they want to move quickly , they may not want to move too quickly with some of the stuff that we ’ve done . ”
“ We ’re getting there , ” she said .
“ Heavens no , ” she laughs in mock surprise of any old boy treatment .
“ You would have to ask someone else that .
I ’m working very hard to be a good chairman . ”

This interview was originally published by AlterNet .
On March 24 , 2010 , the Park Center for Independent Media at Ithaca College , in Ithaca , NY announced that award - winning independent journalist Jeremy Scahill would receive the second annual “ Izzy Award . ”
The Izzy , which is named after the legendary muckraker I.F.
Stone , celebrates outstanding achievement in independent media .
Last year ’s winners were Amy Goodman of Democracy Now ! and Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com .
Scahill is a two - time Polk Award winner , and a regular contributor to The Nation , Democracy Now ! and AlterNet .
His book , Blackwater : the Rise of the World ’s Most Powerful Mercenary Army , is an international bestseller .
In 2009 , he published dozens of stories detailing Blackwater ’s secret presence in Pakistan ; its involvement in 2007 ’s Nisour Square massacre ; and its CEO ’s alleged complicity in murder .
“ The judges chose Scahill for his relentless efforts in 2009 to push these issues into mainstream debate , ” said Jeff Cohen , director of the Park Center for Independent Media .
“ We are awed by Scahill ’s success , and also by the sheer number of outstanding candidates for the award this year ; both reflect the growing importance of independent media in our country . ”
Scahill , a Puffin Foundation Writing Fellow at The Nation Institute , will appear at Ithaca College on April 19 to receive his award .
AlterNet ’s Byard Duncan caught up with him Wednesday morning to discuss the award and the future of independent journalism ( interview is edited for length and clarity ) .
Byard Duncan :
What does it mean to be an “ independent journalist ? ”
Jeremy Scahill : I would define an independent journalist as someone that ’s totally un-embedded when it comes to their relationship with the powerful .
In other words , you do n’t get into bed with any political party .
I ’m not a Democrat ; I ’m not a Republican .
I ’m a journalist .
It means that you do n’t get in bed with the military , with the CIA , or wealthy corporations , and you do n’t compromise your journalistic or your personal integrity in the pursuit of anything , including a story .
I believe that the way independent journalists are most effectively able to conduct their work is by maintaining their independence from the powerful .
I do n’t hob - nob with the powerful .
I do n’t count among my friends executives or other powerful people .
I think it ’s important for independent journalists to not be beholden to any special interests whatsoever .
On the flip side of that , it ’s the role of independent journalists to embed themselves with the victims of U.S. foreign policy — in the case of U.S. journalists — or domestic policy .
What I mean by that is to actually go out to where the people live who are most affected by these policies — be it Afghanistan or the slums of the United States .
You have to be un-embedded from the powerful and you have to embed yourself with the disempowered , because I think part of our role as independent journalists is not only to confront those in power , but to give voice to the voiceless .
BD : You ’ve reported from all over the world .
Talk about the relationships you ’ve observed between the powerful and the powerless .
JS : You have this nexus of the iron fist of U.S. militarism that is backing up the so - called “ hidden hand ” of the free market .
And so what we see is that the United States will economically target countries , then have that targeting of them with economic neo-liberalism backed up by brute military force — by supporting military dictatorships , by interfering in elections .
One strain that has tied together the people that live on the other side of the barrel of the gun that is U.S. foreign and economic policy is that they always , out of the rubble , seem to emerge in some form of resistance .
We ’ve seen that in Iraq , and we ’re seeing it in Afghanistan .
We ’ve certainly seen it throughout Latin America .
Another thing that ’s important for people to remember :
If we fail to stop the United States from targeting communities across the globe , we do n’t choose the kind of resistance that people offer up to wars that we should have stopped .
We in this country have an obligation to hold our leaders responsible , because if we do n’t , then in one way or another , we ’re responsible for the consequences — either in terms of attacks on civilians there , or in opposition that rises up violently to the policies we had a moral obligation to try to confront and expose .
BD : What about some of independent media ’s limits ?
JS : You have to fight for access to anything happening — you ’re boxed out of press conferences ; you ’re not given interviews with powerful people .
If there ’s one thing that I ’ve learned after years of working in independent media , it ’s that you have to work harder than corporate journalists .
Because a corporate journalist ’s kid ’s godfather might be the secretary of the interior , or went to Harvard with this member of Congress .
Or they go to yacht parties with that executive from Goldman Sachs .
People who are out there doing rabble - rousing journalism , we have to fight to get credentials to get into events ; we have to actually ambush powerful people or officials because they wo n’t return our calls .
I ’ve been to every Democratic and Republican convention since 1996 , and still to this day feel like a kid in a candy store .
Literally what I do from morning till night is run around trying to track down all of those members of Congress that would never give me an interview .
I find them in the hallways and back them into a corner and ask them questions that they have refused to answer when I tried to do it through official means .
The other part of it :
You are not in the lab of the powerful , so you have to file a lot of FOIA requests ; you have to fight secretive bureaucracies .
Oftentimes , you ’re pursuing stories that are not being pursued by the corporate media .
And therefore it ’s easier for the powerful to sweep it away and say , “ no one ’s going to care if it ’s just The Nation Magazine .
No one ’s going to care if it ’s AlterNet . ”
So we are constantly fighting that uphill battle to pursue these stories that no one else is looking at , against the odds and against a network of individuals that have a vested interest in not having those stories come out .
BD : Barack Obama had big promises about transparency when he first took office .
He campaigned on it .
But according to a recent L.A. Times article , the Obama administration has denied FOIA requests 70,779 times in its first year ( the Bush White House denied only 47,395 requests in the same amount of time ) .
What ’s your take on Obama ’s transparency claims ?
JS : I think I have six outstanding FOIA requests that have gone months without any response .
I have had several document requests rejected from federal agencies when I ’ve been doing my investigations of covert U.S. military and intelligence operations .
One of the unfortunate but predictable realities of the political moment that we ’re living in right now is that the Obama administration has continued some of the most atrocious policies of the Bush administration — and unfortunately has implemented policies that , in some cases , are worse than those of the Bush administration .
If you look at the Obama administration ’s position on prisoner rights issues , on civil liberties issues , on domestic spying issues , on issues of war and peace , the Obama administration in some ways is worse than the Bush administration .
They claim to preach from a gospel of open government .
And in some cases , you do see that federal agencies are more responsive to journalists now than they were under the Bush Administration :
You can actually get someone on the phone in the State Department or the Defense Department in a way that would n’t be possible under the Bush administration .
But the information they ’re willing to give you has n’t changed much at all .
BD : According to a recent Pew poll , newspaper ad revenues have dipped 43 percent in the last three years .
Magazine revenues are drying up , too .
How does this affect what you do ?
JS : When I started out in journalism , Amy Goodman was paying me $ 40 a day out of her pocket to come in and write news headlines for Democracy Now !
when it was on , like , 20 radio stations .
I basically spent much of the first six or seven years I was in journalism making nothing and writing for Common Dreams and AlterNet and Counterpunch — scraping together what I could from Pacifica Radio and from Democracy Now !.
I never was working for an outlet that depended on any sort of corporate sponsorship or ad revenue .
What ’s really impacted the work of journalists like myself or institutions like AlterNet and The Nation that rely on the generosity of individuals — or in the case of the Nation Institute , foundations — is that the economic crisis has meant that there was an almost overnight reduction of almost 40 percent of all the money that was available to support independent media .
There ’s a real crisis right now in journalism , because a lot of the best journalists are struggling to make ends meet , and I think we ’re in a moment where corporations are more dominant over newsgathering and news production and disseminating information than they ’ve ever been .
Contrary to that , though , you also have this sort of “ citizen journalism ” rising up , where you have people that are staring their own blogs or their own web sites .
I think that you have a danger when we lose that old - school , fact - checking operation where you have peers critiquing your work .
Those with the resources to do fact checking and build an old - school journalism bureaucracy — which in some ways is very good — are unfortunately those that are funded by corporations and have an agenda .
I think we ’re at a moment where we have a lot of really good independent journalism that ’s being produced by bloggers and independent journalists , but we also need to not go far away from that tradition of peer review , editing and fact - checking .
We ’re at a ground zero moment of how to save real journalism without succumbing to the ownership desires of large corporations or other corporate forces .
BD : Given the political divisiveness of issues like health care , there ’s a lot of pressure for progressive publications to fall into what you have called a “ blue state ” mentality .
What are the hazards of this ?
JS : I was talking about a liberal equivalent of Fox News , where you had all these liberal journalists that were sort of gaga over President Obama because he was President Obama .
I think you had quite a substantial amount of intellectual dishonesty from people who were holding the Bush administration accountable for actions that the Obama administration was taking from day one , and even announced on the campaign trail .
Health care is a perfect example of this .
Obviously , we want to have pre-existing conditions covered .
Obviously , we want young people to be able to continue on their parents ’ health care plans .
There are many things that are going to be improvements .
But let ’s be clear here :
This is a complete and total sellout to the interests of the insurance lobby by the Obama administration .
This is , as Michael Moore has said , a complete victory for the ultra-capitalists .
Yet , if you look on the liberal blogosphere , people like Jane Hamsher are attacked mercilessly for having the audacity to stand up and say “ this is a Democratic sellout . ”
So you have this blind allegiance to … what ?
To Obama as a man ?
To the Democrats as a party ?
To me , it ’s very dangerous when you start going down the road of unquestioning support for any powerful individual or any politician .
The moment you cede your conscience to a politician is the moment you stop struggling for a better society .
BD : You won this award in part because of your ability to elevate stories to front - page news in the mainstream media .
Talk about independent media ’s relationship to the mainstream .
JS : I ’ve gotten many e-mails and phone calls from friends and colleagues where they ’ll say “ the New York Times just ripped of this story of yours , ” or , “ did you see that piece in the Washington Post ?
They did n’t even give you credit . ”
I ’ve almost never had a reaction of anger , or saying , “ why was n’t I credited in that ? ”
That ’s not the point of this kind of journalism — editors can get mad about that stuff .
To me , if the New York Times picks up on a story and puts it on the front page , that means that something is probably going to get done about it .
It should be taken as a very positive thing when these corporate media are forced to cover an issue because independent journalists have driven it with drumbeat coverage .
I remember how proud I was when I saw the New York Times forced to credit Marcy Wheeler , who was an online blogger , for picking up details on the Bush administration ’s torture program .
They had to credit Marcy Wheeler , and put a quote from her , and cite her in their newspaper .
That to me was a great moment in the recent history of independent media , because what it did was shame the corporate media .
It said that a blogger with very little resources can out - scoop the New York Times on a very important story that was catching headlines at that time .
Part of what we ’re doing is trying to fill the void that is left from corporate media .
We either shame them , or force them to cover it , because we make it a major issue .
When my book first came out , I thought I was going to be running around the country selling it out of my backpack , which was fine with me .
What I ’ve learned from doing this story is that if you go around the country , if you keep at it , if you beat the drum , if your facts are all in order , and you just keep going , you can have an impact .
But you ca n’t give up .
We live in a very exciting time in independent media .
Corporate journalists are less powerful now than they were 10 years ago , but their owners are much more powerful .
Still , the journalists themselves — they ’re no longer these sort of regal kings on a hill .
Peggy Noonan represents a dying generation of people that pontificate from a golden palace somewhere , hoping the poor will never get through her gates .
The poor are now journalists around the world .
The question is : how do we fund it ?
How do we keep it viable ?
How do we keep it credible ?
And that is our challenge right now .
Underground " nuke proof " data bunkers have been used in commercial storage for decades .
In recent years , subterranean bunkers have emerged as a growing niche in the data center ecosystem .
Perhaps no company reflects that transition as well as Iron Mountain , a traditional leader in document storage that is now building a digital storage empire .
The flagship facility in the company 's push into the data center sector is a huge underground facility in western Pennsylvania .
Iron Mountain bought the former limestone mine , which houses 1.7 million square feet of space , from the National Underground in 1998 .
It has developed a section of the mine into an energy - efficient data center known as Room 48 .
Located more than 200 feet underground , Room 48 takes advantage of its subterranean environment .
The mine 's temperature remains steady at 55 degrees and the imestone walls to absorb heat eliminate the need for typical data center cooling systems that consume large amounts of power .
The mine was opened in 1902 by U.S. Steel to provide limestone for its operations , but the company abandoned the site in 1952 .
The founders of National Underground Storage then bought 80 acres for record storage , and soon convinced federal officials to store vital documents in the old mine to preserve them in the event of a nuclear attack .
Around the same time , Herman Knaust founded Iron Mountain in a former iron ore mine in Livingston , N.Y .
Their paths intersected in 1998 , when Iron Mountain acquired the National Underground site for $ 39 million .
Today more than 2,700 employees work in underground records vaults spread over 130 acres .
About 150 of those are Iron Mountain employees , with the remainder working for the company 's many customers .
The facility has its own restaurant , fire trucks , water treatment plant and backup power infrastructure .

PR professionals use social media every single day to get the word out about clients , to communicate with customers and to respond to questions or problems .
Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and other social sites have quickly become important tools in a PR professional 's overall toolkit .
As one PR professional , Jeremy Pepper , told us ,
" There are so many uses — conversational marketing , reaching influencers — that PR is able to participate in conversations and answer questions , be a support system for clients and companies , as well as empowering customers and power users to be a de facto resource for your company , a champion for your products . "
We 're going to take a look at how PR professionals are using social media to achieve real results when dealing with business - to - business relationships , when representing companies that already have a well - known brand , and in politics .
We 'll also look into some of the tools of the trade that PR pros are using to measure the success of their endeavors .
The Role of Social Media in Business - to - Business PR
Pepper considers social media an important part of the public relations toolkit .
When I asked him what social media has to offer PR professionals , he said , " Social media is a great tool for public relations people , especially if you align it to both PR goals and figure out what the ROI is for the client or the company . "
As we 've pointed out when discussing measuring social media ROI , having a goal in mind or a main focus can be very important when using social media for any reason .
Pepper offered some insight into how he uses social media with Palisade Systems , a business - to - business data loss prevention company .
For Palisade , the main goal is to increase the company 's name recognition .
Because data loss prevention deals with sensitive data and often regulatory compliance ( for things like HIPPA / HITECH , FERPA and others ) , having strong name recognition is important , as a known name can often be equated with trust .
Pepper explained how he goes about reaching his client 's core audience , in this case small and medium - sized enterprises .
" At Palisade , we 've done a three - pronged approach : traditional PR , traditional analyst relations and social media .
We have a Palisade Blog where we write and talk about Data Loss Prevention and various issues for corporations , we are on Twitter , shooting out information , retweeting interesting articles in the space , and participating in conversations [ @PalisadeDLP ] , and , we reach out to security bloggers . "
While I expected Twitter to have limited use in a B2B PR strategy , it turns out it can actually be pretty powerful .
By following security experts and industry analysts , Palisade can take part in the conversations happening in the space .
Pepper can also track keywords on Twitter and then communicate with CIOs and IT people who are asking questions about DLP and he can then send them case studies or reach out to start a new kind of relationship .
As Pepper said , " It lets the people know that there is another solution besides the large corporations , and lets us have conversations with the analysts beyond the calls . "
Blogging , for instance , is one way the company can share stories beyond just what goes into a press release .
" One recent example is that EPISD ( El Paso Independent School District ) is a legacy customer of Palisade Systems , and recently signed up for the DLP solution .
I interviewed the IT staff for the press release , and got great anecdotes that were n't really appropriate for the press release .
But I was able to tell them in the blog post , and expand on why they continue to use Palisade — because of our support , and our product . "
Social Media Drives Authenticity
Political figures have really embraced social media — the White House has an official presence on Twitter , Facebook and YouTube , plus its own blog - powered website , for example — and more and more local and national representatives from all over the world are taking to the web to connect with their constituents .
Claire McCaskill , the junior U.S. Senator from Missouri , is one politician that has embraced social media in a big way .
On Twitter , @clairecmc has nearly 37,000 followers — making her the second - most popular person in Congress , according to Tweetcongress.org .
The Senator also has a YouTube channel and a Tumblr blog that she uses to share information with her constituents and to respond to questions .
Anamarie Rebori , a spokesperson for Senator McCaskill , told us that the senator actively uses social media .
" While it definitely has changed the way she gets the word out , McCaskill has said that if anything , she is glad she has the opportunity to bring a more personal touch to her communications and get outside the Washington bubble , " Rebori said .
Especially for politicians , authenticity is an important part of PR .
According to Rebori , McCaskill has been able to utilize social media to communicate authentically .
" People seem to respond best to an authentic touch over Twitter , and that ’s something that Senator McCaskill has been able to convey in her use of social media , " Rebori said .
" It ’s really her typing each of those tweets , and people can tell . ”
Senator McCaskill makes a point of reading every tweet that is addressed her way — and she also makes a point to respond to others on Twitter , either via @replies or direct messages .
However , as the Senator explained in her Tumblr blog , she does n't follow anyone .
That 's not because of lack of engagement , it 's because it 's the best way the senator can allocate her resources .
Furthermore , the senator has developed a hashtag for Missourians to use so that she can connect with as many of them as possible .
If you 're a Missouri resident and you use #MO in a tweet , chances are it will get the senator 's attention .
There are huge possibilities from a PR perspective for politicians who use social media , as Senator McCaskill 's success shows .
Building Brand Loyalty
Pepper also works with computer bag and accessory provider Targus .
Because the company is already well - known in its space , the goals for public relations are different than with other brands .
“ Working with a very well - liked brand , it ’s both hard and easy to get conversations going , " Pepper said , who explained that responding to negative feedback is rarely an issue because Targus gets very little .
Instead , the approach for Pepper has been figuring out ways to develop brand loyalty and turn customers into fans .
One method that has yielded results for Targus is utilizing its Twitter account for giveaways and promotions and monitoring Twitter conversations to target bag - buying consumers .
In one situation , Pepper followed a conversation between a user who had a bag from a rival company .
Pepper tweeted the user a coupon code for 25 % off , which ended up being more than what the company that made his old bag had offered him and resulted in the user writing about his experience .
That ’s the type of thing that can create long - time customers and also get users observing or reading about the situation to consider Targus for their next product .
Using social media has provided Pepper with a simple way to build brand loyalty without having to invest significant time and resources .
Tools of the Trade
Josh Jones - Dilworth , the founder and CEO of the PR and marketing consulting firm Jones - Dilworth , Inc. ( and a Mashable guest author ) has a lot of expertise in blogging and social media .
As such , Jones - Dilworth has developed his own system for measuring the effectiveness of different social media approaches as they relate to PR .
Jones - Dilworth explained that while it 's fairly easy to measure conversations and engagement on an empirical level , putting that analytical data into context so that it can be evaluated as cause and effect is considerably more difficult .
" Right now we are doing a lot of work to mash up social data with business data to get cause and effect .
Some products are starting to support this action — but only a few .
I think this is the next big wave .
You 've got to be able to tie causes to effects , and that is the big challenge right now , what all our clients want , and what is frankly the hardest to accomplish . "
We absolutely agree that this is both a big challenge when evaluating the successfulness of social media in any context — PR or otherwise — and that it is going to be a large area of growth in the future .
For the future , Jones - Dilworth sees visualizations and modeling as two key components to watch for .
" Visualization [ is important ] because we really need to be able to make these streams come alive and make them navigable , otherwise you 've got death by data , pure and simple .
More is more is more until it is n't .
Modeling is all about predicting out futures :
Who will be the Farecast of social media ?
Who will help with intelligent decision support ? "
However , just because he does n't have all the tools at his disposal now does n't mean that Jones - Dilworth is operating in the dark .
Here is Jones - Dilworth 's list of the tools that he uses for tracking social media results in his work as a PR pro :
He also points to these tools that he enjoys playing with :
Until we reach the stage where drawing contextual correlations between social media actions and results can be more easily measured ( or at least , more easily distilled ) , it is vital to have concrete goals before starting a social media strategy in PR and to also have some sort of baseline .
Common Threads
PR professionals are using social media in a lot of ways to either supplement or add on to existing PR strategies .
The most successful PR pros focus on creating active relationships and truly engaging with their customers ( or constituents ) to have a real conversation .
It is n't about just putting a PR pitch on Twitter or Facebook , it 's about using the platforms in ways that help clients to connect .

As hooking up takes over from dating as a means of heterosexual interaction on university campuses , more women than men continue to prefer dating whereas more men than women rate hooking up above dating .
Both genders however perceive similar benefits and risks to dating and hooking up .
Carolyn Bradshaw from James Madison University in Virginia , US , and colleagues explored the reasons that motivate college men and women to hook up or to date , as well as the perceived relative benefits and costs of the two practices .
Their findings are published online in Springer 's journal Sex Roles .
Typically , dating follows a predictable pattern whereby the man is active − he asks the woman to go out with him , organizes the date and at the end of it may initiate sexual activity ; whereas the woman is reactive − she waits to be asked out on a date and accepts or rejects the man 's sexual overtures .
They know each other or want to get to know one another and there is the prospect of a future relationship .
In contrast , a hook up is a casual sexual encounter , which usually occurs between people who are strangers or brief acquaintances .
For instance , two people meet at a party where they have been drinking ; they flirt and engage in sexual behaviors from kissing to sexual intercourse , with no commitment to a future relationship .
Bradshaw and team exposed 150 female and 71 male college students from a southern , public American university to a variety of dating and / or hooking up situations , such as when there was potential for a relationship , when their partner had a great personality and when drinking was involved .
They asked the students the extent to which they would prefer dating or hooking up in each situation .
The participants were also asked to pick the top three benefits and top three risks associated with dating and hooking up from a checklist , as well as provide details of their dating and hooking up activities over the past two years .
Even though men initiated significantly more first dates than women , there was no gender difference in the number of first dates or number of hook - ups .
For both men and women , the number of hook ups was nearly double the number of first dates .
Overall , both genders showed a preference for traditional dating over hooking up .
However , of those students who strongly preferred traditional dating , there were significantly more women than men ( 41 percent versus 20 percent ) .
Of those who showed a strong preference for hooking up , there were far fewer women than men ( 2 percent versus 17 percent ) .
However , context mattered : when considering the possibility of a long - term relationship , both women and men preferred dating over hooking up ; however , when the possibility of a relationship was not mentioned , men preferred hooking up and women preferred dating .
On the whole , men and women agreed on the benefits and risks of dating and hooking up .
However , there were some notable differences :
In 1954 , in a much - debated letter we featured here back in October , Einstein wrote , ‘ The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weakness , the Bible a collection of honorable , but still purely primitive , legends which are nevertheless pretty childish ’ .
Today we have another of Einstein ’s letters , again concerning religion and equally as outspoken , but written four years previous – in 1950 – to a Morton Berkowitz .
Transcript follows .

Mr. Morton Berkowitz
365 New York Ave .
Brooklyn N.Y .
Dear Mr. Berkowitz :
I felt very grateful receiving your kind letter of October 24th .
Such utterances are the finest reward for an author .
My position concerning God is that of an agnostic .
I am convinced that vivid consciousness of the primary importance of moral principles for the betterment and enoblement of life does not need the idea of a law - giver , especially a law - giver who works on the basis of reward and punishment
I am sending you under separate cover two books of mine containing occasional writings where you will find more about this subject .
Sincerely yours ,
( Signed , ‘ A. Einstein . ’)
Albert Einstein .
Trudie Pert ’s current TOO article ( Post - Genome Princeton ) illustrates once again that all of our elite institutions are essentially enemy - occupied territory .
Princeton ’s president , Shirley Tilghman , is the sort of White person that is absolutely poisonous to our cause .
She doubtless feels morally superior as she champions Black causes , investing millions of dollars in faculty and facilities for the Black Studies Department and admitting Blacks with an average of 230 points less on the SAT than Whites .
She is also doing her best to absolutely eliminate
White males from high - profile positions .
My favorite is making a woman dean of the School of Engineering even though she is not an engineer .
Non-Jewish
Whites are vastly underrepresented as students by a factor of around 4 , while Jews are overrepresented by a factor of around 5 ( unusually low for an Ivy League University ) .
It is common among White advocates to see White politicians and at least some anti-White activists ( such as Morris Dees ) as sociopaths , and there is much to recommend this point of view .
I do n’t think that is the case with people like Tilghman , even though she has profited mightily from her position ( > 530,000 salary + millions in stock and stock options from being on the Google Board of Directors ) .
People like Tilghman believe in what they are doing with a moral fervor .
They feel good about themselves , and they really are virtuous people — exactly the sort you would want in your tiny hunter - gatherer band during the Ice Age .
I think it ’s that Puritan moralism that seems to be so common among White people :
What is striking is the moral fervor of the Puritans .
Puritans tended to pursue utopian causes framed as moral issues .
They were susceptible to appeals to a “ higher law , ” and they tended to believe that the principal purpose of government is moral .
New England was the most fertile ground for “ the perfectibility of man creed , ” and the “ father of a dozen ‘ isms . ’ ”
There was a tendency to paint political alternatives as starkly contrasting moral imperatives , with one side portrayed as evil incarnate — inspired by the devil .
Whereas in the Puritan settlements of Massachusetts the moral fervor was directed at keeping fellow Puritans in line , in the nineteenth century it was directed at the entire country .
The moral fervor that had inspired Puritan preachers and magistrates to rigidly enforce laws on fornication , adultery , sleeping in church , or criticizing preachers was universalized and aimed at correcting the perceived ills of capitalism and slavery .
My view is that this is an ethnic trait of our people — adaptive in small ingroups during our evolutionary history and massively maladaptive now given the current anti-White moralism that pervades our culture .
We have to convince people like Tilghman that there is a morality in White advocacy as well .
The ultimate irony is that without altruistic
Whites willing to be morally outraged by violations of multicultural ideals , the multicultural utopia that they envision is likely to revert to a Darwinian struggle for survival among the remnants .
But the high - minded descendants of people like Tilghman wo n’t be around to witness it .
What is striking is the moral fervor of the Puritans .

If you have a lot of time on your hands and get excited by tests for unit roots , do have a look at contributions the thread on random walks at Tamino 's blog and the longer ( much longer ! ) subsequent thread at Bart Vergheggen's .
VS , for that is his nom - de - blog , reckons that the temperature records are a random walk ( or something like one ) which means that many standard statistical approaches to measuring trends , including all the ones currently used in climatology , are invalid .
The thread is interesting on another level too , with several days of calm debate at Bart 's site rudely interrupted by an invasion of trolls from Tamino's .
Statistics was n't supposed to be this much fun .
New York ( August 13 , 2020 ) —
In 1920 , the ratification of the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote , and in 1965 , with the passage of the Voting Rights Act , the voting rights of women were protected and enforced .
In 2020 , we mark this centennial celebration of the ratification of this Constitutional Amendment .
WASHINGTON – In a surprise move today , US President Barack Obama issued an official Executive Order that from henceforth it is now legal for individuals in the United States of America to marry fictional 2D characters .
“ We have seen progress my friends , and it has come from the east , ” Obama said , citing recent advances in Asia where the marriage of humans and fictional characters has already begun .
“ I have heard the plea from our people in the otaku community , and no longer will the United States of America discriminate against our two - dimensional citizens .
Animericans will now have the same rights and privileges to marry whomever they choose . ”
Animericans , short for Animated - Americans , are simply fictional cartoon characters .
While not technically alive by any means , American otaku citizens have been fighting tooth and nail for the right to marry their two dimensional love interests since they saw it was becoming all the rage across the Pacific .
“ Today , I believe the President has made great strides in bringing human Americans and Animericans closer together .
In more ways than one , ” said Animerican activist Ron Nerdageek , head of the Marriage Otaku Equality league .
He then held up a picture of his Animerican girlfriend Misato Katsuragi , drawn winking and flashing a victory sign to the camera .
“ I ’m so glad we can finally marry ! ” her word balloon declared .
This lovely couple are n’t the only ones excited about the new presidential mandate .
Already hundreds of otakus have been lining up outside courthouses , some dressed in tuxedos carrying drawings of cute anime girls in wedding dresses .
“ Real women never paid any attention to me , ” said an anonymous otaku as he waited in line with a cardboard cutout of his bride to be .
“ But Haruka has always been there for me .
This is a proud day for both of us . ”
This move has brought harsh criticism from certain members of Congress who are staunchly against the idea of marriage to cartoons .
“ This is absolutely ridiculous , ” decried 569th district representative and Anti-Animerican Party member Gus Mcdoodledonnel .
“ They are n’t real !
Grow up you losers ! ”
Nevertheless , as it stands right now , people are free to marry the fictional character of their choice .
So if you will please excuse me I have a date with Motoko Kusanagi and Wonder Woman I need to get ready for .
Obama 's 17 - minute , 2,500 - word response to woman 's claim of being ' over - taxed '
by Anne E. Kornblut
CHARLOTTE - Even by President Obama 's loquacious standards , an answer he gave here on health care Friday was a doozy .
Toward the end of a question - and - answer session with workers at an advanced battery technology manufacturer , a woman named Doris stood to ask the president whether it was a " wise decision to add more taxes to us with the health care " package .
" We are over - taxed as it is , " Doris said bluntly .
Obama started out feisty .
" Well , let 's talk about that , because this is an area where there 's been just a whole lot of misinformation , and I 'm going to have to work hard over the next several months to clean up a lot of the misapprehensions that people have , " the president said .
He then spent the next 17 minutes and 12 seconds lulling the crowd into a daze .
His discursive answer - more than 2,500 words long -- wandered from topic to topic , including commentary on the deficit , pay - as - you - go rules passed by Congress , Congressional Budget Office reports on Medicare waste , COBRA coverage , the Recovery Act and Federal Medical Assistance Percentages ( he referred to this last item by its inside - the - Beltway name , " F - Map " ) .
He talked about the notion of eliminating foreign aid ( not worth it , he said ) .
He invoked Warren Buffett , earmarks and the payroll tax that funds Medicare ( referring to it , in fluent Washington lingo , as " FICA " ) .
Always fond of lists , Obama ticked off his approach to health care -- twice .
" Number one is that we are the only -- we have been , up until last week , the only advanced country that allows 50 million of its citizens to not have any health insurance , " he said .
A few minutes later he got to the next point , which seemed awfully similar to the first .
" Number two , you do n't know who might end up being in that situation , " he said , then carried on explaining further still .
" Point number three is that the way insurance companies have been operating , even if you 've got health insurance you do n't always know what you got , because what has been increasingly the practice is that if you 're not lucky enough to work for a big company that is a big pool , that essentially is almost a self - insurer , then what 's happening is , is you 're going out on the marketplace , you may be buying insurance , you think you 're covered , but then when you get sick they decide to drop the insurance right when you need it , " Obama continued , winding on with the answer .
Halfway through , an audience member on the riser yawned .
But Obama was n't finished .
He had a " final point , " before starting again with another list -- of three points .
" What we said is , number one , we 'll have the basic principle that everybody gets coverage , " he said , before launching into the next two points , for a grand total of seven .
His wandering approach might not matter if Obama were n't being billed as the chief salesman of the health - care overhaul .
Public opinion on the bill remains divided , and Democratic officials are planning to send Obama into the country to persuade wary citizens that it will work for them in the long run .
It was not evident that he changed any minds at Friday 's event .
The audience sat politely , but people in the back of the room began to wander off .
Even Obama seemed to recognize that he had gone on too long .
He apologized -- in keeping with the spirit of the moment , not once , but twice .
" Boy , that was a long answer .
I 'm sorry , " he said , drawing nervous laughter that sounded somewhat like relief as he wrapped up .
But , he said : " I hope I answered your question . "
Total Number of Bars
Rank State Bars per 10,000 Population
1 North Dakota 6.54
2 Montana 6.34
3 Wisconsin 5.88
4 South Dakota 4.73
5 Iowa 3.73
6 Nebraska 3.68
7 Wyoming 3.4
Specialization in Bars
At FloatingSheep , we 're willing to search for and analyze almost anything that falls within the realm of human experience .
Sometimes this is mundane ( pizza ) and sometimes it is contentious ( abortion ) but most of the time it falls somewhere in between .
Such as , where can I get a drink ?
We were quite surprised , however , when we did a simple comparison between grocery stores and bars to discover a remarkable geographically phenomenon .
We had expected that grocery stores would outnumber bars and for most parts of North America that is the case .
But we could also clearly see the " beer belly of America " peeking out through the " t - shirt of data " .
Starting in Illinois , the beer belly expands up into Wisconsin and first spreads westward through Iowa / Minnesota and then engulfs Nebraska , and the Dakotas before petering out ( like a pair of love handles ) in Wyoming and Montana .
The clustering was so apparent that we wanted to check how it compared to the " official " data on this activity .
So we gathered 2007 Census Country Business Pattern on the number of establishments listed in NACIS code 722410 ( Drinking places ( alcoholic beverages ) ) and divided by Census estimates for state population totals for 2009 and found remarkable correspondence with our data .
On average there are 1.52 bars for every 10,000 people in the U.S. but the states that make up the beer belly of America are highly skewed from this average .
Another slice of the Google data which shows the relative number of bars in a location further confirms this concentration .
So looks like Wisconsin is your best bet .
With the unfortunate continuing expansion of economic interventionism , if not outright socialism , revisiting the writings of the outstanding Austrian School economist , Eugen von Böhm - Bawerk , is illuminating .
In 1914 , Böhm - Bawerk published an essay , “ Control or Economic Law ” , in which he analyzed whether political dictate could invalidate economic law .
Of course , as one of the foremost economists of his time , Böhm - Bawerk knew that attempts to annul economic law by political fiat are futile .
Below are comments from the beginning of Böhm - Bawerk ’s essay :
“ … the fact that , just as natural phenomena are governed by immutable eternal laws , quite independent of human will and human laws , so in the sphere of economics there exist certain laws against which the will of man , and even the powerful will of the state , remain impotent ; and that the flow of economic forces cannot , by artificial interference of societal control , be driven out of certain channels into which it is inevitably pressed by the force of economic laws .
Such a law , among others , was considered to be that of supply and demand , which again and again had been observed to triumph over the attempts of powerful governments to render bread cheap in lean years by means of ‘ unnatural ’ price regulations , or to confer upon bad money the purchasing power of good money . ”
Despite the warnings of Böhm - Bawerk ( and other economic scientists ) , politicians and bureaucrats , as well as their kept technical advisors and media propagandists and apologists , continue to ignore economic law .
Their overriding concern is with power and with forcibly establishing a society that conforms to their wishes , no matter how irrational ( and immoral ) .
As a result of the political class ’ deliberate disregard of the teachings of economics , the standard of living of most members of society continues to be negatively impacted .
In addition , interaction between individuals is increasingly governed by the point of a gun , by violence , by the law of the jungle , as opposed to voluntary and peaceful cooperation .
Economic interventionism and socialism are both characteristics and drivers of the ongoing decay of civilization .
Since 1789 , Congress has approved 33 constitutional amendments .
Twenty - seven of those amendments were eventually ratified and became part of the Constitution .
Six failed after being sent to the states .
Here 's the scoop on those six that did n't make the grade .
1. House Size
" Article the First " may sound a bit Yoda - esque , but it was actually the first provision in the original proposal for the Bill of Rights .
The amendment , which the first Congress approved in September 1789 , basically provided a way to regulate the expansion of the House of Representatives as the country grew .
Among other provisions , the amendment stated that after the House grew beyond 200 members , there would be no more than one Representative for every 50,000 citizens .
Eleven states ratified the amendment between 1789 and 1792 , but it never got the three - quarters majority of state support needed for ratification .
Although the amendment is still technically eligible for ratification , it seems unnecessary now .
Given the current U.S. population , if we went with the maximum ratio of one Representative for every 50,000 people , the House would balloon to over 5,000 Congressmen , which would make finding airtime for campaign commercials nearly impossible .
2. Gifts From Abroad
The Titles of Nobility amendment got the thumbs - up from the 11th Congress in 1810 but failed to gain the requisite traction with the states .
The amendment was pretty straightforward ; it stated that any U.S. citizen who accepted a title of nobility or honor from a foreign power would cease to be an American citizen and would no longer be eligible to hold an American office .
Accepting a gift from a foreign power without Congress ' permission would also cost the recipient his citizenship .
Congress overwhelmingly approved this amendment , which seemed aimed at divorcing the U.S. from the allure of the European aristocracy , and twelve states ratified the amendment .
However , five states were n't so keen on it , so the amendment never became part of the Constitution .
Because there was no clause in the amendment that set a deadline for ratification , it 's still technically fair game to add to the Constitution if three - quarters of the states ratify it .
3. " Persons Held to Labor or Service "
The Corwin Amendment made it through Congress in 1861 , so you can probably guess what hot - button issue it tackled .
The amendment , which was proposed by Ohio Representative Thomas Corwin , read , " No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere , within any State , with the domestic institutions thereof , including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State . " 
While the language never mentions slavery directly , it 's pretty clear who the " persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State "  are .
When Congress approved the amendment in March 1861 , it was basically the legislature 's last - gasp attempt at avoiding the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln even contacted states ' governors in an attempt to get their support for the amendment .
Obviously , it did n't work .
The Civil War broke out just a month after Congress approved the amendment , and in the end only three states ratified the measure .
Like the Title of Nobility amendment , though , it 's technically still fair game for ratification .
4. Child Labor
The Child Labor Amendment got Congressional approval in 1924 .
Proposed by Ohio Representative Israel Moore Foster , the amendment sought to curb some of the era 's horrifying child labor practices by giving Congress the exclusive power to " limit , regulate , and prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age . " 
As the time , there seemed to be a real need for better child labor regulation .
The workforce of 10 - to - 16 - year - olds had ballooned to over two million kids , and many of them were n't doing light work like mowing lawns and delivering newspapers .
Twenty - eight states ratified the amendment during the 1920s and 1930s , but it never got the necessary three - quarters vote .
You might have noticed , though , that your 12 - year - old did n't traipse off to a shift at the steel mill this morning .
Thank FDR .
In 1938 he signed the Fair Labor Standards Act , which nixed labor by children under 16 or hazardous work by those under 18 .
In 1941 the Supreme Court upheld these provisions , which effectively meant that the Child Labor Amendment was n't necessary anymore .
Like the others , it 's still technically pending ratification , though .
5. Equality Now
The Equal Rights Amendment is another pretty straightforward measure .
Its key section read , " Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex . " 
The idea for a similar amendment had been kicking around for decades , but it did n't gain real traction until the early 1970s , when NOW ramped up its picketing efforts and the national Women 's Strike for Equality in August 1970 drew greater attention to the need for women 's rights .
The debate around the amendment was particularly thorny .
Some critics worried that the amendment would make women eligible for the draft and to serve in combat duty , while many working class women 's groups were concerned that the amendment would nullify any of the protective labor laws that had been helping women in industrial fields .
Congress approved the amendment in 1972 , but unlike the previous failed amendments , this one had a time limit for its ratification .
The original deadline for ratification was in 1979 , and even after Congress pushed back the cutoff date to June 1982 , only 35 of the required 38 states ratified the amendment .
The amendment is n't totally dead , though ; it 's been frequently reintroduced since the original 1982 deadline , most recently New York Representative Carolyn B. Maloney .
6. D.C. Statehood
The District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment would have made all those D.C. " Taxation without Representation "  license plates a thing of the past .
In 1978 the 96th Congress approved an amendment that would have repealed the 23rd Amendment which gives D.C. its Electoral College votes and instead given the citizens of the District full congressional representation and the same ability to vote in national elections .
To an impartial observer , giving D.C. 's 600,000 citizens congressional representation may sound like a fair idea .
The states were n't so crazy about the notion , though .
Some argued that a single city should n't be given two seats in the Senate , while others claimed that giving D.C. representation was tantamount to presenting the Democratic Party with a gift of two free Senate seats .
Proponents counter that the District 's population is actually larger than Wyoming 's , and nobody 's trying to swipe the Cowboy State 's senators .
When the amendment expired in 1985 , only 16 states had ratified it , leaving it well short of the 38 ratifications it needed .
Congress frequently hears suggestions for new D.C. voting amendments , though , including ones that would give the District a seat in the House while withholding Senate representation .
* * * * * *
If you 're a huge fan of one of these amendments that floundered , do n't despair ; these things can take some time .
The 27th Amendment , which states that changes to congressional pay can't take effect until the next term starts , got congressional approval in 1789 along with the rest of the Bill of Rights .
It was over 202 years later when the states finally ratified it in 1992 .
I am currently hip - deep in Final Fantasy XIII , and I can say with confidence that it has more Roman numerals than any Final Fantasy game I 've ever played .
My first Final Fantasy game was VII , and I 've felt like it would take a really special game for me to take on that third " I . "
When I saw that XIII would finally feature something I 've been begging for – a guy wielding two guns with a baby chocobo in his hair – I decided it was time to take the plunge .
At the same time , I 've started playing the original Final Fantasy game on the Wii Virtual Console , because I do n't spend enough of my day sitting down as it is .
Now , you may be thinking to yourself " Are n't they basically the same game ?
After all , there have n't been any real advances in videogame technology in the past 23 years . "
As it turns out , there are a few differences , which I outline below .

And Pulse , well the thing is the fal ' Cie made Cocoon , actually there are Pulse fal ' Cie and Cocoon fal ' Cie , and they each make l'Cie , which are ... well , Pulse and Cocoon are at war , or they used to be at war , and there 's this one Pulse fal ' Cie in a Vestige .
OK , well , a Vestige is ... uh ... it 's all kind of confusing but at least the heroes of the story do n't know what 's happening either .
They spend most of the time so far asking what 's going on and what they should be doing and if they 're making the right choices , so I guess you could say it 's immersive .

The heroes must restore light to the four elemental orbs and save the world .

Will Manley is a retired librarian .
In 1992 , while working for the Wilson Library Bulletin , he sent a survey to subscribers about sex .
5,000 librarians responded , but the prudish Library Bulletin would n't publish the results .
They 've finally been released !
The Wilson Library Bulletin ( " a professional journal published for librarians from 1914 - 1995 " ) published the initial survey , but then fired Manley and refused to publish the results .
Thanks to the increasing democratization of publishing technology , Manley was able to publish the results on his blog last week .
This is a big day for anyone who has a sexy librarian fetish .
( And , honestly , who does n't ? )
Without further ado : According to " The 1992 Librarians and Sex Survey , " of 5,000 librarians surveyed :
40 % believed that " Playboy " should be in libraries
23 % thought " Playgirl " should
22 % believed that libraries should have condom dispensers in their bathrooms
20 % had " done it " in the library
91 % had read " The Joy of Sex "
34 % lost their virginity before age 18
4 % were still virgins
20 % believed that sex without love is bad sex
Only 1 % had sex more than 7 times per week
50 % had sex 1 - 2 times per week
30 % had 2 - 5 partners in their lifetime
4 % had more than 50
78 % of female librarians felt they had been sexually harassed by a patron
7 % of male librarians did
And our favorite :
When asked to pick the Shakespearean title that best described their first sexual encounter , 28 % chose Comedy of Errors ; 23 % chose Midsummer 's Night Dream ; 22 % chose Much Ado About Nothing ; 21 % chose All 's Well That Ends Well ; and 6 % chose Rape of Lucrece .
( Read the whole thing at Will Manley 's blog . )
Of course , this was in the innocent days of 1992 .
Today 's librarians probably spend all day showing off their genitals on Chatroulette behind the circulation desk .

TALLAHASSEE — Passions were ablaze at a Tax Day Tea Party event held on the steps of the old Florida Capitol , with protesters holding signs that read , “ We vote with bullets , ” “ Fire Congress , ” “ 9/11 was an Inside Job ” and “ Return to the Constitution . ”
The Tea Party movement proclaims it is n’t racist , but there were less than half a dozen black people in the crowd , a head count that supports the recent CNN / Opinion Research Poll finding that only two percent of the Tea Party activists were African - American .
ADVERTISEMENT
Organized by the local Fox News radio station , it drew a few hundred people who listened to a taped speech from Glenn Beck and to various Republican and right - wing Christian leaders talk about taking back the federal government , living according to the U.S. Constitution and returning the nation to the “ path of Godly virtues . ”
The We The People Rally , which draws its name from the first three words of the preamble to the U.S. Constitution , promised to be “ the focal point of Florida ’s message to lawmakers in Washington , D.C. and to elected leaders in every level of government in the Sunshine State . ”
The organizers of the 2009 rally had reported that event had drawn over 2,000 protesters so the Independent News drove three hours to Tallahassee on Tax Day , April 15 to check out if the Tea Party Movement had grown since last year as some in the media claimed .
We found a crowd of less than 500 protesters and a slate of speakers who knew the Tea Party “ buzz words ” and how to pander to its audience .
The speakers , including Beck ’s video , insisted the Tea Party movement was n’t Republican or Democratic or Conservative or Liberal .
However , the speakers themselves were conservative and Republican .
They made it clear that they did n’t like President Barack Obama or moderate Republicans like Florida Gov. Charlie Crist .
The rally had four distinct layers .
Along Monroe Street which runs in front of the historic Florida Capitol , the Mullet haircut crowd squatted - not listening to the speakers , but instead waving at cars turning on to Apalachicola Parkway and trying to coax truck drivers to honk their horns .
ADVERTISEMENT
Many waved yellow “ Do n’t Tread on Me ” flags .
On the right side of the plaza , under the shade of towering moss - covered oaks , were Republican candidates trying to get petition cards signed and handing out flyers .
The offices they sought ranged from U.S. Senate to Tallahassee mayor .
Tanned college coeds wearing tight t- shirts for their candidates and short shorts circulated through the crowd promoting their candidates .
Marco Rubio for U.S. Senate campaign signs and stickers were everywhere .
Rubio is running in the Republican primary against Gov. Charlie Crist and was pushed by some supporters at the rally as the second coming of Ronald Reagan .
ADVERTISEMENT
Near the Capitol steps sat the gray - haired warriors , inspired by Fox News to protest the Obama health care plan .
Several were in wheelchairs , using walkers and attached to oxygen tanks .
They clapped .
They cheered and gradually tired as the evening wore on .
Along the edges were the Florida lawmakers and their aides , also listening and perhaps trying to gauge how authentic the crowd was .
ADVERTISEMENT
The ringmaster for the event was Preston Scott , former sportscaster and host of the morning show of the Fox News radio affiliate , WFLA 100.7 FM .
Scott made a concerted effort to prove to the sea of pale white faces in the audience that the Tea Party and his rally were racially diverse .
He had his African - American intern , Jerome Hutson , and State Rep. Jennifer Carroll , R - Jacksonville , speak .
Two African - American music ministers from a Tallahassee church led the crowd in singing “ God Bless America . ”
Hutson , a Tallahassee Community College student who has been featured several times on Glenn Beck ’s Fox News show , was one speaker .
Dressed in 80 degree heat in a khaki blazer , maroon sweater vest and yellow “ power ” tie , the Clear Channel radio intern looked like Carlton Banks , Will Smith ’s uptight , unhip cousin in “ The Prince of Bel Air . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Hutson opened by shouting “ Welcome Patriots ” and professed allegiance to the U.S. Constitution , a document that he claimed President Obama called “ a charter of negative liberties . ”
“ We the people are meant to be free , no matter what race , sex or religion , ” said Hutson to applause and cheers .
“ And while we are on the subject of race , I want to say that the Tea Party Movement is not a racist movement .
The Tea Party Movement is not anti-black people .
The Tea Party Movement is not anti-minority .
The Tea Party Movement is not anti-government . ”
“ The spirit of the Tea Party Movement is Americanism , and it has made it the most free - est and most prosperous nation on earth — whether you be white , black , brown , man , woman or child , ” he continued .
This sentence drew huge applause from the whites in the crowd .
One black man just shook his head from side to side .
ADVERTISEMENT
Florida House Majority Leader Adam Hasner , R- Delray Beach , and Senate President Jeff Atwater , R - North Palm Beach , both spoke .
Their focus was on Washington , D.C. Hasner accused the Obama Administration of bankrupting the county “ both fiscally and morally . ”
He called the national debt “ generational theft . ”
Atwater talked proudly about how the Florida Legislature has a balanced budget , but did n’t mention its use of state trust funds or receipt of Obama ’s stimulus dollars .
He called for a national convention to draft a constitutional amendment that would force the federal government to have a balanced budget .
In his taped speech , Glenn Beck stressed a return to the Constitution and emphasized the 10th amendment , which states that powers not granted to the national government nor prohibited to the states by the Constitution are reserved to the states or the people .
The Washington Post had reported earlier in the day that 54 Republican members of the Virginia House of Delegates have signed a letter calling on the federal government to “ cease and desist ” from passing mandates that exceed its power under the 10th amendment .
Ã‚Â Nice coincidence .
“ Never in our history has there been such a wide gap between what is legal and what is right , ” Beck said .
“ We must demand more of ourselves .
We must elect people of character because character does matter . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ And that will begin that process of bridging that gap , returning our country to a path of Godly virtue , ” he added .
The crowd began to fizzle after Beck ’s presentation .
Many left .
Others seem to delight in ganging up on the few counter - protesters there .
The Independent News staff moved through the crowd interviewing people .
When a counter - protester was interviewed , people would stand in the background with signs identifying the interviewee as “ Infiltrator , ” “ Party Crasher ” and “ Not One of Us . ”
One middle - aged lady with dyed red hair was following a Florida State student who had a sign jokingly declaring he was a “ Socialist ” and saying , “ Where is the party ? ”
When attendees tried to take a photograph of the man ’s sign , the lady blocked the camera with her “ Do n’t Tread on Me ” flag .
Though the Independent News reporters with their video cameras went unchallenged as they moved through the audience , this reporter did n’t escape the attention of event organizers .
Dressed in blue jeans , blue Oxford button - down shirt and wearing my Ole Miss baseball cap , I quietly watched the rally from different vantage points , took notes and recorded the speeches , wearing my Independent News press badge .
ADVERTISEMENT
I was approached by man in a WFLA 100.7 FM t- shirt who wanted to know if I was with press and who I worked for .
When he heard the words , “ Pensacola , ” he backed off and said he worked with Preston Scott and they had noticed that I looked like I was from out of town .
“ Is that a problem ? ” I asked .
“ No , no , we just noticed you in the crowd , ” he replied as he moved quickly away .
He declined to answer my questions about who noticed me or how I looked different .
When we walked back to our car after the rally , a couple of rally attendees followed us to our parking spot to get our tag number .
I waved as we drove away .

And this incident happened before Gov. Jan Brewer signed the SB1070 into law on Friday .
Video and story from AzFamily.com .
PHOENIX – A Valley man says he was pulled over Wednesday morning and questioned when he arrived at a weigh station for his commercial vehicle along Val Vista and the 202 freeway .
Abdon , who did not want to use his last name , says he provided several key pieces of information but what he provided apparently was not what was needed .
He tells 3TV , “ I do n't think it 's correct , if I have to take my birth certificate with me all the time . ”
3TV caught up with Abdon after he was released from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in central Phoenix .
He and his wife , Jackie , are still upset about what happened to him .
Jackie tells 3TV , “ It 's still something awful to be targeted .
I can't even imagine what he felt , people watching like he was some type of criminal . ”
Abdon was told he did not have enough paperwork on him when he pulled into a weigh station to have his commercial truck checked .
He provided his commercial driver ’s license and a social security number but ended up handcuffed .
An agent called his wife and she had to leave work to drive home and grab other documents like his birth certificate .
Jackie explains , “ I have his social security card as well and mine .
He 's legit .
It 's the first time it 's ever happened . ”
Both were born in the United States and say they are now both infuriated that keeping important documents safely at home is no longer an option

Australia is not a racist country .
We are comforted by this mantra every time we turn on the radio or television or happen upon a column by say , Piers Ackerman .
Whenever Julia Gillard speaks on such subjects , we are reassured that Australians are an " open and generous people " who " repudiate racism wherever we see it " - and we have a good " sense of humour " as well .
Australia is not a racist nation , we are told , and we should believe it because , well , everyone says it .
The image of Australia as an egalitarian paradise where everyone is welcome to spend eternity cavorting on a sun-drenched beach is the image Australia presents to the world , and there 's a new $ 4 million advertising campaign to promote this ideal : " There 's nothing like Australia " .
Listening to politicians Kevin " the business of what works " Rudd , Tony " Muslim integration is a serious issue " Abbott , Julia " deeply offensive " Gillard or Barnaby " send the Oceanic Viking back to Colombo " Joyce , we could be excused for laboring under the misapprehension , like our politicians , that Australia is an Anglo Celtic country .
Because there are people who still regard Australia as an Anglo Celtic country , despite around 200 years of Chinese Australians , Afghan Australians , African Australians , and 60,000 years of Indigenous Australians .
Australia is not a racist nation , we are told .
It is some other , hard - to - define reason that explains why Australian institutions - the government , the police , immigration , the media - appear to not only devour the ' racial and cultural divides ' invective , but also promulgate it .
Last month we learned that at least 100 members of the Victoria Police are being investigated over the workplace circulation of a series of emails graphically depicting " an ethnic man being tortured " .
We cannot know the " ethnic " identity of this man , or what takes place , but the chief commissioner of Victoria Police , Simon Overland , guarantees the emails are " extremely serious " , " offensive " , and in his view " would cause significant concern and alarm in the community if the material was made public " .
Overland made clear that although the material was pornographic and racist , it was n't technically a crime because the emails did n't involve child pornography .
This is a shameful turn of events that comes 10 days after a report from the Springvale Monash Legal Service revealed " there was a culture of discrimination within the Victoria Police " resulting in racial profiling , targeting , harassment and abuse of youths of recognisably African ethnicities .
Claims against police included beating and kicking a young African who was handcuffed on the ground , threatening sexual violence , threatening to kill , excessive batoning , punching a person during an interview until he lost consciousness , using capsicum spray as punishment , desecrating a copy of the Koran during a raid by throwing it on the ground and calling it " shit " , and punching a person in the eye with a torch , causing permanent eye damage .
The report concludes that the " the pattern and scale of reports of abuses indicated dangerous , institutional and systemic failures " and that previous complaints had not resulted " in the discipline or punishment of any police " .
Revelations about the racist core of the Victoria Police come only two months after the murder of Nitin Garg and the denial that there was anything akin to racism , and racism as a motivating factor in crime , on Australian soil .
How did we move so quickly from utter refusal to acknowledge the existence of racism to the discovery that the Victoria Police is riddled with the kind of racism that has moved into action - the removal of identifying uniforms and badges when assaulting children ?
A reasonable question when faced with this incursion of racism onto Australian soil may be : who is accountable ?
The dismissal of one or two officers responsible for introducing the racist torture - porn email into the Victoria Police workforce will not resolve anything because of the systemic nature of racism within the police force , and within Australian institutions .
If and when these officers are rooted out , it wo n't change the factors that allowed the racist culture of the police to develop in the first place .
We need an explanation as to the processes that allowed so many racist police to be active for so long , and why no - one noticed earlier .
Without transparency on these issues , how do we know who has been held accountable and what has changed to prevent this racism from taking root again ?
We can't trust that it will be Victorian Police chief Simon Overland , who when he takes bullets onto a plane , an otherwise jailable offence , is excused while the airport screener is suspended .
But there 's more .
The Age newspaper has reported that three Tamil men facing imprisonment for supplying funds to the LTTE pleaded guilty to lesser charges and were released .
The officers involved were castigated by the Supreme Court judge for arresting Arumugan Rajeevan at gunpoint , without legal grounds , " unarresting " him , after realising their mistake , and subjecting him to hours of " outrageous " questioning without legal counsel .
As Brian Walters articulated on The Drum :
" The burden of the prosecution case was that the accused sent money to the LTTE … The prosecution said it did not matter if that money was for the purpose of charity - the Act makes no exception for such circumstances .
Not surprisingly , when the charges were laid , major international aid organisations immediately feared that they too would be subject to criminal charges .
After all , they had done exactly the same thing as the accused men .
Privately , the authorities reassured these organisations that they would not be charged . "
In other words , the prosecution is selectively applying these laws to people they feel they can intimidate without resulting in public scrutiny , which is also called racial profiling .
So , despite the evidence from our police forces , politicians and selectively applied laws , we can rest assured that Australia is not a racist nation , as we have been told .

Drawing boards have been used by engineers and architects for more than two centuries .
But the saying “ back to the old drawing board ” is more recent and can actually be traced to a specific source and date .
It was coined by the American artist Peter Arno in a cartoon first published in the March 1 , 1941 issue of New Yorker magazine .
Arno created hundreds of classic cover and interior cartoons for the New Yorker from 1925 until his death in 1968 .
Many were compiled in a series of popular books .
The caption of one of those cartoons , first published in 1932 , popularized the saying “ This is a hell of a way to run a railroad ! ”
Arno ’s phrase - making 1941 cartoon shows a crashed military plane , with the pilot coming down by parachute in the background .
Uniformed military personnel are running toward the plane .
But a nerdy - looking guy in a suit , carrying a roll of papers under his arm , is walking away , saying ( in the caption ) : “ Well , back to the old drawing board . ”
The nerd is presumably one of the engineers who designed the plane .
He seems almost cheerful that he has more design work to do .
The rolled up papers he ’s carrying are the engineering drawings for the plane , soon to be put back on his drawing board for modifications .
During World War II , Arno ’s caption was picked up and transformed into an idiomatic expression .
The phrase “ back to the old drawing board ” ( or just “ back to the drawing board ” ) became a humorous way of saying that something did n’t work or is n’t working as planned , so a different option or plan is needed .
The expression is still in common use today , though few people know that it comes from a Peter Arno cartoon published on today ’s date in 1941 .

Have you ever seen a building in motion that actually changes its shape ?
Sounds unbelievable but not to Dr. David Fisher .
This building will never appear exactly the same twice .
It is amazing but you will have the choice of waking up to sunrise in your bedroom and enjoying sunsets over the ocean at dinner .
In addition to being such an incredible engineering miracle it will produce energy for itself and even for other buildings because it will have wind turbines fitted between each rotating floor ( picture 2 ) .
So an 80 - story building will have up to 79 wind turbines , making it a true green power plant .

Last week Mike Pence , the third - ranking Republican in the House , was asked what compromise he would agree to on health care .
His answer , word for word , was
Well , look , you know , I was , uh , yeah , yeah , look , uh .
Today Tim Pawlenty has an article in Politico , which is a bit more articulate than that — but as Bruce Bartlett says ,
he rants about the deficit without proposing any spending cuts and insisting on still more tax cuts .
Well , look , you know , he was , uh , yeah .
The moral here is that right now the GOP literally has no ideas about how the nation should actually be governed .
And the scary thing is that lack of ideas seems to be a winning platform .
Global timber giant Weyerhaeuser Co. said today it has joined the U.S. Climate Action Partnership group that is lobbying for comprehensive climate and energy legislation on Capitol Hill .
The Federal Way , Wash .- based company becomes the 29th member of the business - NGO lobbying coalition , alongside General Electric Co. , General Motors Co. and the Natural Resources Defense Council .
" The forest products industry will play a leading role in reducing dependence on fossil fuels and reducing emissions of carbon dioxide using biomass from forests , a sustainable resource and one of the best at sequestering carbon , " Weyerhaeuser CEO Dan Fulton said in a press release .
" The role of forest fiber in a low carbon economy will depend on the public policy concepts under debate in Washington , D.C. "
" USCAP , " Fulton added , " has successfully integrated the expertise of numerous stakeholders , and we believe our membership will help positively position sustainable forestry , biomass and forest products in these important policy discussions . "
Membership in U.S. CAP has more than doubled since its inception just prior to then - President George W. Bush 's State of the Union speech in January 2008 .
The group played a critical role in pushing the House toward passage of climate legislation last June .
But the group has also seen some of its power dwindle after recent defections .
Two big oil companies , BP America and ConocoPhillips , and Caterpillar Inc. , withdrew last month from the $ 100,000 - a- year membership club .
And Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) recently questioned GM and Chrysler LLC 's participation after they received $ 17 billion in federal bailout funds .
Barton also helped drive insurance giant AIG Inc. out of the group after it got $ 85 billion from the Treasury .
U.S. CAP officials insist they are still playing a big role in the climate debate on Capitol Hill that has been largely in standby mode in the Senate .
The coalition 's CEOs are expected to participate today in a conference call with Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass. ) , a lead author of the Senate proposal to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
In its press release today , U.S. CAP said Weyerhaeuser 's arrival " demonstrates that there is ongoing support from the business community for enacting sound climate and energy policy that is economically sustainable and environmentally effective . "
Weyerhaeuser owns or manages 21 million acres of timberland and has offices or operations in 10 countries .
Yet the company has struggled in the aftermath of the U.S. housing market 's collapse , as well as larger global economic trends from the financial crash -- with its revenue dropping 32 percent last year to $ 5.53 billion , from $ 8.1 billion in 2008 .

China Promotes Its Transcontinental Ambitions with Massive Rail Plan
» China intends to extend its high - speed rail system towards south Asia and Europe with the goal of two - day journey times between London and Beijing .
If China were n’t already halfway through the construction of the world ’s largest high - speed rail network , it would be difficult to take this proposal seriously .
But the most populated country on earth has shown no deficit of skill recently in undertaking massive public works projects , and its ambitions — and willingness to finance them — show no sign of slowing .
So the news that China is planning a series of transcontinental high - speed rail lines designed to connect London to Beijing in just two days that broke yesterday in the South China Morning Post should be taken at face value .
The proposal , which is mapped out above according to preliminary information about proposed alignments , would likely be the largest infrastructure project — ever .
Taking the growing Chinese rail network as the starting point , new 200 mph lines would extend south towards Singapore , north and west into Siberia , and west through India , Kazakhstan , and Turkey , with the eventual goal of linking into the growing European fast train system .
Exact routes are not yet determined , but the general goal of the plan is to increase the region ’s mobility through fast rail networks and to join together the mostly disconnected Asian and European systems .
Government officials in China plan to use this project to expand the country ’s base of natural resources .
Negotiations are already underway with 17 countries , premised on the idea that China would spend its own money building the rail links in exchange for resources it currently lacks .
According to Wang Mengshu , a consultant working on the project , “ We would actually prefer the other countries to pay in natural resources rather than make their own capital investment . ”
China has already agreed to finance a rail link into Myanmar in exchange for the rights to that country ’s lithium reserves .
Russia and China have announced plans to build a new trans -Siberian link .
Iran , Pakistan , and India are each negotiating with China to build domestic rail lines that would link into the overall transcontinental system .
It ’s a sort of neo-imperialism desired by the countries to be colonized .
Will they regret the selling off of their natural resources in exchange for better transportation offerings ?
Is this reasonable foreign investment on the part of China , or is it an attempt to take control of the economies of poor countries ?
The strategy ca n’t be more clear : China wants to establish itself as the center of Asian trade , the hub of the world ’s largest market .
By developing the economies of Cental Asian and Eastern European countries that have missed out on the enormous growth currently being experienced by China , the region will experience increasing trade and development , a result that will in turn aid in expanding the Chinese economy .
It would allow China to solidify its position as the dominant player in the Asian economy , with the goal of eliminating any hopes of increasing American or European influence there .
Though China ’s economy continues to grow at an unbelievable pace , its slow - growth demographics resulting from the one - child policy mean that it must focus its efforts abroad if it wants to continue expansion into the future .
Despite China ’s history of following through with its big rail plans , building a 17 - country network is quite different than upgrading just its own lines .
Some major problems , like track gauge differences and differing visa requirements , stand in the way of ever completing the project .
If they get their way , however , Chinese officials want to complete the project in ten years .
It ’s an outrageous — and exciting — objective .

March 1 , 2010 -- I do n’t shed any tears about former Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra ’s billions being seized by order of the Thai Supreme Court on February 26 .
I advocate that the billions of ill - gotten gains in the hands of the entire
Thai rich : the politicians in this government , the generals , the businessmen and businesswomen , and of course the entire royal family and all their hangers - on , should be seized in the future .
The rich do not have the right to accumulate wealth on the backs of the majority of hard - working Thais .
No public figures , including the king and the generals , or politicians , should hold shares or have special interests in business .
This always leads to corruption .
Just think about the corrupt benefits which the politicians around former US President George Bush enjoyed as a result of the illegal war in Iraq .
So if Thaksin gained from the policies of his government ( and that has to be proved in a real court , not a Thai kangaroo court ) , then he is no different from George Bush or the other business - oriented politicians in the West .
Conservative politicians who shackle trade union rights and force the public to face spending cuts and job losses because of what their mates in the banks did , are also acting in their own interests .
If guilty , should they be punished ?
Yes ! , certainly .
All of them .
But is it OK to stage a military coup against them so that another faction of the corrupt rich take power ?
There is one difference between the corruption of politicians and that of kings and generals .
In a democracy we can throw the politicians out at election time and this is an even better standard of public scrutiny than leaving it to biased judges .
The kings and generals are not subject to such public scrutiny , however .
So , let 's get rid of all private business interests in society and tax the rich until they are no longer richer than the general public .
And let 's have all public positions subject to election and instant recall .
King Pumipon has just left hospital for his palace .
In my view it was timed to try to turn the public interest and media away from the Thaksin case and promote the king instead .
The bombs outside Bangkok Bank were also the work of those wishing to libel the [red shirts [ democracy movement ] .
Pumipon has deteriorations in his brain function , like most elderly people , and his hospital stay was genuine .
His pneumonia and fevers were likely to be a result of infections from not being able to swallow food properly .
His lungs got infected .
He can not sit up straight or walk properly even now .
His speech is even more slurred and incoherent than before .
As such he has become a more useful tool of the army and the conservatives .
He was “ urged ” to be seen to talk to the Supreme Court judges , so that the conservatives could pretend that the king “ ordered ” their verdict .
He was “ asked ” to leave hospital on a day when it would suit the conservatives .
He was photographed in September 2006 with the junta generals .
But who was telling whom what to do ?
There are of course a number of questions about Pumipon ’s hospital stay .
Who paid for it ?
He is the richest man in Thailand .
Did he pay out of his own pocket ?
Why did he stay so long ?
Remember that the conservative royalists kept saying that poor villagers went to the doctor “ more than was necessary ” after Thakin 's Thai Rak Thai party 's 30 - baht health care scheme was introduced ?
Was Pumipon in hospital at the expense of the nation for longer than was necessary ?
He left hospital with his dog leading the way .
Is it against health regulations to allow a dog into a public hospital ?
Or is the dog “ semi- divine ” too ?
I say .... Seize it all !!
The palaces , the shares , the diamonds , all the ill - gotten gains !

Conservation groups are calling on the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) to abandon a proposal that would overturn a global moratorium on commercial whaling .
A group of IWC nations is meeting in Washington to negotiate a way forward for the deadlocked regulatory whaling body , ahead of the annual whaling conference in June .
IWC members including Australia , New Zealand and the US are considering a deal that could overturn a 24 - year ban on commercial whaling in return for Japan cutting its quota of whales killed in the name of science .
But Mick McIntyre from the group Whales
Alive says the negotiations have gone too far and countries such as Australia must stop the deal from going ahead .
" This compromise proposal certainly has momentum , and that 's incredibly worrying , " he said .
" Now that they 're getting to the point of talking about how many whales to kill , we ask the question , how did it get this far ?
" We need to stand tough , work very hard to convince our other allies that we need to stop this compromise in its tracks . "
Mr McIntyre says the deal undermines whale protection .
" This is n't about working to create a deal that allows whaling .
This is about working to stop whaling , " he said .
" Any compromise that is talked about at this meeting is just unacceptable . "
The proposal needs a three - quarters majority vote to go ahead .
A number of IWC nations are yet to declare their position .
Earlier in the week we reported the consternation of historians over the sale of an Anglo - Saxon stone .
Now the item has been withdrawn from auction
It was the Guardian wot won it .
Perhaps .
In Monday 's G2 I reported that , to the consternation of archaeologists and historians , an Anglo - Saxon stone carving was to be sold yesterday by Bonhams in London .
The carving is part of a cross from Peakirk , Northamptonshire , a monument to St Pega , England 's first female hermit , which fell into the hands of a couple called the Evereds when they acquired a former chapel and its outbuildings eight years ago .
It was n't regarded as part of the listed building ; neither was it covered by the Treasure Act .
So the fear was that it could disappear from public view or even go abroad .
But on Tuesday evening Bonhams withdrew the item .
Mike Heyworth , director of the Council for British Archaeology , had written in protest to the saleroom .
( " I 'm sure the Guardian article helped , " he says . )
The Church of England , in the person of Janet Gough , director of its cathedral and church buildings division , had also complained to Bonhams on Tuesday , writing that " we consider the legal status of this piece to be unclear . "
At the moment it is n't exactly clear what 's happened to it , either , although archaeologists are hopeful that the cross will eventually find its way to Peterborough Museum .
A Bonhams spokesman suggested that a private treaty deal may have occurred , in which the seller comes to a direct arrangement with a buyer ; very likely someone who would donate it to the museum .
The seller , Nick Evered , would not comment yesterday , although he hardly sounded like a man who had just won the lottery .
In the emerging global economy , e-commerce and e-business have increasingly become a necessary component of business strategy and a strong catalyst for economic development .
Porter , the strategy guru , used concepts developed in Industrial Organization ( IO ) economics to derive five forces which determine the competitive intensity and therefore attractiveness of a market .
This model describes the attributes of an attractive industry and thus suggests that opportunities will be greater , and threats less , in these kinds of industries .
Attractiveness in this context refers to the overall industry profitability .
An “ unattractive ” industry is one where the combination of forces acts to drive down overall profitability .
A very unattractive industry would be one approaching “ pure competition ” .
Porter ’s industrial organization competitive analysis framework ( five - forces model ) is challenged in resource - based critiques .
Resource based views were argued to be more suitable than the 5 forces model as a tool for analysis in the wake of web enablement of businesses .
Research has established that the rate of unique visitors , the e-business - specific measure , showed significant correlations with market value , net income growth , and employee growth .
This implies that cyberspace - specific indicators , such as page views , stickiness , click - through rate , and conversion rate , may not be unreliable as performance measures .
In the study , these were added as indicators of industry specific profitability indicators besides those in the Porter ’s framework .
Porter ’s model is also challenged in view of the static nature of the industry which it analyzes .
Web enablement increases the dynamic nature of industry structure .
In the light of technology enablement of business to e-business , the five forces , as depicted by Porter are significantly affected .
The bargaining power of both suppliers and customers increase as the information accessibility is increased and the information gap is narrowed .
This leads to lower bargaining power for the firm , and may transcend into lower profits .
Again as e-business enablement increases customer reach , the bargaining power of the customers are negatively impacted by this change .
Also , e-business models will enable easier entry into the industry , as now , companies may only look to perform very few activities in - house , and outsource the rest to other firms in the value chain .
This decreases the management complexity among new entrants , and thus the threat of new entrants may go up .
While systematic risks may be addressed by taking objective steps and tactics , the rest is somewhat difficult to address , especially those which arise from socio political linkages or from regulatory fluctuations .

So , another Easter long weekend has finished .
Going by what the media and people online portray , Easter means one of several things :
The most significant event in the Christian calendar
A chance to meet up with family
An excuse to sell novelty chocolate
Four days to do home improvement projects in
“ Zombie Jesus Day ”
Australia is apparently a Christian country .
It ( as a nation and not a collection of tribes ) was founded by Christians , its laws and system of justice are based upon Christian ethics , the collective morality was initially highly Christian , and the society in general was Christian .
As part of this last point , we have a four day long weekend for Easter ( with Good Friday and Easter Monday both being public holidays ) , and another public holiday for Christmas ( with Boxing Day being thrown in as part of the English heritage of the nation ) .
The purpose of these holidays ?
To let the good Australian Christians go off to commemorate and think .
Yet now , that first point is hardly ever mentioned : I ’ve just flew back to Canberra a few hours ago from spending Easter with my family back in Brisbane and picked up the Sunday paper , to find the only mention to do with the Christian relation to Easter is to tie in the latest round of sexual abuse scandals to this most sacred time of the year .
Being a Christian is now out of vogue ; maybe there is something to the Pope ’s allegations of anti-Catholic sentiments being promoted .
But I digress .
I can accept the second rationale for Easter being at least partially true , especially for those who are not “ religiously ” ( if you ’ll excuse the pun ) Christian or indeed are of a different faith but who take advantage of the long weekend .
However , I find the latter three “ reasons ” rather offensive .
Crass commercialism is bad enough , but for Ferrero Rocher to suggest that ancient Greek gods celebrated Easter ?!?!?
Where is the sense in that ?
And why is it that the only reason people have to not go to work is so that they can go and spend time working at home ?
What is wrong with just relaxing and enjoying yourself rather than feeling guilty because you know that you have a wobbly front step but you ’re not taking advantage of a sale at the local hardware store to fix it ?
Finally , let ’s consider the “ Zombie Jesus ” supposed joke that ’s going around .
Why is it that only Christians lean over so backwards that they can’t even consider offending anyone else ’s beliefs but are more than willing to let theirs be ridiculed ?
I ’m not proposing a crusade against whoever first coined that phrase , but the willing acceptance and joking usage of it is detrimental to our own selves .
In fact , if anyone ever tries to promote Christianity then they ’re usually declared some kind of fundamentalist .
( Disclaimer : I believe in everyone being able to make the decision themselves with no - one advocating for or actively degrading any particular belief system . )
But OK , you disagree with all my arguments .
You think religion is overrated , you think people should be able to do whatever they want to do , etc.
Fine .
But in that case , spread it around .
There are plenty of other beliefs to impune whilst you ’re at it : Islam , Judaism , Hinduism , Buddhism , etc .
So why do n’t hardware stores promote Ramadam as the perfect time to paint the house , or have ancient Greek gods partying for Passover , or have Zombie Vishnu day ?
Fair ’s fair : you pick on one , you pick on all of them .
Go on , I dare you .
Did n’t think you ’d do it .
And is n’t that the saddest thing of all : that we ’re all such cowards that we know that Christians wo n’t actively fight back so they get picked on , whereas we do n’t dare say anything mean about Muslims , Jews , etc .
Edit :
Thank you for reading and commenting on this article .
However , if you ’re going to keep missing the point by trying to point out the problems with Christianity , etc. then I ’m just going to delete your comment .
I frankly care what you believe in ; the point of this blog post was to vent about companies and people either ridiculing or down - playing Christianity when they would n’t have the balls to do so about other religions ( and yes , I ’ve talked to people about this who admitted that they would never dare talk about “ Zombie Mohammed ” or the like for fear of personal attack ) .
Edit 2 : Due to the number of personal attacks I ’m getting ( and people still not getting what I consider to be the point ) I ’m disabling any future comments .
Do n’t like it ?
That ’s your opinion , but I ’m not talking about persecution here ; I ’m talking about mockery and devaluing of belief systems and whether people do it to all beliefs or just to one .
Feel free to disagree with me ; that is your prerogative , but quite frankly I do n’t care .
I write here because I want to , not to cater for anyone in particular .

Initial Jobless Claims - Claims Edge Down From Higher Levels ; Lowering Payroll Forecast to +200 k from + 275k
Actual : 439,000
Previous : 445,000
Consensus : 440,000
Released : Thursday , April 01 , 2010 at 08:30 ( New York time )
Claims Edge Down From Higher Levels ; Lowering Payroll Forecast to +200 k from + 275k
BOTTOM LINE : Initial and continuing claims both decline modestly from upward - revised bases .
The total number of claimants receiving benefits - including those on extended programs - rises about 240,000 in week ended Mar 13 .
Consistent with the analysis presented in last night 's daily comment , we are lowering our estimate for March nonfarm payrolls to +200 k from +275k .
KEY NUMBERS :
Initial claims - 6 k to 439 k in week ended Mar 27 vs. median forecast 440k .
Continuing claims - 6 k to 4.662 million in week ended Mar 20 vs. median forecast 4.618 million .
MAIN POINTS :
1. Initial claims for the week ending Mar 27 were in line with expectations , falling 6,000 from a base that was revised up slightly .
Continuing claims for regular programs followed a similar pattern , falling 6 k - also from an upward revised base - in the week ended Mar 20 .
2 . However , as noted in last night 's daily comment , the key outstanding issue for tomorrow 's report on payrolls in March is the total number of people receiving benefits during the survey week ( week ending Mar 13 ) .
That figure rose 238,000 to a level roughly equal to the figure reported for the Feb 13 week .
Based on these results , we are lowering our estimate for March nonfarm payrolls to +200 k from +275 k .
The underlying assumptions are +25 k in underlying net hiring ( vs. +50 k previously ) , +100 k for a weather rebound ( unchanged ) , and +75 k for temporary Census hires ( vs. +125 k previously ) .
How Much Fabric to Get
The original poster is not answering questions .
Though many were asked long ago , I am answering because it is a popular instructable and I have over 40 years of sewing experience .
It all depends on how wide the fabric is and how big you are .
If you want to use woven cotton fabric , and have a bust under 40 " , just buy the length of fabric that you want to dress to be in length , plus some extra for the straps .
If you are plus and your bust is larger than the 45 " width cotton fabric comes in , then you would need to buy twice the length you want the dress .
BUT you do n't want to use both full widths across of 45 " or it will be way too big and bulky .
Unless you have an 80 " or so bust .
Let 's say you are a big beautiful woman and your bust is 55 " and you want the dress to be 45 " long .
( I am 5 ' 4 " and that is ankle length for me ) A nice cotton fabric that 's 44 " or 45 " wide will not fit around your bust ( nor mine ) , so you must have TWO lengths of fabric , one for the front , one for the back of 45 " wide fabric .
to make a dress that will fit around your girls .
Oh , I hear you thinking .
Why can't I run the fabric sideways ?
It 's best to not try and fudge and run the long length of the fabric around you sideways .
Garments should be made up and down the long length of the fabric , the way it comes off the bolt unless the Zombie Apocalypse happens .
The manner in which fabric is woven makes it hang all wrong when it is hung sideways on a body .
It wo n't look good or right .
So 45 " length for the front , 45 " length for the back , plus 4 " for the four hems - a 1/2 " one at the top and at the bottom ( a double fold of 1/ 2 " at the top and bottom of each of the two pieces means an inch gets used up at top and bottom of the front and of the back ) .
( 4 x 1 " = 4 " ) .
Did that make sense ?
A half inch seam means that your fold over 1 / 2 " of the raw fabric edge neatly , iron and fold 1 / 2 " over again , iron flat , then sew it down .
That 's happening in four places .
You wo n't be using the full width of each 45 " piece across your body so we 'll have plenty left over for whatever kind of straps you want to make .
Fabric is sold by the yard , but can also cut in one long length with an additional increment of a partial yard if needed .
We needed 94 " of fabric .
Fabric is almost never cut exactly straight across at some stores , so adding a little might not be a bad idea .
94 " is 14 " less than 3 yards , so I would just go ahead and buy 3 yards .
So any plus person with a bust over 40 " or so wanting a 45 " long dress needs 3 yards .
Any person with a bust under 40 " needs to buy whatever length of fabric they want the dress to be , plus maybe 4 inches more to have plenty for straps of whatever style you want .
You CAN fudge most straps and cut them sideways on the fabric instead of lengthways if you are trying to be as economical as possible
Arizona Legislature Advances Tough Immigration Bill
Created : April 14 , 2010 13:06 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The Arizona House of Representatives passed a bill yesterday that puts the state within reach of having some of the toughest immigration laws in the country .
FOX News provides an explainer on select provisions of Arizona Senate bill 1070 :
It would :
– Create a new state misdemeanor crime of willful failure to complete or carry an alien registration document .
– Allow officers to arrest immigrants unable to show documents proving they ’re legally in the country .
– Ban so - called soft immigration policies at local police agencies and allow people to sue if they feel a government agency has adopted a policy that hinders the enforcement of illegal immigration laws .
– Prohibit people from blocking traffic when they seek or offer day - labor services on street corners .
– Make it illegal for people to transport illegal immigrants if the drivers of vehicles know their passengers are in the country illegally and if the transportation furthers their illegal presence in the country .
The provision is designed to target law enforcement policies that prevent officers from asking people about their immigration status , but opponents worry it will make victims and witnesses scared to work with police and prosecutors .
The bill , introduced by state Sen.
Russell Pearce , would give an unprecedented amount of immigration enforcement power to local police officers — something that has divided groups in Arizona .
From the Los Angeles Times :
… police were deeply divided on the matter , with police unions backing it but the state police chief ’s association opposing the bill , contending it could erode trust with immigrants who could be potential witnesses .
Immigrant rights groups were horrified , and contended that Arizona would be transformed into a police state .
“ It ’s beyond the pale , ” said Chris Newman , legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network .
“ It appears to mandate racial profiling . ”
During the debate , the bill managed to win support from some state senators who expressed misgivings about the legislation .
One of the bill ’s provisions is to prevent “ sanctuary cities ” from not enforcing immigration laws , and Republican state Rep.
Russ Jones said he could n’t think of one sanctuary city in the state .
“ I do n’t see this as a problem , and I wonder what we ’re fixing , ” he said .
Nonetheless , he voted for it .
A similar supportive vote came from Republican Rep. Lucy Mason , who said the bill does n’t focus on where it needs to : the border .
This bill could represent a reaction by Republicans to border violence , in the wake of the recent death of an Arizona rancher who is believed to have been killed by an illegal immigrant or a drug smuggler .
His death has gotten attention from both the media and lawmakers looking ahead to the November elections with promises of stronger border security .
And given recent comments from Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer ( R - Ariz . ) about the rancher ’s death , this bill looks likely to become law .
The text of the House version is nearly identical to a Senate bill approved in February , but changes were made to create a prosecution exemption for people who drive illegal immigrants to church or who provide emergency services , according to a Phoenix Business Journal article .
Mars Odyssey and Phoenix Status Report
PASADENA , Calif . - NASA 's Mars Odyssey orbiter heard no signal from the Phoenix Mars Lander when it listened from orbit while passing over Phoenix 60 times last week .
Odyssey had also listened for a signal from Phoenix during periods in January and February .
During the third campaign , April 5 through April 9 , the sun stayed above the horizon continuously at the arctic site where Phoenix completed its mission in 2008 .
The solar - powered lander examined ice , soil and atmosphere at the site for two months longer than its planned three - month mission before succumbing to seasonal decline in sunlight .
It was not designed to withstand winter conditions .
However , in case it did , NASA has used Odyssey to listen for the signals that Phoenix would have transmitted if abundant spring sunshine revived the lander .
" In the unlikely event that Phoenix had survived the harsh Martian arctic winter and been able to achieve a power - positive state with the return of continuous sunshine , there is a very high likelihood that one or more of these 60 overflights would have overlapped with a transmission attempt by the lander , " said Chad Edwards , chief telecommunications engineer for the Mars Exploration Program at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" This was the last of our three planned Phoenix search campaigns .
The Mars program will evaluate the results in hand to assess whether further action is warranted , " Edwards said .
Pressure continued to mount Tuesday against Arizona ’s tough new immigration law , with the Obama administration considering a legal challenge and political leaders calling for economic boycotts .
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that she had “ deep concerns ” with the law and said it could siphon resources needed to target criminals .
U.S. Atty . Gen. Eric Holder said he was considering “ the possibility of a court challenge . ”
“ I think that that law is an unfortunate one , ” Holder said .
“ It is , I fear , subject to potential abuse .
And I ’m very concerned about the wedge that it could draw between communities that law enforcement is supposed to serve and those of us in law enforcement . ”
The law makes it a state crime to be in Arizona illegally and requires police to check suspects for immigration paperwork .
The legislation also bars people from soliciting work or hiring day laborers off the street .
Gov. Jan Brewer cast the law in terms of public safety , saying , “ We can not sacrifice our safety to the murderous greed of drug cartels . ”
Brewer said she would order the state police training agency to formulate guidelines for law enforcement officers .
But critics said the law will result in racial profiling and discrimination .
Calls for boycotts spread throughout California this week after the bill was signed by Brewer on Friday .
The law is scheduled to take effect 90 days after the legislative session ends this week .
On Tuesday , seven members of the Los Angeles City Council signed a proposal for a boycott , calling for the city to “ refrain from conducting business ” or participating in conventions in Arizona .
Councilman Ed Reyes , who coauthored the proposal with Councilwoman Janice Hahn , said he wants city officials to spend the next 90 days assessing the financial relationships that exist between various city departments and businesses based in Arizona .
“ If Arizona companies are taking our money , I want to sever that , ” he said .
Hahn acknowledged that a boycott would be logistically complicated but said the city should not remain silent .
“ When people are asked to show their papers , it brings back memories of Nazi Germany , ” she said .
A spokesman for City Controller Wendy Greuel identified at least 12 city contracts with Arizona companies that are worth an estimated $ 7.2 million .
San Francisco supervisors introduced a similar resolution Tuesday , and Mayor Gavin Newsom imposed an immediate moratorium on city - related travel to Arizona , with limited exceptions .
Newsom also announced the convening of a group to analyze how a boycott would affect city contracts and purchasing .
City Atty .
Dennis Herrera said he hoped the city ’s resolution would “ be an impetus to others taking an aggressive stand in terms of scrutinizing the services they have with Arizona companies . ”
The leader of the California Senate , Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) , called the law a “ disgrace ” and said the state also should consider a boycott .
He sent a letter to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger asking for an inventory of Arizona businesses and government agencies with which California does business .
“ The Arizona law is as unconscionable as it is unconstitutional , and the state of California should not be using taxpayer dollars to support such a policy , ” Steinberg wrote .
Already , several organizations have canceled planned conventions in Arizona .
The American Immigration Lawyers Assn. announced that it is moving its fall convention , originally scheduled for Scottsdale in September .
“ We just felt that given this new law signed by the governor that it would not be right for our association to meet and convene there and take on the issues of immigration in a state that passed such a misguided bill , ” said George Tzamaras , spokesman for the group .
Arizona was already reeling from a decline in tourism because of the recession , and the fallout from the law has taken hotel owners by surprise , said Debbie Johnson , president of the Arizona Hotel and Lodging Assn .
“ Obviously our members are concerned , ” Johnson said .
“ I thought there would be political issues .
It has become so tourism - focused and that , to me , is the unfortunate side . ”
Johnson said 200,000 people , many of them Latinos and legal immigrants , depend on a paycheck from the tourism industry .
“ They do n’t want to lose their jobs , ” she said .
Barry Broome , president of the Greater Phoenix Economic Development Council , compared the boycott resolutions to the aftermath of Proposition 187 , the anti-illegal immigrant measure passed by California voters in 1994 .
“ You did n’t see people in Arizona trying to leverage political gain from California ’s issues , ” he said .
Brewer said at a meeting in Tucson on Monday that she was n’t worried about possible boycotts .
“ I believe it ’s not going to have the kind of economic impact that some people think that it might , ” she said .
But Rep. Raul Grijalva ( D - Ariz . ) , who himself called for companies not to plan conventions in the state , said in an interview Tuesday that he expected the state to see declines in business and leisure travel , the trucking industry and retail shoppers from Mexico .
“ There are political , legal and economic consequences that are going to hit the state , ” said Grijalva , who has received death threats since speaking out against the law .
“ The disgust goes across state lines . ”
The concern about the law crossed international borders , with a travel warning posted by the Mexican government Tuesday .
The post , on the Mexican Foreign Relations Ministry website , urged Mexican citizens to be careful in Arizona and to expect harassment and questioning .

This composite image of the galaxy cluster Abell 3376 shows Chandra and ROSAT X - ray data ( gold ) , an optical image from the Digitized Sky Survey ( red , green and blue ) , and a radio image from the VLA ( blue ) .
Two different teams used Chandra observations of galaxy clusters -- including Abell 3376 -- to study the properties of gravity on cosmic scales and test Einstein 's theory of General Relativity .
Such studies are crucial for understanding the evolution of the universe , both in the past and the future , and for probing the nature of dark energy , one of the biggest mysteries in science .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Two new and independent studies have put Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity to the test like never before .
These results , made using NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory , show Einstein 's theory is still the best game in town .
Each team of scientists took advantage of extensive Chandra observations of galaxy clusters , the largest objects in the Universe bound together by gravity .
One result undercuts a rival gravity model to General Relativity , while the other shows that Einstein 's theory works over a vast range of times and distances across the cosmos .
The first finding significantly weakens a competitor to General Relativity known as " f ( R ) gravity " .
" If General Relativity were the heavyweight boxing champion , this other theory was hoping to be the upstart contender , " said Fabian Schmidt of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , who led the study .
" Our work shows that the chances of its upsetting the champ are very slim . "
In recent years , physicists have turned their attention to competing theories to General Relativity as a possible explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe .
Currently , the most popular explanation for the acceleration is the so - called cosmological constant , which can be understood as energy that exists in empty space .
This energy is referred to as dark energy to emphasize that it cannot be directly detected .
In the f ( R ) theory , the cosmic acceleration comes not from an exotic form of energy but from a modification of the gravitational force .
The modified force also affects the rate at which small enhancements of matter can grow over the eons to become massive clusters of galaxies , opening up the possibility of a sensitive test of the theory .
Schmidt and colleagues used mass estimates of 49 galaxy clusters in the local universe from Chandra observations , compared them with theoretical model predictions and studies of supernovas , the cosmic microwave background , and the large - scale distribution of galaxies .
They found no evidence that gravity is different from General Relativity on scales larger than 130 million light years .
This limit corresponds to a hundred - fold improvement on the bounds of the modified gravitational force 's range that can be set without using the cluster data .
" This is the strongest ever constraint set on an alternative to General Relativity on such large distance scales , " said Schmidt .
" Our results show that we can probe gravity stringently on cosmological scales by using observations of galaxy clusters . "
The reason for this dramatic improvement in constraints can be traced to the greatly enhanced gravitational forces acting in clusters as opposed to the universal background expansion of the universe .
The cluster - growth technique also promises to be a good probe of other modified gravity scenarios , such as models motivated by higher - dimensional theories and string theory .
A second , independent study also bolsters General Relativity by directly testing it across cosmological distances and times .
Up until now , General Relativity had been verified only using experiments from laboratory to Solar System scales , leaving the door open to the possibility that General Relativity breaks down on much larger scales .
The simulation shows how the universe has evolved from soon after the Big Bang to the present day .
As the universe expanded and cooled , matter began to clump together due to the effects of gravity , and large structures such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies formed , over billions of years .
This growth has been suppressed by dark energy over the last 5 billion years , as the expansion of the universe accelerates .
Chandra observations of the growth of galaxy clusters over time , and of the weight distribution of galaxy clusters in the nearby universe , have been used to test Einstein 's theory of General Relativity and test an alternative theory of gravity on cosmic scales .
To probe this question , a group at Stanford University compared Chandra observations of how rapidly galaxy clusters have grown over time to the predictions of General Relativity .
The result is nearly complete agreement between observation and theory .
" Einstein 's theory succeeds again , this time in calculating how many massive clusters have formed under gravity 's pull over the last five billion years , " said David Rapetti of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology ( KIPAC ) at Stanford University and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory , who led the new study .
" Excitingly and reassuringly , our results are the most robust consistency test of General Relativity yet carried out on cosmological scales . "
Rapetti and his colleagues based their results on a sample of 238 clusters detected across the whole sky by the now - defunct ROSAT X - ray telescope .
These data were enhanced by detailed mass measurements for 71 distant clusters using Chandra , and 23 relatively nearby clusters using ROSAT , and combined with studies of supernovas , the cosmic microwave background , the distribution of galaxies and distance estimates to galaxy clusters .
Galaxy clusters are important objects in the quest to understand the Universe as a whole .
Because the observations of the masses of galaxy clusters are directly sensitive to the properties of gravity , they provide crucial information .
Other techniques such as observations of supernovas or the distribution of galaxies measure cosmic distances , which depend only on the expansion rate of the universe .
In contrast , the cluster technique used by Rapetti and his colleagues measure in addition the growth rate of the cosmic structure , as driven by gravity .
" Cosmic acceleration represents a great challenge to our modern understanding of physics , " said Rapetti's co-author Adam Mantz of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland .
" Measurements of acceleration have highlighted how little we know about gravity at cosmic scales , but we 're now starting to push back our ignorance . "
f( R ) Gravity
One possible way to explain the observed acceleration in the expansion of the universe is to change Einstein 's theory of General Relativity .
The simplest modification is to introduce a cosmological constant , which can be explained by energy that exists in the vacuum .
In f( R ) gravity and other modified gravity models , scientists go beyond this simple modification .
In the f ( R ) gravity model , spacetime reacts differently to the matter in the universe than it does in General Relativity .
In General Relativity , gravity is a manifestation of the curvature of space and time , where the source of this curvature are all of the forms of mass and energy in the universe .
In the absence of any mass or energy spacetime can become completely flat .
What f( R ) gravity does is allow spacetime to act as a source of its own curvature , so there can still be some curvature even if spacetime is completely empty and the energy is zero .
So , as the universe expands and empties out , some curvature remains , resulting in cosmic acceleration .
By making this modification to gravity an additional ( " 5th " ) force is introduced .
By comparing observations of the masses of galaxy clusters with the predictions of f( R ) gravity , the range of this 5th force can be estimated .
On distance scales smaller than this range , gravity is stronger than predicted by Einstein 's equations .
The smaller that this range is , the less effect that this modification to gravity has on the growth of galaxy clusters .
If the cosmological constant is the explanation for cosmic acceleration then the acceleration will continue forever and all galaxies outside the Local Group should eventually disappear from view , resulting in a lonely universe .
If f( R ) gravity applies then the 5th force will die away in the far future , cosmic expansion will slowly decelerate and a lonely universe will be avoided .
It will be many billions of years before either one of these future scenarios can play out .

Google said the attacks targeted online critics of the mining
Vietnam has rejected accusations made by Google and McAfee that malicious software had been used to spy on tens of thousands of Vietnamese web users .
The companies said the software had been used to target anti-government blogs and websites .
McAfee said the perpetrators of the attacks " may have some allegiance " to the country 's government .
But Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga said the accusations were " groundless " .
" We have on many occasions clearly expounded our view on issues relating to access to , and use of , information and information technology , including the internet , " she told reporters .
" Vietnam law puts in place specific regulations against computer virus and malware , as well as on information security and confidentiality . "
Neel Mehta of Google 's security team said last month that the spy software had " infected the computers of potentially tens of thousands of users " around the world .
He said the malware installed itself when users downloaded a popular piece of software needed to type Vietnamese characters .
The infected computers were then used to spy on the users or to block other sites " containing messages of political dissent " , he said .
Mr Mehta said the attacks were targeted at opponents of bauxite mining in Vietnam , which has attracted criticism over potential environmental damage .
George Kurtz , chief technology officer and executive vice president of McAfee , said the action appeared to be " a politically motivated attack " , because of the individuals and organisations affected .
" We believe that the perpetrators may have political motivations and may have some allegiance to the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam , " he said .
The alleged cyber attacks come amid an ongoing row between China and Google about the censoring of online content .
Google said it would stop censoring its search results after it complained of a " sophisticated cyber attack originating from China " targeting the email accounts of human rights campaigners .
The Foreign Office responded by sending Francis Campbell , the British ambassador to the Vatican , to an urgent meeting with senior officials of the Holy See , and said the “ foolish document ” had not been cleared or shown to ministers or senior officials before it was circulated .
While on the Ron Smith show today , one caller asked , “ So , where would you cut spending ? ” �
Given my recent piece , The Virtue of a Big Bang , I was ready .�
My view is that in a crisis , pain should be shared as evenly and broadly as possible .�
Thus when someone claims that the schools or hospitals must be exempt , you come back with “ No one is exempt . �
There are lower priority projects and functions everywhere inside government . ”
An aside : I live in Howard County , Maryland , which has the best school district in the state .�
We homeschool anyway .�
Unlike most places in the US where homeschoolers tend to be evangelical Christians , here most homeschoolers are purely secular . �
We hear tales of those who have left the public schools decrying the sloppiness and waste in the system . �
Also , we experience that the system demands more of homeschoolers than it asks of those that go to the public schools .
Earlier in my life , I have been on school boards — as a homeschooler , of course not now , that would be impossible .�
No one would elect someone who homeschools to the school board .�
But from my earlier work , and what I know from a basic understanding of the economics of public school systems , when counting in the fair value of pension accruals , teachers are very well paid .�
We can freeze their pay , and freeze their benefits .
And , that is true for all government programs .�
Cut an even amount everywhere ; freeze them in nominal dollars at least .�
Yes , that ’s painful .�
Pain needs to be shared as we cut back after years of growth beyond our ability to sustain it without additional debt .
Governors and mayors , ignore the screams .�
People need to learn to make do with less .�
If you lead , they will follow . �
People love politicians that flout pandering , and stand for something , particularly during times of crisis .
The Same Idea on the Federal Level
Okay , much as I am not in favor of Obama ’s plan for national health care , let me propose something like it .�
It is time to tame Medicare .�
The concept of a safety net means basic care , not extraordinary care . �
News bulletin : every one of us will die , regardless of how much medical care we receive .�
Too much money is spent in the last six months of life , for too little good . �
If people want to spend their own money for extraordinary care to extend life , that is their own business , but it should not be the way the government spends , if it spends at all on health care .
Away from health care , let ’s consider “ Defense . ” �
To any who think me a slave of living near DC , pleazzze get it , even though if implemented , most of my friends would be hurt by what I am about to say , I will say it anyway .
There are bases overseas where soldiers face no real possibility of combat . �
There is no real reason for the bases , aside from the US acting like an empire over the rest of the world .�
We need to close bases in the US , and even more overseas . �
They do n’t benefit US interests .�
We do not need to be the global policeman .
Also , many weapons programs fail .�
They do n’t produce anything useful , and yet a huge bureaucracy gorges on the cash from the US Government .
We need to focus on defense .�
Defense , not dominating the rest of the world .�
We do n’t need a large military .�
We do n’t need to be in Iraq , and maybe not Afghanistan , and we do n’t need legacy bases all over the world .�
Cut “ defense ” spending , it is useless to the US .
If we did n’t try to dominate the Mid-East , we would not face many terror threats .�
We get what we deserve .�
Would we like it if outsiders tried to influence our leaders , and our selection of leaders ?
Everything Must Be Cut
Fairness is paramount .�
Americans have a strong sense of fairness .�
If everything is being cut , then the sense of shared pain will reduce support for riots and demonstrations where people plead for their special interests .�
Let the students that want lower tuition at the state University pay more .�
Much more , but in rough proportion to the cuts in the rest of society .
If we cut Medicare by reducing our willingness to pay in the last six months of life , even so , let us make other cuts , such as reducing or eliminating Medicare Part D. �
There is no good reason to have a Medicare drug benefit . �
Please end this signature program created by George W. Bush .
I will say it again , cut everything .�
Get your head around the idea that preserving the nation , state , or municipality is worth a lot more than preserving the stupid programs that venal ideologues are ranting must be kept . �
There is nothing that must be kept , aside from police , fire , justice , and public health . �
Even they should have wage cuts — the pain must be shared everywhere .

Editor 's Note : BenHasna takes a great look at the effect for Islanders players with and without Frans Nielsen on the ice to help them .
We are not the only ones -- non-Isles fans have noticed Frans ' Selke - like qualities , too .
For those of you who have some interest in these " advanced " stats to measure what 's going on , this is a nice way to dip your toe in .
A quick explanation is after the first table .
The links explain the rest , but ask questions or make corrections in comments .
Advanced stats have drawn my interest quite a bit over the last few months .
Reading about the Oilers , Canadiens , Avalanche is great , too , but I obviously would prefer to read about the Islanders .
As there is n't much out there , I 'll give it a try here myself .
Advanced stats do n't explain everything , but there 's so much going on during play and you can't catch everything just from watching the games .
So , in my opinion , as long as you do n't try to predict the future solely based on these numbers and always use them in context , they indeed help a lot to understand what 's going on on the ice .
I do n't know too much about statistics , but I can understand most of the things and I 'll try to reproduce a few here .
Tyler Dellow inspired me with two interesting pieces about Horcoff and Ovechkin .
And thanks to the great sites and new tools of Vic Ferrari , I should be able to do the same for the Islanders .
Basically , it 's about how certain players do with or without certain other players on the ice in terms of Corsi , which is one of the most telling numbers .
Whoever is dominating Corsi is almost sure to dominate scoring chances , too , and obviously has the best odds to outscore the opposition .
I have already run the numbers for most of the Islanders and now will try to spot and post a few interesting things over the next few days or weeks .
To begin with , I tried to keep it simple and looked at Frans Nielsen - someone who does well with anyone in any situation , as we all know from reading this blog .
And I can tell you , it 's very true indeed .
I 'll look at maybe the other centers next and later at some other forwards , the defensemen , certain combos or other stunning numbers .
Some look pretty interesting at first glance , some might not tell very much and some might be tough to interpret .
But I hope you will join in there or also correct me , which easily could be necessary , as I have never done anything like this .
So , let 's look at the numbers of Frans Nielsen .
You can find a reading example below .
The table includes all players who had at least 100 Corsi events in total ( Even strength , excluding empty - net situations ) while being on the ice together with Frans Nielsen .
with Nielsen without Nielsen Corsi % Total Corsi % Total Corsi % WOWY Witt 183 0.514 842 0.422 21.83 % Bailey 361 0.537 1357 0.463 16.12 % MacDonald 383 0.527 989 0.457 15.40 % Streit 712 0.538 2215 0.467 15.23 % Gervais 532 0.536 1816 0.465 15.13 % Hunter 676 0.558 782 0.491 13.57 % Sim 302 0.490 1258 0.434 12.91 % Moulson 448 0.542 1641 0.492 10.16 % Hillen 553 0.501 1629 0.456 9.82 % Sutton 471 0.480 1365 0.450 6.67 % Meyer 358 0.528 1397 0.503 5.06 % Okposo 696 0.507 1393 0.500 1.51 % Reese 108 0.491 383 0.491 - 0.02 % Bergenheim 536 0.481 968 0.500 - 3.73 %
Reading example : Brendan
Witt was on the ice together with Frans Nielsen for 183 Corsi events in total .
0.514 of these 183 ( 94 ) were in the Isles ' favour ( 89 were against them ) .
Witt had 842 other Corsi events in total while not being on the ice together with Nielsen , whereof 0.422 ( 355 ) were in the Isles ' favour ( 487 against ) .
Witt 's ratio therefore is 21.83 % higher with Nielsen than it is without Nielsen .
Or simply put , he benefited a lot from playing on a line with Nielsen .
Nielsen 's numbers are very impressive indeed .
Just like Witt , everyone on the Isles ' roster except for Bergenheim ( and Reese ) benefited from Nielsen 's presence .
And not only that - most of the guys were in fact able to outshoot the opposition together with Nielsen , whereas almost everyone got outshot without him .
Corsi definitely needs context , though .
Mainly two things need to be considered .
First of all , it 's crucial who you 're on the ice against .
It 's obviously much easier to outshoot the opposition , when playing against 3rd and 4th lines only , whereas it can be almost impossible against the league 's top lines .
Another important factor is where your shift starts , as it's much more difficult to outshoot the opposition when being on the ice for more defensive zone faceoffs than offensive zone faceoffs .
Taking into account these things will only make Nielsen 's numbers look even much more impressive , though .
It wo n't be that easy to tell for everyone , but as long as we remember from watching the games who played together with whom in what kind of situations , we always should be able to get a good idea .
Anyway , Nielsen 's role is pretty obvious .
Being the best defensive forward of the team , Nielsen 's line is often used in tough situations against tough competition .
So , whenever a winger or a defender is on the ice together with Nielsen , it 's one of his more difficult shifts and we would except his Corsi to fall off .
As mentioned , the contrary is the case for almost everyone , by mostly big margins , and that 's again just incredible .
Why exactly Bergenheim is the exception here , I do n't know .
I might find out when taking a closer look at Bergie 's numbers ...
More praise for Frans
Now , let 's also take a quick look at the numbers from Nielsen 's perspective .
Nielsen with Nielsen without Corsi % Total Corsi % Total Corsi % WOWY Hunter 676 0.558 1071 0.490 13.77 % Streit 712 0.538 1035 0.501 7.27 % Moulson 448 0.542 1299 0.507 6.92 % Gervais 532 0.536 1215 0.508 5.49 % Bailey 361 0.537 1386 0.511 5.20 % Meyer 358 0.528 1389 0.513 2.85 % MacDonald 383 0.527 1364 0.513 2.77 % Witt 183 0.514 1564 0.517 - 0.57 % Okposo 696 0.507 1051 0.522 - 2.91 % Hillen 553 0.501 1194 0.523 - 4.31 % Reese 108 0.491 1639 0.518 - 5.26 % Sim 302 0.490 1445 0.522 - 6.08 % Sutton 471 0.480 1276 0.530 - 9.43 % Bergenheim 536 0.481 1211 0.532 - 9.49 %
The reading is pretty similar .
The first column is the same again - 0.558 of the 676 Corsi events with Nielsen and Hunter together were in the Isles ' favour .
The 2nd column has to be read from Nielsen 's point of view this time around .
Therefore , 0.490 of the 1071 Corsi events when Nielsen was on the ice without Hunter were in the Isles ' favour .
Nielsen 's Corsi ratio is 13.77 % higher with Hunter than without him .
First of all , very impressive again that Nielsen is able to outshoot the opposition no matter who he 's on with .
Then , Hunter actually is the only player who benefited as much from playing with Nielsen as Nielsen himself benefited from playing with Hunter .
Some others ( Streit to MacDonald ) still affected Nielsen 's Corsi positively , but not by as much as Nielsen affected theirs .
And then there 's lots of players who hurt Nielsen 's numbers , whereas Nielsen affected theirs positively .
Again , no clue really why Bergenheim is down there .
They somehow do n't seem to work very well together .
Sutton is more obvious , as he was their primary shutdown defenseman and Nielsen surely had easier shifts with the other defenders .
And Sim , well ...
He has a Corsi of 0.434 without Nielsen , who himself has a Corsi of 0.522 without Sim , despite probably playing tougher minutes without Sim .
So , Sim is just terrible and be sure , that 's something you 'll read a few more times ...
Centers up next
We can probably tell already now that Nielsen will turn out to be the Isles ' most valueable forward here .
But I 'll take a closer look at the ( other ) centers next anyway .
Meanwhile , do n't hesitate to point out things I could improve or maybe also tell me which players you'd be eager to see the numbers for .

John Twomey faced four trials over the robbery
The conviction of four men for a £ 1.75 m armed robbery at Heathrow marks the end of a historic case .
After allegations of jury tampering at a previous trial , the case was the first criminal trial for more than 350 years to be heard in a Crown Court in England and Wales without a jury .
For those accustomed to the drama of a conventional court case , recent proceedings in the Old Bailey made for an unusual spectacle .
Gone was the jury of 12 tasked with weighing up the arguments of defence and prosecution .
Instead , the court often resembled a legal version of the X Factor , with a high - powered judge - Mr Justice Treacy rather than Simon Cowell in this case - considering impassively the presentations before him .
Evidence often had the air of a quiet conversation between old friends , with none of the normal rhetoric directed at juries .
Some barristers did their best to emphasise the sense of occasion .
" We 're breaking history , " said Sam Stein QC as the trial started in the vaulted surroundings of court 35 of the Royal Courts of Justice .
TIMELINE OF CASE 2004 : Armed raid on warehouse in Heathrow .
£ 1.75 m taken from vault 2005 : Seven on trial for conspiracy to steal .
Two acquitted ; no verdict reached on four defendants ; John Twomey did not give evidence due to health reasons 2007 : Trial of Twomey , Peter Blake and Barry Hibberd collapses after jury fails to reach verdicts 2009 : Trial of Twomey , Blake , Hibberd and Glenn Cameron collapses after five months amid allegations of jury tampering 2010 : Same four defendants face first jury - less criminal trial held in England and Wales since 1641
But a group of supporters of the defendants outside court were less impressed , waving placards saying " No jury = no justice " .
It was a series of unfortunate events that led to this unprecedented trial - the fourth relating to a robbery in February 2004 in which a group of gun-wielding masked men raided Menzies World Cargo warehouse , seizing £ 1.75 m in foreign currency kept in a vault .
Three previous trials collapsed , with the one in 2007 ending after a juror complained of being " stressed " and refused to return to court after a bank holiday .
Then after six months of evidence in 2008 , allegations of jury tampering led to the third jury trial being abandoned .
The prosecution , fearing the same might happen in the next trial , successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal to allow an unprecedented trial without a jury in England and Wales .
The Appeal Court agreed there was a " real and present " danger of jury tampering , and considered that even a £ 6 m package of protective measures by the police would not prevent it .
Despite defence objections that they had not been provided with any evidence of jury interference , the first jury - less trial went ahead .
Trial number four started in January 2010 at the Royal Courts of Justice with Mr Justice Treacy in charge .
The defendants were John Twomey , 61 , Peter Blake , 57 , Glenn Cameron , 50 , and Barry Hibberd , 33 .
They were all on bail despite being accused of a violent armed robbery , and mixed freely with their lawyers , friends and supporters .
Protesters appeared with " no justice " banners outside court in January
It was hard to imagine them as the men in masks who had terrorised staff at the Heathrow warehouse in 2004 .
But the jury - less trial was not without its own problems .
Halfway through the trial , Blake went on the run just before he was due to start giving evidence .
When , after a nationwide police appeal in which he was described as " dangerous " , Blake handed himself back in the following week , explaining : " I needed some clothes . "
As a result of his temporary disappearance the trial was moved from the Royal Courts of Justice to the more secure setting of court 12 at the Old Bailey .
Here the atmosphere was curiously stifled as the defendants gave their evidence one by one .
Twomey and Blake both started their evidence with a firm denial they had ever been involved in any jury tampering .
No ' brass knobs '
Each time the judge stopped them in their tracks - telling Twomey he wanted to hear his evidence not his opinions .
When it came to barristers ' closing speeches , the judge suggested to barristers he did not want any ornate language - " brass knobs " as he described it .
Rumpole - like phrases that lawyers normally deploy in court such as " it might be thought " and " does n't it seem to you ? " were notably absent .
And at the end of the trial Mr Justice Treacy did not give the usual summing up as there was no jury present to remind of the facts .
" The time has come for me to consider my verdicts and deliver a reasoned judgement , " he simply said - and left court for an undisclosed period .
With no days lost due to jury sickness the whole trial had taken place in less than half the time of the previous trials - just three months rather than six .
But the costs of this series of trials is said to have risen to more than £ 20 m .
Empty seats
Some senior barristers are concerned the trial of Twomey and others has created an unwelcome precedent that could open the door to further similar trials .
Paul Mendelle QC , chairman of the Criminal Bar Association , told the BBC : " A body of law might build up to make it more and more possible for a trial without a jury to take place . "
The Crown Prosecution Service has confirmed that at least one other Crown court judge - only trial , currently subject to reporting restrictions , is in the pipeline .
CPS lawyer Neil Sweet said the Heathrow robbery trial was no different - apart from its scale - to what happened in magistrate courts around the country every week .
But the 12 empty seats were a reminder of what is lost when a jury is absent - some would say the colour , the drama and the soul of a trial goes missing .
Critics would say the justice too .

The startup Formspring .me was just four months old when it closed a $ 2.5 million angel round of funding last month from 10 name - brand investors , among them angel funds , individual entrepreneurs — even a venture capital firm .
Formspring ’s premise is a kind of blogging in reverse ; users set up a profile and invite anyone to ask them questions .
And it ’s seen rapid adoption , to the tune of 50 million uniques a month and more than 300 million questions answered to date .
But premise and adoption numbers aside , such a long list of investors putting money into a jumbo - seed round so early on is not uncommon these days .
Do n’t blame it on too few investments driving up demand , however ; on the contrary , there are many young companies taking lots of money from lots of investors .
We find ourselves reporting on another early - stage funding round for an Internet or mobile startup every day .
Whereas a year ago …nada .
There is n’t much in the way of comprehensive statistics on angel investing , but the numbers that are available back this trend .
U.S. angel investment deal flow was up 33 percent year - over - year in the first quarter of 2010 , according to CB Insights .
And angel investors themselves cite a return to frothiness .
I interviewed a passel of them about when it started , why — and what it means for the future of today ’s crop of companies .
‘ Trigger - happy , But Not Irrational ’
“ I have n’t seen this level of startup activity ( and angel investing ) in SV since ’ 98 , ” PayPal and Slide founder Max Levchin tweeted back in March , an observation he reiterated during a recent discussion .
“ I ’ve probably made more investments in the last month than in the previous year , ” he told me .
“ I ’m suddenly trigger - happy .
And I am not irrational . ”
Early - stage investors agree that things started picking up in the fourth quarter of 2009 , and were going full steam ahead by the first quarter of 2010 .
Levchin ’s PayPal and Slide compatriot Keith Rabois reports having invested in five companies this January , compared to none in the fourth quarter of ’09 .
The first Google employee to go angel , Ayden Senkut , told me he ’s made double the amount of investments this quarter as he did during the previous three - month period .
And there are no signs of a slowdown .
All of which has had an impact on valuations .
From a price perspective , “ There are no longer deals to be had , ” said Jeremy Liew , managing director at Lightspeed Venture Partners and an investor in companies such as Flixster and RockYou .
Indeed , multiple angels said that entrepreneurs now open angel rounds at $ 750,000 , whereas 18 months ago it was unusual to see anything above $ 500,000 .
Investor Posse(s )
The larger rounds are often provided by a larger number of investors .
And there do seem to be more total investors in the angel market .
Jessica Livingston of Y Combinator , the pioneering three - month intensive startup program , said that investor attendance at its latest Demo Day in March was up 50 percent from the previous session , held in August 2009 .
The startups presenting at Demo Day were swarmed — but in fact there was so much advance interest that a quarter of them already had money in the bank before the day even kicked off , according to Livingston .
Whether it be former Googlers , former PayPal peeps , or just folks with some money who ’d like to be tapped into what ’s hot , there are a lot of people these days willing to cut checks for tens of thousands of dollars .
“ When I first started doing this I was the only ex-Google angel , and today there are anywhere between 20 and 40 , and that ’s just Google , ” said Senkut , whose Felicis Ventures has about 50 active investments .
There ’s even one angel team , Mixin Capital , that was started by the Y Combinator alums who sold Zenter to Google and invests almost exclusively in Y Combinator startups .
So many investors on the hunt lead to what Rabois called a “ dogs and cats round , with everyone piling on . ”
Formspring ’s round of 10 named investors is just one example .
Though Rabois , who serves as EVP of strategy for Slide , said he was “ dubious ” as to whether that was a good thing .
“ When there ’s lots of people involved , nobody ’s accountable , ” he noted , never mind how many patrons an entrepreneur then has to please .
There ’s also increasing collaboration between angels , through organizations like AngelList and the Angel Forum as well as Y Combinator and the many startup camp copycats it ’s inspired .
( Increased knowledge sharing might also be partly to blame for the mini-swarms of me - too companies we see these days .
There ’s a reason they call it groupthink . )
And new incubators and seed funds are popping up all over the place .
For instance , the video embedded above is from a tour I took of Kicklabs , a soon - to - open space in San Francisco ’s SOMA neighborhood set up by Transmedia Capital in partnership with the building owner .
They ’re planning to give startups free rent and access to advisers and resources ( and a pretty sweet in - office slide ) in exchange for the equivalent of a $ 25,000 share of each company .
Shortest .
Recession .
Ever .
So why now ?
Why are there so many companies deemed worthy of receiving money and so many investors willing to give it to them ?
The simplest reason is that the overall economy , after cratering in the fall of ’ 08 , is showing signs of recovery .
Even if the market is n’t righted again , investors ’ public company stocks are moving in the right direction .
Call it the shortest recession ever , as I discuss in the video embedded below with SoftTech VC‘s Jeff Clavier , who himself has made 75 consumer Internet investments in the last six years , 48 of them in the last two and a half .
He had four exits in 2009 : Mint to Intuit , Mixer Labs to Twitter , Ohloh to SourceForge and DanceJam to Grind Networks .
Clavier came by our office studio to talk about the state of angel investing .
“ There was a handful of us six years ago and now there ’s a legion , ” he said .
One of the factors that prompted Clavier to start investing was how much cheaper it had become to start companies , given web infrastructure and monetization tools .
And that ’s only more true today .
Another factor is that starting a company has a cool factor — especially these days .
“ You see people from Wharton coming out to Silicon Valley now ” is how Rabois put it , whereas a few years ago , “ a lot of those people would have been at investment banks . ”
The Race to Get in Early
To be fair , the economy is not out of trouble yet , and neither are later - stage Internet companies .
VC funding numbers are still depressed , with first - quarter stats for Internet - specific U.S. investments showing a 14 percent quarter - on - quarter decrease in dollars and a 19 percent decrease in the number of deals , according to PricewaterhouseCoopers and the NVCA .
Still , there are some notable larger and highly sought - after venture funding rounds — like the yet - to - be- closed but widely reported bidding war for Foursquare , and competitive deals closed by former Facebook employees ’ companies Asana and Quora .
Asana and Quora are both pre-launch — aka , the kind of companies that would normally be getting angel funding .
“ Because of the excitement around microcap and seed investing , venture capital firms are being more active in the space as well , ” said Senkut .
“ The valuations are going up too fast .
They feel like they may need to have a better grasp on the seed stage . ”
And after a long IPO drought , there appear to be some viable exits approaching IPO - style valuations available to startup shareholders .
Google , after not buying a single company for nearly a year , has acquired nearly 15 since last August .
And there ’s an active secondary market for employee and early investor shares , led by Russia ’s Digital Sky Technologies , which has made deals to buy common stock in Facebook , Zynga and Groupon .
Those companies are part of a small pack that see active secondary market trading , both privately and facilitated by sites like SecondMarket and SharesPost .
Nature or Nurture ?
Are today ’s web and mobile startups any different or better than those of the past ?
Investors contend that they are , for a few reasons .
First of all , there ’s a working theory that companies borne out of the hardship of a bust cycle are better grounded , if only because they ’re not swept up in the hype of a boom .
Secondly , many of today ’s early startups actually have revenue before they seek funding , whether from commerce , subscriptions or coupons .
Or , like Formspring , they have incredibly viral and mainstream adoption that seems to promise long - term value .
And thirdly , as Max Levchin put it , “ Every decade or so you see enough of a buildup in technology capabilities to enable things that change the world in fundamental enough ways that incumbents ca n’t take advantage of and startups can . ”
That ’s why he invested in the social payments startup WePay , which he hopes will take on PayPal .
The behaviors the company is trying to address are fundamentally different than those of 10 years ago because broadband Internet has become a much more significant part of our life since then .
But there are downsides to so much money being spread around .
More funding buys an entrepreneur a bigger runway , but also increased oversight and higher expectations .
The result will be that many similar companies will have trouble co-existing , and the most crowded segments will see consolidation .
There ’s no way all these companies will succeed .
Lastly , increased excitement around early - stage companies is also responsible for an imbalance in the tech job market .
“ I do not have a single company that is not hiring , and I do not have a single company that is not finding it difficult , ” said Senkut .
“ Anyone worth being hired as an employee is starting their own company . ”
For some , this kind of frenzied , frothy atmosphere will be all - too - reminiscent of the dot - com bubble 10 years ago .
At this accelerated pace , it ’s possible that the shortest recession ever could be followed by the shortest boom .

Yep , here we go again .
Party before country , temper tantrums before the country 's business :
Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) promised that he'd be the next Sen. Jim Bunning ( R - KY ) if he had to be .
And last night , he made good on his threat .
Coburn is blocking unanimous consent on extension of unemployment benefits , just as Bunning did a few weeks ago .
Only this time , Coburn 's not alone -- the Republican caucus has joined with Coburn , promising to block billions in unemployment benefits just as the Senate is set to leave on a two - week recess .
Due to the timing of the blockade , benefits could expire on April 5 , a situation that would not be remedied for a week while the Senate is out of town .
Senators will return from their Easter break on April 12 .
When Bunning blocked the benefits extension in early March , government programs funded by the money -- which includes everything from construction work , unemployment payments and doctor 's fees -- were only shut down for a matter of hours .
This time , with the expiration coming on April 5 while the Senate is in recess , the shutdown could last for days .
Coburn and the Republicans are making the same argument this time that Bunning made back on March 1 : if Democrats want to extend the benefits , they need to find a way to pay for them .
On the Senate floor , Coburn said he was blocking the benefits on behalf that old political standby , the average Joe .
First legal commercial whaling in nearly 25 years moves a step closer with ' compromise ' between nations such as Japan and US
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The International Whaling Commission has proposed permission to hunt under strict quotas , bringing the world a step closer to the first legal commercial whaling in nearly 25 years .
The proposal , released yesterday , would allow Japan , Norway and Iceland – which hunt whales under a variety of exceptions to a 1986 moratorium – to catch whales for 10 years , but under strict limits set by the IWC that would reduce the overall catch .
Japan 's self - imposed annual quota of 935 Antarctic minke whales , which are not endangered , would be lowered to 400 over the next five years , then reduced to 200 for the next five years .
The country 's current take of 320 sei and minke whales in waters near Japan would be cut to 210 .
The proposal is an attempted compromise between pro-whaling nations and opponents such as the United States and Australia .
The commission argues that allowing whaling under strict quotas would be an improvement to the current hunts , over which it has no control .
Various small indigenous groups could continue to hunt in limited numbers .
The IWC is preparing for a general meeting in June in Morocco , where it will debate the proposal .
Environmental groups were quick to criticise the proposal , which they say could lead to an eventual return to the large - scale whaling of the past , which devastated many species .
" At the moment , it appears that the whales are making all the concessions , not the whalers and this proposal keeps dying whaling industries alive and not the whales , " said Greenpeace Japan programme director Junichi Sato in a statement .
Despite a 1986 moratorium on whaling , Japan hunts whales for scientific reasons .
Excess meat is sold for consumption , leading critics to call the programme a mere cover for commercial hunts .
Norway and Iceland also defy the ban under other exceptions .
Together , they have an annual cap of about 3,000 whales , 10 times as many as in 1993 .
The newest proposal from the commission 's chairman suggested specific catch quotas for various species .
It would allow 69 bowhead whales , 145 grey whales , 14 humpbacks and 109 fin whales to be hunted each year around the world .
Japanese officials were cautiously positive about the scheme , which would allow it to commercially hunt whales close to its shores .
" A catch quota for minke whales in Japanese small - type coastal whaling is our long - term cherished desire , and under the framework proposed by the chair , that desire can be realized , " said fisheries agency official Toshinori Uoya .
However , some also criticised the proposed limits on minke hunts , which would be lower than Japan 's current take from research whaling .
Agriculture minister Hirotaka Akamatsu said Tokyo would " persistently continue negotiations " to address this " gap " .
New Zealand foreign minister Murray McCully said the IWC 's proposal does not deliver what New Zealand wants – that it must be significantly better than the status quo and meet the country 's commitment to end whaling in the southern ocean .
" The catch limits proposed in the southern ocean are unrealistic .
The proposal to include ( endangered ) fin whales in the southern ocean is inflammatory .
New Zealanders will not accept this , " he said in a statement .
On the front lawn of New Zealand 's parliament , about 100 Greenpeace anti-whaling protesters Friday held black whale - tail placards aloft with " RIP ? " written across them in white letters .
The commission was formed in 1946 to deal with whaling issues and has 88 member countries .
I have found my feline equal .

The four men found guilty by a judge sitting without jury for the first time in a criminal case since the star chamber was abolished in 1641 certainly looked like hardened criminals , and it seems probable that they were indeed responsible for the £ 1.75 m heist at the Menzies world cargo building .
But their apparent guilt does not make the absence of a jury any less alarming in the trial that was presided over by Judge Treacy and has just ended with heavy sentences for all four men .
A profound change has occurred in Britain where it is now possible for counsels and a judge to decide the fate of defendants without the involvement of 12 ordinary citizens – the fundamental guarantee against arbitrary state punishment represented so well by the use of the star chamber under King Charles I .
In the history of this disreputable government there is no better symbol of Labour 's contempt for the traditions of the English law .
However , we should n't be too surprised .
The trend towards a legal system where the state can decide on a person 's guilt without normal legal processes being followed has been with us for sometime , most notably in control order hearings where a sentence of house arrest is handed down to a suspect without him ever knowing the evidence against him .
I repeat the observation that if a Tory government had been responsible for the serial corrosion of important legal principles we would be out on the streets , but having been groomed by Labour 's sinister machine over the last 13 years we just accept these erosions as being a necessity of modern life .
They are not .
There are three disturbing aspects of this case .
First , the evidence against the accused was very good indeed .
Darren Brockwell , the inside man at Heathrow , had turned Queen 's evidence and this seems certain to have swayed a jury , which had been properly protected by the police , to find the men guilty .
Second , the decision to go ahead without a jury was partly taken for financial reasons .
A jury trial was estimated to cost £ 6 m , while one without a jury costs £ 1.6 m .
To the Crown Prosecution Service it seemed a no- brainer , but since when did we agree that a principle of every defendant 's right to be tried in front of his peers had a price on it .
Third , and most important , the defence teams were not allowed to know the evidence of previous jury tampering , nor whether their clients were implicated in these alleged activities .
The court and the public are expected to accept the word of the police that there are " sensitive issues " concerning this evidence and trust in their good faith .
That is unacceptable .
None of this increases confidence in the CPS .
The director of public prosecutions , Keir Starmer , has taken time to lecture us on the significance of the Human Rights
Act yet is now the man who has orchestrated a trial that offends the very basis of British justice .
His spokesman claimed that the trial went ahead without a jury to ensure justice was done .
What utter nonsense .
For those who care about the justice in the courts , the proceedings under Judge Treacy may comply to a normal understanding of justice in Kazakhstan , but not in the United Kingdom .
The final word should go to Paul Mendelle QC , chairman of the criminal bar association , who pointed out that jury trial was a fundamental right whose origins stretched back 800 years .
" It represents the value that society places on the judgment of peers when citizens are accused of serious crime .
Some values in a democratic society are beyond price .
We would not countenance a restriction of the right to vote because elections were too costly , nor should we remove the right to jury trial simply on the grounds of cost when the costs may not be capable of scrutiny .
I am concerned that this is just the start of a process and that the government will bit by bit trying to chip away at this bulwark of our freedom . "
Shame on Keir Starmer .
Shame on the judge and the lawyers who took part in this of parody of justice .

Interested in finding out what information Facebook is sharing about you through the company ’s new open - graph API ?
Developer Ka-Ping
Yee has come up with a simple tool that shows you everything the social network sends to anyone whose app or service decides to plug in to the new feature — all it requires is a user ID or user name .
You can find out what information you ’re sharing via your public profile by looking at your settings within Facebook , too , of course .
But Yee ’s tool shows you exactly what data a developer would get when it asks Facebook for info via the API , such as your name , birth date , location , etc. and also any public information such as your “ likes ” ( formerly pages you were a “ fan ” of ) , your photos and so on .
As of yesterday , the tool was also showing some information that most users had not made public .
Yee — a Canadian - born programmer who works for Google ’s ( s goog ) charitable arm , Google.org , and developed the “ people finder ” tool used after the Haiti earthquake — found that the API was showing what events he had recently attended , and even those he was planning to attend , information he did n’t recall giving Facebook access to ( another developer says the old API provided this as well ) .
Thanks in part to Yee flagging the issue in a blog post and contacting the social network , Facebook now appears to have fixed it so that the API no longer makes this available by default ( the developer says that his experiments with the Facebook API were the result of “ personal dabbling ” and do n’t have anything to do with his work for Google ) .
Even though this glitch has been fixed , however , Yee ’s tool has managed to surprise even some of the savviest tech users with what it reveals .
Caterina Fake , co-founder of Flickr and Hunch.com , for example , on Twitter called it “ immensely useful [ and ] potentially scary .
I ’m a sophisticated privacy vet & found things I had n’t known I was sharing ! ”
Facebook has come under fire from a number of sources over privacy related to its new features , particularly the fact that users have been “ opted in ” to services such as “ instant personalization , ” which allows several sites that Facebook has partnered with to show users personalized content by drawing on their Facebook profile .
Four senators sent the social network a letter today complaining about this kind of behavior , one of whom has also written a letter of complaint to the Federal Trade Commission .

Talk - radio host Rush Limbaugh ( left ) fired back after President Barack Obama singled him out in an interview .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Limbaugh accuses Obama of ' character assassination '
The president is trying to trick Rush Limbaugh into talking about himself and would rather engage in " character assassination " than debate conservatives in the " Arena of Ideas , " the conservative talker charges in an e-mail to POLITICO .
Two days after President Barack Obama labeled Limbaugh and conservative television host Glenn Beck " troublesome " in a CBS interview , Limbaugh says Obama is trying to get him off his game .

" I think the president is trying to distract me , to get me talking about ME on my show instead of talking about him and the regime 's agenda .
But it wo n't work .
I 'm wise to their tactics , " he wrote .
" I know that a majority of Americans are angry at the regime 's ( and the Democrats ' ) constant attempts at character assassination of their opposition .
They want no part of engaging us in the Arena of Ideas .
They seek instead to discredit and marginalize us , and it has gotten old . "
Obama 's shot at Limbaugh and Beck demonstrates that a long - running White House effort to undermine influential elements of the Republican coalition remains in effect .
Asked generally about the " level of enmity that crosses the airwaves , " Obama slammed Limbaugh and Beck by name .
" Well , I think that when you listen to Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck , it 's pretty apparent , and it 's troublesome , but keep in mind that there have been periods in American history where this kind of vitriol comes out , " Obama said .
" It happens often when you 've got an economy that is making people more anxious and people are feeling like there is a lot of change that needs to take place .
But that 's not the vast majority of Americans .
I think the vast majority of Americans know that we 're trying hard , that I want what 's best for the country . "
Democratic strategists say the president can rally his liberal base by taking on icons of the conservative movement and also appeal to independents and moderate Republicans who are turned off by the style — and substance — offered by talk show hosts who run hot .
Though some analysts predict that Obama 's most recent remarks will raise Limbaugh 's profile , Limbaugh said that 's no longer possible .
" How can I possibly be elevated as a voice of the opposition ? " he wrote .
" I 'm already on the top of the mountain , and the regime put me there shortly after they took office . "
Another beating snuff video shames coalition of the killing , You Tube censors it

British troops punch , beat and kick pleading Iraqi children as a sadistic comrade films the brutal scenes of torture , laughing , screaming , growling and frothing like a serial killer filming a snuff movie .
This is why the Iraqis hate us .
Iraqi children throw rocks as they flee from running British troops , are grabbed , brought inside a gate and beaten half to death .
Watch the video below .
The censorship spies at You Tube rejected it 2 minutes after upload so I re-named it “ Fluffy Happy Poodles In Heaven , ” to try and bypass their keyword filters and it was still rejected .
I even renamed the actual ‘ wmv ’ filename but it was still blocked for “ terms of use violation . ”
I finally managed to get it posted on Google Video .
If it disappears again , here ’s the Windows Media link on our server .
November 19th : Google removed the video too !
So here ’s an old copy the censors at You Tube missed .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Oh yes !
Oh Yes !
You ’re gonna get it ! ” snarls the cameraman .
“ Yes !
Naughty little boys . ”
He laughs as they boys begin to scream out in pain , “ Yes ! ”
He then takes on the tone of a demented serial killer , grunting and growling , “ Yeeeeeesss , yeeeeeessss , ” as troops punch and kick the children .
He mocks the cries of the boys , “ No please do n’t hurt me , ” laughs again and then proceeds to begin frothing in some kind of insane carnal bloodlust , “ Motherfuckers , you little fuckers – die ! ”
Adult Iraqis are brought in and similarly assaulted – the video ends .
A probe of this video led to the arrest of the cameraman , Cpl Martin Webster , but after that the investgation seemingly went nowhere and was swept under the rug .
Originally leaked in February this year , this is just the latest in a long line of “ trophy videos ” that expose the true face of what the troops have been trained and ordered to do in Iraq , dominate , brutalize and enslave the population – and it ’s why nearly 3,000 have come home in flag - draped coffins .
This is why the Iraqis hate us .
– A CNN clip from the early days of the “ liberation ” shows U.S. troops finishing off an injured Iraqi .
The tape cuts to an interview with one of the soldiers who states , “ Like , man , you guys are dead now , you know .
But it was a good feeling .
I mean , afterwards you ’re like , hell , yeah , that was awesome .
Let ’s do it again . ”
– In another clip the soldier exclaims , “ Hell yeah bitches , ” as he audibly orgasms as the scene of carnage before him – a missile slamming into a nearby building .
“ I got all that shit on camera . ”
– U.S. troops in a convoy drive vehicles down an Iraqi highway and bemoan the fact that they are not allowed to gun down children who throw rocks at them .
– Bloodthirsty security guards and contractors hang out the back of trucks and randomly execute Iraqis driving in vehicles behind them .
– An Iraqi taxi driver who stole some firewood gets his vehicle crushed by an Abrams tank as U.S. troops cheer and holler .
Note :
Most of these videos have now been removed but a reminder can be viewed below .
These are just some of the videos that have been leaked onto the Internet .
Now we know that the policy to abuse and torture innocent Iraqis just to show them who the bosses were was implicit , how many more of these kind of incidents have happened over the past three and a half years but not been videotaped by salivating zombies ?
This is why the Iraqis hate us .
No one is suggesting that U.S. troops should roll over like a poodle if someone is shooting at them – they have every right to shoot back no matter what your view on the war is .
The rubicon is crossed when petty thieves , children who throw rocks or completely innocent people are brutalized without recourse and the one thing that betrays the true nature of it all is the sadistic reaction of the protagonists who enjoy the torture , the beatings and the death .
Most of these individuals were brought up on a steady diet of first person shoot - em-ups , and they have overlaid the mental perception that the video games taught them on how to treat death .
Distanced and emotionless , the troops see random slaughter and torture as a stress reliever , a means of letting off some steam – and it ’s all sanctioned from the very top .
This is why the Iraqis hate us .
The assumption that Iraq is now liberated and that its people have suffered for the glorious opportunity of seeing democracy and freedom flourish throughout their country is the last thread the Neo - Cons are hanging onto as claims of weapons of mass destruction and Al - Qaeda ties evaporated long ago .
Yet to claim Iraq is liberated is the most absurd of any of the justifications for going to war or “ staying the course . ”
Every cornerstone of what one would consider to be basic rights in a free society , freedom of speech , freedom of the press , right to fair judicial process , right to be secure from unlawful searches and seizures in one ’s home , have been abolished in Iraq .
The occupation makes the regime of Saddam Hussein look like post - revolution America .
This is why the Iraqis hate us .
I guess the Iraqi children should feel lucky in that they got their retaliation in first by throwing rocks , many are simply arrested , hooded and taken to the torture camp for refusing to show ID at checkpoints .
It ’s good to see that the authorities are not hypocrites and that the same kind of law enforcement techniques are practiced here at home , as Mostafa Tabatabainejad can attest to , the student was tortured for refusing to show his ID to UCLA police in a campus library .
The fun will continue when the same kind of barbarous fiends who get orgasmic pleasure from watching children being tortured come back home and become our police .

WESLEY CHAPEL , Fla. , Feb. 18 ( UPI ) -- Police in Florida said a late - night drunken brawl between a couple began when the husband got out of bed to use the restroom and missed the toilet .
Pasco County Sheriff 's deputies said they arrived at the mobile home of Deanne Elsholz , 44 , and David Elsholz , 50 , in Wesley Chapel late Monday night and found both spouses drunk and with slightly different accounts of the evening 's confrontation , the St. Petersburg ( Fla . )
Times reported Thursday .

Deanne told deputies she asked her husband what he was doing when she heard his urine splashing on the floor and he struck her in the head with a towel .
She said she then threw the glass that struck him in the nose , causing blood to flow onto his chest and arms .
The deputies ' report says Deanne then " ran into the bathroom and slipped on David 's pee . "
She then claims he kicked her in the ribs while she was on the ground .
David 's account differs in that he denies hitting his wife with the towel , saying she threw the glass at him while he was attempting to go back to bed .
He also made no mention of kicking his wife .
Deanne Elsholz was deemed the aggressor in the conflict and arrested for domestic battery , a charge David has faced twice in recent years .
Deputies said she was examined by a doctor who determined her ribs were not injured .
If Paula Dean provides an example of how a larger than life personality and killer branding can overcome mediocre email marketing , Cesar Millan is a classic example of how an equally big personality gets email marketing right .
If you ’re not familiar with Cesar , star of the National Geographic show , The Dog Whisperer , you should be .
With a story every bit as compelling as Paula ’s , Cesar has crafted an entirely new career , not as a dog trainer , but rather as the world ’s leading “ dog psychologist . ”
His show teaches the viewer as much – if not more – about people than about dog behavior .
According to legend , Millan illegally crossed the border into the US at 18 , with $ 100 in his pocket , speaking no English and not knowing a single soul in his new country .
After stints as a dog groomer and limo driver , he began working with some of the most aggressive dogs in Los Angeles and gained a following , eventually attracting the sponsorship of Jada Pickett Smith , going on to star in the Dog Whisperer and founding the Dog Psychology Center .
Every Sunday morning when I ’m checking my email , Cesar ’s weekly newsletter arrives in my inbox .
( I would be curious to know how his marketing team selected Sunday as it is not one of the days known as “ best ” for email newsletter scheduling , yet the day fits well with Cesar ’s mellow , spiritual personality . )
Since I first subscribed , I ’ve never failed to read his letter which is an engaging blend of personal stories , product advertisements , a guest post and a contest or reader involvement of some kind .
When Cesar ’s beloved dog , Daddy , an apparent reincarnation of Ghandi in the form of a pit bull , passed away recently at the age of sixteen , Cesar ’s newsletter featured an announcement and a beautiful tribute .
To honor his legacy , Cesar and his wife , Illusion , created The DEAR Fund for dogs who “ are victims of abuse or violence , man - made disasters ( hoarder and puppy mill rescues ) , and large - scale natural disasters ( hurricanes , fires , and other natural catastrophes ) . ”
Upon learning of Daddy ’s passing and the Fund , I headed on over to make a contribution .
Considering that the announcement of The DEAR Fund knocked out the servers , I think it ’s safe to say I was n’t the only one with that thought .
In short , Cesar uses his weekly newsletter to build upon his relationship with you , the viewer .
Would n’t you like to establish that kind of relationship with your potential donors and donors ?
One nonprofit doing just that is an organization called Best Friends .

Let ’s dissect this email , paragraph by paragraph :
First paragraph : lets you know why you ’re receiving the email and how you can unsubscribe .
Second paragraph : let ’s you know exactly what to expect from Best Friends ( would be even stronger if they informed you when you would be hearing from them )
Third paragraph : brief info about the society along with an invitation to visit website ( better yet to include an animal photo and a personal story )
Fourth paragraph : gentle ask , mention of monthly giving program ( normally I am not a fan of having an ask in the first email , however this one is gracious and understated – I love the fact that not only does Best Friends have a monthly giving program , they are actively promoting it as well ) .
Fifth paragraph : nicely reiterates the agency ’s tagline and again thanks the subscriber .
I counted up nine “ you ’s ” in this email .
It ’s succinct , it ’s engaging , it ’s donor - centered .
In short , this is an effective , relationship - building nonprofit email .
So how can your organization do email marketing right ?
Well it ai n’t by slapping a newsletter opt - in box on your website and sending out erratically scheduled emails only asking for money .
On the other hand , developing an online following is n’t rocket science either .
Try my Five Step Action Guide to lead you through the process :
Locate an email marketing provider .
There are many companies providing this service , from ConstantContact to Benchmarkemail.com to ExactTarget.com , but I highly recommend icontact for their superb customer service .
In fact , in a recent survey of email marketing providers , icontact came in # 1 .
Aside from the obvious factors of pricing and ease of use , icontact has phenomenal delivery rates .
Beware of free email marketing providers .
In fact , lose the free mindset .
Now .
Please .
The provider you select will assist you in building the code to place an opt - in box on the home page of your website .
I recommend to the right , above the “ fold . ”
Decide , in advance , what information you ’ll be collecting ( I also recommend keeping it to the minimum – first and last name , email , and address ) .
Make it easy to subscribe .
Test the process out yourself a few times .
I repeat : Make it easy to subscribe .
Rather than “ Subscribe to our e-news , ” give your potential subscribers a reason to subscribe , even if it ’s something very basic .
Think through your own motivations ( and your own cluttered email boxes ) .
Why should your potential reader / donor subscribe ?
Begin including a tagline in your own email and regular signature lines , such as “ Keep in touch !
Subscribe to our monthly newsletter : link . ”
Automatically subscribe all of your staff and board members – and ask them to include the link and tagline within their own email communications .
Decide upon a regular schedule for delivery ( I recommend a bare minimum of once a month , either at the beginning of the month or the end , for consistency ’s sake ) , design a template which utilizes your organization ’s logo ( all of the email marketing providers include scads of design templates to choose from ) , and decide upon the type of content you will provide .
Sure , animals are often more compelling than humans , but that should n’t stop you from developing an engaging , donor - centered email campaign for your own organization .
A systematized approach based upon relationship building is part of a sound strategy for online giving .
I should n’t need to tell you that if your organization is going to put out an email newsletter today – only to let it fall through the cracks and reappear ten months from now – you ’re better off steering clear .
However I firmly believe that every organization , large and small , should make the time to learn effective email marketing .
I urge you , too , to read Lisa Sargent ’s report on nonprofit websites , email newsletter marketing and internet fundraising and think about how you could apply her conclusions to your organization .
An email newsletter need n’t consist of 3 - 5 articles and tons of graphics – in fact a short , simple story - telling newsletter , with one or two photographs will be as effective .
The key is to start – now .

El Ejército mexicano seguirá combatiendo al narcotráfico , pero con más trabas que hasta ahora .
Y el presidente Felipe Calderón seguirá siendo su comandante en jefe , pero con el poder limitado .
El Senado de la República aprobó , por 105 votos a favor y sólo uno en contra , una reforma de la Ley de Seguridad Nacional que regula la presencia en las calles de los más de 45.000 soldados que luchan contra los carteles de la droga .
La reforma concede un " paraguas legal " a la decisión de Calderón de sacar al Ejército de sus cuarteles , pero de ninguna manera blinda a los militares ante las cada vez más numerosas denuncias por violación de los derechos humanos .
A la pregunta de cómo se siente el Ejército mexicano - principal baluarte de Calderón en su lucha contra el narcotráfico- , el general retirado Luis Garfia Magaña contestó : " Desmoralizado " .
Más información Hallados seis cadáveres con el corazón arrancado en Cancún
La decisión de los senadores fue calificada como " histórica " , por cuanto el Presidente de la República ya no podrá utilizar a los militares para reprimir conflictos sociales o de origen político .
Los soldados podrán salir de los cuarteles sólo cuando la policía esté rebasada por el crimen y se deberán atener a una serie de requisitos legales y de procedimiento .
Por ejemplo , y una vez que entre en vigor la reforma , los operativos militares deberán admitir la compañía de observadores de la Comisión Nacional de Derechos Humanos .
De forma indirecta , se establece que los soldados que violen derechos fundamentales de las personas puedan ser juzgados por tribunales civiles .
Al declarar la guerra al narcotráfico , sólo unos días después de llegar al poder , Felipe Calderón no tenía con qué .
Él mismo reconoció que más del 80 % de los policías no eran confiables y que había corporaciones policíacas enteras ( en México hay 1.660 ) a sueldo del narcotráfico .
Así que no optó por sacar a los militares de los cuarteles y ponerlos a combatir calle por calle .
Dos años y medio después , aquella medida - que en su momento se antojó provisional - se ha convertido en una verdadera patata caliente en forma de pregunta : ¿cuándo van a regresar los militares a sus cuarteles ?
Como ya se encargó de denunciar Janet Napolitano , la secretaria de Seguridad Interna de Estados Unidos , la decisión de sacar al Ejército a las calles no ha dado resultado .
Más de 22.000 muertos y un sinfín de heridos dan fe de ello .
Y no porque el Ejército se haya quedado con los brazos cruzados , sino porque el enemigo a combatir era -y todavía es- más poderoso y mejor equipado .
Hay un dato muy significativo .
Desde que se inició la guerra hasta ahora , el Ejército ha logrado quitarle al narcotráfico 458 aeronaves .
Los militares sólo disponen de 200 ...
Desprestigio
Pero el problema no se queda ahí .
Los militares están preocupados porque , además de ir perdiendo la guerra , ven cómo , día a día y a ritmo acelerado , su prestigio se va resquebrajando .
Lo explica el senador del PRI Pedro Joaquín Coldwell : " Siendo una institución fundamental del Estado , al Ejército se le está sometiendo a un desgaste brutal : incremento de las acusaciones por violación de derechos humanos , caída de la alta valoración social que gozaba , riesgos de infiltración como ya sucedió con las policías municipales , estatales y federal ... " .
Desde hace meses , los militares venían pidiendo una ley que los protegiera ante las cada vez más frecuentes reclamaciones de organizaciones internacionales de derechos humanos .
Los senadores tenían ante sí muchas preguntas y muy pocas respuestas .
Una vez aprobada , ahora se plantea otra pregunta : ¿ Es la reforma aprobada en el Senado lo que los militares estaban esperando ?
Según el general retirado y ex legislado Luis Garfia Magaña ; rotundamente no .
" La situación actual es desmoralizante " , explica , " cuando un militar es enviado a combatir al narcotráfico está llevando a cabo un servicio de armas .
Y cuando disparan y matan a un delincuente o , en algunos casos y de forma desgraciada , a algún inocente , es consecuencia de ese servicio de armas , de ese acto de servicio .
Por eso es desmoralizante que los senadores , sin un conocimiento cabal de las reglas del Ejército , pretendan que sean tribunales del fuero común los que juzguen a los soldados ... Los militares siguen sintiéndose desprotegidos " .
Aunque el Gobierno lo niega , fuentes militares aseguran que ya se ha dado el caso de oficiales que exigen por escrito las órdenes para en un futuro poder defenderse de posibles querellas .
Por si fuera poco , el narcotráfico está adoptando tácticas de guerrilla o directamente de terrorismo , cortando calles , secuestrando a turistas en sus hoteles , obligando al Ejército a enfrentarse con ellos en lugares llenos de gente , provocando -y consiguiendo - que las balas perdidas maten a civiles .
Ante esta tesitura , ¿qué hacer ?
Cada día son más las voces - de dentro y de fuera de México - que piden un rediseño de la táctica contra el narcotráfico .

な ぜTwitterは低遅延のままスケールできたのか
秒 間120万つぶやきを処理、Twitterシステムの “ 今 ”
Twitterのシステム・アーキテクト、Nick Kallen氏
ユーザー同士のつながりを元に時系列に140文字のメッセージを20個ほど表示する――。Twitterのサービスは、文字にしてしまうと実にシンプルだが、背後には非常に大きな技術的チャレンジが横たわっている。つぶやき数は月間10億件を突破、Twitterを流れるメッセージ数は秒間120万にも達し、ユーザー同士のつながりを表すソーシャル・グラフですらメモリに載る量を超えている。途方もないスケールのデータをつないでいるにも関わらず、0.1秒以下でWebページの表示を完了させなければならない。そのために各データストレージは1〜5ms程度で応答しなければならない。
Twitterのリスト機能の実装でプロジェクトリーダーを務めたこともあるNick Kallen氏が来日し、2010年4月19日から2日間の予定で開催中の「 QCon Tokyo 2010 」 で基調講演を行った。 「 Data Architecture at Twitter Scale」と題した講演では 、Twitterが最初に実装した素朴なシステムから、どのような課題に直面し、それをどうやって解決してきたかを概説した。ローカリティ（局所性）を考慮したデータのパーティショニング戦略の重要性や、それがアクセスパターンに強く依存したものであること、あるいは重たい計算処理が発生するクエリでは事前に処理を行っておくことなど、興味深い技術的洞察に満ちた講演だった。
Twitterが配信するメッセージは秒間120万にも達するという
単純なパーティショニングでは解決しない
サービスの構造がシンプル なTwitterは、サービス開始当初には実装もシンプルだったようだ。各つぶやきのIDをプライマリキーとして、ユーザーIDやテキスト、時刻などを1つのテーブルに保存。これをマスター・スレーブ構成とすることで、readの性能を上げるというストレートなスケーリングを行っていたという。
もともと のTwitter のDBスキーマ
memcached による高速化も行ったものの、最初に直面した課題は意外にもディスク容量の上限だったという。つぶやきの数が30億に近づき、800GBというディスク容量の上限の9割にまで迫った時期があるという。「800GBを超えるサイズのディスク・アレイを導入することは避けたかった」（Kallen氏）というあたりは、Web系企業らしい発想で、これに対処するために、パーティショニングを行ったという。
パーティショニングとは、例えばユーザーIDを偶数、奇数に分けて2つのDBに分けて保存するテクニック。特定のユーザーのつぶやきを表示する場合、IDが偶数か奇数かで問い合わせすべきDBが一意に決まるため、分割すればするほどレスポンスが上がり、1つ1つのDBのサイズも抑えられる。
ただ、ユーザーIDに基づくパーティショニングでは、特定のIDを持つつぶやきを見つけることができなくなる。そのIDのつぶやきを誰がしたかが分からないからだ。このため、せっかくパーティショニングした複数のDBをすべて検索しなくてはいけなくなる。
パーティショニングの1つの方法。つぶやきのIDを元に分けることが考えられるが、この分割方法ではユーザーIDに対応するつぶやきの検索には全パーティションに対するアクセスが発生してしまう
つぶやきのIDでパーティショニングしても、逆の問題が起こる。特定のIDを持つつぶやきがどのパーティションにあるかは分かるが、あるユーザーIDに紐付いたつぶやきのIDは、結局すべてのパーティションを検索しないと分からないからだ。
時系列にパーティショニング
つぶやきの量が多すぎるため、単一のテーブルに保存するのは非現実的。かといって、ユーザーIDやつぶやきIDに基づいて何らかの形で分割するというのも、あまりうまくいかない。
そこで現在 のTwitterでは、時系列のパーティショニングを行っているという。1月のつぶやき、2月のつぶやき、3月のつぶやき、今月（4月）のつぶやき、というように時間軸に沿ってデータを分割しているのだという。
現在 のTwitterのデータのパーティショニング方法。時系列に分割しているという
この分割戦略 は 「 当初はとてもまずい実装のように思えた」
（Kallen氏）という。n個のパーティションに分割したら、そのアクセス時間の平均はO（n）となるからだ。ところがTwitterというサービスには、Kallen氏が「時間的局所性」（temporal locality）と呼ぶ独特のアクセスパターンがある。「実際にはほとんどのクエリは、より新しい情報へのバイアスがかかっている」（同）からだ。ほとんどの人のリクエストは最新のパーティションに対するクエリで完結する。すべてのユーザーがアクティブなわけではないため、「あるユーザーの直近のつぶやき20件」は、複数のパーティションにさかのぼっていくことになるが、それでもこの戦略によりアクセス時間の平均は事実上O（1）となっているのだという。
今後 はFacebookで開発されたオープンソースのCassandraを使い、つぶやきのIDとユーザーIDのそれぞれをプライマリキーとしたテーブルを使う計画だという。
メール配送に似た非同期の仕組み 「 fan out 」
Twitterで次に大きな問題となるのはタイムラインだ。
タイムラインにはフォローしている人のつぶやきが流れてくるが、これはつまり以下のようなSQL文に相当する。
サービス開始当初の素朴なクエリ。矢印で示した部分がメモリ上に載らなくなり、非常に遅くなったという
上のようなストレートな実装では、フォロワー数が増えていくると途端にスケールしなくなる。メモリに載り切らずにディスクアクセスが発生し、レスポンスが落ちるためだ。ディスクアクセスのペナルティは大きく、1秒以下で終わるはずのページの描画が数秒かかるということになる。
さら にTwitterの技術上の課題を大きくしているのは、リストやブロック関係、あるいは「@someone」というリプライによってメッセージの配信先が変わるということだ。これは非常に大きな計算処理である一方、「Hadoopを使って50分かけて処理するタイプの問題ではない」（Kallen氏）。あくまでも数msという低遅延で行わなくてはいけない。
こうした問題への対処方法として、Kallen氏は2つのアプローチを紹介した。
1つは 「 fan out 」
と呼ぶメール配送に似たアーキテクチャを使うこと（fan out は漢字で書くと “ 扇出 ” か。風で一気にまき散らすようなイメージ）。各ユーザーのタイムラインをメールの受信箱のように見立てて、そこにメッセージを配信する。つぶやきはいったんmemcachedに保存され、それが各受信箱（タイムライン）に送られるが、その配送処理は非同期のオフライン処理だという。ただ、オフラインといっても夜間バッチのような半日単位というものではなく、秒単位の遅延を上限としたものであるという。
現 在Twitterではメール配送に似た仕組みでフォロワーにつぶやきを配送しているという
も う1つの工夫は、フォローと被フォローの関係をそれぞれ別にデータに持つこと。論理的には片方向のグラフだけ持っておけば十分だが、あえて「誰をフォローしているか」「誰にフォローされているか」に分けてデータ化しておく。データの整合性に気を付ける必要はあるものの、こうしておけばクエリは特定パーティションへのアクセスで完結するため、メモリに乗り切らないという問題も解消するのだという。
こうした仕組みにより、書き込み側のデッドロック（すべてのつぶやきは巨大な単一のデータセットに放り込まれる）を解消しつつソーシャル・グラフがメモリに乗り切らないという課題を乗り越えて、リアルタイム性の高いサービスを実現できている。
2008 年時点 で Twitter上で生まれるつぶやきの数は秒間30だったが、2010年4月現在は約700にまで膨れ上がっている。スポーツイベントやオスカーの発表時など、ピーク時には秒間2000に達するという。そして1つのつぶやきは平均600個もfan outされるため、秒間120万のメッセージ配送を処理する能力が求められるという計算だ。
2008 年時点と現在とで のTwitterの統計情報。秒平均30だったつぶやき生成速度は700にまで上がり、その結果最大で秒間120万程度のメッセージを配送しているという
Twitterは現在もまださまざまな技術的課題を抱えている。例えば検索インデックスについても時系列のパーティショニングを行っているため、検索される頻度が低い単語などでは最新パーティションにインデックスがないため何もヒットしないということが起こる。このため、現在MySQLベースで行っている検索インデックスを時系列のパーティショニングだけでなく、ドキュメント単位にパーティショニングする案や、MySQLの代わりに全文検索エンジンの「Lucene」を使うという案を検討しているという。
原理は自明でも定石のない世界
余談だが 、Nick Kallen氏は2008年9月にTwitterに加わる以前から、Ruby on Railsコミュニティでは広く知られたハッカーだった。RailsのORM層であるActiveRecordで、より抽象度の高いクエリを構成できる「Named_scope」を実装したのがKallen氏だ。Named_scopeを使えば、例えば「公開フラグが立っているブログエントリ」という条件に名前を付けておくことで、積集合の演算を端的に表現できるようになる（参考）。このNamed_scopeの発想をさらに押し進めて関係代数に基づいてKallen氏が実装したのがRuby向け汎用データクエリライブラリ「Arel」で、これは、まもなく正式版がリリースされる次期Ruby on Railsのメジャーバージョンアップ、Ruby on Rails 3にも含まれる 。ArelはC#などにあるLINQに似て、条件をメソッドチェーンとしてつなげていくことができる。
Arelというクエリの抽象化を行う実装を行ったKallen氏だが、Twitterのような実サービスで重要なのは、むしろ、パーティショニングやローカリティの利用の方法論にはこれという単一のアプローチが存在しないという認識を持つことだと指摘する。「すべてのエンジニアリング上の解決策というのは、一時的なものだ」（Kallen氏）。
Twitter規模のスケーラビリティの問題を抱えるエンジニアは多くはないかもしれないが、今後、巨大なデータセットに対してリアルタイム性の高いシステムを設計・実装することがあれば参考になるのかもしれない。

TOKYO — Japan ended decades of denials on Tuesday by confirming the existence of secret cold war - era agreements with Washington that , among other things , had allowed American nuclear - armed warships to sail into Japanese ports in violation of Japan ’s non-nuclear policies .
The existence of the pacts , known in Japan as the “ secret treaties , ” has long been known from declassified documents in the United States and the testimony of former American and Japanese diplomats .
But successive prime ministers denied their existence , turning the agreements into a symbol for many Japanese of how Liberal Democratic governments had turned their country into a stunted democracy run without full consent by the public .
After ending the Liberal Democrats ’ nearly unbroken 54 - year grip on power last summer , the new Democratic Party government opened an investigation into the pacts as part of their promised housecleaning of Japan ’s postwar order .
Exposing the truth about their nation ’s secret dealings with the United States was also part of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama ’s pledges to put Tokyo on a more equal footing with Washington .
This fed concerns among some in Washington , particularly conservatives , that revealing the treaties was part of an effort by Mr. Hatoyama ’s administration to push away from the United States .
Washington ( CNN ) --
They do well with Wall Street , but Democrats may now risk biting the hand that feeds many of them as President Obama and top party leaders press for financial reform .
And a key question arises :
Will there be a squeeze on the money flowing from New York into Democrats ' campaign coffers ?
The answer is not so simple .
" Can we predict the future ?
Of course not .
If legislation is passed that is particularly onerous to this industry [ that ] might change its tune , " said Dave Levinthal with the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics and OpenSecrets.org .
" That 's entirely possible , but there 's no indication of that yet . "
His organization has tracked campaign contributions made by the financial , insurance and real estate sectors .
The backlash has already caused one Democrat to close the door on a scheduled fundraiser .
Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln , who is in a tough re-election battle in Arkansas , announced Wednesday she was canceling a New York fundraiser with Goldman Sachs executives .
Lincoln is now vowing not to take any more campaign cash from the embattled Wall Street giant .
" In light of the SEC lawsuit against Goldman Sachs , Sen . Lincoln will schedule no future campaign - related events with the firm and will accept no further contributions from the firm 's political action committee or its employees , " said Katie Laning Niebaum , a spokeswoman for Lincoln 's re-election campaign .
However , Lincoln still has no plans to give back campaign money she has already raised from Goldman Sachs .
Lincoln 's primary opponent , Lt. Gov. Bill Halter , wasted little time in criticizing Lincoln 's decision not to return the contributions .
Wall Street has been a longtime cash cow for both parties with the party in power or assuming power the biggest beneficiary .
An OpenSecrets.org analysis found that in the 2008 election cycle , $ 89,221,944 was given to Democrats ; $ 68,022,536 to Republicans .
As the 2010 midterm election season heats up , Democrats -- as of the end of March -- have received $ 21,513,828 ; $ 12,867,315 has gone to Republicans .
Republicans , meanwhile , benefited especially well from Wall Street dollars during President Clinton 's second term in office -- along with the run up to the 2000 presidential election , the analysis showed .
The focus on the money trail has reached a fever pitch as Obama and Democrats push financial regulation as their next top priority .
Democrats are now debating the financial reform bill in the Senate .
It would create a new unwinding process for failing financial firms and require banks to increase capital cushions while creating a new consumer financial regulator to watch over mortgages and credit cards .
The bill , approved by the Senate Banking Committee , includes an " early warning " system intended to spot signs of another crisis , as well as a $ 50 billion liquidation fund created with money from banks and other finance industry corporations to ensure an orderly transition in closing down failing entities .
The legislative wrangling comes in the wake of the Securities and Exchange Commission filing civil fraud charges this week against Wall Street power broker Goldman Sachs .
Republicans , meanwhile , continue to oppose the bill , saying it 's just another government bailout for the big banks .
They have targeted their Democratic counterparts for what they deem as hypocrisy -- taking Wall Street money while simultaneously bashing the industry .
Simon Johnson , economist and author of " 13 Bankers : The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown , " said nervous Democrats should beat back against the criticism by exposing the bigger problem with campaign fundraising .
" Show people , in gruesome detail , the money being spent by this part of big finance , " he wrote Wednesday on his blog , Baselinescenario.com .
" Go to the nonfinancial sector , to other parts of the financial system , and directly to individuals -- asking most clearly for contributions that would replace what the banks have withdrawn and offset what the banks are spending to defeat the president 's reform agenda . "
But Republicans are inclined more than ever to highlight Democrats ' ties to big banks .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was chastised by the National Republican Senatorial Committee after the Nevada Democrat acknowledged Tuesday he held a fundraiser in New York earlier this year , which was attended mostly by Goldman Sachs executives .
" As he collects Wall Street cash behind closed doors and pretends to advocate for Main Street in public , Reid 's partisan rhetoric has quickly been replaced with the stench of hypocrisy , " said Brian Walsh , an NRSC spokesman .
Reid spokesman Jim Manley said Reid raised approximately $ 37,000 at the fundraiser .
While he defended his legislative efforts to put tighter controls on financial institutions , Reid did not respond when asked by CNN for more information about the fundraiser .
Democrats are also facing intense pressure to defend their credibility on the financial reform -- especially after the Goldman Sachs controversy .
" Goldman Sachs has always favored Democrats more than it has Republicans , " he said .
" This is something that the Democrats are already grappling with -- whether they can speak authoritatively on the issue and yet at the same time [ acknowledge that ] they 've largely been the key recipients of Goldman Sachs ' impressive largesse when it comes to politics . "
And that support has been especially strong to the top Democrat .
According to Federal Election Commission figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics , Goldman Sachs ' political action committee and individual contributors who listed the company as their employer donated $ 994,795 during 2007 and 2008 to Obama 's presidential campaign , the second - highest contribution from a company PAC and company employees .
Federal law prohibits a company from directly giving money to an electoral campaign .
Goldman Sachs contributions to the Obama campaign were more than four times larger than the $ 230,095 in donations to Sen.
John McCain 's presidential campaign .
CNN 's Dana Bash , Charles Riley and Robert Yoon contributed to this report .

Have you ever seen a documentary where the herd of zebras is at the river ’s edge ?
The lions are behind them .
The crocodiles are in front of them .
What ’s a wise zebra to do ?
Most of them wait .
Then , without visible warning , they either run like mad or else plunge into the river .
Sometimes the lions win .
Sometimes the crocs win .
Most of the zebras survive : the ones in the middle of the pack .
This phenomenon is also known as regression to the mean .
It is easier to move forward than backward .
Monitoring the lions at your rear is important mainly to know when to take your chances with the crocs .
What you should be looking for is a place in the river where there is a shallow land bridge .
You can get across faster , and the crocs will have a harder time grabbing you .
The trouble is , you ca n’t get onto the submerged land bridge fast enough if you ’re in the middle of the herd .
INFLATION OR DEFLATION ?
You need to investigate the logic of price inflation , which rests on the logic — mostly political — of monetary inflation .
Those who predict price deflation argue that the politics of monetary inflation will be overcome by the size of the debt .
The debt will become so gargantuan that the central banks will not be able to prevent massive bankruptcies , default , and bank runs .
There will be a rush for liquidity .
Prices will fall .
I do not think this argument is correct .
I have offered my reasons elsewhere .
But the logic of deflation rests on an assumption : the triumph of free market leverage over central bank monetary inflation and the monetization of debt .
Deflationists do not argue that central banks will adopt a policy of deflation .
Inflationists argue that central bankers will adopt policies of monetary inflation , and these policies will be successful in preventing the collapse of banking and money .
I am in the camp of the inflationists .
I regard today ’s stable consumer prices as the joint product of central bank monetary inflation to save Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and thereby save the largest banks , coupled with the individual , uncoordinated decisions of commercial bankers to deposit their banks ’ excess money with the Federal Reserve , thereby sterilizing the more than doubled monetary base .
If you can not make up your mind , do nothing .
Why do I say this ?
Because whenever you make a decision to buy anything as misunderstood as gold , you should do so based on your understanding of why gold rises or does not rise under inflation or deflation .
You must then decide which scenario is more logical : inflation or deflation .
Then you must decide which form of gold to hold , and why .
Then you must persuade your wife .
This is not easy .
Yet it is mandatory for anyone who wants to act responsibly .
You can never possess exhaustive knowledge , but you can possess accurate knowledge .
It takes time .
It does not take much money .
Is price inflation associated with the crocs or the lions ?
Find out .
That is your # 1 assignment .
I think inflation is the lions .
There are more of them .
They are easier to see .
The crocs are limited to the river .
They are difficult to see .
I think you should pay attention to what is more common .
When inflation starts moving up , you can make your move .
Right now , consumer prices are flat .
We are caught between the lions and the crocs .
Gold will help you fend off lions .
Long - term U.S. bonds will help you fend off crocs .
CONFLICTING STRATEGIES
“ Inflation is inevitable .
Buy gold . ”
“ Deflation is inevitable .
Buy gold . ”
“ Inflation is behind us .
Buy stocks . ”
“ Inflation is behind us .
Buy bonds . ”
If I wanted to spend a couple of hours , I could provide you with links to articles proclaiming all of these positions .
You would not read most of them , so I have decided to save a couple of hours .
Why should you buy gold if deflation is inevitable ?
The argument is convoluted because it ’s wrong .
I wo n’t bore you with it here .
I have dealt with it elsewhere here and here .
My point here is more limited .
There are hundreds of thousands of people out there who have bought gold on the assumption that one of these arguments is correct .
These arguments cannot both be correct .
Some percentage of these people cannot make up their minds about which argument for holding gold is correct .
They bought some gold .
Then they write to me .
“ Will it be deflation or inflation ? ” I always send the same answer :
“ Please post all of your questions on my website .
Thanks . ”
Why do I do this ?
First , it ’s a polite way of saying , “ I am tired of providing free lunches to cheap people like you , who want me to tell them what to do with their life savings , free of charge . ”
Second , out of 1,000 letters , as many as three people will actually join my website .
So , I ’ll make a few bucks .
Then there are the other people .
They really cannot decide which it will be , inflation or deflation .
They do n’t know whether to buy gold or not .
They send me an email asking me what I think .
They get the same response .
It is all over the Web what I think .
I think there will be price inflation . . . for a time .
I think there will be mass inflation . . . for a time .
I do not think there will be hyperinflation and currency collapse .
But , if there is , I will be in far better shape than most people .
That is because I have adopted Ludwig von Mises ’s investment strategy .
When asked what inflation hedge he had , he replied : “ Age . ” This is the one hedge that works equally well in both inflation and deflation .
People buy investments for lots of reasons , but careful logic is not the main one .
They feel the drive to buy .
It may be gold .
It may be an annuity .
It does n’t matter .
People have heard about it , and they want it .
They go looking for reasons .
The same is true of people who have decided not to buy .
Some people are action - oriented : early adopters .
Others wait a long time to act .
They are the people who make early adopters rich . . . the early adopters who really did see coming what in fact came .
Most people are late adopters .
They sit on the sidelines .
They wait to see what their peers do .
Their peers do the same thing .
For these people , arguments are wasted .
They are not looking for arguments .
They are waiting for the herd to start running .
They want to be at the center of the herd .
That is the safest location to avoid predators .
THE CENTER OF THE HERD
The center of the herd is safe most of the time .
What threatens the zebras in the center is this :
The zebras at the front of the herd get the better grass .
We are in an economic drought .
It is neither price inflationary nor price deflationary .
It is a slow - growth economy in which unemployment remains high .
Promotions are few and far between .
Raises are rare .
Income is slowly falling .
Income in the private sector is falling even faster .
I recommend that people concentrate their efforts on their careers .
People are hypnotized by their IRA or 401 ( k ) plans .
These plans are down since 2000 .
An entire decade is gone .
The experts who advised buy - and - hold , no - load stock funds have proven themselves utterly wrong .
They do not change their advice .
I recommended getting out of stocks , especially dot - com stocks , in March of 2000 .
That was the week of the top for the NASDAQ .
I recommended getting into gold in October 2001 — close to the bottom : under $ 300 .
Did people do it ?
I doubt it .
Did they stick with their stock portfolios ?
Yes .
They are still alive .
They are not poor .
But they have not made gains .
If they borrowed on their homes , they have lost their original loan ’s non-recourse protection .
They are liable for all of their mortgages , even if they sell .
They must make up the difference .
They are trapped .
Nobody warned them , except fringe e-letter writers .
They did not read the loan contracts .
They did not ask their CPAs , if they had CPAs .
Now they look around them and find that being in the center of the herd gave them protection from the crocs and lions , but the grass is depleted .
The economic drought is going to get worse .
If you think I am wrong , read what David Stockman writes .
He was Reagan ’s first budget director .
He warned about the huge deficits that would come if Reagan did not cut Federal spending to match his proposed tax cuts .
He resigned .
He saw what was coming .
Now it has arrived .
He now warns against the enormous Federal deficits and their anti-growth effects on the economy .
There comes a time to move to the front of the herd .
This is especially true when the lions seem distant , and the crocs do not seem close to the water ’s edge .
Most people do not want to be at the front of the herd .
This is just as well , because they could not get there even if they wanted to .
I suggest that you spend your time working on your career before you worry about gold , price inflation , or price deflation .
Your main problem is that the grass is getting sparse .
STRATEGIC INACTION
About four decades ago , conservative sociologist Robert Nisbet offered this bit of advice to the Federal government :
“ Do n’t just do something .
Sit there ! ”
This was a variation on the more traditional advice , “ Do n’t just sit there .
Do something ! ”
His is far better advice .
The case for doing nothing new is a strong one .
As a conservative , he understood this .
Most of our lives are routine .
We do things today pretty much the way we did them yesterday .
This is how we keep our sanity .
If we had to re-think everything every day , we would go mad .
We would wind up paralyzed .
By assuming that things tomorrow will be pretty much the way they are today , we will probably be right tomorrow .
We will not lose time , sleep , or money planning for events that do not take place .
Yet there is always change .
Most things do not change rapidly , but some do .
Nine - eleven came along , and Bush ’s Executive was there with Clinton ’s Homeland Security legislation ready to be implemented .
The bureaucrats had planned ahead .
“ Never let a crisis go to waste , ” Obama ’s Chief of Staff Rahm Emanual has said .
This is the radical politician ’s view of social change .
“ Be prepared ! ” Voters are far more ready to surrender their liberties than to fight politically to get old liberties back .
This , too , is the philosophy of conservatism .
“ Stick to the devil you know . ”
That was Rudyard Kipling ’s advice in one of the greatest poems ever written : “ The Gods of the Copybook Headings . ”
http://bit.ly/copybook
So , most of the time , do n’t just do something .
Sit there .
Your goal is not to stay seated .
It is to give yourself time to read , then think .
You need to know what you are facing .
This takes time and concentration .
But until you have a sense of what you are facing , it is best to take no action other than reconnaissance .
CONCLUSION
People prefer inaction to action .
This is wise most of the time .
But sometimes it is unwise .
I think we are in such a time .
Pay attention to your career and your job .
Concentrate on these if they are not the same .
Think : “ How will my career or job do under conditions of mass inflation ?
Depression ?
In between ? ”
Think about these effects on your job , nit your portfolio .
People get sidetracked .
They think that buying this or that investment asset will save them .
What will save them is their ability to stay ahead of the lions and out of leaping distance by the crocs .
It is not your investment portfolio that matters most .
It is your career .
There are no one - shot answers for your career .
You ca n’t write a check and solve the problem .

Large - sized gastropods found in marine sediments in Utah dating from only ~1 million years after the P - T mass extinction .
The scale bar represents 1 cm. © A. Brayard / J. Thomas
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Large - sized gastropods ( up to 7 cm ) dating from only 1 million years after the greatest mass extinction of all time , the Permian - Triassic extinction , have been discovered by an international team including a French researcher from the Laboratoire Biogéosciences ( CNRS / Université de Bourgogne ) , working with German , American and Swiss colleagues .
These specimens call into question the existence of a “ Lilliput effect ” , the reduction in the size of organisms inhabiting postcrisis biota , normally spanning several million years .
The team 's results , published in the February 2010 issue of the journal Geology , have drastically changed paleontologists ' current thinking regarding evolutionary dynamics and the way the biosphere functions in the aftermath of a mass extinction event .
The history of life on Earth has been punctuated by numerous mass extinctions , brief periods during which biodiversity is considerably reduced , followed by phases of re-conquest of the biosphere , corresponding to the diversification of those species that survived .
Over the last 540 million years , around twenty mass extinctions , of greater or lesser intensity , have succeeded one another .
The most devastating of these , the Permian - Triassic ( P - T ) mass extinction , which decimated more than 90 % of the marine species existing at the time , occurred 252.6 million years ago with a violence that is still unequaled today .
In the aftermath of such events , environmental conditions are severely disrupted : the oceans become less oxygenated , water becomes poisonous , there is increased competition , collapse of food chains , etc .
Until now , it has generally been accepted that certain marine organisms , such as gastropods or bivalves , were affected by a drastic reduction in size in response to major disruptions of this nature , both during and after the event .
It took several million years for such organisms to return to sizes comparable to those that existed prior to the crisis .
This is what scientists call the “ Lilliput effect ” , in reference to the travels of Gulliver who was shipwrecked on the island of the same name , inhabited by very small Lilliputians .
An international team of French , German , American and Swiss paleontologists has recently discovered large gastropod fossils dating from only 1 million years after the P - T mass extinction .
The researchers have spent several years studying the re-conquest phase that followed the P - T crisis .
By focusing their efforts on fossil - bearing outcrops in Utah dating from the Early Triassic , which have not yet been studied in detail , they have uncovered some outstanding specimens of gastropods , up to 7 cm , which can be termed as “ giants ” in comparison to those generally found , normally no bigger than 1 cm .
Complementary studies of these new gastropod fauna also indicate that they are not any smaller than older or present - day fauna .
This discovery therefore refutes the existence of a Lilliput effect on gastropods during the major part of the Early Triassic or , at the very least , suggests that its importance has been overestimated .
Quite surprisingly , the presence of these large gastropods also coincides with an explosive re-conquest of the ocean by organisms such as ammonites ( See also Brayard et al. 2009 .
Science 235 : 1118-1121 ) .
Taken together , these events therefore suggest that restructuring of marine ecosystems was already well underway only one million years after the P - T crisis , a very short time after a mass extinction of such magnitude .
The researchers plan to continue to study the fossils discovered in this locality in Utah while searching for other species and groups , such as bivalves , to confirm this new data .
However , these findings already suggest that paleontologists are going to have to re-think the immediate and long term impact of mass extinctions on species .

A machine that carries British hopes of shattering the world land - speed record for a lawnmower has been tested at Pendine sands in Carmarthenshire .
Project Running Blade as it is called is the brainchild of 49 - year - old Stephen Vokins who , along with driver Don Wales , hopes to break the current world record , held by an American , by driving the lawnmower up to speed of a 100 mph .
Mr Vokins and Mr Wales explain why they are taking on the mission .
Scientists are trying to recover a massive NASA balloon and several tonnes of equipment that drifted into outback Queensland over the weekend .
The 300 - metre balloon was launched recently from Alice Springs in the Northern Territory to gather data about the universe .
The balloon is the size of the Melbourne Cricket Ground and carries two tonnes of equipment used to study outer space phenomena .
Launch director Associate Professor Ravi Sood says it landed without incident near Longreach in central western Queensland on Sunday afternoon .
" About 70 kilometres south of Longreach very close to a farm track , so we should have our recovery people there some time this morning , " he said .
" The balloon landed separately - the balloon landed about 20 kilometres west of where the instrument and the parachute impacted . "
Associate Professor
Sood says overall the exercise was a success , considering its magnitude .
" The equipment was just about two tonnes - then there was about a tonne of ballast and the balloon weighed about two tonnes - we had a gross lift of about four or five tonnes , " he said .
" It was spectacularly successful ... the whole flight was flawless and that 's a great credit to the team that comes out from the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility in Texas . "
He says some residents may have thought the balloon was a UFO .

The first attack occurred in the second car of a train at the Lubyanka station , near the headquarters of the Federal Security Service , the successor to the Soviet - era K.G.B .
The explosion was apparently set off by female suicide bombers as the train pulled into the station .

Girl Sleeps in Siberian Town for Nine Years Non-Stop
A story that happened in the city of Kuibyshev could be compared to a fairy tale of the sleeping beauty .
Unlike in the fairy tale , in this story the sleeping beauty is still sleeping , for the past nine years .
Girl Sleeps in Siberian Town for Nine Years Non-Stop
Her friends last saw this girl when she was completing her fourth year of studies at a teachers ’ college .
Now her classmates are all grownups who have long ago exchanged their school desks for office tables .
Masha Rashalova ( the last name is changed ) is remembered as virtually a child .
It is easy to tell how the girl is by her looks .
In her high school pictures Masha looks like a child .
You could never tell that the girls next to her are the same age .
Her college friends say that Masha did well in all of her classes , and her choice of math was accidental and had no reasoning behind it .
Masha ’s friends do not remember her going out to cafes and clubs .
She was not engaged in belly dancing , fitness or beading .
The only establishment she frequented was a library .
She loved books , but in moderation .
Yet , she was always afraid of exams , despite the fact that she was always well prepared .
During her last physics exam she did well , as usually , but after the exam she disappeared .
“ We were told Masha was sick and most likely wo n’t study with us any longer , “ told Olga Batluk , Masha ’s friend .
It turned out that after the exam Masha came home and “ fell asleep . ”
Her condition is officially called a “ vegetal state . ”
It means that the part of her brain responsible for information processing was “ turned off . ”
Such people are not conscious , but not in a coma either .
In college Maria was given an academic leave of absence .
With time , her friends stopped asking about her and many forgot that she existed at all .
Masha ’s mom is a medical professional and has been helping patients of her small city for over 10 years .
Her daughter is the only one she is not able to help .
“ They are called ' vegetables ' , ” she said .
“ But I know that this is not true , I know she hears and understands everything .
It ’s been so long , we asked so many doctors for help , but there is nothing they can do .
She has to wake up on her own , her body has to fight . ”
A similar story happed in the city of Saransk .
In 2000 , also during exams , another girl named Masha fell asleep on the day of an exam .
It was two days after she turned 18 .
She is still sleeping .
No one knows how long it will last .
The family is hoping for a miracle , and doctors remain helpless .
Komsomolskaya Pravda
Ever since Michael Cera became hot leading guy material , we 've been thinking about the dorky guys we often overlook .
In our experience , nothing about our nerdy next - door - neighbor ever really inspired any naughty thoughts ( except for you know ... free homework help ) .
But it turns out that this slightly geeky breed of men might make the best boyfriends .
Here 's why .
1 . He 's capable of memorizing every line of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings so he should n't have trouble remembering your birthday and favorite kind of flowers .
2 . Sure , he may secretly want to get it on with his super hot neighbor , but knowing that you 're the hottest girl he 's ever been with will probably keep him from cheating .
3 . Geeks tend to be tech - savvy .
Which means not only will he be able to fix a computer problem and upgrade your software , but he 'll actually enjoy doing it .
4 . Although the dumb jock thing is a total cliche , you 're unlikely to meet a dorky guy who can't string together a sentence and carry on an intelligent conversation .
5 . Since he 's supersmart and probably already making a ton of money , he wo n't think being a roadie for Vampire Weekend is a great " career opportunity . "
6 . He was probably bullied during high school so he 'll be sympathetic when you vent about the office bitch ... and help you plot a plan to bring her down .
7 . He 'll never hog the bathroom to manscape .

" Mañana , por favor ! " , I answer when housekeeping knocks on my door .
Mañana , please , I am working ...
I sit , computer on my lap , on my bed reading through a backlog of emails , catching up on work done , being done , and work to do .
I just got back from two days in Port - au - Prince , Haiti .
It has been almost two months since I landed in Santo Domingo to coordinate the support functions for the Haiti crisis , out of the Dominican Republic .
My days are full .
My attention is switching from a meeting with one of the ministers , staff recruitment , debugging a cash advance problem , a meeting on limiting the overtime the drivers can do , a shipment which seems to be lost but really is not , stamping the numbering on the food coupons , staffing contracts and a security incident .
It is not the amount of work that tires me , it is the intensity in which issues come , and need to be dealt with .
Not that I do n't like it , but in the evening , I pass out on my bed ...
After two days in Haiti , I wonder how my colleagues can deal with their work , which is a ten fold more complex than mine .
They do n't have a comfortable hotel room , five floors up and 1 minute away from the office .
They either live in Camp Charly , the tent camp for the humanitarians , or have to shuttle to the boat anchored off shore , to spend the night .
Given , the boat is more comfortable , but it takes anything between one to two hours to get there .
Some of the staff pitched their tent in the back of the container park , in " Log Base " , right next to the airport , where most UN agencies set up tents , tarps and office containers , making it the " humanitarian nerve center " of the operation .
The humanitarian part of Log Base is nothing but one narrow road , lined with parked vehicles , crowded with people moving around between the offices , and filled on either side with " offices " .
The fortunate have a 20 foot office container , some with airconditioning , with tarps over them to avoid water sipping through the joints .
The less fortunate have massive tents to work in .
Meetings are held in open spaces covered with tarps , or half open shelters .
Lack of working space is common with most containers cramped with four people , hardly fitting the make shift desks , filled with files and folders hardly leaving space to fit their legs inbetween .
The noise is constant , mostly from planes and helicopters taking off or landing on the airstrip a few hundred feet away .
During the meetings , when the screaming noise of yet another Ilutsin taking off builds up , people just stop their sentence for thirty seconds , and then continue as if nothing happened .
Like pushing the ' pause ' button on a video .
Most of the containers are now properly wired up onto the generators , and have network connections to the servers and satellite links .
Nothing much we can do these days anymore without connectivity , be it for emails , telephone calls , or registering all procurement or logistics transactions onto the central servers in HQ .
Luckily , during my two days , it was neither hot , nor raining , and many staff commented " this weather is as good as it gets " .
I can imagine the dust , humidity or mud on other days .
There is a constant flow of visitors .
Army personnel , staff from the other agencies and NGOs , civilians , people from the government and local communities , people coming back from assessment missions or distribution points .
It makes it hard to keep concentrated to the task at hand , as people get interrupted every other minute .
And although the spotlight of the world 's cameras is no longer focused on Haiti , the humanitarian operation is still to peak .
While during the first six weeks , the utmost urgent needs were being met with loads of cargo being flown in , the steady massive flow of the aid cargo coming in per ship has started .
While one plane can bring in up to 100,000 kgs of aid supplies , a ship can bring in 400,000,000 kgs in one go .
So the logistics and distribution challenges are only starting now .
On top of it all , the rainy season has begun , making the need of the bringing in supplies even more urgent .
And we have the hurricane season just around the corner .
So , sitting back in my hotel room on this Sunday , I can not have but admiration for the staff working in Haiti .
Many of them were present during the earthquake .
They have lost their homes , suffered from loosing family or friends , scarred by seeing the human misery day by day .
I wish anyone criticizing the humanitarian agencies on the ground in Haiti , could spend a week there , working with them and feel what it is to be faced with the daunting tasks ahead , where " Mañana " might not be an option .
Pictures from my visit to Haiti , and random snapshot from day to day life here , can be found on Shot from the Hip .
The movie studio responsible for the award - winning , German - Austrian film Downfall ( German : Der Untergang ) has asked YouTube to take down several videos from the massively popular subtitled " Hitler finds out ... " meme , and the site has complied .
Search YouTube and you 'll still find hundreds of Downfall parodies , but click through to some of the bigger ones and you 'll now get the message , " This video contains content from Constantin Film , who has blocked it on copyright grounds . "
According to TechCrunch , the first Downfall parody to be taken down was the one about the iPhone 4G leak , but other popular parodies followed .
At four million views , " Hitler Gets Banned from Xbox Live " was one of the most watched and thus among the casualties .
The remaining videos might get taken down soon as well .
Each parody video takes a scene from Downfall in which Hitler throws a tantrum when he learns that he cannot win the war .
Fake subtitles are then applied to make it appear as if he 's having a tantrum about something else .
The topics have ranged from Michael Jackson 's death to Hitler learning that he 's the subject of an out - of - control YouTube video meme .
Downfall director Oliver Hirschbiegel told New York Magazine that he laughs at the parodies .

Soyuz crew transport capsule heads for space station
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : April 2 , 2010
A Russian Soyuz spacecraft roared to life and rocketed away from its launching pad in Kazakhstan early Friday , carrying two cosmonauts and a NASA astronaut on a two - day flight to the International Space Station .

Soyuz TMA - 18 commander Alexander Skvortsov , flight engineer Mikhail Kornienko and Tracy Caldwell Dyson , a shuttle veteran with a doctorate in chemistry , lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 12:04 a.m. EDT Friday .
During the climb to space through a cloudless blue sky , television views from inside the capsule showed Skvortsov , seated in the center , flanked by Kornienko on his left and Dyson on the right .
All three crew members appeared relaxed and in good spirits .
" Everything is fine , we 're feeling fine , " someone , presumably Skvortsov , radioed .
" Watch that rabbit , " a flight controller joked .
" It 's a ducky ! " Skvortsov replied , referring to a bright yellow doll hanging above the commander 's head .
" Your mascot ? " " That 's a zero - G indicator . "
Hampered by initially poor communications , the crew reassured mission control at one point , radioing " everything is on schedule .
We are fine . "
Nine minutes after liftoff , the Soyuz spacecraft slipped into its preliminary orbit , with a planned high point of 143 miles and a low point of about 118 miles .
If all goes well , the trio will dock with the space station 's upper Poisk module around 1:26 a.m. Sunday .
Waiting to welcome them to the Expedition 23 crew will be commander Oleg Kotov , NASA astronaut Timothy Creamer and Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi .
The Soyuz launch came just a few hours before the 3 a.m. Friday start of the shuttle Discovery 's countdown to blastoff Monday from the Kennedy Space Center .
Assuming an on - time liftoff at 6:21 a.m. , Discovery will dock with the space station 's forward port around 3:44 a.m.
Wednesday , boosting the combined crew to 13 .
The goal of the shuttle flight is to deliver some 10 tons of supplies and equipment , including a 1,700 - pound ammonia tank for the lab 's cooling system , science racks , an experiment sample freezer , a crew sleep station and other gear .
Asked about the tight scheduling between the shuttle and Soyuz , Dyson , veteran of a 2007 flight aboard the shuttle Endeavour , said " I think it rocks , I 'm really excited . "
" These are some great friends of mine on the shuttle and I 've flown with some of them , I 've trained with some of them and I 've shared a lot of dinners and good times with these folks , " she said at a pre-flight news conference in Baikonur .
" And I 'm delighted for them and just ecstatic that the timing worked out for us to be in space together .
" But what this means on a larger scale is it really brings out the essence of our International Space Station and our program that we could have a shuttle and a Soyuz launching within days of each other and how we can integrate and add to the already complex nature of what we do and the business we 're in . "
Before heading to the launch pad , Dyson took a moment to sing a Garth Brooks song - " The River " - to her husband , earning applause from dignitaries and guests .
In an earlier interview , she said she was looking forward to comparing the shuttle and Soyuz launch experiences .
" It 's going to be cozy , " she said of the three - seat Soyuz .
" What I 'm really looking forward to is the 180 - degree difference between riding in a shuttle and living in a shuttle and doing the same in a Soyuz .
They 're both tremendous vehicles for totally different reasons .
" The shuttle 's incredibly complex and it mesmerizes me still , just how all those systems work together at the appropriate time to get us through a mission .
And likewise , the Soyuz is just incredibly robust .
It 's simple and where we 're redundant , it 's robust .
I 'm also impressed with the ingenuity and the cleverness of the Russian engineering that went into that vehicle .
And that vehicle has withstood the test of time .
So I have a deep respect for both vehicles . "
As for sharing the cramped confines of a Soyuz for two days with two cosmonauts , Dyson said " they 're great guys , really intelligent guys , they have diverse backgrounds , they are personally really good people to surround yourself with . "
" This is their first spaceflight , so it 's going to be interesting to see the transformation that I know I went through when I got to orbit for the first time , " she said .
" They 're going to have plenty of time to get over that learning curve , operating in zero gravity . "

Thalidomide affects limb and ear development in embryos
Scientists have discovered the primary mechanism by which thalidomide causes malformed limbs in developing embryos .
This side - effect was recognised after thousands of affected children were born to mothers who had been prescribed the drug for morning sickness .
Research in the journal Science reveals that thalidomide binds to and renders inactive the protein cereblon , which is very important in limb formation .
This finding could help the development of safer thalidomide - like drugs .
' Unknown mechanism '
Thalidomide can be effective in the treatment of certain cancers and leprosy , but the fact that it causes birth defects means that for women its use remains risky and controversial .
Medical researchers would therefore like to develop drugs that mimic the action of thalidomide , but do not affect limb development .
The research team , led by Takumi Ito from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan , managed to isolate the negative effects of this " potentially useful " drug .
They set out to discover which target molecules thalidomide bound to in the body .
They did this using tiny beads that extracted each individual molecule the drug bound to .
The scientists confirmed their conclusion by using genetic techniques to reduce the production of the cereblon protein in developing zebrafish and chick embryos .
The embryos with reduced cereblon had similar developmental defects to those that were treated with thalidomide .
" We [ have shown ] that cereblon ... is a primary target of thalidomide teratogenicity " ( or its ability to cause birth defects ) , the researchers wrote in their Science article .
Dr Ito told BBC News : " Although the mechanism for the teratogenic effect was made clear , the mechanism for its therapeutic effects remains unknown .
" [ If we want to develop ] a new drug devoid of teratogenic activity , it is important to understand [ this ] mechanism ... this is what we are heading for . "
When two men were arrested for taking a stroll in the sewers on Sunday , police were flummoxed .
“ That ’s not normal , people going down into the sewers , ” said Det. Dan Murphy at 14 Division .
“ Why are they going down into the sewers ? ”
Well , it really does n’t smell that bad , according to one of the men arrested .
“ For the most part it is n’t toilet waste , which makes up a small part of the stream , ” Andrew Emond told the Daily Commercial News and Construction Record last month .
“ It ’s mostly water from showers , baths and dishwashers , which gives off a kind of soapy , organic smell , which is n’t unpleasant . ”
Michael Cook , 27 , of Toronto , and Andrew Emond , 35 , of Montreal were arrested Sunday after a perplexed citizen saw them enter the sewer near Ossington Ave. and Dundas St. W. Both face charges of mischief to interfere with property .
“ I do n’t feel comfortable commenting on this event just yet until it ’s been resolved in court , ” Emond wrote in an email on Monday .
Emails to Cook were not returned .
Both men are urban explorers and photographers .
Cook runs www.vanishingpoint.ca, and Emond runs www.undermontreal.com.
Both have explored drains for several years and most recently , the men were exploring the sewers that replaced Garrison Creek , in the western section of downtown .
Urban exploration is a hobby and subculture where people venture into drains , abandoned buildings and infrastructure to photograph the forgotten past and unseen workings of a city .
Some ask permission , some do n’t .
“ It ’s illegal what we do unfortunately ” said a Toronto photographer acquaintance of Cook and Emond , who ’s accompanied them twice to the sewers that do n’t smell as bad as you ’d think .
“ We do n’t do this to break the law , ” said the fellow explorer who did not want his name used .
“ It ’s about urban cartography , viewing the city that is n’t visualized through streets and other landmarks . ”
He said they are usually outfitted with hip waders and goggles , and always listen to the weather forecast to make sure there ’s no rain .
Urban exploration can be deadly .
In 2009 , a man lost his life after he was swept into the Mississippi River when the tunnel he was exploring in Minneapolis - St.
Paul filled with rainwater .
Another urban explorer on the same venture survived .
“ We take every precaution necessary to keep ourselves safe , ” the photographer said .
“ Every time it rains obviously those pipes are going to fill up and are potentially dangerous . ”
In a 2007 interview with a U.S. blog , Cook said he once ran into trouble while navigating the “ surge spillways ” that “ spiral downwards ” at the Ontario Generating Station in the Niagara Region .
Cook said he lost his footing and slid 60 metres to the bottom .
“ I was very lucky to come away from that with just a few friction burns and a sprained thumb , ” he told BLDGBLOG .
Although many urban explorers publish their photos under aliases , Cook and Emond have always been up front about their identities on their respective websites .
Emond has said he ’s explored Montreal ’s sewer and waste water system for three years without any repercussions .
“ In fact , I ’ve received positive responses from a wide range of people , including historians , engineers , architects , community planners , the media , artists and even local politicians , ” he said .
Cook has said most urban explorers are n’t interested in “ undergrounding ” because it can be kilometres on end of “ featureless pipe . ”

Troy Paiva , a San Francisco photographer who wrote Night Vision : The Art of Urban Exploration , has other reasons to stay above ground .
“ I do n’t do functioning infrastructure .
I find it ’s too easy to get thrown in jail , ” he said .
Paiva has run into police , property owners and people with shotguns , all telling him to scram .
He ’s never been charged .
“ You have to learn how to talk to people and say you ’re just a weirdo artist , not a vandal or a thief .
I think most people think you ’re in there to do drugs , break the place up or to tag it , ” he said .
In his interview with BLDGBLOG , Cook acknowledged legal issues around sewer exploration are “ pretty grey . ”
“ It ’s not something that I ’ve ever had a problem with — and definitely not something that requires me to go in the middle of the night , ” he said .
“ The only thing that really dictates what time you can go is traffic conditions .
If you have to use a streetside manhole , you generally do n’t want to be doing that doing the day . ”
Stanley Greenberg , who has photographed the infrastructure beneath New York City since the early ’90s , says urban explorers are like well - intentioned computer hackers .
“ Part of the challenge is finding your way in .
They ’re not there to do any harm , these are n’t people who do graffiti , ” he said .
“ Granted it ’s occasionally dangerous , it can cause problems , but most of the time it ’s pretty harmless . ”
Greenberg , who published Invisible New York , has pestered officials for permission for most of his explorations , but there have been a few places he had to sneak into .
“ So many places I ’ve been to , I thought , ‘ I almost do n’t care if I make a good picture , I ’m getting to see this incredible place , to be on the edge of the unrestored part of Ellis Island , it ’s like you ’re in a different century . ’ ”
Cook and Emond ’s acquaintance said he felt obliged to speak about urban exploration to dispel myths .
“ A city like Toronto desperately needs more urban mythology .
Instead of having crap like the CN Tower , the SkyDome represent the city , we present things that have been around much longer that most people are n’t even aware of . ”

Plain Clothes Officer Pulls Gun on Man for Speeding ; Police Threaten to Jail Him for Recording the Incident
*** UPDATED VIDEO AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS POST ***
Whatever you do , do n’t speed to work in Maryland .
Apparently , the cops in that state believe the appropriate way to handle speeding is to use an unmarked car with no lights or sirens to cut off the speeder , forcing them to stop , then jump out the car with no uniform or badge and fail to identify them self while he pulls out his gun and orders you off your vehicle .
That ’s what happened to Anthony Graber , who admitted to speeding .
He was cited for doing 80 MPH on the highway .
Fortunately for us , the story gets more interesting .
Anthony was riding with a video camera attached to his helmet to record his venture .
It was still recording when it caught the cop acting like a thug .
The police interaction takes place in the last 30 seconds .
The incident itself raises some interesting questions .
First of all , the officer here comes off as an impulsive thug , not the image we should expect of our law enforcement officers .
Second , as a concealed pistol license holder , I would probably interpret this officers actions as those of a car jacker or road raging murderer .
If this happened to me or someone else who was carrying , it might have resulted in the officer and / or the motorist being shot .
Not wise , officer .
But it gets worse …
A month after this incident cops found the video Anthony posted on youtube .
Apparently furious that their behavior was exposed , they showed up to his home with a warrant for his arrest for felony recording without consent from the other party .
Maryland is a two - party consent state for audio recording , but that is usually never upheld when there is no reasonable expectation of privacy – such as on the side of a busy road during a traffic stop .
They also confiscated his cameras and computers .
Anthony now faces five years in prison , but it seems likely the case will simply be thrown out .
We ’ll see .
I think Anthony might be looking at a fat paycheck at the end of this .
UPDATE : I found the portion with the plain clothes officer with audio , so you can hear he clearly does NOT identify himself for several seconds AFTER he pulls out his gun .
UPDATE 2 : Looks like the Maryland PD are at it again .
The X - 37B space plane prototype is seen on a runway during flight tests in this undated photo released by the U.S. Air Force .
TheUnited States Air Force plans to launch its first robotic X - 37B space plane Thursdayon a mission that is a forerunner of things to come .
A second mini -space planeis already under contract and is projected to be launched next year .
Newdetails regarding the mini-spaceplane and its upcoming Thursday liftoff atop an Atlas 5 booster werediscussed today during a U.S. Air Force - held media press briefing .
TheX - 37B vehicle 's history stretches back to the late 90s , with NASA kick - starting the project .
It was later picked up by the Defense Advanced Research ProjectsAgency ( DARPA ) and ultimately found a home within the Air Force .
The project isnow under the wing of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office . [ X - 37 Bspacecraft photos . ]
? Aftera tumultuous history of sponsorship , it ?s great to see the X - 37 finally get tothe launch pad and get into space , ? said Gary Payton , U.S. Air Force DeputyUnder Secretary for Space Programs in a media press briefing today .
Auto - pilotmode
Thesmall X - 37B spacecraft resembles a miniature space shuttle and is equipped withits own payload bay about the size of a pickup truck bed ?
ample space to holda couple of small satellites that are a few hundred kilograms each , Payton noted .
Accordingto released specifications , the X - 37 B space plane weighs about 11,000 pounds and is just over 29 feet in length .
It stands slightly more than 9 1 / 2 feet in height and has a wingspan just over 14 feet across .
Theinitial X - 37B flight is designed to loiter in space up to 270 days .
Afterretracting its solar array and closing payload doors , the space plane would re-enterin automated mode .
? It ? son auto - pilot , literally , the entire time the rest of the way in , ?
Payton toldSPACE.com , adding that the Air Force is ready in case the spacecraftmalfunctions .
?
We?ll be tracking it over the Pacific ... and it does have adestruct mechanism on it . "
TheX - 37B is designed to make an autonomous landing at Vandenberg Air Force Base inCalifornia , or at neighboring Edwards Air Force Base as backup .
? Similarto the shuttle , it ?ll take half - the - world to come home , ? banking on redundantdigital flight control systems on the vehicle , Payton said .
" I ? ve got alot of confidence in the ability of this bird to come back home autonomously . "
Onorder : second space plane
Paytonsaid the X - 37B space plane provides a new way for the Air Force to conducton - orbit experiments .
More important is experience gained in quick turnaroundof the returned vehicle , the honing of low - cost operations and maintenanceexpertise , as well as sharpening payload change - out skills , he added
Fastturnaround of X - 37B , Payton told SPACE.com , could be measured in several daysto 10 to 15 days or less .
?
I?d like to see this X - 37 handled much more like anairplane , ?
he said , likening that ability to the SR - 71 , an advanced , long - range , Mach 3 and faster strategic reconnaissanceaircraft .
Thenew unmanned space plane will test a new batch of reusable technologies , including new silica re-entry tiles , as well as ? other technologies that aresort of one generation beyond the shuttle , ?
Payton said .
Alreadyon order is a second mini - space plane .
? Wedo have a second tail number on contract .
Currently , we ?re looking at a 2011 launch for that second tail number .
That assumes everything goes properly aspredicted on this first flight , ?
Payton said .
Additionalcopies of the mini-space plane ?
depends on success of these first two birds , ?
hetold SPACE.com , and if operations and maintenance costs are low and fastturnaround times are achieved .
Classifiedbudget
TheX - 37B initiative leverages extensive and early NASA , DARPA , Air Force , as wellas investments by its builder ?
Boeing Phantom Works .
The funding level for theoverall project is within the Air Force ?s classified budget , explained AngieBlair , an Air Force spokeswoman for the project in an earlier interview .
According toinformation released by the U.S. Air Force , the X - 37BOrbital Test Vehicle ( OTV ) will provide a flexible space test platform toconduct various experiments and allow satellite sensors , subsystems , componentsand associated technology to be efficiently transported to and from the spaceenvironment where it will need to function .
The X - 37B will alsoprove new technology and components before they are committed to operationalsatellites .
The OTV is the first vehicle since NASA ?s shuttle orbiter that has the abilityto return experiments to Earth for further inspection and analysis .
Experimental testplatform
? The X - 37B is the only self - contained effort intended to be an economicallyviable experimental test platform on - orbit for months at a time and thenreturn , ? said David Hamilton Jr. , the Air Force Rapid Capabilities officedirector in a recently released article by the Air Force .
Hamilton explained the X - 37B is a risk reduction vehicle for spaceexperimentation that explores concepts of operation for a long - duration , reusable space vehicle .
Hamilton explained that the OTV has the potential ? to revolutionize how the AirForce operates in space by making space operations more aircraft like andadding in the capability for returnable plug - and - play experiments .?

The land problem has drawn fresh attention since Mrs. Aquino ’s son , Benigno Aquino III , declared his candidacy for the May 10 presidential election , running on his mother ’s legacy of “ people power . ”
Though Mrs. Aquino made land reform a top priority , she allowed landowning families to eviscerate her distribution program .
Critics say there is no greater example of the failure of land reform than her own family ’s estate .
For the past five years , the family has been fighting in the Supreme Court a government directive to distribute the 10,000 - acre Hacienda Luisita — the second - biggest family - owned piece of land in the Philippines , about 80 miles north of Manila — to 10,000 farmers .
In 2004 , the military and the police killed seven protesters during a strike by farmers fighting for land and higher wages .
Since then , the family - controlled Hacienda Luisita Inc. has managed to plant only 40 percent of the estate with sugar cane ; the rest has been seized by individual farmers or remains idle .
Criticized for his family ’s position , Mr. Aquino , 50 , the front - runner in the presidential election , announced recently that the family would transfer the land to the farmers after ensuring that debts were paid off .
“ It will be theirs clear and free , ” Mr. Aquino said in an interview in Manila .
But Mr. Aquino ’s cousin , Fernando Cojuangco , the chief operating officer of the holding company that owns the plantation , said that the extended Cojuangco family , owners of this plantation since 1958 , had no intention of giving up the land or the sugar business .
More than 25,000 people died in the Bam quake
Women who wear revealing clothing and behave promiscuously are to blame for earthquakes , an Iranian cleric says .
Hojjat ol - eslam Kazem Sediqi , the acting Friday prayer leader in Tehran , said women should stick to strict codes of modesty to protect themselves .
" Many women who do not dress modestly lead young men astray and spread adultery in society which increases earthquakes , " he explained .
Tens of thousands of people have died in Iran earthquakes in the last decade .
Mr Sediqi was delivering a televised sermon at the Tehran University campus mosque last Friday on the need for a " general repentance " by Iranians when he warned of a " prevalence of degeneracy " .
" What can we do to avoid being buried under the rubble ?
There is no other solution but to take refuge in religion and to adapt our lives to Islam 's moral codes , " he said .
' Disappoint God '
Correspondents say many young Iranians sometimes push the boundaries of how they can dress , showing hair under their headscarves or wearing tight - fitting clothes .
Mr Sediqi also described the violence following last year 's disputed presidential election - the result of which prompted thousands of people to hold mass protests - as a " political earthquake " .
" Now if a natural earthquake hits Tehran , no one will be able to confront such a calamity but God 's power , only God 's power .
So lets not disappoint God . "
More than 25,000 people died when a powerful earthquake hit the ancient city of Bam in 2003 .
Seismologists have warned that the capital , Tehran , is situated on a large number of tectonic fault lines and could be hit by a devastating earthquake soon .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said many of Tehran 's 12 million inhabitants should relocate .
There are plans to build a purpose built new capital near Qom .
The Wake n' Bacon is a collaborative alarm clock design by Matty Sallin , Daniel Bartolini and Hsiao - huh Hsu .
It wakes you up with the delicious scent of bacon instead of beeping .
How ?
A frozen strip of bacon is placed in Wake n' Bacon the night before .
Because there is a 10 minute cooking time , the clock is set to go off 10 minutes before the desired waking time .
Once the alarm goes off , the clock it sends a signal to a small speaker to generate the alarm sound .
We hacked the clock so that the signal is re-routed by a microchip that in responds by sending a signal to a relay that throws the switch to power two halogen lamps that slow - cook the bacon in about 10 minutes .
Simple as that .
No loud noises , no breaking your alarm , just delicious bacon .
Now what you need to do is keep a mini - fridge by the bed so you can toss in another piece , hit snooze , and ten minutes later , more bacon .
Toss in another piece , hit snooze , and ten minutes later , more bacon .
Toss in another piece , hit snooze , and ten minutes later , more bacon .
Toss in another piece , hit snooze , and ten minutes later you can't see your penis past your pork - gut anymore because you 've been eating two pounds of bacon every morning .
Wake N' Bacon
Thanks Mac and Liz , now make one that can cook an egg and biscuit too .

In a wide sense , it includes building a tunnel or a bridge at both ends of the strait , extending [ the ] existing railways of the United States and Russia , and laying a world highway around the coasts of the world , which requires a massive amount of construction .

For two hours every day , at UTC 10:00 – 11:59 , there are actually three different days observed at the same time .
At UTC time Thursday 10:15 , for example , it is Wednesday 23:15 in Samoa , which is eleven hours behind UTC , and it is Friday 00:15 in Kiritimati ( separated from Samoa by the IDL ) , which is fourteen hours ahead of UTC .
For the first hour ( UTC 10:00 – 10:59 ) , this phenomenon affects inhabited territories , whereas during the second hour ( UTC 11:00 – 11:59 ) it only affects an uninhabited maritime time zone twelve hours behind UTC .

Public and cultural programs intermittently rise above the bridge while research and education programs hang below the rail / road .
Significant programs include a new United Nations headquarters , World Water Council headquarters , an Arctic Museum , and extensive oceanographic and meteorological facilities .
Sea ice is often trapped between the Diomedes prior to drifting northward .
The new park seeks to enhance and highlight this phenomenon .
The Bering Ice Park will cultivate , collect and distribute ice floes .
The extent of the park is defined by the Diomedes coastlines facing the international border and date line as well as natural ocean currents movement north .
In their submission to the recent competition to design a bridge across the Bering Strait – the Bering Strait Connection – Toronto 's Lateral Office proposed " IceLink : Occupying the Temporal Seam .
" Lateral Office , of course , are also the brains behind the excellent blog InfraNet Lab , as well as the designers of both the Air Unit and the awesome Runways to Greenways plan proposed for Iceland – and IceLink is no less interesting than either of those .
First , for those of you who did not see the original call for projects , the Bering Strait Connection described itself as a " project attempting to connect two continents " : Architects were asked to design " a peace park with a bridging structure using the two islands , Big Diomede and Little Diomede at the Bering Strait , " and a " proposal of how to connect two continents .
"
In response to this , then , Lateral proposed : " 1 ) a tunnel / bridge hybrid that runs along the international date line and accumulates diplomatic programs , and 2 ) a seasonal ice park that harvests ice floes into a global water vault . " : it 's ideas like this that make me love architecture .
So the site , of course , would straddle two very different timezones : that is , both today and tomorrow ( or today and yesterday ) .
If I was n't living in a temporary apartment right now , and thus without access to my books , I would quote from Umberto Eco 's intellectually pessimistic novel The Island of the Day Before .
There , we read how a shipwrecked scientist repeatedly fails to come to grips with the temporal ( and epistemological ) fact of his maritime abandonment along the international date line .
But , perhaps to the benefit of my readers , I can't .
Instead , let me also mention The Cryptographer , a novel by Tobias Hill .
While it would be hard actually to recommend the book , it 's nonetheless worth mentioning Hill 's use of the international date line as an origin point for a currency - destroying computer virus : the Date Line Virus .
Hill 's Date Line Virus spreads westward with the ticking of the clock – or the turning of the earth – erasing digital savings and scrambling all systems of measured economic value .
That is , the world 's entirely computer - based monetary system , hour by hour , goes mad .
Clearly , then , from even only these two examples , the narrative possibilities – and intellectual stakes – of the international date line are fairly interesting to draw on .
Or , for instance , check out this factoid , from that well - known source of scientific accuracy , Wikipedia For two hours , in other words , there are three different days happening on the earth simultaneously .
But what about thepossibilities of the international date line ?
How can this strange temporal fissure in the planet 's political and cultural landscape be taken advantage of architecturally ?
IceLink , its designers write , without much surprise , " seeks to capitalize and highlight [ the Strait 's ] unique geography , climate , and context . "
However , they add , " The intent here is less to impose a new landscape in this context than to emphasize the sublime conditions already existing .
Currently , the Bering Strait is a seasonal barometer of the impacts of climate change .
The intent with this scheme is to offer spaces with which to reflect on the correlation between natural environments and their occupation .
" This is where we come to the project 's " two primary infrastructural elements : a tunnel - bridge link and an ice park .
"
The so - called " Bering Link " half of the project would consist of " bundled infrastructures , " the architects explain ; these infrastructures would span a distance of 85 km , from Dezhnev , Russia , to Wales , Alaska .
In the process , the Bering Link would skirt the Diomede islands , and even travel north - south atop the date line for 4 km .
Alongside this would be a series of new buildings , " concurrent with the international date line .
"
It 's a little hard to believe that the United Nations would move its headquarters to the middle of the Bering Strait – after all , thriller - reading Christians know that they 'll soon be moving it to Baghdad – but it's a pretty ingenious move to put the World Water Council headquarters out there .
Why ?
Here we come to the second half of Lateral 's project : the " Bering Ice Park , " a kind of floating archive and index of global climate change : I 'm reminded of BLDGBLOG 's earlier look this month at the terroir of drinking water , in a guest post by Nicola Twilley : might specially cultivated ™ from Lateral 's Bering Ice Park someday arrive on the tables of high - end restaurants the world over ?
As it happens : no .
The project described here did not manage to find a place amongst the finalists of the design competition .

The Mercatus Center is a distinctly right - leaning entity , The author , Veronique de Rugy , was previously a the American Enterprise Institute .
She writes a column for Reason magazine and also blogs at The Corner at National Review Online .
Enter Nate :
However , the study does not control for at least one other variable that is overwhelmingly important in determining the dispensation of stimulus funds .
The variable in question is in fact pretty obvious if you simply look at the districts that have received the largest amount of stimulus money , according to de Rugy 's dataset .
The denouement is quite amusing - click over now and read it for yourself , because I 'm about to spoil it with the next sentence :
The districts that got the most money are all home to state capitals .
A lot of stimulus funds are distributed to state agencies , which are then responsible for allocating and administering the funds to the presumed benefit of citizens throughout the state .
These state agencies , of course , are usually located in or near the state capital .
It is so funny you would almost think the original " study " was an April Fool 's joke .
Bravo , Nate .
The time you spend thinking about politics may be baseball 's loss but it is the nation 's gain .

The low snap of a single gunshot bursts from eight speakers at once .
Each speaker is positioned behind a single man , and each man is positioned more or less identically in a sprinter 's crouch : his feet in the starting blocks , his legs slightly bent , his rear end higher than his shoulders , his fingers splayed on but not beyond the white chalk of the starting line .
The color schemes of their Lycra uniforms are different — the blue and white of the United States , the red and white of Trinidad and Tobago , the green and yellow of Jamaica — but otherwise , at this moment , their heads down , their faces invisible , their bodies immobile , it is hard to tell the runners apart .
The individuation begins as soon as the sound waves conveying the gunshot traverse the two meters or so between the speakers and the ears of the men .
Reaction times differ .
The theoretical limit of reaction time in this race , taking into account the time it takes for the sound waves to reach the ears of the sprinters and the time it takes for their brains to process those sound waves and send a signal to their muscles , is 0.1 seconds .
The starting blocks each contain Omega - built pressure sensors , and if these sensors detect a push from the foot of any runner beginning less than 0.1 seconds after the gunshot leaves the speaker , that runner is tagged with a false start and the racers must line up and begin again .
There is no false start this evening , August 16 , 2008 , deep in the Bird 's Nest stadium in Beijing .
It is the 100 - meter finals of the XXIX olympiad , and the first man off the blocks , 0.133 seconds after the shot , is Richard Thompson , of Trinidad and Tobago .
He is followed less than a thousandth of a second later by Walter Dix , of the United States .
In the next three hundredths of a second , four more runners shove off against their pressure sensors .
And then , finally , 0.165 seconds after the start of the race , in second to last place , Usain Bolt of Jamaica begins to run .
Nadav Kander
He 's only been racing this distance for about a year , and the importance of a quick start is one of the things he 's still getting used to .
His specialty throughout his running career has been the 200 meters , and that 's a distance for which the start is n't as crucial .
Over two hundred meters , you can make up for lost time .
That 's not the case in the 100 .
He 's had to work to overcome some of his sloppy starting habits .
For example , he has a tendency to brush his left toe along the ground during the explosive burst from the blocks , generating counterproductive friction .
He 's gotten better , and usually manages to avoid doing that now , but he does it today , the front of his left shoe scuffing the track as he whips his leg forward to take his second stride .
The shoe also happens to be untied , a sloppy mistake , no excuse .
Within the next few seconds , the so - called drive phase , the heads of the runners begin to come up , and their bodies start to straighten , their spines unfurling as their strides lengthen .
Although they are still grouped closely together — were the race to end at the 2.4 - second mark , Bolt would come in fourth place , by a hair — another point of differentiation now emerges :
Bolt is the biggest man in the pack .
He 's six feet five inches tall , 210 pounds .
That makes him three inches taller and twenty pounds heavier than the second - biggest competitor .
During the drive phase , Bolt and the rest of the runners are all leaning forward at an unsustainable tilt , their torsos out ahead of where their feet impact the ground .
They are basically in the act of falling down , face - first , but their legs , racing against gravity , are preventing that from happening , propelling them forward so hard and so fast that their bodies , instead of face - planting , begin to slowly rise up into a full upright position .
Sprinters often describe this phase , when everything happens correctly , as being analogous to liftoff in an airplane .
Usain Bolt 's top speed is simply significantly higher than anyone else 's , ever .
By approximately the four - second mark , the drive phase has transitioned into the stage known as " full acceleration . "
The runners are now truly , in the classic sense , running , knees driving up ahead of their hips while their elbows drive back in the opposite direction , a plumb line between where the balls of their feet impact the ground and their chests cleave the air .
And it is at this point that the ultimate difference between Usain Bolt and his competitors reveals itself .
It is both a simple difference and one that , when you witness it , is hard to fathom .
When the other men reach their top speed , their limit , Usain Bolt continues to accelerate .
By the fifty - meter mark , he has caught up to the leader .
By the sixty - meter mark , a noticeable gap has emerged between him and the rest of the pack .
By the seventy - meter mark , he is covering more than twelve meters of ground — about forty feet — every second , a pace faster than the speed limit for automobiles in most neighborhoods .
Nobody has ever moved this fast before under his own power .
Usain Bolt 's top speed is simply significantly higher than anyone else 's , ever .
His top speed is such a spectacle , so phenomenal , so searing that many who witness this race , who see Bolt cross the line in 9.69 seconds , breaking his own three - month - old world record by three hundredths of a second , do n't notice , until they see the replay , what is perhaps the most salient and frightening thing about his performance :
Approximately eighty meters into the race , twenty meters from the finish line , Bolt stops trying .
It happens right after he throws a quick glance to the right , toward lane seven , the lane of his chief rival , a fellow Jamaican named Asafa Powell who held the world record before Bolt did .
Prior to the start of the race , Bolt believed Powell was his only credible threat .
Now seeing that Powell is nowhere in sight , that , indeed , no other runner is visible , Bolt lets something like a smile cross his lips .
Then his arms stop pumping .
He drops them to his sides , pulls his shoulders back , pushes his chest out , splays his fingers .
His legs continue to cycle , but he no longer provides them additional impetus .
He coasts .
Several meters before he crosses the finish line , a full half second before he wins the 100 - meter final by one of the widest margins in Olympic history , he brings his right fist up and thumps his chest .
As Bolt bounds toward his family waiting on the sidelines , kicking off his golden , unlaced shoes , beginning to do a Jamaican dance called the Nuh Linga , Ato Boldon , one of the men NBC hired to comment on the race , does his job and tries to put what he has just seen into words .
The frontiers of human performance , he says , sounding somewhat stunned , " have now gone into the realm of video - game times . "
The sound of gunfire bursts from two speakers at once , one on either side of the television set .
Usain Bolt flinches , flicks his left thumb forward on the nub of his controller .
" Run ! " he shouts .
" Run ! "
Bolt is sitting on the edge of a king - sized mattress in his bedroom , one foot curled under him , the other planted on the floor .
He 's usually got a warm , open face , with a grin lurking near the surface , but right now his expression is as slack and empty as the wet socks hanging on the clothesline in his backyard .
He and his younger brother , Sadiki , are playing a two - player mission in Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 .
Sadiki sits on a leather rocker next to the bedroom window , which is cracked open .
A warm Jamaican breeze penetrates the room , causing the maroon - and - orange curtains to roil and billow inward , lapping up against Sadiki 's cheek , but Sadiki does n't seem to notice .
He , like Bolt , is staring , rapt , at the fifty - inch Sharp HDTV that sits on the glass - topped entertainment console at the end of the bed .
They began playing soon after they woke up , at 10:00 A.M. , and by 1:00 P.M. , neither has moved , even to go to the bathroom , though Bolt has occasionally shifted his position , loosening his shoulders , stretching his back , switching from playing while sitting up to playing while lying on his stomach or his side .
He 's got scoliosis , a congenitally warped spine , and a significant portion of his training over the last few years has been devoted to dealing with this birth defect , trying to keep his back strong and supple .
At the foot of Bolt 's bed is a partially unpacked suitcase .
He got back almost a week ago from a publicity trip to Kenya , where he adopted a baby cheetah on behalf of the Zeitz Foundation for Intercultural Ecosphere Safety , a nonprofit that the chief executive of the Puma Corporation founded .
Puma has been
Bolt 's sponsor for years , and his suitcase is basically a grab bag of the Puma freebies that make up the bulk of his wardrobe : sneakers , shorts , socks , shirts .
Right now he 's wearing khaki cargo shorts and a white tee .
Under his bed , three new - looking pairs of sneakers are lined up , tongues lolling , next to a remote control and a sealed condom .
Another condom sits on a chest of drawers next to the bed , along with a bottle of Jergens Age - Defying Lotion , a stick of Right Guard Xtreme deodorant , a bottle of Purelene Multivitamin Hair Food , a few ounces of Hugo Boss cologne , a ceremonial key to the city of Trelawny , and the passport he used on his trip to Kenya .
On his next trip abroad , he 'll have a new passport , since Jamaica 's prime minister just made him an ambassador - at - large , a designation that comes with the perk of a customs - bypassing diplomatic passport , not to mention full diplomatic immunity .
Over the past few hours , he and his brother have hardly talked to each other , though Bolt did berate Sadiki at length when a terrorist 's dog knocked Bolt 's avatar down and started chewing his face off and Sadiki did n't do anything about it .
" One thing , " Bolt moaned , " I only needed you to do one thing ! "
A couple of times they 've had to pause the game when NJ , Bolt 's best friend since first grade and personal assistant since Beijing , escorted visitors into the bedroom on business .
A man named Clive Campbell , whom everyone refers to as " Busy , " wanted Bolt 's permission to provide the BBC with some footage he had of Bolt playing soccer .
A woman named Kim from a local BMW dealership had a bunch of T - shirts she needed Bolt to sign .
After Kim left ,
Bolt sent NJ out on a mission to track down a twelve - month Xbox Live subscription card , and he and Sadiki have been playing uninterrupted since .
Bolt was born twenty - three years ago and grew up , like Sadiki and NJ , in a remote village called Sherwood Content in the northwest quadrant of the island , a long way from here , the King 's Vale gated community in Kingston , where Bolt 's jet - black 2010 Skyline GT - R — a replacement for the 2009 BMW M3 he wrecked last year — squats in the driveway of his cozily swank whitewashed three - bedroom house , a few paces from the maid 's entrance .
Bolt 's dad operated , and still does , a little shop in Sherwood Content that sells meat , eggs , milk .
His mother worked in the fields , picking bananas , cassava , yams .
Bolt 's hometown remains the same sleepy place it 's always been , though there 's been a minor yam push there recently , with at least one company planning to export the local tubers worldwide , marketing them as the primal foodstuff of Usain Bolt .
There 's another burst of gunfire and Bolt 's portion of the screen reddens with blood .
He 's leaning forward a bit , his forearms resting on his thighs , his shoulders hunched , tense .
More gunfire and he dodges to the right , both in the real world and the virtual one , his crosshairs losing their target .
He sucks in air through his teeth , his whole body taut with effort , with anxiety , bracing for a final hit , another failure .
But then , suddenly , unexpectedly , Sadiki comes through , finding the last terrorist , taking him out .
A banner unfurls on the screen — " Mission Accomplished " — and in the space of a heartbeat , Bolt relaxes , exhaling , flopping backward onto the bed , stretching his long legs out in front of him , pumping his fist , smiling , exultant .
It was close , but he made it .
He won .
It 's worth keeping in mind that there is a significant difference between the final seconds of Usain Bolt 's gold - medal run in Beijing in 2008 and the final seconds of his victory this afternoon in Call of Duty .
In the video game , right up until the moment Sadiki took out the final terrorist , Bolt was on edge , nervous , uncertain .
It taxed him .
He almost lost .
Beating the video game was a challenge for him .
Executing the most dominant and effortless performance in the history of the Olympic Games was not .
Ethan Siegel , a theoretical astrophysicist at Lewis & Clark College , recently charted a graph to demonstrate that , judging by the incremental progression of the 100 - meter world record over the past hundred years , Bolt appears to be operating at a level approximately thirty years beyond that of the expected capabilities of modern man .
Mathematically , Bolt belonged not in the 2008 Olympics but the 2040 Olympics .
Michael Johnson , the hero of the 1996 Olympic summer games , has made the same point in a different way : A runner capable of beating Bolt , he says , " has n't been born yet . "
Which raises the question :
What would happen if the greatest athlete alive put as much effort into his training as he does his video games ?
Network Osaka
Bolt is lying on his back on the concrete floor at the top of a set of crumbling aqua - painted bleachers , one arm on his chest , the other flopped out by his side , holding on to the leg of a nearby massage table , eyes closed , gasping .
The bleachers overlook a raggedy track on the outskirts of the Kingston campus of the University of the West Indies .
The grass of the track is a sun-faded , watercolor green , much paler than the green of the mountains that rise up just beyond it .
The pounding of countless footfalls has worn the grass away entirely in places , leaving bald spots of red earth .
Bolt has just run six 200 - meter half - oval repeats on the track .
It was his first serious workout in months , since his recent trip to Kenya was preceded by a lengthy media tour of New York City , where he found himself doing things like appearing on Jimmy Fallon and racing the staff members of ESPN .
" Hey , Usain . "
Bolt opens his eyes , sees the Racers Track Club masseur standing over him .
The masseur shakes his head , pats his own stomach while looking down at Bolt's .
" What ? "
Bolt says , grinning , pulling up his T - shirt , exposing a six - pack , though one that is perhaps a bit more insulated than those of many of the other runners here today .
Before arriving at the track , Bolt had scarfed down a typical lunch : a sandwich of cheese patties and coco bread , eaten one - handed from a greasy brown paper bag , his other hand working the controls of the deejay deck in his living room .
Bolt pulls his shirt back down .
The shirt is , of course , another Puma .
It features a stylized picture of Bolt striking his now famous " Lightning Bolt " pose , one arm stretched to the sky , the other pulled back as though drawing a bowstring .
Under the picture , two words : " Who Faster ? "
Bolt eventually sits up , pushes himself to his feet with an exaggerated groan , and strolls over to where some of the other runners are clustered together , talking about movies .
" Law Abiding Citizen , " says a hurdler , and then offers a five - word review : " Yo. Moronic !
That shit 's bad . "
" Funny ? "
Bolt asks .
" No , not funny .
Not anything . "
Bolt likes movies almost as much as he likes video games .
He might even star in a movie himself soon .
The producer of Pumping Iron , the old documentary about Arnold Schwarzenegger , has been talking with his manager and wants to shoot a feature - length documentary about Bolt .
But he 's got mixed feelings about it .
He thinks the movie would probably be a dud : " It would be boring .
I do n't really do much .
Training .
Play video games .
Play music .
I 'm always home . "
The quietest and youngest runner of the group is an eighteen - year - old 100 - meter specialist named Jason Young .
Young , by one measure , is blessed :
He came from Bolt 's hometown , attended Bolt 's high school , excelled there , attracting the attention of Bolt 's manager , who decided to take Young under his wing .
Bolt himself has been kind to Young , makes an effort , often invites him over to his place to hang out and play Xbox .
By another measure , though , Young , like every other up - and - coming 100 - meter specialist in the world today , is cursed .
Over the last several decades , up until last year , the world - record time in the 100 meters dropped in tiny steps , the world 's top sprinters swapping it back and forth , shaving off a hundredth of a second every year or so .
Two or three elite runners at a time always seemed to be within a toe of the mark , while a wider pool of runners brought up the rear , poised to take their place among the elite .
Bolt , by replacing the incremental drop in the world record with an exponential one , by doing approximately thirty years of damage in a single year , has undermined the fondest aspirations of an entire generation .
Who faster ?
Nobody .
Here or anywhere .
Not now , and probably not for a very long time .
Glen Mills , who has been
Bolt 's coach since 2005 , is down on the field , watching another one of his runners skip sideways down a row of hurdles , the young man 's legs kicking up and over each one like a chorus girl's .
A digital stopwatch hangs from Mills 's thick neck , dangling just above his potbelly .
Mills has close - cut gray hair , narrow eyes , a perpetually sardonic expression .
Were someone to have charted a graph depicting Bolt 's story up to the point that Mills became his coach , it would have shown a steep parabolic trajectory , a rapid rise followed by a precipitous fall .
Like many promising runners ,
Bolt had come out of nowhere , burned brightly for a few years — setting a number of junior records — then appeared to have burned out .
In 2004 , at seventeen years old , Bolt made the Jamaican national team and competed in that year 's Olympic Games in Athens , but his performance there was poor :
He never made it past the first round in his only event , the 200 meters .
His progress stalled , then reversed .
" When I got him , he was injured , " Mills says .
" Also , his coordination and all those things were off .
And his scoliosis was affecting his hamstring .
So we had to do some work . "
Much of that work consisted of not working so hard .
Mills cut down on Bolt 's high - intensity workouts and put him instead on a training regimen that emphasized strength and flexibility , building up his core muscles to compensate for his problematic spine , honing Bolt 's body and technique until he was ready to fully harness his gift .
Although Bolt continued to compete , for the two years of 2006 and 2007 , he did n't place first in any races .
It was n't until 2008 that Mills 's training regimen came to fruition , and the world took notice of what had been taking root at this worn track on the grounds of an old Kingston sugar plantation .
Soon Mills noticed that some of his younger runners , realizing that they could never hope to match Bolt but not prepared to give up their world - conquering dreams , shifted their attention from the 100 - and 200 - meter distances to other events , to hurdles or longer distances in which they might still hope to make a mark .
The 400 , for example .
As it happens , a group of five 400 - meter runners is rounding the oval right now , their last circuit of today 's practice , and though it 's not a real race , you can tell from across the field that they 're trying hard , shoulders stiffening , cheeks bellowing , each wanting to win .
Bolt and the others stand up and cup their hands to their mouths and start shouting encouragement .
Bolt rarely races the 400 , hates the long practices , the lung - searing , vomit - inducing arduousness of the extra training required to run that distance at an elite level .
Still , he thinks that someday he might give the 400 a serious go .
And the general consensus in the world track community is that if he were ever to dedicate himself to the 400 , he could dominate it as thoroughly as he has the 100 and 200 .
And after that ?
Who knows .
But he 's kind of interested in the long jump , too .
At this point , there 's every reason to believe that Bolt is like Alexander in his prime , a young conqueror whose future conquests will not be determined by ability but simply by desire and discipline .
As the pack of 400 - meter runners approaches the bleachers , the final bend , Bolt suddenly skips down the steps to the track .
He 's taken off his running shoes , is back in his usual pair of blue Puma flip - flops .
When the runners come abreast of him , Bolt shoots a smile back at his friends in the bleachers , jumps out beside the straining , struggling runners , and sprints easily to the finish line in first place , arms raised in mock victory .

The route from the track back to Bolt 's house passes a billboard that evidently has been up for a while .
It 's an ad for a local car dealership , and it features a picture of Asafa Powell leaning up against a Mercedes .
" The Fastest Man in the World , " it reads .
Asafa Powell 's world - record time in the 100 , set in September 2007 , was 9.74 .
Usain Bolt 's latest , set at the World Championships in Berlin in August 2009 , is 9.58 .
Incidentally , toward the end of that race , just as he had in Beijing , Bolt glanced over his shoulder and , seeing nobody was near him , slowed down before the finish line .
Powell and Bolt , though they train with different coaches , are friends .
In fact , as soon as Bolt gets home , he will shower , change into slacks and a short - sleeved button - down shirt , and head out to the Pegasus Hotel , which is hosting an event honoring the launch of the Asafa Powell Foundation .
At the event , in front of a crowd of a couple hundred people dressed in suits and gowns , Bolt will present Powell with a check .
Later , at the podium , Powell will mumble good - naturedly that public speaking , for him , is as impossible a task as beating Usain Bolt .
Other runners , past and present , have n't been so gracious .
Carl Lewis , for example , suggested in 2008 that anyone who , like Usain Bolt , can drop his 100 - meter time from 10.03 seconds to 9.69 in a year has to be viewed with skepticism .
Darvis Patton , an American sprinter who ran in the 100 - meter final against Bolt in Berlin , was asked for a comment about Bolt immediately after the race .
Patton shook his head , then echoed the video - game analogy Ato Boldon had employed the year before in Beijing , but with an ambiguous twist .
" There are no words to describe him .
He 's like a created , game person , " Patton said .
Then he thought for a moment and added , " He 's like a cheat code . "
Bolt , of course , swears he 's not cheating .
He says he does n't even like to take legal supplements , that he 's willing to be tested anytime , anywhere .
But Bolt 's manager , Norman Peart , is keenly aware that it will take more than words to make his client wholly credible .
It 's only natural that people are skeptical , he says .
He brings up the cases of Marion Jones and Justin Gatlin , two American 100 - meter champions whose careers were destroyed not long ago by drug revelations .
Prior to the revelations , Peart says , Jones and Gatlin had repeatedly " sat down just like me and you , and they went , ' I have never ! '
And ' I 'm gonna sue so and so ! '
And they cried .
And then ... "
He shrugs .
" Just the same way [ Bolt looks ] , that 's the way Marion looked , that 's the same way Justin looked .
Who are we to believe ? "
The problem is compounded by the fact that these days there are plenty of substances
Bolt could be taking , from human - growth hormone to designer steroids , that remain effectively undetectable .
" You can beat the system , " Peart says .
" You try to get something they can't find .
Whatever .
So that 's the thing in people 's minds :
Are these guys one step ahead ? "
Actually , putting all questions of chemistry aside , Bolt is not just one step ahead but three .
When he set his latest 100 - meter record , it took him forty - one steps to reach the finish line .
The second - place finisher , the American Tyson Gay , required forty - four steps to cover the same distance .
So the simplest , most literal explanation for Bolt 's speed is this :
He cycles his stride nearly as quickly as other sprinters , but his stride length , owing to his longer legs , is significantly greater than theirs .
Or even simpler :
He 's a tall man who runs like a shorter one .
" That 's his gift , " Coach Mills says .
" Over everyone else .
That 's what makes him special . "
And what 's the explanation for this gift ?
" Only the good Lord can tell you , " says Mills .
Which is to say , whether you believe in Usain Bolt is ultimately a matter of faith .
There 's another HDTV hanging on the wall in Bolt 's living room , above a shelf that is packed , like most available surface area in this house , with various awards and memorials , including a two - foot - tall abstract bronze statue of Bolt in which he looks kind of like the Sandman villain from Spider - Man , his skin sloughing off in waves .
The TV is tuned to MTV Jams , which is showing the video for the new Chris Brown song , " I Can Transform Ya , " but you can't hear Chris Brown at all because Bolt is blasting , at club - level volume , from speakers hooked up to a set of Pioneer deejay decks on a coffee table , Bob Marley 's " One Love . "
Actually , you can't really hear Bob Marley , either , because Bolt has used the mixer to fade Marley 's vocals and is singing the chorus himself .
He 's sitting on an overstuffed leather sofa , holding a wired mic flush against his lips .
A pair of headphones scissors his skull above his ears .
He 's got a high , paper - thin singing voice .
" Let 's get together and feel all right , " he croons , holding a hand out toward an imaginary crowd .
" Sing it together , " he says .
" Sing it ! "
Most of the people in this room — Sadiki , NJ , and Bolt 's bodyguard — are n't paying any attention to him .
They 're all busy doing other things , texting or Facebooking or Web surfing .
They 're used to these midafternoon deejaying sessions of his , used to ignoring them .
Deejaying fascinates Bolt .
He even entered a deejaying competition recently , and he lost to a former Miss Jamaica World .
Undeterred , he remains a diligent , if not particularly precocious , student , keen to learn and get better .
Most afternoons , he spends an hour or so here in his living room and tries to get his utterly disinterested entourage moving .
When they refuse to sing along to " One Love , " he finishes up one more round of the chorus himself , then fades the song all the way down .
" Yeah , and we end that one on a good note , " he says in a sort of self - consciously baritone deejay voice , smiling broadly , then executes a few scratches on his deck 's turntable before using his MacBook to cue up the next song .
" All right , let 's try some hip - hop , " he says .
" No more reggae now .
You know what I 'm gonna play now ?
Anyone know what I 'm gonna play ? "
" ' You 're a Jerk , ' " NJ says , sounding bored , without looking up from his own laptop .
" You know ? "
Bolt says , looking surprised , and a moment later the first verse of the song , which is the same as the chorus , which is the same as the title , fills the room .
" You 're a jerk !
You 're a jerk !
You 're a jerk ! "
The song is by a group called the New Boyz .
It 's hard to call it a song , actually , since it 's more of a single hook line repeated , ad nauseam , over a desiccated drum - and - synth beat .
It originated last year in southern California and has since spawned a minor dance craze , The Jerk , which washed up in Kingston .
Bolt throws himself into it , dancing as best he can on the couch , his arms executing rhythmic backward circles , as though he were doing a sort of flailing backstroke .
His friends continue to ignore him .
The head of the International Olympic Committee criticized Bolt 's dancing during the 2008 Olympics , saying that Bolt 's dances after his gold - medal performances in the 100 meters , 200 meters , and 4x100 - meter relay — dances known respectively as the Nuh Linga , the Gully Creepa , and the Tek Weh Yuhself — smacked of showboating and were disrespectful to the other athletes .
The criticism of his dancing was part of the larger critique that 's often leveled against him , which is that he does n't take running seriously enough .
There 's a perception in some quarters of the athletic community that Usain Bolt is the Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart of track and field , a prodigiously gifted individual who is also something of a wastrel and clown .
Certain people , when they see a man perform superhuman feats , want that man to carry himself with superhuman gravity .
Bolt , by this measure , never fails to disappoint .
And personally , he could n't care less .
When he was younger , he says , the only thing he wanted to do was please everybody around him , from his fans to the media .
But after his disastrous showing in Athens in 2004 , Bolt sussed out the heartless calculus that underpins critical and public opinion : " I figured out that as long as you 're not doing good , they 're going to criticize you , and if you 're doing good , they 're going to love you . "
The epiphany was a liberating one , in that it allowed him to disregard basically everything — from the dizzying adulation to the steroid speculation — that people have thrown at him since then .
" I figured it out , and I was like , okay ... I 've gotta put me first .
And then I just started enjoying it . "
He tries to get Sadiki to get up and do the Jerk , but Sadiki 's busy on his BlackBerry , so about thirty seconds into the song , Bolt throws off his headphones , puts down his mic , jumps over the coffee table , and does it himself , his Puma flip - flops sliding on the tiled floor as he starts sort of skipping backward in place .
It 's a goofy dance , but he 's a good dancer .
His entourage can't ignore him anymore , and they 're watching him now , but he does n't see them .
He 's got his eyes closed , his ears open , his body moving .

Critics say there was no military reason to bomb Dresden Up to 25,000 people died in the Allied bombing of Dresden during World War II - fewer than often estimated , an official German report has concluded .
The Dresden Historians ' Commission published its report after five years of research into the 13 - 15 February 1945 air raid by Britain and the US .
The study was aimed at ending an ongoing debate on the number of casualties in the German city .
Germany 's far - right groups claim that up to 500,000 people died .
They say the bombing - which unleashed a firestorm in the historic city when Nazi Germany was already close to defeat - constituted a war crime .
Critics say there was no military reason for it , but others argue that Dresden was an important logistical point close behind German lines , as the Soviet Army approached from the east .
' Crux of argument '
The Dresden commission said it had used records from city archives , cemeteries and other official registries and compared them with published reports and witness accounts to reach its conclusion .
It also noted that fewer refugees fleeing the Eastern front were killed in the air raid then was previously thought , rejecting reports that many victims ' bodies were never recovered .
" Remembering the Allied bombings of Dresden ... still carries importance for the social - political understanding of how history is seen , how society is shaped , and how identities are formed , " the commission said .
" In this debate , the number of people killed in the raids on Dresden has long been a crux of the argument that is key to certain views . "

On the 7 ^th of December , 2008 , in the heart of Scotland , a chimpanzee called Pansy died peacefully .
She was over 50 years old and lived on an island in Blair Drummond Safari Park with three other chimps – her daughter Rosie , another adult female called Blossom , and Blossom ’s son Chippie .
Their reaction to her passing was recorded by the park ’s cameras ( see video above ) and many of their actions seem remarkably human .
The others seemed to care for Pansy in her final minutes , examine her body for signs of life , and avoid the place where she died .
Rosie even conducted the equivalent of an all - night vigil .
This footage provides a rare glimpse into how one of our closest relatives deal with death , and it ’s one of two such examples that have been published today .
The second took place several thousand miles away in the forests of Bossou , Guinea .
In 2003 , a respiratory epidemic killed five of the local chimps , including two babies called Jimato and Veve .
Their mothers , Jire and Vuavua , carried their babies ’ lifeless bodies around for 68 and 19 days respectively .
They groomed the dead youngsters and chased away the flies that circled them ( see image and video below ) .
Even after both babies had completely mummified into dry , leathery husk , the mothers still carried them , and other groups members investigated them .
These examples of quiet , calm behaviour are incredibly different from previous anecdotes .
At Gombe National Park in Tanzania , the death of a male who fell from a tree was greeted by an eruption of noise .
The others made alarm calls and aggressive displays , and they touched and held each other .
They stared and sniffed at the corpse , but no one touched it and after four hours , the group left .
Elsewhere , in the Tai Forest , a leopard fatally mauled a young female and the same mass excitement ensued .
This time , the others frequently touched the body and some males even dragged it for short distances before abandoning it .
And in other cases , chimps have been shown to attack or even cannibalise the corpses of dead infants , despite the protestations of their mothers .
In stark contrast , Pansy ’s peers were calm and restrained .
When studying animal behaviour , it is always important to avoid the trap of anthropomorphism , but one cannot help but draw comparisons between Rosie , Blossom and Chippie ’s actions and the responses of humans to peaceful death .
Pansy ’s final hours were documented by Alasdair Gillies , head keeper at Blair Drummond .
She started becoming lethargic in November and started receiving veterinary care .
Her fellow chimps seemed to know that something was up .
Instead , of sleeping on their usual platforms , they nested near her .
At 4 pm on December 7th , she started breathing erratically and laboriously and Gillies let the others join her .
They groomed her with unusual frequency in the 10 minutes before her death and afterwards , they seemed to test for life by inspecting her mouth and lifting her limbs .
More unusually , Chippie attacked Pansy ’s corpse on no less than three occasions ( see video below ) ;
Gillies thinks that he may have been trying to rouse her or expressing frustration or anger .
Blossom groomed her son for an extraordinary amount of time , perhaps an act of consolation or social support .
Rosie , meanwhile , stayed with her mother ’s body throughout the night , on a platform that she had never previously slept on .
All the three surviving chimps slept restlessly and the next morning , they were all subdued .
They removed straw from Pansy ’s body , ate less than normal , and watched silently as the keepers took Pansy away .
When they were allowed to return to the sleeping area , Blossom and Rosie did so hesistantly , but Chippy refused .
His alarm calls drew the other two back to the day area , where the trio spent the night .
For the following week , none of the chimps nested on the platform where Pansy died , even though all of them had frequently done so before .
Legendary primate researcher Frans de Waal says , " I have seen chimpanzees die in captive colonies , sometimes unexpectedly and sometimes after a long illness , and the reactions described here correspond with my experiences .
There is even a dramatic photograph that reached cyberspace . "
The tale of the African chimps , told by Dora Biro from the University of Oxford , differs in its details but has many parallels .
Vuavua paid such care to her dead baby that by the time she abandoned him , his body was largely intact albeit mummified .
Jire did the same , although she carried Jimato along for so long that his facial features were largely unrecognisable .
Did Jire and Vuavua know that their babies were dead ?
It ’s hard to say .
Certainly , they seemed to treat the corpses like live babies , at least for a few days .
Towards the end , they started carrying them in positions that they never use for healthy youngsters .
Other chimps touched , poked and sniffed the bodies , and lifted their immobile limbs .
Some of the other youngsters even carried them in bouts of play .
Even though the bodies ’ were starting to deform and smell intensely , only one of the chimps ever reacted in a way that looked like repulsion ( see video below ) .
Biro never saw a single act of aggression .
This is hardly the first time that a chimp mother has been seen carrying the mummified corpse of her baby ; the first such sighting was made in 1992 and was very similar to the latest ones .
De Waal says , " The carrying of dead infants by chimpanzee mothers is well known , and has also been reported for other primates , although never of such long duration .
68 days is longer than any previous report that I have seen ! "
He says that ape physiology drives an enormous attachment between mother and infant , that does n't rapidly shut down when the infant dies .
For example , a chimp ’s reproductive cycle grinds to a halt for four years after giving birth .
" It would also not be adaptive to abandon an infant every time it gets sick , " says de Waal .
" The best option is for mothers to keep hope and keep caring .
A rapid shutting down of attachment would be maladaptive : it might lead mothers of near - dead infants to abandon them prematurely . "
Why did Jire and Vuavua eventually let go ?
As their reproductive cycle restarted and all the associated hormonal changes kicked in , the mums could have been psychologically prepped to raise another generation .
The fact that Jire carried her dead child for longer than Vuavua may be because she had already had 7 previous children , while Vuavua was a first - time mother .
Both of these examples suggest that chimpanzees have a better awareness of death and dying that people have previously thought .
In many ways , this should n’t be surprising – these animals are self - aware and empathetic towards each other .
Another intellgent animal , the African elephant , also shows remarkably sophisticated behaviour on the death of their peers .
De Waal says , " I do n't think this is the same as what elephants do , which visit burial sites long after the death of a companion .
But I would n't be surprised if elephants also showed reactions like these ( minus the aggressive displays , which seem typically chimp ) to the actual death of another . "
Do chimps truly understand the concept of death ?
Based on the stories of Pansy , Jire and Vuavua , de Waal says , " Definitely , they seem to recognize the death of another , and perhaps realize that this is a permanent change , and a permanent loss .
This by itself is already very significant , and reports like these help us understand the depth of their understanding . "
But he also adds that we can't draw any conclusions about whether they understand their own mortality .
" To understand one 's own mortality would require extrapolating from what happens to others to one 's own situation .
We cannot rule this out , of course , but it would require another big mental jump and for the moment we have no way of knowing if species other than us have made this jump . "
In the meantime , James Anderson , who led the Scottish study , says that the work could affect the way that elderly chimps in zoos and research facilities are cared for .
It might , for example , be more humane to let the old - timers die naturally , surrounded by peers and familiar surroundings , than to resort to isolated treatment or euthanasia .

A new report launched by the Institute of Physics ( IOP ) Exoplanets -
The search for planets beyond our solar system explains how new technological advances have seen the discovery of more than 400 exoplanets to date , a number expected to rise to thousands in the next few years .
The report details how new techniques and instruments are providing growing observational evidence that our home galaxy - the Milky Way with its 100 billion stars - could contain millions of solar systems .
Discovering a distant exoplanet should be almost impossible but astronomers have used their understanding of physics , combined with sophisticated instrumentation and data analysis , to detect signals indicating the presence of a planet .
The first exoplanets were discovered in 1991 using radial velocity measurements , the detecting and measuring of the gravitational tug that expolanets exert on their parent stars , which causes the stars to wobble .
Other detection methods include transit observation ( measuring the dimming of a star 's brightness as a planet passes in front of it ) or nulling interferometry ( where light waves received by several telescopes are combined to give a proportionately higher - resolution image ) .
Today , direct detection of the visible and infrared light from giant planets in wide orbits is becoming increasingly possible .
In particular , UK researchers have been heavily involved in a new adaptive optics system , the Gemini Plant Imager , which will enable vastly more sensitive searches for fainter planets in closer orbits - and take us one step closer to discovering a second Earth .
Dr Robert Kirby - Harris , chief executive at IOP , said : " This report outlines exciting developments in detecting planets which might - just might - be able to support life in distant solar systems .
It provides yet another illustration of how the techniques and knowledge provided by physics which help us to further our understanding of the universe . "

In the latest scientific study to pin the blame for these kids today on everyone but their self - absorbed parents , the Journal Of Studies On Alcohol And Drugs has published findings that say children who are allowed to watch R- rated films are much more likely to start drinking at an early age .
According to the report , researchers who surveyed nearly 3,600 New England middle - school students over the course of two years discovered that “ 3 percent of the kids who said their parents never allowed them to watch R- rated movies said they had started drinking alcohol , compared with 19 percent of those who were sometimes allowed to watch R- rated movies and 25 percent of those who said they were allowed to watch such movies ‘ all the time . ’”
And as with most studies involving kids and their behavior , correlation naturally equals causation , with author Dr. James D. Sargent pointing out that his findings seem to support previous , similar studies that suggested exposure to “ adult content ” can also lead to drinking , smoking , sex at a young age , and violence .
Well , that 's ironclad then , is n't it ?
Of course , what it does not point out — as with most studies that try to explain kids ’ behavior using pop culture as a scapegoat , and we ca n’t believe we ’re still having this conversation in 2010 — is that kids who are “ allowed to watch R - rated movies all the time ” most likely have parents who are already fairly libertine about what their kids are doing , which means many of them ( say , 25 percent ) basically do whatever they want , including drinking underage — or , at least , bragging to some nerd scientist that they do .
Also not taken into consideration , as PopWatch points out :
The sweeping generalization that all R- rated movies are created the same , and that the “ change in personality ” they can jumpstart in impressionable young folk is always a bad thing ; imagine , for example , the sheltered lives being led by those kids who have been raised to think that all R- rated films are inherently immoral .
But then , we do n’t have a random polling of middle - school kids to quantify any of that , so science wins this round .

Former Vancouver NPA councillor Lynne Kennedy will never forget the chaos on Robson Street during the 1994 Stanley Cup riot .
In a phone interview with the Georgia Straight , she said “ alcohol fuelled the atmosphere ” , which culminated in hundreds of police officers clashing with hooligans throughout the night .
Contrast that with the “ family atmosphere ” of the 2010 Winter Olympics , Kennedy continued , and it is clear that the Vancouver Police Department was doing something right during the Games .
She said one strategy that proved effective in maintaining public order this past February was the early closure of liquor stores and shops selling beer and wine .
Located in the downtown core are six provincial liquor stores and many more private shops .
Dylan Palmer , a manager at Crosstown Liquor on Abbot Street , told the Straight that he estimated a 30 - percent loss in revenue for each day the VPD had his store close early .
But Palmer was quick to note that although the closures were bad for business , they were good for public safety .
He said he does n’t expect closures during the playoffs , and explained that for Canucks games , people buy their booze before the puck is dropped .
During the Olympics , it was different , Palmer continued , with people purchasing alcohol at all times of the day .
Seema Talwar , a manager at Jimmy ’s Cold Beer and Wine on Robson Street , told the Straight that the VPD ’s closures also cost her store “ quite a bit ” of money .
She said that although there are issues of public safety involved with the sale of liquor , it was her impression that people were well - behaved during the Olympics .
“ We are grownups , ” Talwar remarked .
“ I think we can handle this [ the sale of alcohol during major events ] . ”
She also noted that some of her staff could be living paycheque - to - paycheque , and expressed concern that more closures could hurt people ’s livelihoods .
VPD media spokesperson Const .
Lindsey Houghton said that before a closure is recommended , a complicated set of factors is weighed by a number of officers .
After this has occurred , VPD chief Jim Chu makes a final decision .
“ It is not one person sitting down and deciding on a whim , ” Houghton said .
“ We know that it is a bit of an imposition on businesses because , essentially , what we are doing is asking the GM of the LCLB to consider closing a business . ”
Houghton maintained that a recommendation of early liquor - store closures is a last option for the VPD .
Representatives of the Calgary , Edmonton , Toronto , Ottawa , and Montreal police departments told the Straight that they could n’t recall their agencies ever requesting early closure of liquor stores for major events .
How do you feel about the VPD warning of early liquor - store closures during the hockey playoffs ?
Ashley Fehr
Director of operations , Kwantlen Student Association “ I think they ’re kind of treating the people like children . ”
¦People will just get more alcohol earlier or they ’ll make sure they ’re drinking at home , but I do n’t think it really slows down any of the problems that they are seeing .
During the Olympics it might have helped , given that there were so many tourists in town , but when it comes to people who live in the area , they already have it on hand . ”
Gerald Thomas
Senior policy and research analyst , Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse “ I ’m happy they have a tool that they can use when they think they need it .
I trust the police to be able to determine when that ’s got to happen , right ?
On the other hand , it kind of bothers me that people are n’t responsible enough with their freedoms to keep themselves in check , and we have to have another rule . ”
Raymond Louie
Vision Vancouver city councillor “ I think it ’s important that the message be put out to the public that public consumption of alcohol should not happen and that everyone should have a good time during this playoff run in a responsible fashion .
If we act responsibly , we can recreate the fun and inspiring feeling we experienced during our Olympic Games , and I hope that everyone will agree with that . ”
Lynne Kennedy
Former NPA councillor , ex–Vancouver police board member , former chair of Vancouver liquor licensing commission “ It ’s worth a try .
I think back to the riot — the [ 1994 ]
Stanley Cup riot — part of that was fuelled by anger and possibly , you know , alcohol sales . ”
¦I think it ’s probably a good policy .
People liked the city during the Olympics .
They loved the family atmosphere .
They loved that .
It was kind of like , ” ˜Take back the downtown . ’
I think that was a good thing . ”

The FCC's National Broadband Plan , released today , calls for a new " minimal " fee on all U.S. broadband users to help pay for a new $ 16 billion nationwide emergency response wireless network .
Public safety officials have pleaded for such an interoperable network to aid their response to disasters and potential attacks since firefighters and police could not communicate effectively during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the response following Hurricane Katrina .
" If we do n't get the funding , this network wo n't be possible and following 9/11 and Katrina , we need the funding , " said Charles Werner , chief of the Charlottesville , Va. , fire department and chairman of the executive committee of Safecom , a public safety communications organization that works with the Department of Homeland Security .
" The key thing is to achieve a public interoperable network and this is a must .
Failure is not an option , " Werner said .
In its 19 - page section on public safety , the plan calls for creating the national wireless network for first responders and says that the cost of between $ 12 billion and $ 16 billion over 10 years could be paid with state and local contributions .
But the plan also argues for a " nominal " fee on all U.S. broadband users to " ensure that this country 's emergency responders have access to critical communications capabilities when and where they need them . "
The plan urges Congress to authorize the FCC to impose or require the fee or another funding means .
The plan adds : " It is essential that the United States establish a long - term , sustainable and adequate funding mechanism to help pay for the operation , maintenance and upgrade of the public safety broadband network . "
" America 's safety depends on it ...
Recognizing that Americans will obtain substantial benefits from the creation of this network , imposing a minimal public safety fee on all U.S. broadband users would be a fair , sustainable and reasonable funding mechanism , " the section reads .
Werner said he wanted to study the plan more thoroughly before reacting to the funding proposal and related measures .
In February , he said public safety officials were " disappointed " with the bare bones of the broadband plan presented at that time , because it called for a reserved portion of spectrum , known as the D block , to be auctioned off to private entities and shared with public safety groups who have wanted total control of the D block .
But today , Werner seemed to soften his earlier comment and said that since the FCC now wants the D block auctioned off , " we need to focus on the outcome of how we can achieve the network . "
Another element in the plan calls on the FCC to consider designating LTE technology as the standard that would be used for the public safety network in the 700 MHz band .
" [ Having LTE as ] a consistent air interface creates a greater likelihood of interoperability between the public safety and commercial D block networks , " the plan says .
" [ LTE ] will facilitate roaming between networks to improve coverage and access for public safety and commercial customers ... and encourage a larger number of potential users . "
However , some have criticized using LTE , including Michael Jude , an analyst at Stratecast , a division of Frost & Sullivan .
The biggest drawback to LTE is that it wo n't be widespread for years and requires cell towers to be fairly close compared to some other wireless standards " which probably would n't work well for many first responder situations , " he said .
Jude said that with so many federal dollars under scrutiny for other programs , it makes more sense for public safety groups to rely upon multiple frequency - capable handsets for interoperability in emergencies .
Such handsets equipped with Communication Electronic Operations Instructions , a kind of flow chart , " would solve most interoperability problem at very low to no cost at the local level , " Jude said .
The broadband plan also calls for several federal agencies to oversee the public safety network , including a new Emergency Response Interoperability Center ( ERIC ) .
ERIC would oversee public safety wireless network standards and assist another new , unnamed , agency in giving grants to public safety groups .

HONOLULU ( AP )  Hawaii is a step closer to joining a small group of other states in allowing same - sex civil unions .
In a move that still needs the governor 's signature to become law , the House of Representatives Thursday night approved a measure that has drawn some of the state 's biggest protest rallies .
Republican Gov. Linda
Lingle has n't said whether she 'll reject it or sign it into law but her office said later that she will carefully review the bill .
The House voted 31 - 20 in favor of the legislation , which had been stalled but was unexpectedly revived on the last day of this year 's legislative session .
The Senate passed it in January .
The measure would grant gay and lesbian couples the same rights and benefits that the state provides to married couples .
If approved , Hawaii will become one of six states along with California , Nevada , New Jersey , Oregon and Washington to grant essentially all the rights of marriage to same - sex couples without authorizing marriage itself .
Five other states and the District of Columbia permit same - sex marriage : Iowa , Vermont , New Hampshire , Massachusetts and Connecticut .
The Aloha State has been a battleground in the gay rights movement since the early 1990s .
A 1993 Hawaii Supreme Court ruling nearly made Hawaii the first state to legalize same - sex marriage before voters in the state overwhelmingly approved the nation 's first " defense of marriage " constitutional amendment in 1998 .
The measure gave the Legislature the power to reserve marriage to opposite - sex couples .
It resulted in a law banning gay marriage in Hawaii but left the door open for civil unions .
This year the issue has proven divisive in Hawaii with religious groups arguing that civil unions are a step toward legalizing same - sex marriage .
During one of the biggest ever state rallies , several thousand people protesting the measure rode buses to the Hawaii Capitol last year following Sunday church services .
The gay and lesbian community urged lawmakers to act on their principles rather than back down in the face of public pressure from opponents threatening to vote them out of office .
Civil - union supporters wearing rainbow - colored leis , or flower necklaces , jumped and screamed for joy outside the House chamber following the vote .
" Hawaii is the Aloha State , and this vote shows that the greater community has love and acceptance for everyone , " said supporter Van Law .
Disappointed civil union opponents wearing red " iVote " buttons as a warning to legislators this election season quickly departed the Hawaii Capitol , with only a few lagging behind .
" Civil unions are a step down the very slippery slope toward legalizing same - sex marriage , " said Rachel Nakasaki , a Christian who believes traditional marriage between a man and a woman should be preserved .
Hawaii 's civil union legislation appeared to be dead in January , when the House did n't take a vote on the measure and postponed it indefinitely out of fears that Lingle would veto .
The issue was revived Thursday after every other bill introduced this year had been acted on .
Democratic House Majority Leader Blake Oshiro made the motion to reconsider the bill , although the House fell three votes short of the two - thirds majority needed to override the governor .
The bill was written so that civil unions would be available to both same - sex and opposite - sex couples to avoid claims of discrimination .
" Equality feels really good , " said Suzanne King , who said Hawaii would recognize her Massachusetts marriage to her partner as a civil union if the bill becomes law .
" It allows us to strengthen our family . "
If Lingle vetoes the bill , it 's unlikely lawmakers would return to the Capitol to try to override her .
They lack enough votes , and it's an election year where legislators are hesitant to take stands on contentious social issues unless they 're forced to , as they were during Thursday 's roll - call vote .
" I 'm looking forward to not coming back , " said Democratic Speaker of the House Calvin Say .

The SNCF said it was practising emergency procedures
By Emma Jane Kirby
BBC News , Paris
The French railway operator , SNCF , has mistakenly put a dramatic statement on its website saying more than 100 people had died in a train explosion .
The false announcement , of an explosion in Macon in the Burgundy region , was part of a training exercise .
It was only when journalists began flooding the railway operator 's phone lines that the company realised there had been an enormous error .
A real SNCF statement later firmly said that the accident had never happened .
The message , which appeared on the SNCF website shortly after 1100 ( 1000 GMT ) , stated that following an explosion on a high - speed TGV train on the Paris to Dijon line , 102 people had been confirmed dead , while 380 people had been injured .
During an in - house training exercise in which staff were asked to respond to a massive rail accident , a staff member had accidentally posted details of the pretend scenario on the official website .
In a statement about the misunderstanding , SNCF explained that it was obliged to practise its emergency procedures for the safety of its passengers .

“ Geckos have millions of microscopic hairs on their toes , each with hundreds of tips that adhere to surfaces , with no residue left behind , ” said Kellar Autumn , a biology professor at Lewis & Clark College in Portland , Ore .
“ Their hairs can stay attached indefinitely . ”
Mr. Autumn and scientists at the University of California , Berkeley , were responsible for the research that enabled Mark Cutkosky , a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford , to develop a prototype for a tape based on gecko adhesion .
The tape , which is reusable , was so strong , Mr. Autumn said , that when they tested it , he was able to stick his 50 - pound , 8 - year - old daughter to a window with it .
That was a little more than two years ago ; there are now at least 50 patent applications pending in gecko - adhesion technology , Mr. Autumn said , and he holds several patents himself .
Here 's some quick perspective on the commodities market thus far in 2010 .
The outlook for many economically - driven commodities has brightened as global growth continues .
Prices have gone on a tear .
Yet gold , which is n't driven by any significant source of economic use , has been left in the dust by them .
It 's up only 5.4 % on the year , whereas these others are doing better .
Early this morning AMD officially launched its first six - core Thuban processors : the Phenom II X6 1090T and 1055T .
The last thing we would dream of doing is complain about pricing on these parts .
AMD is selling you almost a billion transistors for $ 199 or $ 285 depending on what clock speed you want .
AMD just sent us word that the pricing story gets even better .
TigerDirect is running a $ 50 mail in rebate on the new X6 processors dropping the price down to $ 149.99 and $ 249.99 for the 1055T and 1090T , respectively .
While we 're not huge fans of mail in rebates , if you 're fine with getting a check in the mail sometime later then you honestly can't beat these deals .
At $ 149.99 there simply is no answer to AMD's Phenom II X6 1055T .
Update :
The deal is dead , congrats to those who got in .
Most transparent White House ever ...
Police chased reporters away from the White House and closed Lafayette Park today in response to a gay rights protest in which several service members in full uniform handcuffed themselves to the White House gate to protest " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell . "
People who have covered the White House for years tell me that 's an extremely unusual thing to do in an area that regularly features protests .
A reporter can be seen in the YouTube video above calling the move " outrageous " and " ridiculous . "
UPDATE : U.S. Park Police spokesman David Schlosser tells POLITICO his service erred in pushing the reporters back , and stressed that the White House played no role in the move .
" That was strictly the U.S. Parks Police that screwed up – that has nothing to do with the Secret Service of the White House or the Administration , " said Sergeant Schlosser .
" We had some young officers who , when they were told to move the people back -- which we typically do when we 're going to make arrests - they moved the people back a lot further than we typically do .
That was a rookie , amateur error and they screwed up on that . "

April 1 , 2010  --
Hot Bird 8 may be Europe 's largest and most powerful television satellite , but it still has little chance when the Iranian regime decides to block its signals .
When that happens , the Farsi services of the BBC and Voice of America instantly disappear from television screens -- and not just in Iran , but also throughout the satellite 's entire coverage area .
Tehran has targeted the satellite in an effort to prevent critical foreign media coverage from reaching domestic viewers .
Even though the United Nations has condemned it as an act of sabotage , the international community can do little to stop it .
The Arabic service of the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle was also affected by the attacks on Hot Bird 8 .
" We experienced disruptions in December and February , " Deutsche Welle spokesman Johannes Hoffmann told SPIEGEL ONLINE .
" A total of over 30 hours of programming was affected . "
Hoffmann believes the attacks were a " targeted act to block news coverage " on Iran .
For example , he noted , there were problems in February during celebrations marking the anniversary of the Iranian revolution .
No Accident
France - based satellite provider Eutelsat , which operates Hot Bird 8 , also believes the jamming attempts are deliberate .
" This is not happening by accident , " says Eutelsat spokeswoman Vanessa O'Connor .
The latest attempt to block the satellite occurred on March 20 , according to the BBC and Voice of America .
Indeed , it would seem that it is often surprisingly easy for the regime in Tehran to suppress information from abroad .
Although Hot Bird 8 is in geostationary orbit about 36,000 kilometers ( 22,400 miles ) above the Earth , it can be easy to sabotage , something which is also true for many other satellites .
The Iranians only need to transmit a strong signal in the satellite 's direction using the same frequency with which programs are transmitted from the original ground transmission station .
In the case of Deutsche Welle , the so - called uplink is sent from a ground station in Usingen , in the German state of Hesse .
" The satellite cannot , however , determine whether the signal is coming from Usingen or from Tehran , " says Deutsche Welle chief engineer Horst Scholz .
If in doubt , he explains , the satellite chooses the stronger signal , which allows it to be deceived by the interference coming from Iran .
Signals from Tehran
That is apparently exactly what happened to Hot Bird 8 .
Eutelsat 's employees were easily able to detect the jamming signals -- with their constant amplitude , constant frequency and high power -- on their monitors , but they could not do anything about them .
Using a special software package called SatID , they were also able to identify the source of the signals : Tehran .
The satellite operator then informed the French telecommunication regulator Agence Nationale des Fréquences ( ANFR ) about the signals .
The ANFR sent a four - page fax , which has been obtained by SPIEGEL ONLINE , to the Iranians regarding the issue .
A copy of the complaint was also sent to the Radio Regulations Board of the UN's International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) .
The 12 - member board meets regularly in Geneva .
Its meetings typically focus on highly technical issues , with the experts discussing problems related to frequency interference .
In fact , given the paucity of free frequences these days , incidents of interference are not uncommon .
Still , targeted disruptions are rare , though there had already been complaints about Iran in the summer of 2009 .
This time around , the UN experts were unusually outspoken , at least by their standards .
In a statement issued last Friday , the board " urged " Tehran to " continue its effort in locating the source of interference ( of the Eutelsat satellite ) and to eliminate it as a matter of the highest priority . "
The Iranians had previously protested their innocence , saying they knew nothing about any jamming attempts , and they assured the board that they would look into the matter as quickly as possible .
Appeal to Goodwill
The issue is also likely to play a role at the next meetings of the International Telecommunication Union .
But , in practice , the UN can do little against the jammers .
" In such cases , the ITU Radio Regulations Board appeals to the goodwill and mutual assistance of its member states to find a solution and prevent the occurrence of harmful interference of radio signals , " ITU spokesman Sanjay Acharya told SPIEGEL ONLINE .
But it is doubtful whether Tehran is interested in cooperating .
Likewise , since the European Union lacks the political will to block Iranian TV broadcasts as a countermeasure , there is no speedy solution to the problem in sight .
" These things take time , " says Eutelsat 's Vanessa O'Connor .
" We have the patience to accept that . "
In the meantime , the satellite operator has changed how some of its services are distributed .
The channels affected thusfar are now transmitted via other satellites that can broadcast to the entire Gulf region , but without being reachable by uplinks from Iran .
Not all the channels on Hot Bird 8 have been affected by the electronic sabotage , however .
The state broadcaster Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting also transmits its Press TV foreign service from Hot Bird 8 .
So far , it has not experienced any problems .
No , the health insurance reform is n't perfect .
But it is better than what we 've had .
Late last week , hundreds of ignorant Tea Party morons were as ecstatic as pigs in a Dumpster full of stale doughnuts .
Bart Stupak , the Michigan congressman who cast a difficult vote to make health care reform reality , was stepping down !
" That 'll show 'em ! " the know - nothings cried .
How dare Stupak vote to provide all Americans a chance to have health care insurance !
Fanatic anti-abortion protesters were happy too .
Never mind that Stupak may be the most anti-abortion Democrat in Congress .
Never mind that he only voted for health care after President Obama signed an executive order declaring it illegal to use any federal funds for abortion .
No , the Christian nutball universe saw this principled man as having sold out to baby - killers .
His courageous act was denounced by people calling themselves good Roman Catholics — who remained silent about revelations that their pope , the onetime " unenthusiastic " Hitler Youth member Joey Ratzinger , helped cover up and protect child molesters before he became CEO of the church of the pederasts .
The wacky Catholics are in a class by themselves .
The Tea Partiers , some of whom packed three buses that careened state to state , seemed less interested in abortion .
They were fixated on the crackpot idea that Stupak had expanded big government by voting to require people buy health care from private insurers , thus giving capitalism many new customers .
Ever since the vote , they had been attacking Stupak , a Democrat from Menominee who has been elected — easily — nine times in a district that usually has elected Republicans .
Ironically , he got it from both sides .
When he first said he could n't support the health care bill without changes , liberals savaged him .
Maureen Dowd wrote in The New York Times that " we might have to bang Bart 's head into a blackboard a few times . "
Michael Moore said Stupak had " neither a uterus nor a brain . "
None of that swayed Bart Stupak a bit .
Indeed , he still seems to be far more authentic than most congressmen .
Now 58 , he was a cop and a state trooper who put himself through law school .
He served a term in the state House , and then got elected to Congress , beating a much - better known and better - funded opponent .
He 's won easily since .
His people know him .
And those who 've gotten closer to his district than a TV studio knew there was little reason to think he was in serious trouble , despite his health care vote .
Nor is there any indication that his voters were upset by an ethics complaint brought against him by a government watchdog group that 's alleging he received discount housing in a Washington , D.C. boarding house connected to a secretive Christian group known as " The Family . "
Most of his constituents know that Stupak wo n't even accept the cushy health plan congressmen can get .
Instead , he pays for his own , through a plan offered to former state employees .
He needs it too ; an injury chasing a crook in his police days has meant he 's suffered through many knee operations .
Indeed , my guess is that the bused - in blowhards of the Tea Party Express would actually have helped him at home .
Yoopers do n't much like strangers telling them what to do .
In fact , they might have asked embarrassing questions of the Tea Partiers , questions the national media might have asked if they had been doing their jobs .
Such as , " Who paid for these folks to go tell people in other states how to vote ? "
" Do any of them have jobs ? "
Reportedly , the organizer of the tour offered Stupak $ 700,000 to quit his job , before the congressman decided not to run for re-election .
Was that a serious offer ?
Does that constitute a thinly veiled offer to bribe a federal official ?
And in any event , who is putting up that kind of money ?
There have been lots of reports that the Tea Party protesters are a sad collection of angry and undereducated people who are actually being manipulated and used by various big - money right - wing interest groups .
There are also signs they are n't really typical independent voters , as their self - appointed spokesmen tend to claim .
A Quinnipiac University poll found that 77 percent of them had voted for John McCain .
Nearly all were white ; 74 percent identified themselves as Republican or GOP - leaning .
Meanwhile , the admittedly liberal Talking Points Memo has shown that the Political Action Committee ( PAC ) behind the Tea Party Express , directed almost two thirds of its funding to the Republican - affiliated political consulting firm that created the committee in the first place !
The sign - waving screamers are , then , at best only a pawn in somebody else 's game .
Yet are n't they a potent political force ?
Did n't they , after all , knock off Stupak ?
Their so - called leaders clearly think so .
According to The New York Times , one yelled out in Escanaba , " Let that be a warning to the rest of the rats on the U.S.S. Marx ! "
The facts are much different .
Actually , they may not have had anything to do with Stupak 's decision not to run for re-election .
While he seemed burned - out after the nasty health care battle , there were lots of earlier indications that he was thinking about stepping down .
He had n't been raising money , for one thing .
He had been telling friends he was tired .
Besides going back and forth to Washington , Stupak 's district is one of the geographically largest east of the Mississippi — bigger than West Virginia .
( All districts must have the same number of people , and northern Michigan is sparsely populated . )
Unfortunately , he made his announcement just when the crazies were careening though his district .
Ten years from now , Stupak will still be the man who cast a difficult and honest vote that helped millions of Americans get health care for the first time .
The Tea Party Movement will be lucky to be in Trivial Pursuit .

Reflections on a lost war :
Thirty - five years ago this spring , North Vietnam launched its final assault against a nation that had been our client state for years .
But with the U.S. Army gone , South Vietnam folded like a pup tent in weeks .
Older Americans ( me ) still recall the appalling TV images of helicopters on the roof of the U.S. embassy , as hundreds of diplomats and their panicked Vietnamese allies fought to get aboard .
For the first time in history , we had lost a war .
For years , most of the nation wanted to forget — but hundreds of thousands of Michigan veterans of that conflict do n't deserve to be forgotten .
Last year I wrote about how the Vietnam Veterans of America , Detroit Chapter 9 , were fighting to make a memorial park next to their building on Woodward north of Temple .
On Saturday , May 1 , they and the Vietnamese American Association of Michigan are holding a ceremony to honor the people of both nations , and to mark the end of this nation 's longest war .
Things get under way a little before noon at the park , and , if you ever wanted to learn more about Vietnam , or want to honor someone who served , you ought to go .
The war was a mistake , but it was n't the fault of the 2,654 Michigan soldiers who followed orders and who as a result died there .
Nor can we blame their comrades , thousands of whom who were physically and psychologically scarred for life .
They deserve to be remembered , and this day .

Remember the $ 200 smartbook reference design that we saw at CES this year ?
Well , it 's back , it 's holding on to that same price and 7 - inch enclosure , but this time it 's also showing off an expanded OS compatibility .
Adapting the open source Chromium OS and another Linux variant to the ARM architecture of the prototype device was apparently not much of a hurdle for Freescale , who has an Android option in the works as well and claims to be just optimizing and enhancing the user experience at this point .
Presumably one of the enhancements will be the installation of a capacitive touchscreen as the present demonstration requires either a mouse and keyboard or a resistive torture test to operate , but we 'll accept the company 's explanation that this is just a proof of concept and not the final product .
Slide past the break to see some HTML5 video running on this bargain bin tablet , and hope that your friendly neighborhood OEM picks these designs up for some retail action .
It was a silent call to arms : an easy - to - overlook message urging New Jersey students to take a stand against the budget cuts that threaten class sizes and choices as well as after - school activities .
But some 18,000 students accepted the invitation posted last month on Facebook , the social media site better known for publicizing parties and sporting events .
And on Tuesday many of them — and many others — walked out of class in one of the largest grass - roots demonstrations to hit New Jersey in years .
The protest disrupted classroom routines and standardized testing in some of the state ’s biggest and best - known school districts , offering a real - life civics lesson that unfolded on lawns , sidewalks , parking lots and football fields .
The mass walkouts were inspired by Michelle Ryan Lauto , an 18 - year - old aspiring actress and a college freshman , and came a week after voters rejected 58 percent of school district budgets put to a vote across the state ( not all districts have a direct budget vote ) .
“ All I did was make a Facebook page , ” said Ms. Lauto , who graduated last year from Northern Valley Regional High School in Old Tappan , N.J. “ Anyone who has an opinion could do that and have their opinion heard .
I would love to see kids in high school step up and start their own protests and change things in their own way . ”

Gee , what a shock - the country which is most on the hook should Greece blow up is now issuing ultimatums .
What is funnier is that the object of the ultimatum is none other than France wartime buddy Germany .
From Reuters : " The European Union must immediately implement its previously agreed 30 billion euro ( $ 39.96 billion ) aid package for debt - stricken Greece , French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said on Wednesday .
" We must immediately put in place the 30 billion euros , " Fillon told France 's lower house of parliament .
He added he had " no doubt " that German Chancellor Angela Merkel would adopt the same position as France , concerning Greece . "
France has about 75 billion reasons to be terrified that Germany will leave it in the dust .
Hey Birnbaum : we are better buyers of French CDS in size .
We do n't care if Goldman is on the other side of the trade .
Wonder why France is so terrified ?
Here is your answer : exposure by countries to Greece .

Temperature records gleaned from clamshells reveal accuracy of Norse sagas .
Mussels could yield a more accurate temperature record than trees .
Alamy
Oxygen isotopes in clamshells may provide the most detailed record yet of global climate change , according to a team of scientists who studied a haul of ancient Icelandic molluscs .
Most measures of palaeoclimate provide data on only average annual temperatures , says William Patterson , an isotope chemist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon , Canada , and lead author of the study1 .
But molluscs grow continually , and the levels of different oxygen isotopes in their shells vary with the temperature of the water in which they live .
The colder the water , the higher the proportion of the heavy oxygen isotope , oxygen - 18 .
The study used 26 shells obtained from sediment cores taken from an Icelandic bay .
Because clams typically live from two to nine years , isotope ratios in each of these shells provided a two - to - nine - year window onto the environmental conditions in which they lived .
Patterson 's team used a robotic sampling device to shave thin slices from each layer of the shells ' growth bands .
These were then fed into a mass spectrometer , which measured the isotopes in each layer .
From those , the scientists could calculate the conditions under which each layer formed .
" What we 're getting to here is palaeoweather , " Patterson says .
" We can reconstruct temperatures on a sub - weekly resolution , using these techniques .
For larger clams we could do daily . "
It 's an important step in palaeoclimatic studies , he says , because it allows scientists to determine not only changes in average annual temperatures , but also how these changes affected individual summers and winters .
" We often make the mistake of saying that mean annual temperature is higher or lower at some period of time , " Patterson says .
" But that is relatively meaningless in terms of the changes in seasonality . "

Patterson , W. P. et al , PNAS
For example , in early Norse Iceland — part of the 2,000 - year era spanned by the study — farmers were dependent on dairy farming and agriculture .
" For a dairy culture , summer is by far the most important , " he says .
" A one - degree decrease in summer temperatures in Iceland results in a 15 % decrease in agricultural yield .
If that happens two years in a row , your family 's wiped out . "
Technically , the molluscs record water temperatures , not air temperatures .
But the two are closely linked — specially close to the shore , where most people lived .
" So , when the water temperatures are up , air temperatures are up .
When water temperatures are down , air temperatures are down , " Patterson says .
Lean times
One of Patterson 's goals was to verify assertions in historical Icelandic sagas describing the weather .
Because these sagas include dispatches to the king back in Norway , there was an incentive to exaggerate .
" If you 're having a bad year , you 're not expected to provide as much in the way of tribute or taxes , " Patterson explains .
The study 's findings suggest that the sagas are reasonably accurate .
In the 1000s , for example , the ' Book of Settlements ' — a medieval manuscript containing details of Iceland 's settlements — reports a famine so severe " men ate foxes and ravens " and " the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs " , Patterson says .
And according to his shells , it was indeed a difficult era , with summer water temperatures peaking at only 5 – 6 °C , down from as high as 7.5 –9.5 °C around 100 years earlier .
The mollusc - based temperature record for Iceland suggests Norse sagas can be trusted .
Mary Evans Picture Library
Patterson 's data also reveal a number of climate changes recorded by historians , including a Roman - era warming period , a cold snap in the Dark Ages and a subsequent period of warming , during which the Vikings discovered Iceland .
But it 's not just historians who will be interested .
The new data will help climate modellers to improve their understanding of seasonal effects in the North Atlantic , Patterson says .
" This is a new line of evidence . "
Other scientists are impressed .
" The technique is fascinating , " says geoscientist Richard Alley of Pennsylvania State University in University Park .
" This represents a huge amount of work , and demonstrates outstanding potential for revealing past processes in unprecedented detail .
One can envision a tree - ring - like continuous history , given a lot more effort . "
If he can find the funding , that is exactly what Patterson would like to establish next .
" We have what may be the world 's oldest clam , " he says , " that might give a continuous record going back 400 years . "
He also wants to push the study back towards the end of the last ice age .
" We have 11,000 years worth of material , " he says .
Police have charged a couple with " theft by finding " after they forked out a few dollars for a second - hand suitcase at a Melbourne Salvation Army Store that had up to $ 100,000 hidden in its lining .
The suitcase was donated to the Salvos in Beaconsfield by a woman who did not know her husband had hidden the cash in the bag 's lining .
The distraught man contacted the Salvation Army last Tuesday in a bid to retrieve the suitcase but it had already been sold , Salvation Army spokesman Major Brad Halse said .
" He said his family had cleaned out a room and donated some goods .
One of the items was a suitcase with a very significant amount of money in it , " Major Halse said .
" I guess sometimes people store things of value in unusual places . "
The more I think about all the pixels that have been spilt over Glenn Beck ’s comments on churches that preach “ social justice , ” the more I think we ’ve been had .
( And yes , I bit , too , so that makes me equally guilty . )
For one thing , Beck ’s hardly the first right - winger to attack the tradition of social justice .
Personally , I think charging the mainline churches with being in bed with the Sandinistas is much more creative than anything Beck has come up with .
For another , Beck is just using the same routine perfected by the likes of Ann Coulter , Pat Robertson , and Fred “ God Hates Fags ” Phelps :
Say something stupid , outrageous , or outrageously stupid .
Wait for predictable liberal reaction .
Make sure the papers spell your name right .
Profit !
It ’s attention - seeking , in other words .
In Fred Phelps ’ case , it ’s done for no better reason than to hurt people .
The rest of them do it to raise money and / or sell books .
The remarkable thing about all of this is not that they do it , since it works .
It ’s that they keep throwing the chum in the water , and we keep snapping it up .
Which makes them , yes , master baiters .
The rest of us are just chumps .
Do n’t take the bait , please .
Ignore Glenn Beck and do n’t buy crappy products from his crappy sponsors .
Eventually he ’ll change his tune .
Maybe he ’ll even go away .
The following blog post is mainly targeted at plasma - devel subsribers and I expect possible discussion to take place there .
I just published it here , because I needed an easy way to host images and then I thought I could also post the entire text here for a broader audience to see . 😉
While my task within KDE is mainly to translate K3b , I see myself as a usability geek as well .
So while cycling through parks in my hometown and enjoying the spring weather , I thought about improving the netbook experience .
And while I continued to think about it Plasma applets I already know exist and how they could be incorporated and refined .
I also remembered using classic Mac OS which featured a pointer - based GUI that was targeted at screens that have roughly the same proportions as today ’s netbooks .
I have to add that I do n’t know how in what shape Plasma Netbook in current trunk is , so my suggestions may even already be obsolete .
I also lack any talent to code , so obviously I ’m hoping for an actual programmer to pick up my ideas .
So , enough introduction talk .
Let ’s get started .
First , here is a screenshot of Plasma Netbook from SC 4.4 showing the " Search and Launch " page :
Plasma Netbook how it looks today
Page
One displays various Plasma applets in an aligned way .
So overall I think this screenshot is pretty self explanatory .
One aspect is worth pointing out :
How task switching currently works .
You click on the Running Apps " button " and get an Exposé view of all open windows .
This IMHO has some drawbacks .
A. ) it requires compositing ( not available to everyone ) and B. ) totally breaks down if many windows are open .
Well , classic Mac OS had a simple drop - down list of running apps .
Hardly fancy , but worked really well , so this is what I came up with :
Plasma Netbook mockup :
No active app
I moved clock and tray to the far right where IMO it ’s expected by many users anyway .
" Show all windows " triggers the Exposé effect , so no functionality is lost .
The menu could also be assigned to a keyboard shortcut .
When an application runs , the top bar changes :
Plasma Netbook mockup : App active
On the left side is still the app switcher , but now also featuring the options to hide or quit the app ( Quit and Show All maybe should switch positions ) .
The button title switches to the app name to indicate what ’s running .
The pages bar is changed to the app ’s menu bar .
Plasma Netbook works in a similar fashion already , but by simply launching apps in full screen and hiding the window decoration .
My proposal should look better esp. if smoothly transitioned from pages bar to menu bar ( eg. using a slide effect ) .
A similar menu bar is already implemented by Bespin ’s XBar applet .
Another approach seems to be in development .
On the far left side , window control buttons move clock and tray .
I figured that in this case it ’s more important to keep users ’ muscle memory for window operations intact rather than tray interaction .
The window controls are what we are all used to :
Minimize / Hide — Unmaximize — Close .
It can be argued that netbook users should run their application always in full screen anyway , but this would effectively kill the usage of multi- window apps .
I also saw several people connect bigger screens at home to their netbooks .
An unmaximized window can more easily be moved to the other screen .
That feature is also already developed .
Any comments ( praise , insults , volunteering coders ) should be send to plasma - devel .

THE AFGHAN CONFLICT .
A MAP OF POSSIBLE SCENARIOS
Afghanistan - A country of conflict
Since the terroristic attack on the World Trade Center on september 11th , 2001 and the following invasion by the Allied forces in Afghanistan in order to fight the Taliban regime and Al - Quaida , the Western countries are involved in an ongoing conflict which seems never to stop .
The situation in 2010
After nine years of war the situation still remains unstable .
The set up afghan government turns out to be corrupt and more and more people are dying on both sides .
Which again provides radical Islamist groups an even better and stronger breeding ground for their resistance .
The two paths : Stay or Leave ?
What shall we do ?
Pull out the troops , because this war can't be won , but risk lots of blood in another civil war , and maybe a much worse and more dangerous scenario ?
Or shall we stay and take the risk of being trapped in a never - ending conflict , which will cost a huge amount of money , blood and tears .
A Map of Scenarios
When we started researching this topic we very quickly saw , that the debate whether to pull out the troops , staying or even enforcing is not too much about arguments , it ’s a battle of possible scenarios .
Every side seems to have their own positive and negative visions of how things will happen in the future if certain steps are done .
The resulting map The Afghan Conflict - A Map of Possible Scenarios is the attempt of a summary of the most popular possible scenarios around the afghan conflict , according to a pullout or stay of the Allied troops .
And is based on interviews with journalists , politicians and political foundations .
Please notice that our goal was never to display the full consequences in every detail because in such a complex process and especially when you try to make future predictions this is never possible .
But we do give an overview about the main problematics and its complexity .

The Concept
The Afghan Conflict - A Map of Possible Scenarios starts with the current timeline , a single line on the map .
Which then splits into more and more possible future scenarios currently discussed .
The scenarios split and join , or lead to other ones according to events that may take place or decisions made .
The design is pure and minimalistic , using only lines and typographic elements , which does not resemble the ugliness of a war , but helps understanding a complex structure of problems without being visually manipulated by polemic images .

A computer security researcher has launched a project designed to provide people greater privacy when using Google , as the company expands the scope of data its collects about its users .
The project , called GoogleSharing , is a Firefox add - on that uses an anonymous proxy service that gives Google false information when someone uses services that do n't require an account , such as its search , news , and images services , said Moxie Marlinspike , a security consultant and penetration tester with the Institute of Disruptive Studies .
Google collects a vast amount of information about its users , said Marlinspike , who gave a presentation at last week 's Black Hat conference .
The company collects IP ( Internet protocol ) addresses , search requests , browser type and more .
Google as well as other major search companies have taken steps to allay concerns over data collection , such as anonymizing parts of IP addresses held in their records after certain periods of time .
But Google dictates how it anonymizes information that could potentially be collated later to profile a user , Marlinspike said .
With IP addresses , for example , Google anonymizes the last octet of the address after nine months , Marlinspike said .
Some privacy advocates argue that does not go far enough .
Google also uses cookies , or data files stored by a browser , to associate search queries with a particular installation of a browser on a given computer .
" The main problem is that they [ Google ] have a lot of data , " Marlinspike said .
" They do record everything .
Forever .
In many ways , the information they have probably paints a more complete picture of you than even your best friend would know . "
So Marlinspike built GoogleSharing , an add - on for Firefox .
When it is enabled , GoogleSharing detects when someone is using a Google service that does n't need a login .
If it 's a search request , for example , GoogleSharing then strips the request of its cookie .
The search request is encrypted and sent to a customized proxy server .
" You get SSL [ secure sockets layer ] protection on your local area network for Google services that normally do n't provide https :// access , " Marlinspike said .
The proxy server then assigns a different yet valid Google cookie to the request and washes the requests of its original HTTP headers .
The request is then sent to Google , Marlinspike said .
Google returns the answer to the proxy server , which is then passed on to the client .
There are other anonymizing services that provide a greater degree of privacy protection such as The Onion Router ( TOR ) , Marlinspike said .
TOR should be used for high - value searches , he said .
But TOR is " painfully slow , " Marlinspike said .
Since TOR also strips out HTTP headers , Google may treat the request as an attempt to abuse its services , displaying a CAPTCHA ( Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart ) that a person must solve and respond to before it will deliver search results .
That can disrupt a person 's productivity .
GoogleSharing is fast , transparent and does n't interrupt someone 's workflow , Marlinspike said .
With GoogleSharing , " what you 're trying to protect are your searches ... that are only valuable in aggregate that paint a really big picture of who you are , " Marlinspike said .
Anyone can run a GoogleSharing proxy server .
Although those running one of those proxies would have access to the same information Google would have received , " those that are running a GoogleSharing proxy server are in a much worse position than Google to make use of that information , " Marlinspike said .
If enough people run GoogleSharing proxies , queries could be distributed among all of the proxies , further diluting the information pool .
The add - on can also be configured to use a specific proxy , he said .
" Your intent in using Google is not actually to share information with them , " Marlinspike said .
" When you 're using Google you 're not actually trying to give them your personal information .
You 're just trying to make use of the services . "
Google did not have an immediate comment , although the company explains on its privacy pages that it keeps search engine data such as queries in order to improve the service and for the security of its systems .
Google introduced a dashboard in November 2009 that lets users see and manage some of the data that the company holds .
But users must have an account to access that panel , and it does n't show other information the company may have collected .

The female condom was redesigned and relaunched in the US
Washington DC will become the first city in the US to make female condoms available for free , the Washington Post has reported .
The contraceptives will be handed out in beauty salons , convenience stores and high schools in areas with high rates of HIV / Aids infection .
Male condoms have long been handed out but infection rates remain high among Washington 's black residents .
Female condoms have been on sale since 1993 but take - up has been slow .
The initial version of the contraceptive was judged by US customers to be too expensive .
However , a new version now being used in countries including South Africa , Brazil , and Indonesia will be distributed in Washington DC and offered for sale in pharmacies alongside male condoms .
Cutting edge
" Anywhere male condoms are available , female condoms will be available , " Shannon Hader , director of the city 's HIV / AIDS administration , told the Washington Post .
" We 're trying to make every effort count to build on what already exists ... to expand options rather than limit them . "
HIV / Aids infection is the leading cause of death for black women aged 25 - 34 in the US .
A 2008 report showed Washington DC's HIV / Aids rate at 3 % , or about 15,100 adults , the Post reported .
March 15 , 2010  --
The fiancee of accused Yale murderer Ray Clark is standing by her man , visiting him regularly in jail , even as she has become a subject of the homicide investigation .
A search warrant released today stated that detectives sought a DNA sample from Clark 's fiancee Jennifer Hromadka because they had " probably cause " to believe her DNA would be found on bloody items stuffed in a wall along with the body of 24 - year - old Yale researcher Annie Le .
The lawyer for Hromadka told ABCNews.com that she is still supporting Clark and that the results from the DNA tests ordered by the state prosecutor 's office in November have still not been released .
" As far as I know , they are still together , " said criminal lawyer Robert Berke .
" And we are waiting , just like every one else , for results [ of the DNA test ] . "
Berke said that Hromadka has been visiting Clark in prison but is not sure how recently she has been to see him .
Asked whether his client is concerned about the results of the DNA test , Berke said , " She is not worried . "
It is not unusual , said Berke , for results of DNA comparisons to take months due to a backlog at the state 's forensic laboratory .
According to a search warrant released today , DNA found on a lanyard that attached to Hromadka 's university key card was found on a pen and a bloody sock found in the wall where Le 's body was stuffed .
The search warrant claimed that because of the apparent DNA matches between Hromadka 's lanyard and on the bloody socks , there was " probably cause that evidence of the crime of murder ... will be found within the ... swab taken from Jennifer Hromadka . "
But the results of the DNA tests , which were taken more than three months ago in November , are not revealed in the search warrant , and Hromadka has never been accused or charged in connection to Le 's murder .
Late last year , New Haven Police Chief James
Lewis said that he did not expect to make any more arrests after taking Clark into custody .
" We 've made the only arrest we expect to make , " Lewis said at the time .
Since her fiancee 's arrest , Hromadka has reportedly been visiting Clark weekly at a maximum security prison , the MacDougall - Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield , Conn. , where he is being held on $ 3 million bail .
Messages left with the New Haven State Attorney 's office and Hromadka 's attorney , Robert Berke , were not immediately returned .
Berke told The Associated Press in December that he was n't sure why his client 's DNA was wanted and that he had been told that Hromadka was not a suspect .
Ray Clark 's Fiancee Probed for DNA , Use of Key Card on Murder Date
Also in the warrant is an description of Hromadka 's key card in the days leading up to and after Le 's murder .
Hromadka worked at an Animal Technician alonside her boyfriend and was sometimes assigned to work in the lab where Le 's body was found .
Her key card permits her entry to that lab .
From Sept. 8 to Sept. 13 Hormadka's key card was not used to access the building and were instead only active in other buildings that were in her " normal course of business " at Yale , according to the documents .
Still investigators say in the warrant that it is not uncommon for employees at Yale to gain entry into a building by " following behind others accessing and using their respective electonric key - cards , suggesting that even if Hromadka did n't swipe her card , she could have been with someone who did .
Le was first reported missing on Sept. 8 when her roommate said she had n't returned after class .
After days of searching , investigators found her body on Sept. 13 - the day she was scheduled to get married - in the Ivy League lab where she worked .
Autopsy results show Le was strangled , and after physical evidence linked Clark to " key pieces of evidence " found with the graduate student 's body , he was charged with felony murder .
Clark entered a not guilty plea on Jan. 26 to two charges of murder and felony murder .
He is due in court again April 7 .

Iceland ’s special investigation :
The plot thickens
Thorvaldur Gylfason
What brought down Iceland ’s banks ?
This column examines the revelations from the latest report from the Icelandic parliament , raising the possibility that the collapse of Iceland ’s three largest banks is the result of “ control fraud ” where shareholders stole from their own bank in the same way as those convicted of looting from the American saving and loan banks in the late 1980s .
The recently published nine - volume , 2,400 - page report from the Icelandic Parliament ‘s Special Investigation Commission ( SIC , appropriately pronounced sick ) is not an attempt at whitewash as many had feared .
Those fears arose from the government ’s unwillingness to appoint an international commission of enquiry as proposed by Professor Robert Aliber ( see Aliber and Zoega , forthcoming ) and others , including myself .
Rather , the report confirms , and documents in detail , what many of us thought we already knew ( Gylfason et al. , 2010 , Ch. 7 ) .
The report states : “ Explanations for the collapse of Glitnir ... , Kaupthing … , and Landsbanki … are first and foremost to be found in their rapid expansion and their subsequent size when they tumbled in October 2008 . “
Further , the report states ( see the report ’s English version Special Investigation Commission 2010 ) :
“ The largest owners of all the big banks had abnormally easy access to credit at the banks they owned , apparently in their capacity as owners .
... in all of the banks , their principal owners were among the largest borrowers . ”
“ When the bank [ Glitnir ] collapsed , its outstanding loans to Baugur and affiliated companies amounted to ... 70 % of the bank ’s equity base . ”
“ When Landsbanki collapsed , Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson and companies affiliated to him were the bank ’s largest debtors .
Björgólfur Guðmundsson [ his father ] was the bank ’s third largest debtor .
In total , their obligations to the bank ... [ were ] higher than Landsbanki Group ’s equity . ”
“ During a hearing , an owner of one of the banks [ Mr. Guðmundsson ] , who also had been a board member of the bank [ Chairman of the Board , in fact ] , said he believed that the bank “ had been very happy to have [ him ] as a borrower ” . ”
( I am not making this up . )
“ The operations of the Icelandic banks were , in many ways , characterised by their maximising the interests of the larger shareholders , who managed the banks , rather than running solid banks with the interests of all shareholders in mind , where due responsibility was demonstrated towards their creditors . ”
“ In 2008 the banks were buyers on average in 45 % of cases of automatically matched trades in their own shares .
In comparison they were sellers in less than 2 % of cases of automatically matched trades during the same period .
... all the banks in this manner attempted to elicit abnormal demand for their own shares . ”
“ At the beginning of 2006 , ... all the prerequisites for a financial crisis were in place . ”
“ It has been established that until just before the collapse of the banks [ in October 2008 ] there was little discussion within the Icelandic government of the bank ’s standing and of the liquidity crisis which began towards the end of summer 2007 . ”
“ When the ministers intended to improve the image of the banking system by partaking in public discussions , mainly abroad , it was done without any assessment of the financial capability of the state to come to the banks ’ assistance and without information being available on the cost of a possible financial shock . ”
“ … when the banks collapsed there was no joint governmental contingency plan available . ”
“ In a letter to the Investigation Commission , Stefan Ingves , Governor of the Central Bank of Sweden , makes it clear that unclear ownership , along with the banks ’ rapid balance sheet growth had led to a dangerous situation and that the Icelandic government did neither seem to fully grasp nor understand how to deal with it . ”
The report concludes by identifying three former ministers and three former central bank governors as well as the erstwhile director of the Financial Supervision Authority who “ showed neglect ” in the exercise in their duties .
Control fraud ?
The language of the SIC report is guarded .
It uses the gentle word “ neglect ” to refer to what might more accurately be called gross dereliction of duties .
Let us not forget what happened on the authorities ’ watch .
Not only did Iceland ’s three main banks accounting for 85 % of the country ’s banking system collapse within a week , but much of the remaining 15 % of the banking system went the same way as did other important concerns that had to be propped up at taxpayers ’ expense .
Assets equivalent to seven times Iceland ’s GDP went up in smoke , including foreign creditors ’ claims equivalent to five times GDP .
Foreign shareholders and some foreign depositors also took a hit .
Icelandic residents lost the equivalent of two times GDP .
No other country has ever caused such damage relative to its own size , at least not in peacetime .
At this stage it must be left to the reader and ultimately to the courts to determine whether the facts reported by the SIC suggest that the Icelandic banks were brought down by control fraud as defined by Black ( 2005 ) or by their “ their rapid expansion and their subsequent size ” per se .
If the banks were looted by their owners with the assistance of politicians , there would be no mystery about how they did it : they would have used the same methods as the convicted criminals who looted the American saving and loan banks in the late 1980s .
More than 1,000 elite white - collar criminals ( not counting tellers and minor players ) were convicted of felonies arising from the S&L debacle .
Their methods are described in Akerlof and Romer ( 1993 ) and Black ( 2005 ) .
Smörgasbord of the shareholders
The SIC chose to focus its attention on the role and responsibility of the government in the events leading to the crash and to steer around the question of the banks ’ “ possible criminal conduct . ”
Even so , the report clearly states that the banks broke laws .
The Danish bank director Jørn Astrup Hansen writes ( vol. 2 , p. 313 , my translation ) : “ The banks not only broke the law but they also exceeded their own limits , or moved the limits as needed . ”
Mr. Hansen goes on to add ( pp. 317-318 ) : “ Three relatively large banks could easily have serviced even the largest firms in the country without breaking the most important rule of the banking legislation stipulating that the individual loan obligations must not exceed 25 % of the bank ’s risk capital .
…
The Icelandic banks broke this rule . …
All three banks applied especially unhealthy methods involving loans to finance purchases of their own equities with the equities themselves as sole collateral .
The method and scope of such loans to finance purchases of the banks ’ own equities after October 2007 became such that they must be presumed to have constituted a violation of the law . …
The five largest shareholders in the banks were also their five largest customers .
Largest by far !
As if that were not enough , they also sat on the banks ’ boards or had representatives there .
This arrangement seemed , to say the least , dubious .
The danger of favouritism and self - dealing looms large . ”
More gold , anyone ?
The SIC was granted full access to the records of the banks .
Thus , it was able to report that , of 63 Members of Parliament , ten owed the failed banks € 1 million or more each at the pre-crash exchange rate of the króna ; their personal debts range from € 1 million to € 40 million .
The average debt of the ten MPs , including the leader of the Independence Party , his deputy , and five other party comrades , was €9 million .
( This is not a misprint . )
The Independence Party has been in government 90 % of the time since 1944 .
Most of these loans were heads - I - win - tails - you lose as they were granted mostly to finance equity purchases with the equities themselves as sole collateral .
Besides , the banks and affiliated companies had paid the political parties and candidates large sums before the crash .
Further , to understand what happened in Iceland , it helps to know the following ( some of this information is not included in the SIC report , but has been reported in the Icelandic press ) :
Two Icelandic brothers who produced TV dinners for export became bank shareholders , and went on to buy themselves a yacht that used to belong to Giorgio Armani .
Another bank owner bought himself a penthouse in Manhattan , but – this is actually in the SIC report – the bank “ forgot ” to ask for collateral .
At a small dinner party for favoured bank clients on the Riviera , where Tina Turner stood for the music , the main course was sprinkled with – you could n’t possibly have guessed this one – gold flakes .
And then there was the dinner party in Reykjavik where singer George Michael had been scheduled to land on the glass roof in a roaring helicopter , but to the great embarrassment of the bank ’s director of entertainment the plan fell through .
One of the bank owners , the afore - mentioned Mr. Guðmundsson , declared bankruptcy in 2009 to the tune of $ 750 million , of which $ 500 million is owed to the bank he owned and directed .
Not even Texas has seen a personal bankruptcy of such proportions .
What happens next ?
The SIC has referred a number of cases or issues to the Special Prosecutor ’s Office where an independent assessment will be made as to whether charges will be brought against the bankers and the four civil servants .
Parliament will decide whether to press charges against the ministers ; if it does , it must convene Landsdómur , a special court designed to determine whether ministers have broken the law .
If Landsdómur is convened , as appears likely , it will be the first time in the 66 - year history of the republic .
If some or all suspects are found guilty , the constitution permits the President of Iceland to pardon the bankers and the public officials , but a presidential pardon of ministers found guilty by Landsdómur would have to be affirmed by Parliament .
We are not in Kansas anymore .

Egyptian Court Acquits Muslims Who Beheaded a Christian Share Tweet
March 8 , 2010
ASSUIT , EGYPT ( ANS ) --
An Egyptian court in the southern city of Assuit has acquitted four Muslims accused of killing 61 - year - old Farouk Attallah on October 19 , 2009 .
This has been reported by Mary Abdelmassih in a story for the Assyrian International News Agency who said , " In broad daylight and in full view of witnesses , the killers fired 31 bullets to his head before beheading him , in the busy village market place of Attaleen , near Dairout , 313 kilometers south of Cairo , " said , The dead body was then dragged in the street , accompanied by shouts of victory .
" The judge presiding over the court on February 22 , said that he was not satisfied that the testimony of the witnesses established that the imprisoned men were the killers .
After the acquittal of Mohamad , Ashraf , Osama and Ahmad Hassouna , there was jubilation in the court room , with shouts of ' Allah is Great ' and congratulations from all Muslims , including members of the state security forces who were present . "
She said that Christians were enraged over the acquittal , since similar cases would result in life imprisonment or execution for a Copt if the victim was a Muslim and came as another wake - up call to many Copts in Egypt .
According to Peter Sarwar , the plaintiff 's attorney who told Mariam Ragy of Katiba Tibia Coptic site , " It sends a clear message that Coptic blood is extremely cheap .
This acquittal will make permanent the present culture of impunity enjoyed by Muslim aggressors against Copts . "
Sarwat said the ruling was inadequate , as it acquitted the accused but did not say who the perpetrators are .
" If these men did not kill , so who killed ?
The ruling should have referred the case to the general prosecution to present the perpetrators . "
Abdelmassih said that the Court based its ruling on quasi non existent proof , as well as the absence of " positive evidence " testimony versus the presence of " negative evidence " testimony .
" The judge refused to take into consideration the testimonies of the dead man 's daughter who said she only saw one killer and not four , as well as the testimony of the Muslim man who was wounded in the shootings , " said Sarwat .
According to media reports , most people who witnessed the shootings in the market place refused to come forward for fear of vengeance from the assailants ' family .
There were false witnesses who confirmed that the killers were present at work .
" It is not enough to get a conviction based only on police reports which are full of legal loopholes and weak prosecution investigations , " said Sarwat .
Legal observers have always claimed that the police purposely deliver to prosecution reports full of inadequacies and loopholes , thereby getting from the courts acquittals for Muslims .
What prompted the killing of Farouk Attallah was an alleged illicit sexual relationship between his son Romany and a local Muslim girl , Hagger Hassouna .
A rumor that intimate photos of Hagger together with her lover Romany were circulating on cell phones in Dairout lead four members of the Hassona family to kill Romany 's father , after failing to locate his son , who had fled .
Abdelmassih stated that besides the killing of Farouk Attallah , the arrest of the Hassouna perpetrators sparked on October 24 , 2009 , Muslim riots and collective punishment against all Copts in Dairout .
Christian - owned shops , pharmacies , and homes were looted and burned .
" Although several hundreds Muslims participated in those riots , the police only detained 19 , and these were acquitted on December 13 , 2009 because of the lack of eyewitnesses and conflicting statements between the accused and the victims , " she said .
" The majority of Copts believe the reason for the acquittal of Muslims is that although Egypt claims to be a secular state , in reality it applies the Sharia law which dictates that a Muslim who kills a non-Muslim must not be killed , because it is not reasonable to equate a Muslim with a ‘ polytheist ' ( a Christian ) . "
Commenting on the acquittal , Dr. Naguib Gobraeel , President of the Egyptian Union of Human Rights , asked : " What is the solution ?
The same happened with regards to Al - Kosheh Massacre [ 21 Copts were slaughtered in 2000 and not one Muslim was indicted ] , the attack on the Copts in Alexandria were blamed on a mentally unstable person ; even the assailant who beheaded Abdo Goerge Younan in Menoufiah is now in a mental hospital .
Heavenly Justice is our last resourt . "
He stated that he will appeal this week 's verdict .
The victim 's family was greatly shocked and saddened by the acquittal .
" In spite of the blood of their slain family head filling the street , the Muslim killers got away literally with murder , " Sarwat said " It just shows how cheap Coptic blood can be . "
Sarwat asserted that he will appeal the ruling .
" We can not remain silent over this verdict as it has very serious implications for all Copts in Egypt . "
He added : " It is not safe for Copts now , as any Muslims who wants to get rid of a Copt , would kill him , knowing well that in the end he will be acquitted . "

My name is Ronald Bedard .
I want to recommend Greg Oberhauser Law to anyone out there who is struggling to get their driver ’s license back .
I had an an extremely difficult , complicated case and I reached out to Gregg , he met with me and developed a plan to appeal the RMV ’s decision to suspend and revoke my license for many years , , , we met with the board of appeals in Marlborough and Greg presented a very solid case as to why I needed and deserved to be able to drive again .
The board continued the hearing as they requested more information .
Greg worked with me and got me in front off the board again a couple months later and the board agreed to reinstate my driver ’s license !!!
This was not an easy project but Greg ’s knowledge in this area was key into me getting my life back !!!
He was very professional and responsive throughout this difficult process .

DETROIT — This city is shrinking , and Mayor Dave Bing can live with that .
The nation 's once - a - decade census , which gets under way next month , usually prompts expensive tally - building efforts by cities eager to maximize federal funding tied to the count .
Detroit , ...
Susan first dipped her toe into the murky cyberpool of infidelity two years ago , when she was bored at home on a day off from her part - time fitness job .
Her husband , a business executive seven years her senior , was working , as usual .
Sexually frustrated and a little lonely , the 25 - year - old started Googling “ sex club ” and “ swingers club ” before stumbling upon AshleyMadison.com , advertised as a “ discreet dating service ” for people in relationships .
Like most Torontonians , Susan , who did not want her real name used , heard about it before .
Three months and more than a 1,000 profiles later , she sat at the bar at a Hooters restaurant with Michael , a 23 - year - old with a 31 - year - old wife .
“ He understood where I was coming from and we had the same expectations , ” she says .
After about two hours , they got a hotel room .
That was what she was really looking for .
According to Ashley Madison statistics , the number of Toronto - area female newlyweds on their site has skyrocketed in the past year .
In March 2009 , there were 3,184 women who had been married for three years or less actively using the service .
A year later , there were 12,442 .
Since he founded the service in 2001 , it was clear to CEO Noel Biderman that attracting men would be easy .
But he and his team thought their female clients would be desperate housewives or dedicated mistresses looking for “ lifestyles and fun and sex and gifts . ”
They deliberately targeted women with everything from the name of the brand to the colour scheme of its advertising was designed to attract aspiring female cheaters .
They soon realized they had overlooked a robust and active demographic : “ These were young women who , from their self - description ... were only married a year or two and seemed to really be questioning the institution , their next step , entering into parenthood , staying with that partner , ” Biderman says .
They called it their “ newlywed marketplace . ”
So much for those happy early years — the seven - year itch has shrunk to three or four and wives , not just husbands , are increasingly stepping up and sneaking out .
Infidelity is tricky for researchers to quantify because surveys largely rely on self - reporting , and people are inclined to lie according to the medium ( online , on the phone or in person ) .
And there is no one definition for infidelity — sometimes emotional and online affairs , and committed couples who are not married are included , other times not .
“ There ’s an overall increase in female infidelity in general , ” says Ruth Houston , a New York - based infidelity expert .
Houston ’s research began more than 16 years ago , after she unintentionally recorded her husband ’s phone conversations with three other women while working as a journalist from their home .
Houston is convinced we ’re “ in the midst of an infidelity epidemic ” and goes by the often - cited stat that infidelity by women has increased by 50 per cent in the last 10 years .
But the U.S. National Opinion Research Center report on American Sexual Behaviour offers much smaller figures :
In 2004 , 20.5 per cent of men and 11.7 per cent of women admitted to cheating on their spouses , a change from 21.3 and 10 per cent in 1991 .
Houston believes these numbers are deceptively low and that women are definitely catching up to men .
She says today ’s women are much more exposed to possible partners than their mothers and grandmothers .
They ’re out working and on the Internet , the top two places to cook up an affair .
“ I just think that women are stronger and coming into themselves and following their own path , ” says Toronto relationship therapist Nancy Ross .
She says infidelity is often what brings couples to seek therapy and that , increasingly , men are initiating therapy .
Biderman thinks female newlyweds are looking for more than a fling — that many of them are sizing up their husbands and questioning whether they really want to start a family with him .
And , in a pragmatic move not unlike job hunting , they might even want to line up a new partner before leaving their current one .
“ As more and more people get married later and later in life , does it really surprise you that a 30 - year - old woman who just got married a year or two ago , but has a very robust career and is very independent , is really going to tolerate the same kind of failed expectations that someone two generations removed from her ( did ) ? ” he asks .
Or maybe it ’s the digital era that is making young people so eager to move on , Biderman says .
After all , past and future lovers are all just a mouse click away .
Susan , now 27 , says she loves her husband and does not plan to leave him .
More than that , she ’s convinced Ashley Madison has helped her marriage : she ’s made many friends who understand her , both male and female , and she ’s now had four very satisfying affairs .
“ I come home smiling after and I ’m just fulfilled , which kind of cuts up my resentment toward my husband , because I just feel better — physically , emotionally , everything . ”

Business is booming for Ashley Madison
Ashley Madison membership is growing madly , which founder Noel Biderman ties , at least in part , to the economy .
“ Martial discord is very closely tied to economic issues , ” Biderman says .
“ If you ’re having challenges around your family finances , it ’s really hard to all of a sudden turn on the intimacy dial and go upstairs and make passionate love to one another . ”

A while back I talked about how my wife and I were looking to close out our account with Bank of America because the rate of interest that we were receiving on our money was not very good , even in today ’s market with low rates across the board .
Our account had a paltry .50 % rate of interest , and I was n’t expecting them to raise the rates anytime soon .
We had a considerable amount of money sitting in the account ( our 9 month emergency fund ) , and we wanted it to be gaining at least a little bit more interest while it sat there .
At the time I wrote about how I had closed the account , and was expecting to receive a cashier ’s check in the mail for the balance of our funds in the account .
At least that ’s what I was expecting , but unfortunately Bank of America had other ideas .
So , how many attempts would it take before we were actually able to close our account ?
Closing My Account : Attempt Number One
The first time I attempted to close my account I called up on a Monday morning .
I talked to a nice young man who told me that closing my account would be no problem .
He quickly processed my request ( or so I thought ) , and told me that my account was now closed , and that I would be receiving a check for the balance of the funds in the account .
He said it would take 5 - 7 days for my check to be processed and sent .
He then asked if I had anything else that I needed today .
I said no , and hung up the phone fully expecting to receive my check a few days later so that I could open and fund a new account elsewhere .
A few days and then a week passed , and still I had n’t received a check .
I was a bit worried because this was a considerable amount of money that we were waiting on , and I wanted it sitting in an account gaining interest – not sitting out there in a post office somewhere waiting to be delivered .
I checked my account online and discovered my account still appeared open and all the funds were sitting there in my account .
Something was n’t right .
Closing My Account : Attempt Number Two
I called up Bank of America again to ask them why I had n’t received my check in the mail , and to confirm that my account had in fact been closed .
The customer service rep pulled up my account and then told me that nothing had been done , that my account had not been closed .
I expressed my concern as to why this had n’t been done , and the rep could n’t tell me for sure , but told me she would help me to close the account now .
At this point she explained the process .
She would close the account for me on her end , which would mean I would receive a letter in the mail that I would have to sign and get notarized , and send back to confirm that I wanted to close the account .
I was frustrated by this because it meant I had to find a notary to notarize the documents , and it was going to mean more time and hassle in order to close my account .
She told me that this should have been done the first time around , and that it is standard procedure when closing an account with over $ 25,000 in it .
I finally agreed to do it so that I could be done with it , and waited 3 days for an account closure letter in the mail .
I took the letter to a notary at my wife ’s place of employment and signed the document and had it notarized .
( By the way , if you ’re looking for a notary , you can often find them at your bank or a real estate office ) I sent the document back and awaited a confirmation and a check with my remaining funds .
A week later I had seen nothing .
Closing My Account : Attempt Number Three
By this point I was getting extremely frustrated .
I had now made two attempts to close my account , one of them on the phone and one of them involving me having to track down a notary public and signing documents in order to get my own money back .
By now I was beginning to think that Bank of America was never going to let me have my money back .
I called Bank of America again and asked why my account had n’t been closed and my money sent .
The rep told me that they had never received my documents , and that I would need to resend them .
The problem was that I had n’t made copies of the notarized letter requesting the account be closed ( my own fault , I know ) .
She said the only option was for the documents to be resent to me , and to have them notarized again .
So again , I would have to wait 3 - 5 days for the new letter to arrive .
At this point I was exasperated and started voicing my displeasure with BofA on Twitter .
At this point my experience with Bank of America changed for the better .
After I had tweeted my situation I received a reply from the Bank of America twitter customer service rep asking if they could help .
If you want to track them down for your own issues , you can find them here :
I started talking with one of the reps , Nereida , about my situation on Twitter and via email .
She did her best to help me rectify the situation .
After doing some research she called me up , got further details of the situation and called the manager of the account closure department .
Instead of making me wait 5 days for a letter in the mail , she emailed me a copy of the account closure letter .
She then asked that I send it back to her directly , and she would make sure that it was followed up on .
I expressed my displeasure that I would have to pay for a notary again , and she said she could make things right by sending me an Amazon gift card .
I got the form notarized again , and faxed it back directly to Nereida .
She forwarded it on to the account closure department , and my account was closed and check was received within a couple of days .
On top of that I got a $ 50 gift card for my trouble .
Turning A Negative Experience Into A More Positive One Via Social Media
My experience in attempting to close my Bank of America savings account started out as a frustrating and aggravating one .
After several phone calls and weeks of waiting I had n’t been able to close my account and my money was being held in limbo .
In the end BofA was able to turn the situation around , and leave me with a positive feeling by being more engaging and helpful via their social media customer service team .
While it was n’t enough for me to stick around , it does show that at least some of their customer service reps know what they ’re doing .
Also , once again it shows the power of social media .
I was able to get the attention of a big company by voicing my displeasure online , and get what would have been a 1 - 2 week wait turned into a 3 day turn around – and a gift card !
So how many customer service reps does it take to close an account with Bank of America ?
One good one , and possibly several bad ones .
Now I just have to make a final decision about which new savings account I ’m going to open .
I ’m currently leaning towards an account with Ally Bank ( read my Ally Bank Review here ) , but could be swayed if you ’ve had a particularly good experience with another bank .
Let me know in the comments !
Have you had a bad experience closing an account somewhere ?
Have your own story of using social media to get better customer service ?

" And this is Colossus , " Eric said with a dramatic sweep of his hand .
It was an impressive sight .
The PDP - 11/70 was a beast of a machine : one megabyte of memory , up to 63 concurrent jobs , and a control panel straight out of straight out of Star Trek .
Sadly , Kevin was n't properly impressed .
Kevin was Eric 's new boss , whose main qualification was that he and the VP of Finance played squash together .
Kevin knew nothing about PDP systems or RSTS /E , the OS it ran .
It fell to Eric to train his new boss how to do his job , and the slack - jaw dangling from Kevin 's face did n't bode well .
A few days into Kevin 's reign , accounting called .
Their complaint , the same complaint they had last month , and the month before that , was that the accounts payable job took too long to run .
" Well , what can we do about it ? " Kevin asked .
" What ?
Nothing , really .
It 's a big job .
It takes a long time , " Eric said .
" Ca n't you boost the priority ? "
Eric raised an eyebrow at that ; " priority " was likely on Kevin 's " Tech Word a Day " calendar today .
The short answer was , " Yes , but it wo n't do anything . "
Eric proceeded to explain , in small words , that the bottleneck in their environment was disk I/O .
The large accounting files could n't be cached in memory , so accounting jobs spent most of their time trying to get data off of the disk .
Even at peak load , the CPU was idle 70 % of the time .
" Changing the priority only gives them more CPU , which they do n't need . "
Kevin nodded along , like he understood , and then said , " Great , so we 'll boost the priority then .
Show me how . "
Eric did .
When he actually timed the process , it took just as long .
But Kevin and the VP of Finance agreed that everything was much faster now , so Eric kept his mouth shut .
Happy VPs mean happy budgets , and they found themselves with a significant hardware upgrade .
Two shiny 250 mb hard disks ( $ 15,000 each ) , one disk controller ( $ 15,000 ) , and a second megabyte memory upgrade ( $ 10,000 ) .
The new toys were freed of their packing material and installed .
In - memory disk caching was enabled and performance … did n't change at all .
Eric , a stalwart veteran of 15 months at this time , could n't accept that .
After some research , he found a patch that altered the disk caching behavior .
Instead of trying to explain the details of the RSTS / E caching system to Kevin , Eric simply installed it without permission after everyone else went home .
The next day , the system flew .
That 2 mb of memory was used to store commonly used data , the I/O bottleneck vanished , and the CPU spent most of its time near 100 % .
With this change , Kevin 's knowledge became dangerous .
Now , when he altered the priority of accounting jobs , he swallowed the entire CPU and blocked anything else from running .
Eric explained the technical problem , this time using carefully selected mono - syllables .
" So stop adjusting the priority .
You do n't need to , it 's fast enough for everyone . "
" Accounting needs their jobs to run faster .
If engineering can't make vectors or flipjacks or whatever they do , too bad . "
Eric returned to his desk and scowled at RSTS / E's UTILITY .
BAS file , which contained the source code for a variety of system commands , like SET QUEUE , which controlled the priority .
It took moments to alter SET QUEUE to ignore attempts to change priority .
A quick recompile and Kevin was rendered harmless , again .
This lasted for months , until Kevin learned to read the process report , which was roughly like a lemur discovering fire .
" What 's wrong with the priority settings ? "
Kevin demanded , red faced .
" Accounting needs their data !
Fix it now ! "
Eric knew there was no point in explaining things .
" I 'll look into it . "
As soon as Kevin turned away , Eric opened up UTILITY .
BAS , and this time jumped down to the SHOW QUEUE command .
In five minutes , he added logic to make all of the accounting jobs to look like they had a higher priority than they actually did .
Anyone who knew their way around RSTS / E would notice something was amiss , which meant Eric never had to worry about Kevin noticing .
RSTS /E command documentation - you now know more about RSTS /E than Kevin .

Michael Medved ’s Myths , Lies and Downright Stupidity
In a piece last week , I quoted observations from Matt Yglesias and Ezra Klein to the effect that , when you scrape away all the rhetorical appeals to “ property rights ” and “ free markets , ” you find that the real agenda is not so much the promotion of markets and property as such , as promoting the interests of business and defending business against stuff it does n’t like .
And lo and behold , John Stossel and Michael Medved come out and prove me right .
Stossel hosted Medved , author of The 5 Big Lies About American Business , on his Fox Business Network show .
Medved , in the process of fulminating about Hollywood ’s theme of “ the businessman as villain , ” drops this little gem : “ You can only make a profit in this country by giving people a product or a service that they want , ” he says .
“ It ’s the golden rule in action . ”
( It was amusing , by the way , to see Medved contrast today ’s “ businessman as villain theme ” with the good old days , when Jimmy Stewart played kindly George Bailey the banker .
Oddly enough I seem to recall a character named Potter who was also a businessman — but that ca n’t be ! )
Medved responds to allegations that big business is corrupt and exploitative , in the corporatist economy we live in , by arguing that “ it ca n’t happen , because in a free market , blah blah woof woof . ”
It ’s the moral equivalent of traveling back in time to feudal France and saying to the serfs : “ No , those great landlords ca n’t be exploiting you because in a free market … ”
Or to the old Soviet Union and saying , “ No , those state industrial managers ca n’t be pushing you around because in a free market … ”
Stossel , at least , has previously tipped his hat to the ideas of corporatism and crony capitalism .
But he did n’t let out a peep about it this time .
He smiled and nodded in response to Medved ’s fairy tale with the demeanor of a four - year - old child on Santa ’s knee .
So in a free market , exploitation is impossible .
I agree .
But what has that got to do with a corporatist system founded on 150 years ’ worth of massive collusion between big government and big business , in which the great fortunes are founded on crimes and the great profits are equivalent to the feudal landlord ’s rents ?
The struggle of work vs. ownership is central to the Leftist paradigm .
I agree .
But the main form of “ ownership ” by which labor is exploited is not property in one ’s own accumulated past effort and abstention .
The real form of exploitative ownership against which labor has to contend is artificial property and artificial scarcity : a property in the conditions under which other people are permitted to work , buy and sell .
If you look at the biggest firms , and the dominant sectors in the global economy , their profits are all rents on a property in controlling other people ’s access to opportunities .
Medved also comes out and counters the “ myth ” that the rich get richer by making the poor poorer , because “ when two people engage in free exchange , both gain . ”
So “ there are no obscene profits , ” according to Medved .
I can just imagine him telling a mugging victim that he was n’t really robbed , because “ when two people engage in free exchange … ”
The question is , whether a given transaction in our corporate economy IS a free exchange .
So is he saying that all economic transactions under the present system are “ free exchange ” ?
Is he saying that the profits of ( say ) military contractors and state - protected monopolists are n’t obscene ?
Is he denying that they even exist ?
Frankly , I doubt if he even cares , he ’s been phoning it in for so long .
Medved is just being willfully stupid in order to write a by - the - numbers puff piece , in service to a bunch of crooks who want a legitimizing myth made to order .
And Stossel is cheering him on .
Give me a break .

A long lost light reflector that was left on the surface ofthe moon by the former Soviet Union has been rediscovered by a team of Americanphysicists after nearly 40 years using lasers beamed from Earth .
The French - built laser reflector was sent aboard theunmanned Soviet Luna 17 mission , which landed on ? themoon on Nov. 17 , 1970 and released a robotic rover that roamed the lunarsurface and carried the sought after laser reflector .
The Soviet lander and its rover , called Lunokhod 1 , werelast heard from on Sept. 14 , 1971 .
" No one had seen the reflector since 1971 , " saidTom Murphy , an associate professor of physics at the University of CaliforniaSan Diego .
Murphy leads a team of scientists in a long - term effort to use laserreflectors to measure the shape of the lunar orbit and look for deviations inEinstein 's Theory of General Relativity .
" We routinely use the three hardy reflectors placed onthe moon by the Apollo 11 , 14 and 15 missions , and occasionally the Soviet - landed Lunokhod2 reflector ?
though it does not work well enough to use when illuminatedby sunlight , " Murphy said .
" But we yearned to find Lunokhod 1 . "
Murphy and his team occasionally looked for the Lunokhod 1reflector over the last two years , but had no luck finding it until recently .
The breakthrough came last month , when the high - resolutioncamera on NASA 's LunarReconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) obtained images of the landing site .
Thecamera team identified the rover as a sunlit speck on the image , which turnedout to be miles away from where Murphy and his team had been searching .
Untilnow , the precise location of the rover 's reflector had been unknown .
On April 22 , Murphy 's team sent pulses of laser light fromthe 3.5 meter telescope at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico , zeroingin on the target coordinates provided by the LRO images .
The team was able to find the longlost Lunokhod 1 reflector and pinpointed its distance from Earth to withinone centimeter ( 0.4 inches ) .
They then made a second observation less than 30 minutes later that allowed the team to triangulate the reflector 's latitude andlongitude on the moon to within 10 meters ( 0.006 miles ) .
In the coming months , it will be possible for scientists toestablish the reflector 's coordinates with even greater precision , Murphy said .
The return signal from the reflector was measured as acollection of photons , or individual particles of laser light .
" We quickly verified the signal to be real and found itto be surprisingly bright : at least five times brighter than the other Sovietreflector , on the Lunokhod2 rover , to which we routinely send laser pulses , " Murphy said .
"
The best signal we 've seen from Lunokhod 2 in several years of effort is 750return photons , but we got about 2,000 photons from Lunokhod 1 on our firsttry .
It 's got a lot to say after almost 40 years of silence . "
Prior to this discovery , many scientists had speculated thatthe Lunokhod 1 rover might have fallen into a crater or parked badly , with itsreflector not facing Earth , which would have prevented it from being located bylaser pulses .
" Not only now do we know that Lunokhod 1 is there , wealso know that it is parked perfectly so that its reflector faces Earth , " Murphy explained .
" In fact , the signal is so surprisingly strong that therover could not be in anything but a level parking spot with its commanded rollon the lunar surface deliberately oriented toward the Earth . "
The discovery of Lunokhod 1 will greatly improve uponstudies of the moon and its composition .
" Lunokhod 1 , by virtue of its location , would providethe best leverage for understanding the liquid lunar core , and for producing anaccurate estimate of the position of the center of the moon ?
which is ofparamount importance in mapping out the orbit and putting Einstein 's gravity toa test , " Murphy stated .
Murphy and his colleagues found in a study published this monththat lunar dust may be obscuring the reflectorson the moon .
The researchers found that the laser light they bounce offreflectors on the lunar surface is fainter than expected and dims even morewhenever the moon is full .
" Near full moon , the strength of the returning lightdecreases by a factor of ten , " Murphy said .
" We need to understandwhat is causing this if we are contemplating putting additional scientificequipment on the moon .
Finding the Lunokhod 1 reflector will add importantclues to this study . "
Lithuania ’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Audronius Ažubalis and Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Støre , who could not come to Lithuania due to the cancelled flights in Europe , discussed issues of bilateral relations , cooperation in the Baltic Sea region , economy and international security during a teleconference that was held on 19 April .
During the conversation , Minister A.Ažubalis stressed the advantage of the European Economic Area ( EEA ) and Norwegian Financial Mechanism that functioned successfully in Lithuania for the period 2004 - 2009 .
The Minister expressed trust that a similar agreement would be signed for the period 2009 - 2014 .
“ Norwegian Grants 2004 - 2009 were very popular in Lithuania .
The number of applications was twice as big as the amount available for Lithuania .
These projects are important to us not only economically , as they also strengthen the relations between Lithuania and Norway , ” the head of Lithuania ’s diplomacy said .
Lithuanian Foreign Minister thanked J.G.Støre for the support of Norway to the European Humanities University based in Vilnius , and asked for continuous Norway ’s support to this University .
Ministers A.Ažubalis and J.G.Støre discussed bilateral trade and decided that the Lithuanian - Norwegian economic relations could be intensified even more in the future .
The Ministers agreed that it would be efficient to organize information campaigns and to use high - level bilateral visits for holding business missions .
In 2009 , the Norwegian and Lithuanian trade turnover amounted to 1.233 billion Litas .
The trade balance was positive and reached 803 million Litas .
Lithuanian exports to Norway in 2009 amounted to 1.018 billion Litas , and imports reached 215.69 million Litas .
The Ministers also discussed the Nordic - Baltic cooperation .
Minister A.Ažubalis suggested considering to launch a group of wise men , which would be comprised of representatives from eight countries ( NB8 ) .
This group would set further Nordic - Baltic cooperation guidelines on common identity , foreign policy , energy , environmentally friendly technologies , etc .
“ The Nordic - Baltic cooperation needs to find fresh inspiration and ideas to become more effective , ” Minister A.Ažubalis said .
The Ministers discussed Lithuania ’s Presidency of the Council of the Baltic Sea States ( CBSS ) , prospects for the organization ’s activities in the future , Lithuania ’s preparations to chair the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) in 2011 .
The Ministers discussed ways to make the OSCE activities more effective and the OSCE - anchored dialogue on the future of European security ( the Corfu Process ) .
Minister A.Ažubalis conveyed an invitation to the Norwegian Prime Minister to attend the Summit of the Baltic Sea States due on 1 - 2 June in Vilnius .

Lithuania holds the Presidency of the Council of the Baltic Sea States since July 2009 .
In June 2010 , Norway will take over the Presidency from Lithuania .
The Ministers discussed preparations for the meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers on 22 - 23 April in Tallinn , and NATO ’s new Strategic Concept .
The ministers agreed that NATO had to remain an effective transatlantic defence organization .
Apple has used Intel chips in their products since 2006 ( and things have gone pretty well ) .
But according to AppleInsider , Apple is in high - level discussions with AMD to adopt other processor tech .

In fact , Apple has been doing more than just talking ; they 've even been testing AMD chipsets in their labs .
How could this be , especially when Intel chips are currently outperforming AMD at a noticeable margin ?
A while back , DigiTimes reported that Apple was upset with Intel over chip shortages that forced MacBook Pros into a later than anticipated Core i5 / i7 refresh .
Plus , Apple is now settling for Intel integrated graphics in MacBook Pros following Intel 's disputes with NVIDIA .
AMD , eager for the business , could treat Apple as a grade - A client while simultaneously providing them with a cheaper product as well as superior ATI - based GPU solutions ( since AMD owns ATI ) .

But — and this is just a hunch — while AppleInsider 's intelligence sounds perfectly believable , the idea that Apple would really jump ship to AMD does not .
If anything , these discussions could be nothing more than a threatening bargaining chip to gain better treatment for Intel .
Well , that , and maybe a parachute for if and when things get worse .

2010 update :
Lo , the Web Performance Advent Calendar hath moved
Dec 19
This post is part of the 2009 performance advent calendar experiment .
Stay tuned for the articles to come .
Intrigued by Luke Smith 's comment and also Alois Reitbauer 's comment on the previous post about rendering I did some more testing with dynaTrace and SpeedTracer .
Also prompted by this tweet , I wanted to provide an example of avoiding reflows by using document fragments as well as hiding elements with display : none .
( btw , sorry that I 'm slow to respond to tweets and blog comments , just too much writing lately with the crazy schedule , but I do appreciate every tweet and comment ! )
So welcome to the new game show : " Will it reflow ? " where we 'll look into a few cases where it's not so clear if the browser will do a reflow or just a repaint .
The test page is here .
Changing classnames
The first test is fairly straightforward - we only want to check what happens when you change the class name of an element .
So using " on " and " off " class names and changing them on mouse over .
. on { background : yellow ; border : 1 px solid red ; } .off { background : white ; border : 1 px dashed green ; }
Those CSS rules should n't trigger a reflow , because no geometry is being changed .
Although the test is pushing it a bit by changing borders , which may affect geometry , but not in this case .
The test code :
var onoff = document .
getElementById ( ' on - off ' ) ; onoff .
onmouseover = function ( ) { onoff .
className = ' on ' ; } ; onoff .
onmouseout = function ( ) { onoff .
className = ' off ' ; } ;
Sooo .. will it reflow ?
In Chrome - no !
In IE - yes .
In IE , even changing the class name declarations to only change color , which is sure not to cause reflow , still caused a reflow .
Looks like in IE , any type of className change causes a reflow .
cssText updates
The recommended way to update multiple styles in one shot ( less DOM access , less reflows ) is to update the element 's style.
cssText property .
But .. will it reflow when the style changes do not affect geometry ?
So let 's have an element with a style attribute :
... style= " border : 1 px solid red ; background : white " ...
The JavaScript to update the cssText :
var csstext = document .
getElementById ( ' css-text ' ) ; csstext .
onmouseover = function ( ) { csstext .
style .
cssText += ' ; background : yellow ; border : 1 px dashed green ; ' ; } ; csstext .
onmouseout = function ( ) { csstext .
style .
cssText += ' ; background : white ; border : 1 px solid red ; ' ; } ;
Will it reflow ?
In Chrome - no !
In IE - yes .
Even having cssText ( and the initial style ) only play with color , there 's still a reflow .
Even trying to just write the cssText property ( as opposed to read / write with += ) still causes a reflow .
The fact that cssText property is being updated causes IE to reflow .
So there might be cases where setting individual properties separately ( like style.color , style.backgroundColor and so on ) which do n't affect geometry , might be preferable to touching the cssText .
Next contestant in the game show is ...
addRule
Will the browser reflow when you update stylesheet collections programatically ?
Here 's the test case using addRule and removeRule ( which in Firefox are insertRule / deleteRule ) :
var ss = document .
styleSheets [ 0 ] ; var ruletext = document .
getElementById ( ' ruletext ' ) ; ruletext .
onmouseover = function ( ) { ss .
addRule ( ' .bbody ' , ' color : red ' ) ; } ; ruletext .
onmouseout = function ( ) { ss .
removeRule ( ss . rules .
length - 1 ) ; } ;
Will it ?
Will it ?
In Chrome - yes .
The fact that style rules in the already loaded stylesheet have been touched , causes Chrome to reflow and repaint .
Even though class . bbody is never used .
Same when creating a new rule with selector body {...} - reflow , repaint .
In IE there 's a repaint definitely , and there 's also a kind of reflow .
Looks like dynaTrace shows two kinds of rendering calculation indicators : " Calculating generic layout " and " Calculating flow layout " .
Not sure what is the difference ( web searches disappointingly find nada / zero / rien for the first string and my previous blog post for the second ) .
Hopefully " generic " would be less expensive than " flow " .
display : none
In my previous post I boldly claimed that elements with display : none will not have anything to do with the render tree .
IE begs to differ ( thanks to dynaTrace folks for pointing that out ) .
A good way to minimize reflows is to update the DOM tree " offline " out of the live document .
One way to do so is to hide the element while updates are taking place and then show it again .
Here 's a test case where rendering and geometry are affected by simply adding more text content to an element by creating new text nodes .
var computed , tmp ; var dnonehref = document .
getElementById ( ' display - none ' ) ; var dnone = document .
getElementById ( ' bye ' ) ; if ( document . body .
currentStyle ) { computed = dnone .
currentStyle ; } else { computed = document .
defaultView .
getComputedStyle ( dnone , ' ' ) ; } dnonehref .
onmouseover = function ( ) { dnone .
style .
display = ' none ' ; tmp = computed .
backgroundColor ; dnone .
appendChild ( document .
createTextNode ( '
No mo tests . ' ) ) ; tmp = computed .
backgroundColor ; dnone .
appendChild ( document .
createTextNode ( '
No mo tests . ' ) ) ; tmp = computed .
backgroundColor ; dnone .
appendChild ( document .
createTextNode ( '
No mo tests . ' ) ) ; tmp = computed .
backgroundColor ; } dnonehref .
onmouseout = function ( ) { dnone .
style .
display = ' inline ' ; }
Will it reflow ?
In Chrome - no .
Although it does do " restyle " ( calculating non-geometric styles ) every time a text node is added .
Not sure why this restyling is needed .
In IE - yes .
Unfortunatelly display : none seems to have no effect on rendering in IE , it still does reflows .
I tried with removing the show / hide code and having the element hidden from the very beginning ( with an inline style attribute ) .
Same thing - reflow .
document fragment
Another way to preform updates off - DOM is to create a document fragment and once ready , shove the fragment into the DOM .
The beauty is that the children of the fragment get copied , not the fragment itself , which makes this method pretty convenient .
Here 's the test / example .
And will it reflow ?
var fraghref = document .
getElementById ( ' fragment ' ) ; var fragment = document .
createDocumentFragment ( ) ; fraghref .
onmouseover = function ( ) { fragment .
appendChild ( document .
createTextNode ( '
No mo tests . ' ) ) ; tmp = computed .
backgroundColor ; fragment .
appendChild ( document .
createTextNode ( '
No mo tests . ' ) ) ; tmp = computed .
backgroundColor ; fragment .
appendChild ( document .
createTextNode ( '
No mo tests . ' ) ) ; tmp = computed .
backgroundColor ; } fraghref .
onmouseout = function ( ) { dnone .
appendChild ( fragment ) ; }
In Chrome - no !
And no rendering activities take place until the fragment is added to the live DOM .
Then , just like with display : none a restyle is being performed for every new text node inserted .
And even though the behavior is the same for fragments as for updating hidden elements , fragments are still preferable , because you do n't need to hide the element ( which will cause another reflow ) initially .
In IE - no reflow !
Only when you add the final result to the live DOM .
Thanks !
Thank you for reading .
Tomorrow if all goes well there should be a final post related to JavaScript and then moving on to ... other topics 😉

Due to boring circumstances beyond my control , I will not be online much for awhile .
Fortunately I ’ve been able to line up a number of stellar guests to fill in for me .
Most are writers , but I also thought it would be fun to get some publishing types to explain what it is they do , teach you some more about the industry , and answer your questions , as well as one or two bloggers .
Alaya Dawn Johnson is a wonderful writer , whose short story in Zombies v Unicorns , “ Love Will Tear Us Apart ” is jaw - droppingly good .
Her next novel , Moonshine , out in May is my fave New York City vampire novel .
I love it so much that it ’s been killing me waiting for it to come out because I ’ve been dying to rave about Moonshine to youse lot .
Trust me , you want this book .
– – –
Alaya Dawn Johnson dated a zombie once in high school , but it did n’t stick .
Her first novel was Racing the Dark , the first in a trilogy she decided to call The Spirit Binders once her publisher told her trilogies needed names .
The second book , The Burning City , is due out in June .
She is also looking forward to the May 11 publication of Moonshine , her 1920s vampire novel set in the Lower East Side of New York City .
Alaya says :
What My Dad Said
When I first showed my dad the new paperback cover of Racing the Dark , I was pretty proud of it .
I thought that it evoked the book and was fairly striking .
I wo n’t lie , I pretty much expected him to pat me on the head and say , “ Looks great , honey . ”
Instead , he picked it up and turned it over a few times .
His face took on that serious , thinking expression I recognized meant he was considering how to phrase something important .
“ Alaya , ” he said , “ the art is lovely .
The image and everything is great .
But are you sure you want to limit yourself like that with this cover ? ”
“ Limit myself ? ” I asked .
“ White people are going to be way less likely to pick up a book with a cover featuring a brown person .
That ’s just the way the world works . ”
I told my dad ( with some annoyance ) that I did n’t think that was true , and anyway , my book is about a brown person , so these hypothetical white people would just have to suck it up .
Cut to this past Christmas , when my Dad , my sister , my brother and I were all last - minute shopping at the local mall .
Like we do every Christmas , we all tromped through the local Borders , looking for presents .
This time I was especially excited , because the store claimed to have a copy of my book .
My dad and I searched all through the fantasy section , just so I could experience has n’t - gotten - old - yet zing of seeing my own work in a bookstore .
But Racing the Dark was n’t there .
Finally , we went back to the computers to look for it again .
And we saw what we had missed the first time : though Racing the Dark is clearly labeled “ fantasy ” on its spine , the powers that be at Borders , in their infinite wisdom , had decided to shelve me in the “ African American ” section .
At least I was in good company .
On the shelves surrounding my book were works by Octavia Butler , Zora Neale Hurston and Toni Morrison .
I ’ve looked through this peculiar hybrid section before , and I ’ve always been bewildered by the mish - mash of genres and writers all sandwiched together on two narrow shelves .
Would someone like to tell me what on earth Zane and Toni Morrison have to do with each other ?
Dad and I stared at the book in dismay .
“ I ca n’t believe they did this , ” I said .
“ Honey , I told you , ” he said .
“ You should have had a more generic cover . ”
I could n’t really disagree with him , at that point .
So Dad picked up the book and we physically marched it over to the Fantasy section , where we left it , cover side out .
“ Alaya , ” my Dad said , later that day , over dinner , “ you have to understand that you live in the world .
You ca n’t mess around with the way you wish things would be .
You have to deal with the way that they are .
A black woman writing a book with a cover like that is going to get shoved in a category you might not want to be in . ”
Considering that we had just seen the physical evidence of my being shoved into that category , I just nodded and went back to my food .
It stuck with me , though .
And I realized that my dad ’s point of view has n’t really been in much of the ongoing discussion about cover art and whitewashing .
In a lot of discussions about race , my Dad and I suffer from a pretty profound generational gap .
My dad is of the Old School , which we could call “ determined pragmatism . ”
As far as my dad is concerned , he grew up in a world where he could n’t sit down at half the lunch counters in Richmond , where he had to sit in the balcony of the theater , drink from labeled water fountains and sit on the black side of the court house .
Now , in his sixties , my dad owns a business that actually works with the same governments that supported Jim Crow laws .
He ’s moved into that small percentage of the black upper - middle class , and as far as he ’s concerned , race is something you deal with and move on .
If you have to change something because white people do n’t like overt blackness , then you do that .
It ’s not that my dad does n’t understand my points about how frustrating and degrading it can be to always have non-whiteness relegated to this unwanted subcategory ( or , even worse , an exoticized one ) .
He does .
He just feels that if the world works this way and if I ’m just a writer struggling to make a living , then I ought to find a way to help myself within that existing power structure .
Now , I still do n’t think he ’s right .
I still like my cover and I ’m still very happy that it very clearly features my non-white main character .
But I will say that it felt like a gut punch to see Racing the Dark shelved — with such a contemptuous lack of care for its content or its audience — in the African American section of Borders .

Microbes thriving in salty , alkali waters containing arsenic .
It looks peaceful , but Laguna del Diamante 's waters are deadly .
MARÍA EUGENIA FARÍAS
Argentinian investigators have found flamingos and mysterious microbes living in an alkaline lagoon nestled inside a volcano in the Andes .
The organisms , exposed to arsenic and poisonous gases , could shed light on how life began on Earth , and their hardiness to extreme conditions may hold the key to new scientific applications .
In 2009 , a team led by María Eugenia Farías , a microbiologist at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Tucumán , Argentina , discovered living stromatolites in the Socompa and Tolar Grande lagoons high in the Andes ( see ' High window on the past ' ) .
Stromatolites — collections of photosynthetic microorganisms and calcareous concretions — are thought to have been common more than 3.5 billion years ago .
After that discovery , scientists in Argentina decided to look at lakes and lagoons in the Puna de Atacama , a desert plateau that sits more than 4,000 metres above sea level , in an attempt to understand what life might have looked like on the early Earth .
Lethal cocktail
But when in February 2010 they explored Laguna Diamante inside the still active Cerro Galán volcano — one of the world 's largest volcanic caldera — they found microbes and flamingos flourishing in the extreme conditions rather than stromatolites .
Researchers have not yet identified the compound from which these red crystals are made .
MARÍA EUGENIA FARÍAS
Farías says that the lagoon is hyper alkaline ( pH 11 ) and contains concentrations of salt five times higher than those of sea water .
In addition , the concentration of arsenic in the water is 20,000 times higher than the level regarded as safe for drinking water by the US Environmental Protection Agency .
Laguna del Diamante is located 4,600 metres above sea level , so any life also has to survive ultraviolet ( UV ) light that is around 40 % more intense than in the lowlands as well as low oxygen concentrations , she adds .
In addition , the volcano there is active and gaseous sulphur escaping from vents can make the environment even more hostile .
In the lagoon , the team found rocks coated with mats of microbes , which they have so far not identified .
These microorganisms serve as food for a colony of flamingos , which had never before been seen living in conditions quite as hostile as those in the lagoon .
" To feed , flamingos filter saline water , retain nutrients and microorganisms and discard the fluids , " explains Enrique Derlindati , a flamingo specialist at the National University of Salta in Argentina .
" They are a very adaptable species that can live and adjust to diverse environments , but in this case Laguna del Diamante is very extreme . "
Crystal conundrum
Investigators determined that the flamingos feed on the microorganisms in the microbial mats .
So far , however , they have been unable to identify red crystals also found at the site .
" These rocks are made of calcium carbonate associated with little red crystal reefs , " says Farías .
" But analysis with X - ray diffraction does not show any known or expected mineral . "

In the hope of uncovering characteristics that could have medical or commercial applications , the investigators are working on genetically sequencing any bacteria , algae and fungi in the microbial mats .
In other lagoons , in Puna and elsewhere , where there were less - extreme conditions , the team members have found antibiotic - and UV - resistant strains of bacteria , from which they isolated plasmids — extra-chromosomal DNA molecules — as well as enzymes that can function in extreme conditions .
The researchers hope the hardy organisms will yield new antioxidants , compounds that filter UV light and enzymes that could be useful to the biotech industry or to molecular biologists .
Farías says that that the findings in Laguna del Diamante may also lead to clues on how life developed .
" Low oxygen concentrations , high UV exposure and intense alkalinity , as found in this lagoon , are believed to be the hallmarks of archaic Earth , " she says .
" During our investigations at the Puna we found different new types of plasmids and biodiversity , and we are certain that Laguna del Diamante will house new findings to help us explain how life began on Earth " .

A new free - to - play game based on the Ultima role - playing series puts players in control of a medieval city .
The browser - based Lord of Ultima , a massively multiplayer strategy game , was launched Tuesday by Electronic Arts .
For lack of a better term , I 've come to call games like Lord of Ultima " Travian - likes , " due to their similarities to the German browser game .
Newcomers to the genre be warned :
These games are all about forming alliances with other players and leveraging the power of numbers to your advantage .
Play a game like Lord of Ultima as a loner and you 're doomed to the role of punching bag .
The Ultima games were created in the ' 80s by role - playing legend Richard Garriott .
After launching the pioneering MMO Ultima Online , Garriott parted ways with Origin Systems , the company he founded , leaving the Ultima line in Electronic Arts ' hands .
EA has kept the Ultima Online flame alive since 1997 , recently updating it with new content called Stygian Abyss .

Ryanair confirmed that it is working with Boeing on design changes that will allow the discount carrier to install pay toilets on 168 planes .
Last year Michael O'Leary , the aggressive , bombastic chief of the British discount carrier , said that he wanted to start charging passengers to use the toilet but that Boeing had n't developed an effective locking system yet .
At the time , some analysts said they were n't sure whether O'Leary was serious or poking fun at his own reputation for creating fees for all kinds of conveniences and services .
Ryanair currently levies booking fees , baggage handling charges , and it charges for all food and drink on board .
Apparently Ryan meant what he said .
A Ryanair spokesman told the Daily Mail , who first reported the story , that the airline wants to reduce the number of toilets on board , leaving just one available for up to 189 passengers .
That would allow the carrier to add a half dozen more seats .
" By charging for the toilets we are hoping to change passenger behavior so that they use the bathroom before or after , '' Stephen McNamara , a Ryanair spokeman , said .

Anthony Wright is executive director of Health Access California , the statewide health care consumer advocacy coalition .
He blogs daily at the Health Access Weblog and is a regular contributor to the Treatment .
Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is not the only Republican Governor trying to rewrite history , distancing himself from the new federal health reform law that mirrors the proposal he once championed for his own state .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing it , too .
To be fair , Schwarzenegger has tempered his remarks , highlighting positive elements of the health reform , and has stated a commitment to implement the new reforms .
But he and others in his Administration have also complained about the cost to the state , saying it would cost California $ 2 to 3 billion more , largely in Medicaid expenses , than the state - based reform he supported but that ultimately failed to pass two years ago .
Key California members of Congress responded , saying that any new cost the state will incur needs to be weighed against the more than $ 100 billion in benefits the state will receive .
But the Governor also just misstates the comparison .
His California health reform proposal may have been better in some respects , but two years ago Governor Schwarzenegger would have jumped at the financing arrangement the new federal law offers .
Back then , Governor Schwarzenegger ’s proposal was to expand Medicaid to all people at less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level .
Since Medicaid is a joint federal - state program , he was asking federal permission to extend California ’s standard financing arrangement , in which the feds and California covered an equal share , to more people ( mostly adults without children at home , sometimes called the “ medically indigent ” ) .

" To change government one must first change the way people think about government . "
In his article " Anatomy of the State , " Murray Rothbard defines the state as " that organization in society which attempts to maintain a monopoly of the use of force and violence in a given territorial area ; in particular , it is the only organization in society that obtains its revenue not by voluntary contribution or payment for services rendered but by coercion " ( p. 57 ) .
The state , according to Rothbard , has two fundamental properties : the use of violence , and territory .
Indeed , not only is the state made up of a body of people who claim the right to use coercive violence , but their claim to violence is , more typically , endemic to the territory over which they rule . [ 1 ]
I will come back to territory later in this essay .
First , I would like to address the other part of Rothbard 's definition of the state .
What is that " organization " that claims the monopoly of violence ?
In other words , what is the state apparatus ?
We begin to find an answer in Rothbard 's analysis of the behavior of states .
In his book For a New Liberty , Rothbard says " if you wish to know how libertarians regard the State and any of its acts , simply think of the State as a criminal band , and all of the libertarian attitudes will logically fall into place " ( p. 57 ) .
The reason Rothbard sees the state as a criminal band is simple : " [t ] he right to self - ownership asserts the absolute right of each man , by virtue of his ( or her ) being a human being , to ' own ' his or her own body ; that is , to control that body free of coercive interference " ( For a New Liberty pp. 33 –4 ) .
Thus , for Rothbard , no one may claim the right to aggress against the property , especially the body , of another person .
It is that simple .
The Rothbardian perspective is distinctive because he refuses to interpret the actions of states as belonging to a special class of human action .
Rothbard holds all people to the same standard of conduct , whereas others give the actions of states special moral considerations .
For instance , if one person who is not designated as possessing state authority threatens another person with violence in order to take their property it is considered criminal .
However , the very same action if committed by those with state authority is not considered criminal .
Nobody can deny that the actions are the same , even if the intentions are different .
The difference in these actions is simply a matter of how the actions are interpreted .
When the state commits acts of aggression , they are generally interpreted as acceptable .
When anyone else commits acts of aggression , they are generally interpreted as unacceptable .
But the actions are the same .
If one legitimates the actions of states merely by interpreting their actions differently from all other actions , we can begin to see the essence of their existence .
States exist only as a particular classification of human action .
There really is no state to speak of .
When we speak of " the state " we are not even talking about a collection of individuals , as some have called it .
We are talking about the interpretation of certain actions belonging to certain people who are generally regarded as possessing a special ability to act in ways in which others are forbidden from acting .
Instead of the " state apparatus " we really should be calling this phenomenon the " state designation . "
" State apparatus " is just a reified term that gives a false sense of solidity to the state . [ 2 ]
Here is an illustration of what I mean by " state designation . "
When President George W. Bush left office , President Obama continued the various wars started by Bush .
Obama 's recognition as president began to justify his authorization of the deaths of various people deemed enemies to the United States , whereas , if Obama was authorizing and funding the bombing of Pakistani civilians before his taking of the oath of office , it might have widely been considered heinous .
However , once Obama was given the designation of " president , " it seemed perfectly natural to most for him to authorize and fund the very same actions that would have earned him censure as a " civilian . "
The actions do not change in this case , only the interpretation of those actions .
It is the same with Bush .
If he were still funding and authorizing the bombing of Pakistani civilians , as Obama is now , Bush would be prosecuted for crimes .
Bush now lacks the designation of " government " that offered him immunity for actions that would be considered heinous now that he is a civilian .
It is the same with any other state action : the authority to act as " the state " is merely a matter of a person receiving recognition as a member of a special class .
There is no authority that exists outside of this designation .
There is no state but in the minds of people .
Acting as the State
However , by saying that the state is a way that certain actions from certain people are interpreted by the public at large , I am not saying that all actions by state functionaries are necessarily the state .
For instance , President Obama may issue an executive order , and , thus , act as the state .
However , he does not sleep as the state , smoke as the state , and walk as the state .
Only those actions of his that pertain to the accepted use of violent coercion are designated as belonging to the state itself .
This brings up another issue : states have their limits , but not where we typically think their limits fall .
When an agent of the state acts in such a manner that is not interpreted as an acceptable act of state control that person might be , in turn , prosecuted by the state itself , considering that there is no recourse to abuse other than an appeal to other state officials .
This is to say that a policeman may attack people so long as he attacks people in ways that have been deemed acceptable by people in general .
If he crosses that line , he ceases to act as the state . [ 3 ]
In the United States , the courts have the final say on these matters .
It is not true that the courts ' blessing gives an action , by the mere uttering of their verdict , the state designation .
The courts ' verdict is merely the state 's proven method of molding public opinion on a matter .
In other words : the courts make a ruling ; the people capitulate ; and the state designation is redefined so that it now includes whatever actions the court deemed appropriate .
In a way , people have subcontracted their conscience to the courts .
Here is another example that should further demonstrate the imaginary nature of state authority .
I have written a constitution .
Here it is in its entirety : " Palmer is the Boss of the world .
Do what he says , or else you will be punished .
"
These words obviously do not convey ownership of the entire world to me .
Then why do other documents convey a similar authority to others ?
The answer is very simple : because enough people recognize their claim to authority .
In other words , those who claim this authority have a designation placed upon them , one that gives them license to act with violent coercion without the expectation of reprisal .
Any attempt at reprisal will most likely lack the designation and will be met with opprobrium .
My constitution lacks the putative authority to produce the necessary acquiescence to dominate the world .
That is the only difference between my constitution and all others .
" States have their limits , but not where we typically think their limits fall . "
Territory
What of the second part of Rothbard 's definition of the state ?
What about territory ?
If people wish to follow the commands of another , it is their business .
Merely handing out orders to people does not make one a state .
State designations can be problematic , first , because they are enforced with violence , and , second , when they are tied to territory .
Territory is a means of carving out portions of humanity and natural resources for states to control .
There is no opting out of state control because state control is bound to geography , not to humanity .
For instance , a state does not claim to control the lives and property of redheads and leave all nonredheads to other states .
States ' claims over lives and property are defined geographically .
Borders occur where one state 's claim to violence ends and another state 's begins .
And thus we can see that national communities are created by states , not the other way around .
This is to say that " We the People " did not create the US government .
The US government creates the community of Americans by claiming a certain territory as its homeland .
Borders can and do move , and when borders move , national communities are redefined by a state 's claim to dominate the territory and the people they have acquired .
Therefore , not only do some claim the authority to control others ; some claim the authority to control all people and resources within an arbitrarily determined geographic area .
There is another lesson to be learned from my phony constitution above .
Constitutions are supposed to direct the actions of those holding the state designation .
Constitutions are said to restrict states , empower them , or both .
I argue that constitutions do none of these .
Constitutions could not become law unless some were already claiming the ability to tie violence to territory .
Constitutions cannot predate states ; states must predate constitutions .
Therefore , constitutions do not create and empower states .
And constitutions certainly do not restrict state authority .
As George Bush once correctly said , the constitution is just a " damned piece of paper . "
Pieces of paper cannot control the actions of humans by their mere existence .
What , then , do constitutions do ?
Well , if states exist only in the minds of people , then perhaps constitutions exist only to shape the minds of the people residing in the territory over which that constitution rules .
Perhaps constitutions exist as points of reference for people when they seek justification for the authority to act with violence that is given to certain individuals in the name of the state .
In other words , constitutions serve to make the state appear concrete , to give the appearance of a foundation to a phenomenon that only floats in the minds of people , a corporal point of reference to justify a purely discursive entity .
The actions of those with the state designation are not directed by constitutions .
They are restrained only by the same thing that gives them life : the willingness of the people in their territory to tolerate them .
Perhaps state aggression is like a liquid : something that flows when it is not contained .
Perhaps it is enough to say that aggression will always flow to the point where it is contained by the recalcitrance of people 's desire for freedom .
Thus , those with the state designation can do anything they can get away with , with or without constitutional authority .
And if those with the state designation are restrained only by the wills of those in their territory , we can see that in order to change government one must first change the way people think about government .
In summary , there are no states as they have been previously conceived .
There is only the willingness of some to place the actions of certain people in a special category of human action .
And the limits of people 's willingness to accept aggression are constantly changing .
Since states are created and directed by the boundaries of what people will accept as proper , since they exist only in the vacuum created by the public ’s tolerance for aggression , the only lasting way to change the state is to persuade the public to rethink the program .

April 12th marked the 49th anniversary of human spaceflight , when Yuri Gagarin became the first person to orbit the Earth in 1961 .
At this moment , 13 humans are currently in low - Earth orbit , aboard the International Space Station .
Several were already aboard the ISS when a Soyuz TMA - 18 brought a fresh crew up from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on April 2nd - they were later joined by the crew of the Space Shuttle Discovery on the 131st shuttle mission to date ( only three remaining launches scheduled ) .
NASA recently signed a new deal with Russia for six more round - trips to the ISS , at a cost of $ 55.8 million per seat .
Collected here are recent photos of the Space Station , its current crew , their launch vehicles , and the views from above .

PALO ALTO , Calif . — Hewlett - Packard scientists on Thursday are to report advances in the design of a new class of diminutive switches capable of replacing transistors as computer chips shrink closer to the atomic scale .
The devices , known as memristors , or memory resistors , were conceived in 1971 by Leon O. Chua , an electrical engineer at the University of California , Berkeley , but they were not put into effect until 2008 at the H.P. lab here .
They are simpler than today ’s semiconducting transistors , can store information even in the absence of an electrical current and , according to a report in Nature , can be used for both data processing and storage applications .
The researchers previously reported in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they had devised a new method for storing and retrieving information from a vast three - dimensional array of memristors .
The scheme could potentially free designers to stack thousands of switches in a high - rise fashion , permitting a new class of ultradense computing devices even after two - dimensional scaling reaches fundamental limits .
1 A new optional “ Single Window Mode ” offers awesome new usability features !
Single Window Mode is an OPTIONAL feature that can be turned on in the “ Windows ” menu all the time ( while working ) .
Floating windows like the toolbox and the dialogues will appear inside a single “ main ” window now .
No overlapping of windows or something like that anymore !
Also GIMP is a single application with only one reserved task entry in the task bar .
This feature was awaited for many years from the GIMP community !
It finally arrives with GIMP 2.8 and the single window mode feels just awesome and offers a new great workflow with GIMP !
2 New open window navigation A new navigation above an open image window will let you to switch and navigate through all open windows easily !
No more task bar switching between images .
3 Extended docking features !
Docking your dialogues has been siginificantly enhanced and offers a very dynamic way of managing your GIMP layout now .
Multi-column - docks are available now .
It is very easy to personalize your layout by just dragging the dialogs into other columns / docks etc .
4 Awesome on - canvas text editing feature !
Direct on - canvas editing of text has been made available ( no longer need to use a seperate dialog box to enter text ) !
And not just that .
Now it is possible to change text inside the bounding text box and also use certain styles !
For example select a word and press a “ Bold ” or “ Italic ” button .
You can also change the size , line - height and font !
Not just that – meanwhile it is also possible to change the color of certain words and characters .
To clear styles there is a button available that removes all given styles instantly .
This feature is absolutely great !
5 Changed file export offers a siginificantly faster workflow !
The “ Save ” and “ Save as ” function is now only used to store GIMPs own file format XCF .
No save as png or jpg is available here .
If you want to make a png version of an open file you have to export it using the new “ EXPORT ” entry .
This offers all file formats you previously know GIMP is capable of .
Also the workflow is sped up because there is a simple “ OVERWRITE ” entry after opening an image that is not xcf .
You can then simply overwrite the image with the same properties ( i.e. a JPEG quality of 98 ) .
After a XCF - file has been exported to , say , PNG you ’ll be able to export it again using the same filename and properties easily .
6 Extremely useful : Layer sets / Layer groups
You can now create groups / sets and move layers to these sets which makes the layers dialogue not so confusing when having LOTS of layers in an image .
Especially nice for web deleopers that design their websites using GIMP .
You can show and hide a set , duplicate it or move all layers in a group at once !
If a Layer group is made invisible using the eye icon but still open ( so that the layers inside the group are shown in the list ) there is a striked through eye now shown beside the layers that are inside the group to indicate that these layers are not displayed in the final projection of the image , but theoretically visible inside the layer group .
Layer masks on layer groups will sadly not be implemented in GIMP 2.8 .
7 Highly enhanced resources management GIMPs Brushes , Gradients and Pattern can be now selected and tagged using words that describe a resource .
After tagging you ’ll be able to filter the resources using these tags .
Very useful and an indeed worth to use feature when having lots of brushes loaded into GIMP .
Also : imported brushed are auto - tagged based on the directory name – thats super sweet & easy ;)
8 Rotatable Brushes Brushes can now be rotated !
Great for all kind of paintings !
9 Extended Paint dynamics
The paint dynamics have been removed from the paint tools properties .
They are now available as a dialogue that is dockable .
The Brush Dynamics have been heavily enhanced offering a wide range of new possibilites including opacity , size , tilting , rotating , color , hardness , distance , aspect ratio , rate flow and jitter .
Either use the “ Mapping Matrix ” ( see image : left ) or click the drop down and use a single view of an option to finetune it ( see image : right )
Also there are useful preset dynamics .
Most of these dynamics are only useful with a tablet but some options are also available when only using a mouse ( i.e. “ Speed ” )
Truly a heaven for painters ;)
10 Enhanced Look &Feel
Many tools do have better look and feel now .
For example Selection and Path tools now have a clearly visible verctorized line to better show the selection outline .
The moving ants are however still available to view a selection of course .
11 Brush outlines Brushes now use an outline to make the area better visible which a brush affects .
You can clearly see the brush outline in the picture where I use the vines brush .
12 Brush dynamics presets
The presets for brush dynamics are now available as a drop down field to choose the dynamics from .
This was needed because the brush dynamics get huge improvements too and are therefore more comprehensive .
13 A new “ Lock Pixels ” feature prevents erroneous painting on a layer when switching it on in the layers dialoge .
14 Calculation possibility in image - size - widgets Calculate sizes in widgets that are used to do something with size .
I.e. you can enter ( 200+20+20 ) * 2/3 and GIMP will show up 173 as a final result .
Very useful for setting guides in an image .
15 Layer modes sorted
The layer modes are now all sorted by a certain category such as modes that brighten / darken etc the image .
16 Image palette : export to CSS , PHP , Java , Python or plain text
You can now export color values in several formats .
If you choose PHP , Python or Java , the colors are declared as variables .
For CSS , unnamed classes will be created and plain text files will only contain a Hex code list .
17 Toolbox adjustments and properties Customization of the Tool window is now possible via the Edit / Settings dialog .
Tools can be sorted by priority or removed completely .
18 New / changed keyboard shortcuts New : Alt + WindowsKey+click on a layer = Alpha from layer ( you can combine this with the Shift - and CTRL - key to add or subtract selections quickly .
New : Ctrl + Shift +E = File / Export
New : Ctrl+E : quick export
Modified : Ctrl + Shift+R = Resize canvas to window size
Modified : Ctrl+R = Resize window to canvas size
19 New basic gradient available A new standard color gradient is available that seperates FG and BG - Color without smotthing the colors together .
20 Color Curves show R , G and B channels in background for better finetuning .
21 Misc smaller changes - Canvas edges are now “ magnetic ”
- Support for JPEG2000
- Support for 16 bit RAW import
22 GIMP and GEGL GEGL , the powerful node - based graphics kit that will enable features for non-destructive image - editing in the future , has been completely integrated into GIMP now and is also responsible for image projection .
That means the final image composition you see is done by GEGL .
23 GIMP 2.8 will be licenced under the Lesser GPL v3 license .
24 Zoom hotkeys
In older GIMP versions a keystroke on “ 1 ” brings the zoom - factor to 100 % .
Now you can also use the keys 2,3,4 and 5 to get an instant zoom of the image to 200/400/800 and 1600 % .
25 Intuitive new slider widgets
With the new slider widgets it is possible to alter values in different ways .
You can enter the values directly by clicking into the value number to change it .
But if you hover the slider at the top edge you ’ll be able to jump to a specific value directly , without using your keyboard .
If you hover the new slider widget in the middle or bottom part it is possible to move the slider to the left and right to finetune your adjustments in smaller steps .
This is a very intuitive addition , and you ’ll not want to give it away after trying it out yourself ;)
26 Import Screenshots of a webpage With a new option found in File / Create / From Webpage you ’ll be able to load a screenshot of the entire page into GIMP .
The new option uses webkit to render the website ( Webkit is the engine thats also used in Chromium / Chrome / Safari / Epiphany ) .
It ’s a nice addition for web developers and designers , because you do n’t need to use other plugins ( for instance “ Screengrab ” for Mozilla Firefox ) to shoot the entire website and not just a screenshot that is limited to the size of your monitor / screen .
27 PDF - Export
This new feature is still experimental .
You ’ll be able to export stuff as pdf file that includes text as vector graphics and embeds fonts .
It also tries to convert things to vector graphics where possible .
However the feature is not completed and there is still work left to be done to include images , which did not work for me .
28 Multiple pdf pages
The above described feature also works for multi-page pdf-files .
To generate multiple pdf pages you need to go to File / Create / PDF / Multipage PDF .
Then add a file you want to be a page in pdf format .
Do it multiple times and GIMP will create a pluti page pdf file for you .
As above – this is also experimental , because some image are not included and text is sometimes wrongly set .
29 Tool presets
With this cool new improvement you ’re able to save all the specific values for a tool .
For instance you can create a star brush with a slight white - yellowish color and random angle ( wich can be used to create sparkle on objects ) and save it to the tool presets to directly access in future work .
Or you can save special sized ( for example 1200 px width ) rectangles that are maybe commonly used for web designers or something like that .
The presets store lots of things which you ’re able to define – you can exclude storage of FG / BG color for instance .
30 Merge layer group Nothing more to say – you ’re able to merge down a complete group of layers that are in a set to create everything on a single layer .
31 New tool : Cage transform
The tool makes it possible to create a cage ( more or less some kind of a selection ) around an area that you want transform seperately .
After that you can move the points ( like the points you set using the paths tool ) you set before to transform the cage in the way you like .
The transformation works inside the cage only , so there are sometimes clearly seen edges inside the image you transform .
This has to be worked seperately on ( i.e. using the clone tool to overpaint or get rid of these edges ) .
Nevertheless the new tool is awesome and you can see it in action in our youtube video
32 Feedback on long computations
When working on stuff that needs some more time to compute ( for instance when working with the new cage transform tool ) GIMP now gives you feedback with a neat new overlay that displays the time left for the action you want to perform .
33 GIMPs resources are being revamped – as a first step there will be new brushes that are more useful than the old ones .
That gives GIMP a more modern look !
34 ALT + LayerClick ( in Ubuntu you maybe need to click ALT + WindowsKey +LayerClick ) makes a selection from alpha channel .
You ’re also able to make selection operations ( add , intersect , subtract ) with different alpha channels from certain layers !
35 Choosing the Language GIMP uses is now no longer only OperatingSystem dependent .

Interface >
Language will do it for you now !
He was the editor of the Sun and one of the most influential people in Britain .
He was also drunk – every night for 24 years .
David Yelland recalls the lowest point of his life , and the long road to recovery
David Yelland .
Photograph : David Levene
Happiness is a habit , or at least it is to me , but for a long time I had the habit of unhappiness , the repeat behaviour we call high - functioning alcoholism .
For 24 years I was drunk nearly every night .
Yet my career spiralled upwards and in the eyes of the world I was a great success .
My story is not unusual .
The relationship between material " success " and addiction is scarily close .
When I took my first drink , aged 16 , it made me feel utterly free and at ease .
I felt I could conquer the world .
I had been a shy child .
I had been told I was adopted and then , a few years later , I lost my hair through alopecia .
At school I would lurk behind prefabs avoiding the boys who might pull off my wig and throw it around .
They often did .
The euphoria that came with my first drink seemed to make everything OK .
It seemed to crowd the sadness from my head .
I chased that feeling to the extreme .
But the truth was I never found that high again ; addicts never do , though many die trying .
I had a wonderful Yorkshire childhood , growing up in places like Bridlington , where my grandparents ran a seaside hotel .
Dad worked for Barclays Bank and I never thought of them as adopted parents .
We were blessed with Paul , born in 1965 , my younger brother .
But there was an ambition in me , a huge determination to prove the world wrong .
It took me ages to get into journalism .
I was so shy I could hardly speak at interview .
Yet somehow I went from a local newspaper to the editorship of the Sun in 14 years .
How did I do that if I was so drunk ?
The answer is I did it because I was so drunk : the two habits went hand in hand .
My habit was to work through the day and drink through the night .
My system was so strong and my ambition so acute that somehow it worked .
I got the top job at the Sun in 1998 when I was 35 .
I had already been deputy editor of the New York Post .
In front of me was five years running Britain 's biggest paper and a spell at Harvard Business School .
In 2002 I was listed as the 22nd most powerful man in the country .
I cannot speak for other editors and I have no wish to upset my former colleagues , but the Sun was a dangerous place for me to be , because my addictive traits were big box office .
I was actually paid to rush to judgment , paid to lash out and attack – it was perfect territory for the drunk .
I had 320 people on staff who were paid to agree with me .
I had the prime minister on the phone agreeing with me .
I had a car , a driver , accounts at the best clubs and hotels around the world .
When I went out and disgraced myself in public – as I did many times – I could silence the diary columns by calling a fellow editor .
There are stories I could tell that you would n't believe .
I was untouchable .
I was cocooned and protected , a " made man " , an unelected member of a tiny elite that runs the country and never has to pay a price .
Only I did pay a price .
Or others did .
I had a wife , Tania , at home with breast cancer and a son to whom I was devoted but whom I did n't see enough .
Just before we returned from New York I had found out my natural father was an Irish radical with a mistrust of the British , and my mum a children 's writer .
They had lived in bohemian style in North Yorkshire , they had both marched at Aldermaston .
For the first time I understood myself .
Yet here I was slam - bang in the middle of what Hillary Clinton once dubbed " the right - wing conspiracy " .
I felt like a double agent , so I began to act like one .
I took homophobia out of the paper entirely ( after a bad start in 1998 when we ran the front - page splash : " Are we being run by a GAY MAFIA ? " ) .
I wrote leaders defending Islam after 9/11 .
I swung the paper behind the Irish peace process : I told Mo Mowlam there was radical Galway blood beating in my heart .
I ran leaders on art , poetry , Iris Murdoch and the BBC .
I began to fall in love with the very things I was supposed to oppose .
I was drunk and I was dangerous , but I was having fun .
But I was intensely uncomfortable at the Sun .
My job was to pick out people the country could judge to make us all feel better .
One day it would be a paedophile , another a fallen politician .
But what right did I have to judge ?
What right do any of us ?
As an adopted child I knew how close I had come to being in care .
The dividing line between privilege and underclass is perilously narrow .
In recovery I have found this to be even more the case .
By 2005 , I was out of the Sun and back home from Harvard .
The drink had taken my marriage and now Tania 's cancer was terminal .
Our son , Max , had to come first .
At about 10 pm on 18 July 2005 , I rang Promis , a rehabilitation centre in Kent , and spoke to Dr Robert Lefever , its founder and the man who saved my life .
They sent a car .
In the early hours I arrived .
Two men came out of the front door and stood either side of the car .
They led me inside where a nurse took bloods and I was examined .
I was also searched .
I had a BlackBerry with the mobile numbers of most of the Cabinet , the Murdoch family and a chunk of the British elite .
It was taken off me and locked away .
I was taken to a room in which two other addicts were asleep .
When I tried to open a window I saw it was locked – from the outside .
I felt my life was over .
I felt more alone that night than I ever wish to again .
Yet this was the beginning of a wonderful future .
I was saved just in time .
On 8 September 2006 , Tania died after a most incredible battle .
I did not drink .
I was with our son .
Soon I acquired new habits .
The habit of recovery and that of fatherhood , the habit of healthy work and , in time , the habit of being a loving partner .
These are the habits of happiness for me .
I began to write , too .
I acquired the habit of art .
But that is a whole other story .
They are n’t old enough to legally buy a beer .
They ca n’t vote or join the Army , and they can barely get a driver ’s license .
But Zach and Payden Hall , 17 and 15 years old , run their own political action committee : Do Hard Things 2010 .
The two registered their PAC with the Federal Election Commission just two weeks ago , and already have a website , complete with a graphic - laden introduction urging young conservatives to become more politically active .
The Halls are also emblematic of a small , but growing trend of young people — particularly college students — creating and operating federal PACs .
“ Right now , I ca n’t vote , ” Zach Hall said .
“ If I call my legislator , I wo n’t have a voice , but I decided young people do have a voice … they can volunteer for candidates who support the issues they support . ”
The goal of the Do Hard Things 2010 PAC is not to make contributions to candidates , but to help fund a project called Camp Nashville and “ get conservative teenagers to come to Nashville and help out in primary races so they can go back to their home states for the general election , ” he added .
Using a political action committee to fund such a project is rare but not unheard of .
Nor is it against the law .
In Hall ’s case , the idea stems from the family ’s campaign experiences .
Zach volunteered for his first campaign at age 9 .
The family as a whole has volunteered for a number of campaigns in multiple states .
And in 2008 , the Halls helped run their father David ’s unsuccessful campaign for Tennessee ’s state Senate .
Because Zach was not “ of legal age , ” his older siblings , Dymon and Allie Hall , ages 22 and 20 , filed to be the PAC ’s official treasurer and assistant treasurer , respectively , with the FEC , said Allie Hall .
While the older siblings handled the FEC paperwork , all four share responsibility when it comes to running the PAC .
And despite the political savvy of the Hall family , setting up the PAC was not easy .
“ The hardest part is just getting started , ” Allie Hall explained .
“ Initially when we just got started we knew we had a general idea about what we wanted to do . ”
They knew far less about the numerous federal forms required to establish a PAC and the need to open a related bank account .
“ I remember going to many different banks , ” Zach Hall said .
“ When you said you wanted to fill out an account for a federal PAC they give you blank stares . ”
Just because creating a PAC is complicated does n’t mean children and young adults can’t successfully sustain them , though .
For example , one of the largest college student - run PACs is Students for a New American Politics ( SNAP ) , founded by a group Yale undergraduates in the wake of the 2004 election .
“ The founders considered starting a nonprofit , because we generally give money directly to students , not campaigns , but the lawyer [ they consulted ] said because the work was explicitly political … it made more sense ” to form a PAC , explained John Riley , a senior at Yale and SNAP ’s communications director .
“ Abiding to the rules PACs abide by ensures we would n’t cross any legal boundaries . ”
SNAP has raised nearly $ 104,000 since its founding in 2005 , according to a Center for Responsive Politics review of federal campaign finance records , and during the last three campaign cycles , it has contributed more than $ 57,000 to federal candidates , nearly all Democrats .
However , SNAP does n’t make direct cash contributions , but rather it makes in - kind contributions by providing stipends to financially enable college students to work on campaigns .
“ Virtually all of the money we raise goes straight to students , ” Riley said .
“ We will endorse candidates and then run a fellowship program and assign them to the campaigns and fund them up to $ 2,500 . ”
Other student - run PACs raise more modest sums than SNAP , and often coalesce around partisan campus clubs like college Republicans or college Democrats .
The College Democrats of New York is described on its website as “ the official college outreach arm of the Democratic National Committee … affiliated with the College Democrats of America . ”
However , CDNY does not receive any funds from the state or national party .
Instead , it raises funds independently through its PAC .
Like SNAP , the CDNY PAC helps enable students to work on campaigns by reimbursing travel and other costs , explained Michael Shillawski , a senior at Cornell University and treasurer of the PAC .
The PAC has raised around $ 5,000 since its inception and in addition to in - kind contributions has made one direct contribution to Rep. Bill Owens ( D - N.Y. ) , elected during a special election in 2009 .
Like the Hall family , college students face hurdles when setting up a PAC .
“ There is n’t a real quality guidebook as to how to start a PAC , ” Schillawski said .
“ It really requires someone who is willing to learn the ropes and pour through what materials are available . ”
But running a college PAC also presents its own set of challenges .
College organizations have to contend with near 100 percent turnover every four years , something that can make them difficult to sustain .
“ We basically have to find freshman and get them really involved , to get them to stay for four years to keep the organization going — from communications , to the political arm , to fundraising , ” Riley said .
The complexity of a PAC means that there is “ the constant requirement that you have to train the next group to work , to understand the regulations so that they can stay in compliance , ” Schillawski said .
“ There is a lot of institutional knowledge that needs to be kept , and the difficult thing for any type of college organization , especially PACs , is we do n’t have the resources to go out and retain an accountant . ”
Despite the challenges , more groups are starting PACs .
University of California - Santa Barbara is home to the newest college PAC .
The College Democrats established the UCSB Campus Democrats PAC in mid-March .
“ Many organizations express wanting to have a PAC , but not many get around to doing it , ” said David Cunningham , a sophomore at UCSB and the group ’s treasurer .
The PAC was started mainly “ to keep us out of jail , ” Cunningham said .
“ We had a big fundraiser to raise a couple thousand dollars a couple weeks ago .
It ’s pretty much essential …mainly , we were just getting serious about fundraising and doing more things . ”
The UCSB College Democrats frequently work with the local and county party organization , and occasionally hold joint fundraisers .
“ Without a PAC , ” Cunningham explained , many activities “ can be illegal . ”
The PAC predominately targets local Democrats as potential donors , and having a PAC enhances the group ’s legitimacy : “ There ’s plenty of money out there that Democrats want to give to college students , so its an excellent way for us to tap into those resources , ” Cunningham said .
The UCSB Campus Democrats PAC spends most of its money to fund voter registration and outreach programs , and to get new college students involved with the group .
“ We ’re always trying to grow , always trying to register voters .
That ’s the most important thing we do : get students out to vote , ” Cunningham said .
While having a PAC may increase legitimacy and increase the fundraising capacity of college groups , USCB Political Science Professor Eric Smith does n’t see PACs run by students as becoming a major factor .
“ I think they ’re doing it more out of curiosity and interest than to be a major financial force and influence , ” he said .
“ I talked with the folks who set up the PACs here and it was a pretty interesting thing to do .
I do n’t think they see themselves raising tens of thousands of dollars .
They ’re concerned about getting all the paperwork right . ”
However , there is potential to raise thousands , especially in California .
Besides contributions , the UCSB College Democrats also receive money from the state California Democratic Party to register voter through the so - called “ bounty program . ”
Under the program , third - party groups like the College Democrats go out and independently register voters .
For every voter that registers as a Democrat , the state party will pay the College Democrats a $ 3.50 “ bounty . ”
“ We register voters , and if the person checks Democrat then we turn the card or a copy of the card into the state Democratic Party .
Then they will give us a bounty , ” Cunningham explained .
The California Republican Party run a similar program .
“ The program is an effective tool for local activists to register voters and raise funds for their own organizational activities , ” Tenoch Flores , the communications director for the California Democratic Party wrote to in an e-mail Capital Eye .
“ Participating organizations must be registered with the state party and are required to verify that new voter information is both accurate and truthful .
There is a strong incentive for ensuring high - quality new voter acquisitions — mostly that we need accurate and reliable numbers in order to build a registration advantage . ”
Phone and e-mail messages left with California Republican Party were not returned .
In at least 8 states such programs are illegal , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
What makes the program controversial is the incentive for fraud .
Because third - parties are paid per voter registration card instead of a flat payment , there are incentives to turn in forged voter registration cards .
“ The good news is it ’s providing a monetary incentive to give reason for people to go out and register people .
And registering people is a good thing .
The bad news is that like any monetary incentive it can encourage people to cheat , ” said Meredith McGehee , policy director for the Campaign Legal Center .
Perhaps the biggest takeaway of the student - run PAC phenomenon is that it is evidence of the close relationship between college students and the political parties .
Like the California bounty program , PACs are becoming another way for politicos and the major parties to fund college students who frequently participate in the canvassing and voter registration all but necessary to win campaigns .
“ A lot of politicians understand the relationship between college students and their campaigns , we go out every weekend and canvass for them , ” explained Schillawski .
“ So they are often willing to cut a small check to us to develop that grassroots network .
Being a PAC adds a legitimacy to that relationship , so they are comfortable making a contribution to the PAC , and we can make in - kind contributions — which is something a 501 ( c ) 3 [ nonprofit ] ca n’t do . ”
As young politicos across the political spectrum continue demonstrating an avid interest in the mechanics of electioneering , their interest could translate into rise in the number of PACs run by young people .
And that ’s fine by them .
“ If young people … have a passion in them , ” Zach Hall said , “ if they want to make their voices heard , I think starting a PAC is a great avenue for that passion . ”

Nine members of Congress have written to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asking her to press the Honduran government to stop violent repression against supporters of overthrown president Manuel Zelaya .
The letter was signed by Reps. Jan Schakowsky D - Ill. , James McGovern , D - Mass. , Raul Grijalva , D - Ariz. , Sam Farr , D - Calif. , Barbara Lee , D - Calif. , Maxine Waters , D - Calif. , James Oberstar , D - Minn. , Michael Honda , D - Calif. , and John Conyers , D - Mich .
It calls for Clinton to “ fully investigate reports of severe rights abuses in Honduras , ” and to pressure the administration of President Porfirio “ Pepe ” Lobo into putting a stop to these abuses .
Since Lobo was inaugurated on January 27 , three resistance activists , including two labor union leaders and the daughter of a founder of the since - disbanded Communist Party of Honduras , have been killed , and there have been many beatings , rapes and various kinds of police harassment .
The resistance movement that arose after the April 28 , 2009 , coup has changed its main thrust from restoring Zelaya , whose term ended on January 27 , to the convoking of a constituent assembly to re-write the Honduran constitution to give more power to the people .
When Zelaya was allowed to leave his sanctuary in the Brazilian embassy on January 27 , a throng estimated at 100,000 to 300,000 people ( in a country of 7.5 million ) accompanied him to the airport , showing the degree to which the unions , peasant , indigenous , minority , youth and other popular sectors are alienated from the Lobo government and able to mobilize for their goals .
They have sworn that they will fight against any attempts under Lobo to roll back progressive policies of the Zelaya government including land reform , increased rights for workers , women , minorities and others , the promised closing of the U.S. military base at Palmerola , and investigations into human rights violations by former regimes during the Contra Wars of the 1980s .
This represents a threat to the Honduras power elite of wealthy landowners , bankers , businessmen and military officers , who have long been closely linked to U.S. geopolitical and economic interests and , specifically , to the CIA , military and political ultra-right in the United States .
During the Contra Wars , Honduras was the main base of operations for the CIA and other U.S. agencies who were working to overthrow the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and prevent the left from coming to power in Guatemala and El Salvador .
Many Honduran military and civilian figures were involved in the Contra Wars , and Zelaya ’s promise to investigate such things was probably one of the reasons he was overthrown .
Honduran authorities claim that the killing of political activists could just be a result of their country ’s high crime rate , and point out that a couple of right - wing figures have also been assassinated .
However , the methods of killing are highly reminiscent of the right - wing death squads : men in cars with license plates removed pulling up and shooting someone and then zooming away , or people being kidnapped , strangled or otherwise murdered and their bodies then dumped from cars in some conspicuous place .
Clinton was in Latin America last week on a tour that had the purpose , among other things , of trying to line up Latin American support for stronger sanctions against Iran and for restoration of diplomatic ties with Honduras .
But Clinton butted heads with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim , who pointedly stated to media that he did not think it a good idea to push Iran into a corner .
Other governments were reluctant to extend full recognition to Lobo , who came to power through elections run by the ultra - right - wing de-facto government of Roberto Micheletti , who had been installed as president after the military had thrown out and exiled President Manuel Zelaya and who had been boycotted by much of the Honduran left .
Clinton , however , urged full restoration of ties with Lobo ’s administration by the other hemispheric countries .
She announced that all U.S. aid would now be restored to Honduras .
She left many scratching their heads in puzzlement by congratulating Lobo for coming to power in a process that was “ clean ” and “ without violence . ”
Clinton professed puzzlement of her own as to why some other governments are reluctant to restore full ties with the Lobo regime .

Java Anti-Patterns
This page collects some bad code that may not look so obviously bad to beginners .
Beginners often struggle with the language syntax .
They also have little knowledge about the standard JDK class library and how to make the best use of it .
In fact I have collected all examples from everyday junior code .
I have modified the original code to give it example character and such that it highlights the problems .
Many of these problems can easily be detected by SonarQube .
I strongly recommend this tool .
Some of these may seem like micro-optimization , premature optimization without profiling or constant factor optimizations .
But performance and memory wasted in thousands of these small places adds up quickly and will grind an application to a crawl .
And when I say application , I mean a server - side application running on an application server .
That 's what I do for a living .
On desktop GUI applications the situation may not be as bad .
But then , what 's the only relevant platform that runs client - side Java applications ?
Android .
An embedded platform with very limited resources ( memory ! ) .
Here even constant factor optimizations pay off quickly .
Like iterating over arrays instead of lists .
If you are interested in how to pogram compiler friendly , look at the JDK Performance Wiki .
In the end a lot of your application 's performance depends on the overall quality of your code .
By the way you should never underestimate the importance of memory footprint .
I can't stress that enough .
I have seen too many applications with crazy garbage collection overhead and out of memory errors .
Even though garbage collection is quite fast , most server - side code 's scalability is dominated and limited primarily by its memory use per request / transaction and the request / transaction duration .
Improving either of these by a constant factor will directly give you a higher throughput by that factor .
If the factor is 10 , it can mean supporting 100 or 1000 users , which can make all the difference to your customer .
Compare these scenarios ( assume 100 MB young generation ) :
Scenario thread pool tx duration => max .
tx / s mem / tx => garbage / min GC / min base 30 100 ms 300 50 KB 900 MB 9 slower 30 1000 ms 30 50 KB 90 MB 0.9 more mem 30 100 ms 300 500 KB 9 GB 90 excess mem 30 100 ms 300 5 MB 90 GB 900
In the slower scenario the transaction duration is 10 times longer .
This immediately cuts the maximum number of transactions per second by the factor of 10 as well ( limited thread - pool , limited CPU resources ) .
In the more mem scenario each transaction uses 10 times as much memory .
This directly bumps up the number of garbage collections to over one per second , which causes non-negligible overhead .
Using much more memory like in scenario excess mem this would lead to 15 collections per second , leaving 66 ms per collection which is clearly not enough .
The system will thrash .
Also 66ms is below the transaction duration of 100 ms , so many running transactions will still hold onto memory , preventing it from collection , and causing a propagation of that memory to older generations .
This means the older generations will start growing and will need a large ( slow ) collection sooner .
The application in that scenario no longer performs .
I think this clearly shows how bad excess memory consumption is , compared to just slow code .
All your superfast code can't help you when you allocate too much memory .
String concatenation
String s = " " ; for ( Person p : persons ) { s += " , " + p.getName ( ) ; } s = s.substring ( 2 ) ; //remove first comma
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder( persons.size ( ) * 16 ) ; // well estimated buffer for ( Person p : persons ) { if ( sb.length ( ) > 0 ) sb.append ( " , " ) ; // the JIT optimizes the if away out of the loop ( peeling ) sb.append(p.getName ) ; }
Lost StringBuffer performance

Not taking advantage of immutable objects
zero = new Integer ( 0 ) ; return Boolean.valueOf ( " true " ) ;

zero = Integer.valueOf(0 ) ; return Boolean .
TRUE ;
XML parsers are for sissies
int start = xml.indexOf ( " < name > " ) + " < name > " . length ( ) ; int end = xml.indexOf ( " < / name > " ) ;
String name = xml.substring ( start , end ) ;
SAXBuilder builder = new SAXBuilder ( false ) ; Document doc = doc = builder.build ( new StringReader ( xml ) ) ; String name = doc.getRootElement () .get Child ( " name " ).getText ( ) ;
Assembling XML with String operations
String name = ... String attribute = ... String xml = " < root > " + " < name att=\ " " + attribute + " \ " > " + name +" </name > " + " </root > " ;
Element root = new Element ( " root " ) ; root.setAttribute ( " att " , attribute ) ; root.setText ( name ) ; Document doc = new Documet ( ) ; doc.setRootElement( root ) ; XmlOutputter out = new XmlOutputter ( Format.getPrettyFormat ( ) ) ; String xml = out.outputString ( root ) ;
The XML encoding trap
String xml = FileUtils.readTextFile ( " my.xml " ) ;
char is not int
int i = in.read ( ) ; char c = ( char ) i ;
Assuming char represents one character
" \uD83D\uDC31" .length ( ) == 2
Platform dependent filenames
File tmp = new File ( " C:\\Temp\\1.tmp " ) ; File exp = new File ( " export-2013-02-01T12:30.txt " ) ; File f = new File ( path +'/'+ filename ) ;
File tmp = File.createTempFile ( " myapp " , " tmp " ) ; File exp = new File ( " export-2013-02-01_1230.txt " ) ; File f = new File ( path + File.separatorChar + filename ) ; // or even better File dir = new File ( path ) ; File f = new File ( dir , filename ) ;
Undefined encoding
Reader r = new FileReader ( file ) ; Writer w = new FileWriter ( file ) ; Reader r = new InputStreamReader ( inputStream ) ; Writer w = new OutputStreamWriter ( outputStream ) ; String s = new String ( byteArray ) ; // byteArray is a byte [ ] byte [ ] a = string.get Bytes ( ) ;

InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream ( new FileInputStream ( file ) ) ;

Infinite heap
byte[ ] pdf = toPdf ( file ) ;
File pdf = toPdf( file ) ;
Infinite time
Socket socket = ... socket.connect ( remote ) ; InputStream in = socket.getInputStream ( ) ; int i = in.read ( ) ;
Socket socket = ... socket.connect( remote , 20000 ) ; // fail after 20s InputStream in = socket.getInputStream ( ) ; socket.setSoTimeout( 15000 ) ; int i = in.read ( ) ;
Assuming a cheap timer call
for (... ) { long t = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) ; long t = System.nanoTime ( ) ; Date d = new Date ( ) ; Calendar c = new GregorianCalendar ( ) ; }
This is a real memory waster .
The repeated concatenation of strings in a loop causes excess garbage and array copying .
Moreover it is ugly that the resulting string has to be fixed for an extra comma .
Amazingly in 2016 there are still people that believe that the compiler optimizes this somehow .
It does n't even in Java 8 !
Some morons have even benchmarked the execution time to " prove " that it 's fine .
No , it is n't fine to produce lots of unnecessary garbage .
If you still do n't believe me , then I can't help your ignorance either .
This looks like optimized code , but it is n't optimal yet .
So why do you optimize in the first place if you then fail to do it properly ?
Go all the way !
The most obvious mistake is the string concatenation in line 3 .
In line 4 appending awould be faster than appending a String .
An also major omission is the missing length initialization of the buffer which may incur unnecessary resizing ( array copying ) .
In JDK 1.5 and above ainstead ofshould have been used : because it is only a local variable the implicit synchronization is overkill .
Actually , using simple String concatenation compiles to almost perfect byte code : it 's only missing the length initialization .
None of the above comparisons is wrong - but neither are they really good .
Themethod is overkill and too verbose .
Theoperator tests for object identity which is probably not what you want .
Themethod is the way to go , but reversing the constant and variable would give you extra safety ifisThe return type of themethod is .
A conversion tois wanted .
These two examples in fact do the conversion .
But the first incurs the penalty of a concatenation operation ( translates to ) .
And the second creates an intermediate Integer wrapper .
The correct way of doing it is one of theseLearn how to use the API without allocating unnecessary objects .
as well asare immutable .
Thus it does n't make sense to create several objects that represent the same value .
Those classes have built - in caches for frequently used instances .
In the case of Boolean there are even only two possible instances .
The programmer can take advantage of this :
This naive XML parsing only works with the most simple XML documents .
It will however fail if a ) the name element is not unique in the document , b ) the content of name is not only character data c ) the text data of name contains escaped characters d ) the text data is specified as a CDATA section e ) the document uses XML namespaces .
XML is way too complex for string operations .
There is a reason why XML parsers like Xerces are a over one megabyte jar files !
The equivalent with JDOM is : Many beginners are tempted to produce XML output like shown above , by using String operations ( which they know so well and which are so easy ) .
Indeed it is very simple and almost beautiful code .
However it has one severe shortcoming :
It fails to escape reserved characters .
So if the variables name or attribute contain any of the reserved characters , & , " or ' this code would produce invalid XML .
Also as soon as the XML uses namespaces , String operations may quickly become nasty and hard to maintain .
Now XML should be assembled in a DOM .
The JDom library is quite nice for that .
It is a very bad idea to read an XML file and store it in a String .
An XML specifies its encoding in the XML header .
But when reading a file you have to know the encoding beforehand !
Also storing an XML file in a String wastes memory .
All XML parsers accept an InputStream as a parsing source and they figure out the encoding themselves correctly .
So you can feed them an InputStream instead of storing the whole file in memory temporarily .
The byte order ( big- endian , little - endian ) is another trap when a multi - byte encoding ( such as UTF - 8 ) is used .
XML files may carry a byte order mark at the beginning that specifies the byte order .
XML parsers handle them correctly .
The above code assumes that you can create a character from a number .
It 's already wrong technically : int is signed , whereas char is unsigned .
A char is simply 16 bits of UTF - 16 encoded Unicode .
Please note that Unicode defines way more code points than fit into 16 bits ( Unicode 9.0 is at 271792 code points vs. 65536 16 - bit numbers ) .
Code points like popular emojis are way beyond the BMP and are represented by more than one char even in Java !
Anyway , in Java use Reader / Writer or CharsetEncoder / CharsetDecoder instead to convert between characters and their byte representation ( see below ) .
The escape sequence represents the Unicode code point 0x1F431 in UTF - 16 as 2 chars .
So even though this is only a single cat face symbol on the screen ( 🐱 ) , the length ( ) method returns 2 .
Never hard code paths in a filesystem .
Different platforms have different conventions , and you can never be sure that a hard coded path is actually available on a random system .
Use API calls to create temporary files .
Mind that different file systems have different restrictions on what makes a valid file name .
Here the exp file contains a colon character , which is illegal on Windows file systems .
When you construct absolute or relative paths in the filesystem , be careful of the platform dependent separator character .
Each line of the above converts betweenandusing the default platform encoding .
The code behaves differently depending on the platform it runs on .
This is harmful if the data flows from one platform to another .
It is considered bad practice to rely on the default platform encoding at all .
Conversions should always be performed with a defined encoding .
The above code reads a file byte by byte .
Everycall on the stream will cause a native ( JNI ) call to the native implementation of the filesystem .
Depending on the implementation this may cause a syscall to the operating system .
JNI calls are expensive and so are syscalls .
The number of native calls can be reduced dramatically by wrapping the stream into a .
Reading 1 MB of data fromwith the above code took about 1 second on my laptop .
With the fixed code below it was down to 60 milliseconds !
That 's a 94 % saving .
This also applies for output streams of course .
And it is true not only for the file system but also for sockets .
As demonstrated OutputStreamWriter uses memory for each call to its write ( ) methods because char to byte conversion is not trivial .
Always buffer those writes :
For reading and writing a text file , the correct chain of streams becomes : PrintWriter never throws IOException .
Even if the disk is full .
Even if you continue to call println ( ) one million times after the disk has been full .
Not even when you call .
You need to explicitly callto test for problems .
And then you still do n't get an exception that would tell you what the heck happened .
All you get is a boolean saying that at some point during your writes there was a problem and your file is now corrupt .
And here lies the problem .
Silent file corruption is nothing anybody wants .
Either produce a complete file or do n't produce any at all and error out .
PrintWriter was invented for network I /O , not file I /O .
It is used by Servlets for example .
Another fine application for it is logging , when you really do n't care if your logging produces I /O errors .
It is used in the JDBC API for example .
How to avoid writing corrupt files :
Here a method creates a PDF file from some input and returns the binary PDF data as a byte array .
This code assumes that the generated file is small enough to fit into the available heap memory .
If this code can not make this 100 % sure then it is vulnerable to an out of memory condition .
Especially if this code is run server - side which usually means many parallel threads .
Bulk data must never be handled with byte arrays .
Streams should be used and the data should be spooled to disk or a database .
A similar anti-pattern is to buffer streaming input from an " untrusted " ( security term ) source .
Such as buffering data that arrives on a network socket .
If the application does n't know how much data will be arriving it must make sure that it keeps an eye on the size of the data .
If the amount of buffered data exceeds sane limits an error condition ( exception ) should be signalled to the caller , rather than driving the application against the wall by letting it run into an out of memory condition .
The above code has two blocking calls that use unspecified timeouts .
Imagine if the timeout is infinite .
That may cause the application to hang forever .
Generally it is an extremely stupid idea to have infinite timeouts in the first place .
Infinity is extremely long .
Even by the time the Sun turns into a red giant ( it explodes ) , it 's still a looong way to Infinity .
The average programmer dies at 72 .
There is simplyreal - world situation , where we want to wait that long .
Infinite timeout is just an absurd thing .
Use an hour , day , week , month , 1 year , 10 years .
But not Infinity .
To connect to a remote machine I personally find 20 seconds plenty of timeout .
A human is not even as patient and would cancel the operation before .
While there is a nice override for the connect ( ) method that takes a timeout parameter , there is no such thing for the read ( ) .
But you can modify a Socket 's socket timeout before every blocking call .
( Not just once !
You can set different timeouts for different situations . )
The socket will throw an exception on blocking calls after that timeout .
Also frameworks that communicate over the network should provide an API to control these timeouts and use sensible default values .
Infinity is not sensible - it 's insane and drives you mad .
Who came up with this absolutely useless infinity timeout anyway ?
Unfortunately the file system API ( FileInputStream , FileChannel , FileDescriptor , File ) provides no way to set timeouts on file operations .
That 's very unfortunate .
Because these are the most common blocking calls in a Java application : writing to stdout / stderr and reading from stdin are file operations , and writing to log files is common .
Operations on the standard input / output streams depend directly on other processes outside of our Java VM .
If they decide to block forever , so will reads / writes to these streams in our application .
Disk I/ O is a limited resource for which all processes on a system compete .
There is no guarantee that a simple read / write on a file is quick .
It may incur unspecified wait time .
Also today remote file systems are ubiquitous .
Disks may be on a SAN / NAS , or file systems may be mounted over the network ( NFS , AFS , CIFS / Samba ) .
So a filesystem call may actually be a network call : too bad that we do n't have the power of the network API here !
So if the OS decides that the timeout for the write is 60 seconds you 're stuck with it .
It is a failure to assume that any disk / file operation is fast , or even remotely instantaneous .
An application can do the user a favour by assuming that a file operation can takes seconds .
So it 's best avoided or done asynchronously ( in background ) .
Solutions to this problem are : adequate buffering and queueing / asynchronous processing .
Creating a new Date or Calendar performs a syscall to obtain the current time .
On Unix / Linux this is the syscall gettimeofday which is considered " extremely cheap " .
Well , extremely cheap only compared to other syscalls !
In that it usually does n't require a switch from userspace to kernelspace but is rather implemented as a read from a memory mapped page .
Still calls to gettimeofday are expensive compared to normal code execution .
The exact penalty of the call strongly depends on the architecture and even configuration ( modern x86 systems have numerous timers that can be used by the OS : HPET , TSC , RTC , ACPI , clock chips etc. ) .
On my Linux - 2.6.37 - rc7 system the timer calls also seem to be synchronised over the system .
That means the total available bandwidth of ~ 800 calls per ms is shared by all threads / processes .
Consequently my dual core running with 2 threads was able to make ~400 calls per ms per thread .
( Thanks to J. Davies for that hint )
And last but not least the resolution of this timer is not infinite .
At best it is milliseconds , but it may well be rather something like 25 to 50 milliseconds with a large jitter .
Modern Linux system can easily achieve the full ms resolution in System.currentTimeMillis .
But that has not always been the case .
System.nanoTime will certainly not have its full theoretical resolution : 1ns = 10 - 9s which corresponds to 1GHz .
So on a CPU with 3GHz this would allow ~3 instructions to execute the call , which is obviously not enough .
I measured a large jitter between 800ns and 1000000ns ( 1 ms ) .
Clearly calling gettimeofday every 100 nano seconds is wasteful .
Most of the time you do n't need the current time as precicely .
Caching it outside of the loop is trivial .
This way you only access the timer once .
You can still decide to clone the Date instance , if you really need different objects .
Cloning is extremely cheap compared to a timer access ( factor 50 on my system ) .
Date d = new Date( ) ; for ( E entity : entities ) { entity .doSomething ( ) ; entity.setUpdated (( Date ) d.clone ( ) ) ; }
Caching the time may not be an option if the loop runs for more than a couple of milliseconds .
In that case you may setup a timer that periodically updates a timestamp variable with the current time ( using interrupts ) .
Set it to the exact granularity that you need .
The coarser that granularity is , the better .
On my system this loop is 200 times faster than creating a new Date each time .
private volatile long time ; Timer timer = new Timer ( true ) ; try { time = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) ; timer.scheduleAtFixedRate(new TimerTask ( ) { public void run ( ) { time = System.currentTimeMillis( ) ; } } , 0L , 10L ) ; // granularity 10ms for ( E entity : entities ) { entity .doSomething ( ) ; entity.setUpdated ( new Date ( time ) ) ; } } finally { timer.cancel( ) ; }
Catch all : I do n't know the right runtime exception
Query q = ... Person p ; try { p = ( Person ) q.getSingleResult( ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) { p = null ; }
null
Query q = ... Person p ; try { p = ( Person ) q.getSingleResult ( ) ; } catch ( NoResultException e ) { p = null ; }
Exceptions are annoying
try { doStuff ( ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) { log.fatal ( " Could not do stuff " ) ; } doMoreStuff ( ) ;
try { doStuff ( ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) { throw new MyRuntimeException (e.getMessage ( ) , e ) ; }
Re-wrapping RuntimeException
try { doStuff ( ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) { throw new RuntimeException(e ) ; }
try { doStuff ( ) ; } catch ( RuntimeException e ) { throw e ; } catch ( Exception e ) { throw new RuntimeException (e.getMessage ( ) , e ) ; }
try { doStuff ( ) ; } catch ( IOException e ) { throw new RuntimeException ( e.getMessage ( ) , e ) ; } catch ( NamingException e ) { throw new RuntimeException (e.getMessage ( ) , e ) ; }
Not properly propagating the exception
try { } catch ( ParseException e ) { throw new RuntimeException ( ) ; throw new RuntimeException ( e.toString ( ) ) ; throw new RuntimeException (e.getMessage ( ) ) ; throw new RuntimeException(e ) ; }
try { } catch ( ParseException e ) { throw new RuntimeException (e.getMessage ( ) , e ) ; }
Silly exception messages
try { } catch ( ParseException e ) { throw new RuntimeException ( "**** -->
OMFG something scary happened !!!!
11 ! <---" ) ; }
try { } catch ( ParseException e ) { // for code so it gets access to some context throw new MyException ( input , e ) ; // for humans throw new RuntimeException ( input + " : " + e.getMessage ( ) , e ) ; // or simply throw new RuntimeException (e.getMessage ( ) , e ) ; }
Catching to log
try { ... } catch ( ExceptionA e ) { log.error(e.getMessage ( ) , e ) ; throw e ; } catch ( ExceptionB e ) { log.error(e.getMessage ( ) , e ) ; throw e ; }
Incomplete exception handling
try { is = new FileInputStream ( in File ) ; os = new FileOutputStream ( out File ) ; } finally { try { is.close ( ) ; os.close ( ) ; } catch ( IOException e ) { /* we can't do anything */ } }
finally
is.close ()

The exception that never happens
try { ... do risky stuff ... } catch ( SomeException e ) { // never happens } ... do some more ...

The transient trap
public class A implements Serializable { private String someState ; private transient Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass ( ) ) ; public void f( ) { log.debug ( " enter f " ) ; ... } }
log
log
NullPointerException
f ()
public class A implements Serializable { private String someState ; private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog( A.class ) ; public void f( ) { log.debug ( " enter f " ) ; ... } } public class A implements Serializable { private String someState ; public void f( ) { Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass ( ) ) ; log.debug ( " enter f " ) ; ... } }
Overkill initialization
public class B { private int count = 0 ; private String name = null ; private boolean important = false ; }
public class B { private int count ; private String name ; private boolean important ; }
Log instances : static or not ?
private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(MyClass.class ) ;
Automatically thread - safe .
But only with the final keyword included !
Usable from static and non-static code .
No problems with serializable classes .
Initialization cost only once : getLog ( ) may not be as cheap as you might suppose .
Nobody is going to unload the Log class loader anyway .
Chosing the wrong class loader
Class clazz = Class.forName( name ) ; Class clazz = getClass ( ).getClassLoader().loadClass( name ) ;
ClassLoader cl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader ( ) ; if ( cl == null ) cl = MyClass.class.getClassLoader ( ) ; // fallback Class clazz = cl.loadClass ( name ) ;
Poor use of reflection
Class beanClass = ... if ( beanClass.newInstance ( ) instanceof TestBean ) ...
instanceof
Class.isAssignableFrom( Class )
instanceof
Class beanClass = ... if ( TestBean.class.isAssignableFrom( beanClass ) ) ...
Synchronization overkill
Collection l = new Vector ( ) ; for (... ) { l.add ( object ) ; }
Vector
ArrayList
Hashtable
HashMap
Collection l = new ArrayList ( ) ; for (... ) { l.add ( object ) ; }
Wrong list type
Vector
ArrayList
LinkedList
ArrayList LinkedList add ( append ) const or ~ log(n ) if growing const insert ( middle ) linear or ~ n*log ( n ) if growing linear remove ( middle ) linear ( always performs complete copy ) linear iterate linear linear get by index const linear
The HashMap size trap
Map map = new HashMap( collection.size ( ) ) ; for ( Object o : collection ) { map.put ( o.key , o.value ) ; }
threshold = ( int ) ( capacity * loadFactor )
Map map = new HashMap ( 1 + ( int ) ( collection.size ( ) / 0.75 ) ) ;
Hashtable , HashMap and HashSet are overrated
Lists are overrated
The list has a fixed size .
Example : days of the week .
A set of constants .
The list is often ( 10'000 times ) traversed .
The list contains wrapper objects for numbers ( there are no lists of primitive types ) .
List < Integer > codes = new ArrayList < Integer >( ) ; codes.add( Integer.valueOf( 10 ) ) ; codes.add( Integer.valueOf( 20 ) ) ; codes.add( Integer.valueOf( 30 ) ) ; codes.add( Integer.valueOf( 40 ) ) ; versus int [ ] codes = { 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 } ;
// horribly slow and a memory waster if l has a few thousand elements ( try it yourself ! ) List < Mergeable > l = ... ; for ( int i=0 ; i < l.size ( ) - 1 ; i++) { Mergeable one = l.get ( i ) ; Iterator < Mergeable > j = l.iterator ( i+1 ) ; // memory allocation !
while ( j.hasNext ( ) ) { Mergeable other = l.next ( ) ; if ( one.canMergeWith ( other ) ) { one. merge( other ) ; other.remove( ) ; } } } versus // quite fast and no memory allocation Mergeable [ ] l = ... ; for ( int i=0 ; i < l.length - 1 ; i++) { Mergeable one = l[i ] ; for ( int j=i+ 1 ; j < l.length ; j++ ) { Mergeable other = l[j ] ; if ( one.canMergeWith ( other ) ) { one. merge( other ) ; l[j ] = null ; } } }
Object arrays are soooo flexible
/** * @returns [ 1 ] : Location , [ 2 ] : Customer , [ 3 ] : Incident */ Object [ ] getDetails ( int id ) {...
struct
Details getDetails ( int id ) {...} private class Details { public Location location ; public Customer customer ; public Incident incident ; }
Premature object decomposition
public void notify ( Person p ) { ... sendMail(p.getName( ) , p.getFirstName( ) , p.getEmail ( ) ) ; ... }
class PhoneBook { String lookup ( String employeeId ) { Employee emp = ... return emp.getPhone ( ) ; } }
public void notify ( Person p ) { ... sendMail ( p ) ; ... }
class EmployeeDirectory { Employee lookup ( String employeeId ) { Employee emp = ... return emp ; } }
Modifying setters
private String name ; public void setName ( String name ) { this .name = name. trim ( ) ; } public void String getName ( ) { return this .
name ; }
person.setName(textInput.getText ( ) .trim ( ) ) ;
Unnecessary Calendar
Calendar cal = new GregorianCalender( TimeZone.getTimeZone ( " Europe / Zurich " ) ) ; cal.setTime( date ) ; cal.add(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY , 8 ) ; date = cal.getTime ( ) ;
date = new Date(date.getTime ( ) + 8L * 3600L * 1000L ) ; // add 8 hrs
Calendar cal = new GregorianCalender( TimeZone.getTimeZone ( " Europe / Zurich " ) ) ; SimpleDateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat ( " dd.MM.yyyy HH : mm " ) ; df.setCalendar(cal ) ;
SimpleDateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat ( " dd.MM.yyyy HH :mm " ) ; df.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone ( " Europe / Zurich " ) ) ;
Relying on the default TimeZone
Calendar cal = new GregorianCalendar ( ) ; cal.setTime( date ) ; cal.set ( Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY , 0 ) ; cal.set ( Calendar.MINUTE , 0 ) ; cal.set ( Calendar.SECOND , 0 ) ; Date startOfDay = cal.getTime ( ) ;
Calendar cal = new GregorianCalendar(user.getTimeZone ( ) ) ; cal.setTime( date ) ; cal.set ( Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY , 0 ) ; cal.set ( Calendar.MINUTE , 0 ) ; cal.set ( Calendar .SECOND , 0 ) ; cal.set ( Calendar.MILLISECOND , 0 ) ; Date startOfDay = cal.getTime ( ) ;
Time zone " conversion "
public static Date convertTz ( Date date , TimeZone tz ) { Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance ( ) ; cal.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone ( " UTC " ) ) ; cal.setTime(date ) ; cal.setTimeZone(tz ) ; return cal.getTime ( ) ; }
This is an example of a J2EE EJB3 query .
The getSingleResult throws runtime exceptions when a ) the result is not unique , b ) there is no result c ) when the query could not be executed due to database failure or so .
The code above just catches any exception .
A typical catch - all block .
Usingas a result may be the right thing for case b) but not for case a ) or c ) .
In general one should not catch more exceptions than necessary .
The correct exception handling is There are two problems with this tiny piece of code .
First , if this is really a fatal condition then the method should abort and notify the caller of the fatal condition with an appropriate exception ( so why is it caught in the first place ? )
Hardly ever can you just continue after a fatal condition .
Second , this code is very hard to debug because the reason of the failure is lost .
Exception objects carry detailed information about where the error occurred and what caused it .
Individual subclasses may actually carry a lot of extra information that the caller can use to deal with the situation properly .
It 's a lot more than a simple error code ( which is so popular in the C world .
Just look at the Linux kernel .
return - EINVAL everywhere ... ) .
If you catch highlevel exceptions then at least log the message and stack trace .
You should not see exceptions as a necessary evil .
They are a great tool for error handling .
Sometimes you really want to re-throw any checked exception as RuntimeException .
The above piece of code does n't take into account however , that RuntimeException extends Exception .
The RuntimeException does n't need to be catched here .
Also the exception 's message is not propagated properly .
A bit better is to catch the RuntimeException separately and not wrap it .
Even better is to catch all the checked exceptions individually ( even if they are a lot ) .
This codes just wraps a parsing error into a runtime exception in different ways .
None of them provides really good information to the caller .
The first just loses all information .
The second may do anything depending on what information toString ( ) produces .
The default toString ( ) implementation lists the fully qualified exception name followed by the message .
Nesting many exceptions will produce an unwieldy long and ugly string , unsuitable for a user .
The third just preserves the message , which is better than nothing .
The last preserves the cause , but sets the message of the runtime exception to toString ( ) of its cause ( see above ) .
The most useful and readable version is to propagate only the cause message in the runtime exception and pass the original exception as the cause :
This exception is useless .
It does n't give the caller any indication why it occurred .
Instead it contains ASCII art and emotional wording that helps nobody .
Either add useful information or simply pass the message of the original exception .
Do n't add your custom " operation failed because : " string in front of the original message .
It is useless .
And it adds that string to the constant pool which will be full of useless strings in a big application .
Strings are top space consumers in a compiled application .
This code only catches exception to write out a log statement and then rethrows the same exception .
This is stupid .
Let the caller decide if the message is important to log and remove the whole try / catch clause .
Its only useful when you know that the caller does n't log it .
That 's the case if the method is called by a framework which is not under your control .
If you log because the caller does n't have enough information to log , then your exception class is inappropriate : pass all required information along in the exception .
That 's what they are for !
If streams are not closed , the underlying operating system can't free native resources .
This programmer wanted to be careful about closing both streams .
So he put the close in aclause .
But ifthrows an IOException thenis not even executed .
Both close statements must be wrapped in their own try / catch clause .
Moreover , if creating the input stream throws an exception ( because the file was not found ) thenis null andwill throw a .
To make this less verbose I have stripped some newlines .
Here the developer executes some code in a try / catch block .
He does n't want to rethrow the exception that one of the called methods declares to his annoyance .
As the developer is clever he knows that in his particular situation the exception will never be thrown , so he just inserts an empty catch block .
He even puts a nice comment in the empty catch block - but they are famous last words ...
The problem with this is : how can he be sure ?
What if the implementation of the called method changes ?
What if the exception is still thrown in some special case but he just did n't think of it ?
The code after the try / catch may do the wrong thing in that situation .
The exception will go completely unnoticed .
The code can be made much more reliable by throwing a runtime exception in the case .
This works like an assertion and adheres to the " crash early " principle .
The developer will notice if his assumption was wrong .
The code after the try / catch will not be executed if the exception occurred against all honest hope and expectation .
If the exception really never occurs - fine , nothing changed .
Log objects are not serializable .
The programmer knew this and correctly declared thefield as transient so it is not serialised .
However the initialisation of this variables happens in the class ' initialiser .
Upon deserialization initializers and constructors are not executed !
This leaves the deserialized object with a nullvariable which subsequently causes ain .
Rule of thumb : never use class initialization with transient variables .
You can either solve this case here by using a static variable or by using a local variable :
This programmer used to code in C .
So naturally he wants to make sure every variable is properly initialized .
Here however it is not necessary .
The Java language specification guarantees that member variables are initialized with certain values automatically : 0 , null , false .
By declaring them explicitly the programmer causes a class initializer to be executed before the constructor .
This is unnecessary overkill and should be avoided .
This section was edited and before actually suggested not to store log instances in static variables .
Turns out I was wrong .
Mea culpa .
I apologize .
Store the darn log instance in a static final variable and be happy .
Here is why :
This code uses the class loader that loaded the current class .
getClass ( ) might return something unexpected , like a subclass , or a dynamic proxy .
Something out of your control .
This is hardly ever what you want when you dynamically load an additional class .
Especially in managed environments like Application servers , Servlet engines or Java Webstart this is most certainly wrong .
This code will behave very differently depending on the environment it is run in .
Environments use the context class loader to provide applications with a class loader they should use to retrieve " their own " classes .
This programmer is struggling with the reflection API .
He needs a way to check for inheritance but did n't find a way to do it .
So he just creates a new instance and uses theoperator he is used to .
Creating an instance of a class you do n't know is dangerous .
You never know what this class does .
It may be very expensive .
Or the default constructor may not even exist .
Then this if statement would throw an exception .
The correct way of doing this check is to use themethod .
Its semantics is upsidedown ofis a synchronized .
Andis a synchronized .
Both classes should only be used if synchronization is explicitly required .
If however those collections are used as local temporary variables the synchronization is complete overkill and degrades performance considerably .
I measured a 25 % penalty .
Without sample code .
Junior developers often have difficulties to chose the right list type .
They usually choose quite randomly fromand .
But there are performance considerations to make !
The implementations behave quite differently when adding , iterating or accessing object by index .
I 'll ignore Vector in this list because it behaves like an ArrayList , just slower .
NB : n is the size of the list , not the number of operations !
I refrain from using the O ( ) notation here because it does n't give a useful image of what 's happening .
The table lists the cost of list operations .
The insert performance of the ArrayList depends on whether it has to grow during the insert or if the initial size is reasonably set .
The growing occurs exponentially ( by factor 2 ) so growing cost is logarithmic .
The exponential growing however may use much more memory than you actually need .
The sudden need to resize the list also makes the response time sluggish and will probably cause a major garbage collection if the list is large .
Iterating over the lists is equally inexpensive .
Indexed list element access however is very slow in linked lists of course .
Memory considerations : LinkedList wraps every element into a wrapper object .
ArrayList allocates a completely new array each time it needs to grow and performs an array copy on every remove ( ) .
All standard Collections can not reuse their Iterator objects , which may cause Iterator churn especially when recursively iterating large tree structures .
Personally I almost never use LinkedList .
It would really only make sense when you wanted to insert objects in the middle of a list .
But without access to the wrapper object this does n't scale and has linear cost because you must first traverse the list until you find the insert position .
So what exactly is the point of the LinkedList class ?
I recommend using ArrayLists only .
This developer had good intentions and wanted to make sure that the HashMap does n't need to be resized .
He thus set its initial size to the number of elements he was going to put into it .
Unfortunately the HashMap implementation does n't quite behave like this .
It sets its internal threshold to .
So it will resize after 75 % of the collection have been inserted into the map .
The above code will thus always cause extra garbage .
These classes are extremely popular .
Because they have great usability for the developer .
Unfortunately they are also horribly inefficient .
Hashtables become useful when you have 100 or more entries .
But not for just a few elements .
In typical code such collections contain around 10 entries - which fits in a CPU cache line !
Hashtable and HashMap wrap every key / value pair into an Entry wrapper object .
An Entry object is surprisingly large .
Not only does it hold a reference to key and value , but also stores the hash code and a forward reference to the next Entry of the hash bucket .
When you look at heap dumps with a memory analyzer you will be shocked by how much space is wasted by them in large applications like an application server .
When you look at the source code of HashSet you will see that the developers were extremely lazy and just used a HashMap in the backend !
Before using any of these classes , think again .
IdentityHashMap can be a viable alternative .
But be careful , it intentionally breaks the Map interface .
It is much more memory efficient by implementing an open hashtable ( no buckets ) , does n't need an Entry wrapper and uses a simple Object [ ] as its backend .
Instead of a HashSet a simple ArrayList may do similarly well ( you can use contains ( Object ) ) as long as it's small and lookups are rare .
For Sets that contain only a handful of entries the whole hashing is overkill and the memory wasted for the HashMap backend plus the wrapper objects is just nuts .
Just use an ArrayList or even an array .
Actually it 's a shame that there is no efficient Map and Set implementations in the standard JDK !
Also List implementations are very popular .
But even lists are often not necessary .
Simple arrays may do as well .
I am not saying that you should not use Lists at all .
They are great to work with .
But know when to use arrays .
The following are indicators that you should be using an array instead of a list :
Let me illustrate that in code :
You save an extra list object ( wrapping an array ) , wrapper objects and possibly lots of iterator instances .
Even Sun realized this .
That 's why Collections . sort ( ) actually copies the list into an array and performs the sort on the array .
Even though documented , this kind of passing back values from a method is ugly and error prone .
You should really declare a small class that holds the objects together .
This is analoguos to ain C.
In the first example it 's painful to decompose an object just to pass its state on to a method .
In the second example the use of this method is very limited .
If overall design allows it pass the object itself .
This poor developer suffered from spaces at the beginning or end of a name entered by the user .
He thought to be clever and just removed the spaces inside the setter method of a bean .
But how odd is a bean that modifies its data instead of just holding it ?
Now the getter returns different data than was set by the setter !
If this was done inside an EJB3 entity bean a simple read from the DB would actually modify the data :
For every INSERT there would be an UPDATE statement .
Let alone how hard it is to debug these side - effects !
In general , a bean should not modify its data .
It is a data container , not business logic .
Do the trimming where it makes sense : in the controller where the input occurs or in the logic where the spaces are not wanted .
A typical mistake by a developer who is confused about date , time , calendars and time zones .
To add 8 hours to a Date there is no need for a Calendar .
Neither is the time zone of any relevance .
( Think about is if you do n't understand this ! )
However if we wanted to add days ( not hours ) we would need a Calendar , because we do n't know the length of a day for sure ( on DST change days may have 23 or 25 hours ) .
Here the Calendar object is completely unnecessary .
The DateFormat object already contains a Calendar instance .
Reuse that .
The developer wanted to calculate the start of the day ( 0h00 ) .
First he obviously missed out the millisecond field of the Calendar .
But the real big mistake is not setting the TimeZone of the Calendar object .
The Calendar will thus use the default time zone .
This may be fine in a Desktop application , but in server - side code this is hardly ever what you want : 0h00 in Shanghai is in a very different moment than in London .
The developer needs to check which is the time zone that is relevant for this computation .
If you think this method does something useful , please go and read the article about time .
This developer had not read the article and was desperately trying to " fix " the time zone of his date .
Actually the method does nothing .
The returned Date will not have any different value than the input .
Because a Date does not carry time zone information .
It is always UTC .
And the getTime / setTime methods of Calendar always convert between UTC and the actual time zone of the Calendar .
Using Calendar.getInstance ( )
Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance ( ) ; c.set ( 2009 , Calendar .
JANUARY , 15 ) ;
This code assumes a Gregorian calendar .
But what if the returned Calendar subclass is a Buddhistic , Julian , Hebrew , Islamic , Iranian or Discordian calendar ?
In these the year 2009 has a very different meaning .
And a month called January does n't exist .
Calendar.getInstance ( ) uses the current default locale to select an appropriate implementation .
It depends on the Java implementaton which implementations are available .
The utility of Calendar.getInstance ( ) is thus very limited , and its use should be avoided as it's result is not well defined .
Calendar c = new GregorianCalendar( timeZone ) ; c.set( 2009 , Calendar .JANUARY , 15 ) ;
Dangerous Calendar manipulation
GregorianCalender cal = new GregorianCalender( TimeZone.getTimeZone ( " Europe / Zurich " ) ) ; cal.set ( Calendar .SECOND , 0 ) ; cal.set ( Calendar.MILLISECOND , 0 ) ; if ( cal.before ( other ) ) doSomething ( ) ; cal.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone ( " GMT " ) ) ; cal.set ( Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY , 23 ) ; Date d = cal.getTime ( ) ;
This code manipulates a Calendar object in ways that are bound to yield undefined results .
Calendar objects have complex inner state : individual fields for day , hour , year etc. , a millisecond since epoch value ( like Date ) and a time zone .
Depending on what you change , some of these fields are invalidated and are only recomputed from other values when you call certain methods :
set ( ) invalidates the millisecond since epoch value and dependent fields ( changing DATE obviously invalidates DAY_OF_WEEK )
invalidates the millisecond since epoch value and dependent fields ( changing DATE obviously invalidates DAY_OF_WEEK ) setTimeZone ( ) invalidates all fields execpt the millisecond since epoch value
invalidates all fields execpt the millisecond since epoch value get ( ) , getTime ( ) , getTimeInMillis ( ) , add ( ) , roll ( ) recomputes the millisecond since epoch value from the fields
recomputes the millisecond since epoch value from the fields get ( ) , add ( ) also recompute invalid fields from millisecond since epoch
Whenever you change fields with set ( ) , then dependend fields do not get updated until you call get ( ) , getTime ( ) , getTimeInMillis( ) , add( ) , or roll ( ) .
The first paragraph of above code calls set ( ) followed by before ( ) .
There is no guarantee ( according to the API Doc ) that before ( ) will see the modified time value .
The second paragraph invalidates all fields and the millisecond since epoch value by calling setTimeZone ( ) and set ( ) , losing the calendar 's data completely .
See also bug 4827490
Calendar objects should always be manipulated according to these simple rules :
Initialize TimeZone ( and Locale if you need ) already in the constructor
After calls to set ( ) add a call to getTimeInMillis ( )
add a call to After a call to setTimeZone ( ) add a call to get ( )
GregorianCalender cal = new GregorianCalender( TimeZone.getTimeZone ( " Europe / Zurich " ) ) ; cal.set ( Calendar .SECOND , 0 ) ; cal.set ( Calendar.MILLISECOND , 0 ) ; cal.getTimeInMillis ( ) ; if ( cal.before ( other ) ) doSomething ( ) ; cal.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone ( " GMT " ) ) ; cal.get ( Calendar .DATE ) ; cal.set ( Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY , 23 ) ; Date d = cal.getTime ( ) ;
Calling Date.setTime ( )
account.changePassword(oldPass , newPass ) ; Date lastmod = account.getLastModified ( ) ; lastmod.setTime(System.currentTimeMillis ( ) ) ;
The above code updates the last modified date of the account entity .
The programmer wants to be conservative and avoids creating a new Date object .
Instead she uses the the setTime method to modify the existing Date instance .
There is actually nothing wrong with that .
But I just do not recommend this practice .
Date objects are usually passed around carelessly .
The same Date instance could be passed to numerous objects , which do n't make a copy in their setters .
Dates are often used like primitives .
Thus if you modify a Date instance , other objects that use this instance might behave unexpectedly .
Of course it is unclean design if an object exposes its intrinsic Date instance to the outside world , if you write code that strictly adheres to classical OO - principles ( which I think is too inconvenient ) .
General everyday Java practice however is to just copy Date references and not clone the object in setters .
Thus every programmer should treat Date as immutable and should not modify existing instances .
This should only be done for performance reasons in special situations .
Even then the use of a simple long is probably equally good .
account.changePassword(oldPass , newPass ) ; account.setLastModified( new Date ( ) ) ;
Assuming SimpleDateFormat was thread - safe
public class Constants { public static final SimpleDateFormat date = new SimpleDateFormat ( " dd.MM.yyyy " ) ; }
The above code is flawed in several ways .
It 's broken , because it shares a static instance of a SimpleDateFormat with possibly any number of threads .
SimpleDateFormat is not thread - safe .
If multiple threads concurrently use this object the results are undefined .
You may observe strange output from format and parse or even exceptions .
Unfortunately this mistake is very common !
Yes , sharing a SimpleDateFormat requires proper synchronization .
Yes that comes at a price ( cache flushes , lock contention , etc. ) .
And yes , creating a SimpleDateFormat is not free either ( pattern parsing , object allocation ) .
But simply ignoring thread - safety is not a solution , but a sure way to break your code .
Of course this code also does n't take the time zone into account .
And then defining a class called Constants screams of yet another anti-pattern ( see next section ) .
Having a global Configuration / Parameters / Constants class
public interface Constants { String version = " 1.0 " ; String dateFormat = " dd. MM.yyyy " ; String configFile = " .apprc " ; int maxNameLength = 32 ; String someQuery = " SELECT * FROM ... " ; }
Often seen in large projects : one class or interface that contains all sorts of constants that are used throughout the application .
Why is this bad ?
Because these constants are unrelated to each other .
This class is the only thing that they have in common .
And the reference to this class will pollute many again unrelated components of the application .
You want to later extract a component and use it in a different application ?
Or share some classes between a server and a remote client ?
You may need to ship the constants class as well !
This class has introduced a dependency between otherwise unrelated components .
This inhibits reuse and loose coupling and gives way to chaos .
Instead put constants where they belong .
In no case should constants be used across component boundaries .
This is only allowed if the component is a library , on which an explicit dependency is wanted .
Not noticing overflows
public int getFileSize( File f ) { long l = f.length ( ) ; return ( int ) l ; }
This developer , for whatever reason , wrapped a call to determine the size of a file into a method that returns an int instead of a long .
This code does not support files larger than 2 GB and just returns a wrong length in that case .
Code that casts a value to a smaller size type must first check for a possible overflow and throw an exception .
public int getFileSize( File f ) { long l = f.length ( ) ; if ( l > Integer . MAX_VALUE ) throw new IllegalStateException ( " int overflow " ) ; return ( int ) l ; }
Another version of an overflow bug is the following .
Note the missing parantheses in the first println statement .
long a = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) ; long b = a + 100 ; System.out.println(( int ) b-a ) ; System.out.println (( int ) ( b - a ) ) ;
And last , a true gem that I uprooted during code review .
Note how the programmer tried to be careful , but then failed so badly by assuming an int could ever become larger than its maximum value .
int a = l.size ( ) ; a = a + 100 ; if ( a > Integer . MAX_VALUE ) throw new ArithmeticException ( " int overflow " ) ;
Using == with float or double
for ( float f = 10 f ; f!=0 ; f- =0.1 ) { System.out.println(f ) ; }
f
for ( float f = 10 f ; f>0 ; f- =0.1 ) { System.out.println(f ) ; }
Storing money in floating point variables
float total = 0.0f ; for ( OrderLine line : lines ) { total += line .
price * line.count ; }
double a = 1.14 * 75 ; // 85.5 represented as 85.4999 ... System.out.println(Math.round(a ) ) ; // surprising output : 85 System.out.println( 10.0/3 ) ; // surprising output : 3.3333333333333335 ( precision lost twice during division and on conversion to decimal )
BigDecimal d = new BigDecimal ( 1.14 ) ; // precision has already been lost
The above code does n't behave as expected .
It causes an endless loop .
Because 0.1 is an infinite binary decimal will never be exactly 0 .
Generally you should never compare float or double values with the equality operator == .
Always use less than or greater than .
Java compilers should be changed to issue a warning in that case .
Or even make == an illegal operation for floating point types in the Java Language Spec .
It makes really no sense to have this feature .
I have seen many developers coding such a loop .
Including myself in my early days .
When this code sums 100 order lines with every line having one 0.30 $ item , the resulting total is calculated to exactly 29.999971 .
The developer notices the strange behaviour and changes the float to the more precise double , only to get the result 30.000001192092896 .
The somewhat surprising result is of course due to the difference in representation of numbers by humans ( in decimal format ) and computers ( in binary format ) .
It always occurs in its most annyoing form when you add fractional amounts of money or calculate the VAT .
Binary representation of floating point numbers was invented for inherently inexact values like measurements .
Perfect for engineering !
But unusable when you want exact math .
Like banks .
Or when counting .
There are business cases where you can not afford to lose precision .
You lose precision when converting between decimal and binary and when rounding happens in not a well - defined mannor or at indeterminate points .
To avoid losing precision you must use fixed point or integer arithmetics .
That does not only apply to monetary values , but it is a frequent source of annoyance in business applications and therefore makes a good example .
In the second example an unsuspecting user of the program would simply say the computer 's calculator is broken .
That 's of course very embarassing for the programmer .
Consequently an amount of money should never ever be stored in a floating point data type ( float , double ) .
Please note that it is not just any calculation that is inexact .
Even a simple multiplication with an integer can already yield an inexact result .
It is the mere fact of storing a value in a binary representation ( float , double ) that may already cause rounding !
You simply can not store 0.3 as an exact value in float or double .
Because float and double are binary IEEE754 types .
See also here .
You can play around with various numbers and their binary representation here .
If you see a float or double in your financial code base , the code will most likely yield inexact results .
Instead either a string or fixed point representation should be chosen .
A text representation must be in a well - defined format and is not to be confused with user input / output in a locale specific format .
Both representations must define the precision ( number of digits before and after the decimal point ) that is stored .
For calculations the class BigDecimal provides an excellent facility .
The class can be used such that it throws runtime exceptions if precision is unexpectedly lost in an operation .
This is very helpful to uproot subtle numerical bugs and enables the developer to correct the calculation .
BigDecimal total = BigDecimal .ZERO ; for ( OrderLine line : lines ) { BigDecimal price = new BigDecimal ( line.price ) ; BigDecimal count = new BigDecimal ( line.count ) ; total = total.add( price.multiply ( count ) ) ; // BigDecimal is immutable !
} total = total.setScale(2 , RoundingMode.HALF_UP ) ;
BigDecimal a = ( new BigDecimal ( " 1.14 " ) ).multiply ( new BigDecimal ( 75 ) ) ; // 85.5 exact a = a.setScale(0 , RoundingMode.HALF_UP ) ; // 86 System.out.println(a ) ; // correct output : 86
BigDecimal a = new BigDecimal ( " 1.14 " ) ;
Not freeing resources in a finally block
public void save ( File f ) throws IOException { OutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream ( new FileOutputStream(f ) ) ; out.write (... ) ; out.close ( ) ; } public void load ( File f ) throws IOException { InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream ( new FileInputStream ( f ) ) ; in.read ( ... ) ; in.close ( ) ; }
The above code opens an output stream to a file , allocating a file handle in the operating system .
File handles are a rare resource and need to be properly freed , by calling close on the FileOutputStream ( same for FileInputStream of course ) .
To ensure that even in the case of an exception ( the filesystem may become full during the write ) , closing must happen in a finally block .
Here the stream is also wrapped into a buffering stream .
That means not all data will have been written to disk by the time we arrive at the close ( ) call .
The close call itself will flush the pending data in the buffer to disk and may thus itself fail with an IOException .
If that close fails the file on disk is incomplete ( truncated ) and thus probably corrupt .
The method should therefore propagate the IOException in that case .
In the case of a FileInputStream we can safely ignore the potential IOException from a close ( ) call .
We have read all data that we need , and there is nothing useful that we can do if the underlying close ( ) failed anyway .
It 's not even worth logging it .
In a perfect world BufferedOutputStream.close ( ) would be implemented correctly .
But sadly it has a bug that 's not going to be fixed : it loses any IOException from the implicit flush and truncates your file silently .
So here we give the proper workaround with an explicit flush before close .
To be exact the corrected code below can leak in one small corner case : when the file stream was allocated but then allocating the buffered stream fails mysteriously ( with out of memory for instance ) .
As a pragmatic person I think in such a pathological case we can safely rely on the garbage collector to clean up the mess .
It 's not worth the hassle to deal with it .
// code for your cookbook public void save ( ) throws IOException { File f = ... OutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream ( new FileOutputStream (f ) ) ; try { out . write ( ... ) ; out . flush ( ) ; // do n't lose exception by implicit flush on close } finally { out.close ( ) ; } } public void load ( File f ) throws IOException { InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream ( new FileInputStream ( f ) ) ; try { in.read ( ... ) ; } finally { try { in.close ( ) ; } catch ( IOException e ) { } } }
Let me give you also the cook book recipe for another ubiquitous pattern : database access .
Again this is the pragmatic approach .
Yes , rs.close ( ) could fail with mysterious Errors , except they only occur in your university lecture on Quantum Mechanics and not in The Real World ( tm ) .
And only perverts would write the try / finally cascade that no Error neutrino can escape .
Forgive my sarcasm .
Here once and for all this is how to deal with SQL objects :
Car getCar( DataSource ds , String plate ) throws SQLException {
Car car = null ; Connection c = null ; PreparedStatement s = null ; ResultSet rs = null ; try { c = ds.getConnection ( ) ; s = c.prepareStatement ( " select make , color from cars where plate= ? " ) ; s.setString ( 1 , plate ) ; rs = s.executeQuery ( ) ; if ( rs.next ( ) ) { car = new Car ( ) ; car.make = rs.getString(1 ) ; car.color = rs.getString ( 2 ) ; } } finally { if ( rs != null ) try { rs.close ( ) ; } catch ( SQLException e ) { } if ( s != null ) try { s.close ( ) ; } catch ( SQLException e ) { } if ( c != null ) try { c.close ( ) ; } catch ( SQLException e ) { } } return car ; }
Abusing finalize ( )
public class FileBackedCache { private File backingStore ; ... protected void finalize ( ) throws IOException { if ( backingStore != null ) { backing Store.close ( ) ; backing Store = null ; } } }
With that said , do n't miss the next paragraph .
This class uses the finalize method to release a file handle .
The problem is that you can do n't know when the method is called .
The method is called by the garbage collector .
If you are running out of file handles you want this method to be called rather sooner than later .
But the GC will probably only invoke the method when you are about to run out of heap , which is a very different situation .
It may take anything from milliseconds to days until GC and finalization runs .
The garbage collector manages memory only .
It does that very well .
But it must not be abused to manage any other resources apart from that .
The GC is not a generic resource management mechanism !
I find Sun's API Doc of the finalize method very misleading in that respect .
It actually suggest to use this method to close I/O resources - complete bullshit if you ask me .
Again : I / O has nothing to do with memory !
Better code provides a public close method , which must be called by a well - defined lifecycle management , like JBoss MBeans or so .
public class FileBackedCache { private File backingStore ; ... public void close ( ) throws IOException { if ( backingStore != null ) { backing Store.close ( ) ; backing Store = null ; } } }
close
try ( Writer w = new FileWriter ( f ) ) { // implements Closable w.write ( " abc " ) ; // w goes out of scope here : w.close ( ) is called automatically in ANY case } catch ( IOException e ) { throw new RuntimeException (e.getMessage ( ) , e ) ; }
Involuntarily resetting Thread.interrupted
try { Thread.sleep( 1000 ) ; } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { // ok } or while ( true ) { if ( Thread.interrupted ( ) ) break ; }
JDK 1.7 ( Java 7 ) has introduced the AutoClosable interface .
It enables an automatic call to amethod , when the variable ( not the object ) goes out of scope of a try - with - resource block .
It is very different from a finalizer .
Its time of execution is well - defined at compile time .
The above code resets the interrupted flag of the Thread .
Subsequent readers will not know that the Thread has been interrupted .
If you need to pass on the information about the interrupt , rewrite the code like so .
try { Thread.sleep( 1000 ) ; } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { Thread.currentThread ( ).interrupt( ) ; } or while ( true ) { if ( Thread.currentThread ( ) .isInterrupted ( ) ) break ; }
Spawning thread from static initializers
class Cache { private static final Timer evictor = new Timer ( ) ; }
java.util .
Timer spwans a new thread in its constructor .
Therefore the above code spawns a new thread in its static initializer .
The new Thread will inherit some properties from its parent : context classloader , inheritable ThreadLocals , and some security properties ( access rights ) .
It is therefore rarely desireable to have those property set in an uncontrolled way .
This may for instance prevent GC of a class loader .
The static initializer is executed by the thread that first loads the class ( in any given ClassLoader ) , which may be a totally random thread from a thread pool of a webserver for example .
If you want to control these thread properties you will have to start threads in a static method , and take control of who is calling that method .
class Cache { private static Timer evictor ; public static setupEvictor ( ) { evictor = new Timer ( ) ; } }
Canceled timer tasks that keep state
final MyClass callback = this ; TimerTask task = new TimerTask ( ) { public void run ( ) { callback.timeout ( ) ; } } ; timer.schedule( task , 300000L ) ; try { doSomething ( ) ; } finally { task.
cancel( ) ; }
The above code uses a timer to enforce a timeout on doSomething ( ) .
The TimerTask contains an ( implicit ) instance reference to the outer class .
Thus as long as the TimerTask exists the instance of MyClass may not be GC'ed .
Unfortunately the Timer may keep cancelled TimerTasks around until their scheduled timeout has expired !
That would leave the program 5 minutes with a dangling reference to the MyClass instance during which it can not get collected !
It 's a temorary memory leak .
A better TimerTask would override the cancel ( ) method and null the reference there .
It requires slightly more code .
TimerTask task = new Job( this ) ; timer.schedule( task , 300000L ) ; try { doSomething ( ) ; } finally { task.cancel( ) ; } static class Job extends TimerTask { private volatile MyClass callback ; public Job( MyClass callback ) { this .
callback = callback ; } public boolean cancel ( ) { callback = null ; return super.cancel( ) ; } public void run ( ) { MyClass cb = callback ; if ( cb == null ) return ; cb.timeout ( ) ; } }
Holding strong references to ClassLoaders and unflushable caches
In a dynamic system like an application server or OSGI , you should take good care not to prevent ClassLoaders from garbage collection .
As you undeploy and redeploy individual applications in an application server you create new class loaders for them .
The old ones are unused and should be collected .
Java is n't going to let that happen if there is a single dangling reference from container code into your application code .
As various libraries are used throughout an enterprise application , that directly means that libraries should do their very best not to hold involuntary strong references to objects ( and thus their class loaders ) .
This is not easy .
Classes like java .
beans .
Introspector from the JDK or org.apache.commons.beanutils.PropertyUtils from Apache BeanUtils or org.springframework.beans.CachedIntrospectionResults from Spring implement caches to speed up their inner workings .
They keep strong references to classes you pass them for analysis .
Fortunately they provide methods to flush their caches .
But finding all classes that may have internal caches and flushing them at the right time is a near to impossible job for the developer .
If you happen to use org.apache.commons.el.BeanInfoManager from Apache Commons EL you probably have a leak .
This ancient class keeps a cache of strong references that only ever grows until out of memory .
And it has no flush method .
Even Tomcat had to implement a workaround involving reflection to clean it .
It would be much better if these libraries just used soft or weak references in the first place .
A quick reminder :
WeakReference : nulled more or less at the same time when the last strong reference to the object goes away .
Typical for classloader references ( of what use is a classloader if none of its classes are loaded ) .
But be careful if you use this within a ClassLoader implementation .
SoftReference : the reference is kept even if the last strong reference to the object goes away as long as memory allows .
Typical for caches .
Soft and weak references basically differ in the point in time when they are nulled .
Only if the library just caches objects from its own packages ( with no external references ) , it may be fine not to use these special references and just use normal references .
Using soft or weak references also helps the runtime behaviour of your application : if memory gets tight , the last thing you want to spend memory on is caches .
So the garbage collector will reclaim the memory used by caches if necessary .
A bad example here is JBoss ' SQL statement cache : it 's compeletely static and can use a lot of memory , even when that is tight .
Another bad example is JBoss ' authentication cache .
Also every static cache must always provide a simple way to flush its contents .
It 's the nature of a ( clean ) cache ( as opposed to e.g a write cache ) that its contents are not valuable and can be safely discarded at any time .
The limits of the cache are another trap .
Caches should never grow large , and never cache objects for too long .
A really bad example here is the default settings for the JDK DNS cache ( it completely ignores DNS record lifetimes , and stores negative lookups forever in an unbounded list ) .
Your API documentation should state if and when caching happens .
This also helps the user to estimate runtime performance .
Nested synchronized statements
class Message { private long id ; ... public synchronized int compareTo( Message that ) { synchronized ( that ) { return Long.compare ( id , that .id ) ; } } }
a.compareTo(b )
b.compareTo(a )
public int compareTo( Message that ) { long a ; long b ; synchronized ( this ) { a = this .id ; } synchronized ( that ) { b = that .id ; } return Long.compare( a , b ) ; }
Doing random file access via RandomAccessFile
RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccess File(f , " r " ) ; for (... ) { raf.seek ( pos ) ; byte b = raf.readByte( ) ; }
java.io.RandomAccessFile
FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(f ) ; MappedByteBuffer map = in.getChannel( ).map( MapMode.READ_ONLY , 0 , f.lengt ( ) ) ; for (... ) { byte b = map.get ( pos ) ; }
The above code wants to provide a thread - safe compareTo ( ) method .
The developer realized that access to the id field needs to be synchronized on the owning instance .
So there are two nested synchronized statements here , one to protect this .id , one to protect that .id.
Unfortunately this code will deadlock quickly when used by multiple threads .
And multiple threads was the very thing that we wanted to support here .
When thread 1 doesand thread 2 doesthey will try to obtain the locks on a and b in reverse order and will deadlock .
Remember locking rule number one : locks must always be taken in the same order by all threads .
We could rewrite the method such that the synchronized statements are not nested at all .
Despite its name theclass is not very suitable for accessing files in a random - access way .
That is : seek , read , seek , read , etc .
Each of these directly issue the corresponding system calls / ioctl on the file descriptor .
Every C programmer knows that this sort of file access is slow and should be replaced with memory mapped file access .
You can do that in Java via MappedByteBuffer .
On my laptop that 's 50 times faster .

On my birthday last May , I received a mysterious priority package from an unrecognized California address .
I do n't know anyone in L.A. who would be sending me a birthday present .
Advertisement
Normally , opening a package sheds more light on its origins .
Not this package .
In fact , the packages ' contents further puzzled me .
What I pulled out was the kitschiest apron I had ever seen .
My first reaction : Adorable !
I love it .
My second reaction : Wait ... from who ?!
Why ?
My best friend in Wisconsin had personally - selected the exact design from the popular website Etsy.com , which serves as a massive marketplace for artist / handmade products from around the world .
Advertisement
The note on the package 's insides explained it all : " I wanted to get you something you would never get for yourself ! "
My friend , Meagan , knows me well .
I have to admit I had seen a lot of these retro-designed , contour - cut aprons prior to being a proud owner and I had secretly admired and fantasized about wearing one .
I have been quite happy this past year wearing my orange with polka - dot trimmed , green bird - patterned apron .
The apron holds a power to somehow make one feel mischievous and giddy .

That is .... until this weekend .
Saturday I read an article in the Denver Post that deeply disturbed my love for this apron .
The article 's title says it all : " Sassy , sexy aprons shrug off sexism , tie on a trend . "
Sassy ?
Yes .
Advertisement
Sexy ?
Yes .
Shrug off sexism ?.... Um , NO .
Hold the phone .
How is this an acceptable title for a news publication ?
And , were the contents of this article , which completely ignored the issue of sexism , really written in 2010 ?
Advertisement
Now , I am not actually freaking out about this supposed apron craze .
I think they are cute ... obviously , and I think they can be enjoyed for what they are in a non-sexist way .
To be totally honest , my morning discovery of this article happened in a very ironic manner :
I woke up and felt like having a Saturday slow morning , meaning I was about to whip up a recipe I concocted of " good for you " muffins .
But , what did I do first ?
I put on my apron .
To make matters worse , earlier in the week I had made Giada De Laurentiis ' Lemon - Ricotta Cookies ( they 're delicious by the way ) in that same apron !
Advertisement
After cleaning up the kitchen , I sat down to read the day 's headlines .
This is when I had my feminist identity crisis .
As I read the article , I was asking myself , " Am I perpetuating the idea that female domesticity is our only contribution to society and therefore our only value ? ! "
To understand why this was so dramatic you have to read the article .
I clicked on it because I thought it was just going to be about the trend of these aprons .
As a trend - watcher and apron - owner I expecting it to be a lovely morning read .
Instead , the article seemed oblivious to the sexism it was supporting .
Advertisement
Some beefs I have with it :
" If I bought this apron , I would never leave the kitchen . "
The article does n't utilize that quote to later refute it .
No .
It is used to support the idea that this never leaving the kitchen thing would be positive .
" ... retro-style aprons channel pin-up queens as well as iconic TV housewives .
Some are featured on models who wear nothing but a saucy apron and a pair of pumps . "
Advertisement
Excuse me ?
Did you just write that in the article as something for our society to celebrate ?
The author writes ,
" ... aprons are riding a new wave of retro chic that also includes cupcakes , casseroles , cocktails , canning and gardening . "
Advertisement
Later , describing one specific designer 's goods ,
" her aprons match up with toaster covers , potholders , placemats and curtains . "
And here is an even greater kicker at the end about one particular woman 's apron :
" Her boyfriend bought one for her .
It 's ruffled and has a big button on the left hip where she can hang a dishrag . "
Advertisement
Yes .
It went there .
It said that .
It did n't point out anything potentially alarming with this picture .
Maybe I am reading too far into this , but I can't help but wonder if this new " nostalgia " trend has anything to do with the economic recession .
Let 's take a crash course look at the development of domesticity in the past century .
Advertisement
The domestication of women in the U.S. has strong historical roots in the Cold War era .
Once all the men returned from WWII , the women were basically forced back into their housewife roles .
Even though they had been the American workforce and professionals during the war , it was now considered their " patriotic duty " to return within the walls of the home and make employment space available to the men .
This was a direct trickle - down from the United States ' foreign policy issues of containment and suspicion of " subversive acts . "
In the 1960s and 1970s , second - wave feminism pushed back against this policy of domestic containment .
What resulted was bra-burning ( and apron - burning ) feminism .
Advertisement
The 1980s saw a backlash against feminism and it almost became a dirty word .
However , " new wave feminism " or sometimes called " third - wave feminism " is very much a real thing today .
Once I understood what new feminism was in college , I realized I was one .
With a shaky job market ( or at least the perception of one ) , people seem happy to just exist within their current circumstances .
That 's fine ... it is a bit of self - preservation , or survival mentality .
But , it makes me wonder if this retro kick is in a way similar to the cultural reactions of the 1940s , 50s , and early 60s .
Advertisement
This compelled me to contact a professor I had in my undergraduate history program .
Jodi-Vandenberg - Daves teaches history and women 's studies courses at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse .
After reading the article , she confirmed a lot of my initial thoughts and feelings .
" I 've got no problem with creative , fun clothing , and I 've got no problem with cooking and all the creativity and fun that go with that .
In an era when work can threaten to take over your life ( unlike the era when women were told they should n't be interested in anything beyond their kitchens , kids , husbands and vacuum cleaners , etc. ) , I find cooking rewarding , " Vadenberg - Daves says .
Advertisement
But , she also sees some concerns with this article as she continues ,
" Where I get a little concerned is the marketing of women 's domestic servitude , especially as linked to sex .
The part in the article that jumped out at me was the reference to marketing of these aprons with models wearing only the aprons and pumps .
Sounds like an old Playboy image to me , and we just keep recycling these . "
Advertisement
My personal crisis only lasted about two minutes .
I quickly assessed myself , my motives , why I enjoy the apron , who had given it to me , and I realized I was ok .
I am not sacrificing my ideals by wearing the apron .
The fact that it came from a like - minded , feisty feminist herself helped calm my brief freak out .
The Wikipedia definition of third - wave feminism explains why this is such a quandary for me and our generation as a whole .
One part in particular says a lot : " The third wave embraces contradictions and conflict , and accommodates diversity and change . "
Advertisement
Relief in understanding .
My form of feminism accepts contradictions ... like the apron .
Unfortunately , that does not appear to be the case with the women in the article , and I fear that may be the case with a lot of people who jump on the domestic kickback trend .
Advertisement
The reclaiming of derogatory terms is another characteristic of new feminism .
That could be applied to concepts and ideas , too , which would make this a fun and empowering trend .
That is the way I had been interpreting it up to the point when I read this article and realized there may be something else going on under the surface for some women .
For me , I will continue to prance about in my apron whenever I choose .
I will bake for baking 's therapeutic sake whenever I want and for whomever I want because I enjoy doing it for others as an act of friendship / love , not because it is a duty or expectation .
I will do so as I embrace the contradiction I represent ... so long as I am always aware that is a small piece of me , not all of me .

Privacy has long been a thorny issue for Facebook :
Three years ago , the social networking site unveiled its Beacon advertising project , which resulted in a class - action lawsuit .
December 's privacy changes aimed at encouraging users to share more information publicly evoked plenty of criticism .
And this week at Facebook 's f8 conference , Facebook announced even more changes that affect users ' privacy .
Keeping track of Facebook 's ongoing updates , upgrades and changes -- and how they affect your privacy -- can be confusing and frustrating .
We 've sorted through the new wrinkles for you .
Here 's a list of five essential privacy settings you should review now and tweak accordingly to ensure your information remains safe .
1. Facebook Privacy Settings : " Instant Personalization " and " Like " Buttons
What the " Like " button is : Facebook 's big announcement this week from the f8 conference was the new " Like " button , which you 'll start seeing on blogs and news sites across the Web .
When you click the button on an external website , you authorize Facebook to publish your activity to your Facebook profile ( which , in turn , will also be published to your friends ' news feeds ) .
Also , when your friends visit the external site , they will see that you 've visited that site , too .
What " instant personalization " is :
The second part to Facebook 's announcements this week was it 's announcement of " instant personalization " on partner sites , which ( right now ) include Pandora and Yelp .

Modelling the neuron as little more than a simple on / off switch is a big mistake ( Image : Dan Webber )
LATE at night on a sultry evening , I watch intently as the predator senses its prey , gathers itself , and strikes .
It could be a polecat , or even a mantis – but in fact it ’s a microbe .
The microscopic world of the single , living cell mirrors our own in so many ways : cells are essentially autonomous , sentient and ingenious .
In the lives of single cells we can perceive the roots of our own intelligence .
Molecular biology and genetics have driven the biosciences , but have …
It is an image worthy of a science fiction film : a rainbow , photographed in the middle of the night , glimmers in the foreground while behind it a brilliant star rises above the horizon .
The effect is exotic and unworldly .
Nevertheless , the picture is very much an earthly affair .
It was taken by photographer Wally Pacholka while he was standing at the edge of Haleakala crater on the island of Maui in the Hawaii archipelago .
As Pachokla explains , that band of colours is , in reality , a moonbow .
Like a rainbow , its daylight equivalent , a moonbow is produced when light is broken up into its constituent colours as it passes through water droplets .
In both cases , the source of light is the same : the Sun .
In the case of the rainbow , sunlight produces its effect directly .
In the case of the moonbow , however , that sunlight is first reflected off the surface of the moon and then shines back down to Earth .
" A moonbow is just like a rainbow but is caused by the moon reflecting off rain mist at a certain angle , " says Pacholka .
" I was very fortunate to see this .
But in a sense I created this fortune as I was always out there : I drove up the crater mountain that night but also about every night , even going twice the night before – early evening to shoot the evening sky then back again in early morning to shoot the morning sky . "
As to that mysterious star rising above the horizon , it turns out to be the planet Mars which is currently making one of its closest approaches to Earth .
The Red Planet is currently around a 100 million km distant from us and shines like a brilliant red beacon as it rises in the east on its journey across the night sky .
Hence the impact of this photograph : a distinctive planetary display captured beside a rare moonbow .
i Phone 4 on left , iPhone 3.x on right
iLounge has posted an excellent summary of changes in iPhone 4 on an app - by - app basis .
They do a good job covering much of what has been discussed including multitasking , wallpapers , folders , mail and more .
iLounge , however , also noted that in iPhone 4's Safari application , Apple has removed the " Google " branding from the search button and simply replaced it with " Search " .
While seemingly a minor detail , Apple has been said to be in discussions with Microsoft to replace Google as the default search engine on the iPhone .
If this were to happen , Google would likely still be a user enable - able option .
Note , the iPad 's Safari also uses the " Search " button on the keyboard .
" Google " still appears in the search window itself in Safari .
Boy , 16 , sues his mother for harassing him on Facebook as she argues it's her ' parental duty '
' It 's just like going through his bedroom ... it's my duty ' : Denise New , who is being sued by her son Lane for going through his Facebook page
A teenager has taken his mother to court for logging on to his Facebook page and reading about his private life .
Denise New has been charged with harassment after her 16 - year - old son , Lane , said he wanted criminal charges filed against his mother for her ' snooping ' .
The teenager claims his mother changed his password on his Facebook account after he accidentally left his computer on .
He also said she posted slanderous comments and changed the password to his email so he can no longer receive updates to his page .
The teenager , who lives with his grandmother following his parents ' messy divorce , made a complaint with prosecutors in Arkansas after the incident last month .
Prosecutors agreed with the teenager and charged Mrs New under the state 's harassment laws .
The high tech family row began after Lane accidentally left his computer on while visiting his mother at her home in the town of Arkadelphia .
The 42 - year - old became concerned about several entries , including one in which he son wrote about driving home at 95 mph after an argument with his girlfriend .
She also read some other postings , which bothered her so much she decided to change the password barring her son's access to the account .
Mrs New said she was simply performing her parental duties , and looking at the Facebook page , was the same as going through his bedroom .
Right to privacy ?
Lane claims his mother had slandered him
She said : ' You 're within your legal rights to monitor your child and to have a conversation with your child on Facebook whether it's his account , or your account or whoever 's account .
' I read things on his Facebook about how he had gone to Hot Springs one night and was driving 95 m.p.h. home because he was upset with a girl and it was his friend that called me and told me about all this .
' That prompted me to even actually start really going through his Facebook to see what was going on . '
Her son disagreed with his mother 's views and has asked not to have further contact with her .
In his criminal complaint , he wrote : ' Denise first hacked my Facebook and changed my password .
She also changed the password to my e-mail so I could not change it .
She posted things that involve slander and personal facts about my life . '
State prosecutor Todd Turner refused to comment on the case but cited Arkansas harassment laws that 'a person commits the offence if he engages in conduct or repeatedly commits acts that alarm or seriously annoy another person . '
Mrs New , who has visitation rights to her son while her parents have custodial rights , plans to contest the charge when she appears in court next month .
She said : ' I 'm going to fight it .
If I have to go even higher up , I 'm going to .
I 'm not gonna let this rest .
I think this could be a precedent - setting moment for parents . '
i Pad News
Tracker posted an interview today with Marcos Payan ( with Fusion Of Ideas , the chain that laser - engraves in store ) , who was a first - adopter of the new Apple iPad who needed to distinguish his pad from others soon to arrive around his place of work .
His solution was to have it laser - engraved with Peter , Ray , and Egon , as well as the Ghostbusters logo .
FOI : What did you have laser engraved onto your iPad ?
MP : I had the three original Ghostbusters and the Ghostbuster logo engraved on the back of my iPad .
Film has always been a passion of mine and the one film that I ’ve latched onto the most growing up was the original Ghostbusters .
That was the movie I watched over and over as a kid and really , it is the film that inspired me to take up film - making in the first place .
I can still watch that movie over and over again ( notice the ghost in the logo is n’t holding two fingers up .
I pretend the second movie never even happened ) .
I was lucky enough to meet Harold Ramis some years ago and he was kind enough to spend about twenty minutes with me talking about Ghostbusters and the industry in general .
At that time I had nothing for him to sign and this was before cell phones had cameras on them as a standard .
Now my goal is to get each of the Ghostbusters to sign the back of my iPad .
Not exactly sure how I will make that happen …
Move over , guidos .
The Russkies are coming !
A planned Russian - American reality show dubbed “ Brighton Beach ” aims to be a cross between “ Jersey Shore ” and “ Anna Karenina . ”
“ We are big fans of ‘ Jersey Shore , ’ but the Russian community has its own set of characters which we think could be even more interesting , ” said co-creator Elina Miller , who is working to find a network for the show .
“ There will be plenty of vodka , techno music and guys wearing Adidas pants , leather jackets and gold chains , and driving souped - up cars , ” she said .
“ There will also be a lot of hot , decked - out Russian girls . ”
Hoping to be among them is Mya Erlikh , 22 , a model who applied for a spot in the cast .
She said does n’t expect to get in as many bar fights as “ Jersey Shore ’s ” Nicole “ Snooki ” Polizzi .
“ I think that women should n’t fight , ” she said .
“ But I ’ve been told that if you get hit first , you should finish it .
S- -t happens . ”
Several cable networks have expressed interest in the show , Miller said .
Miller ’s partners , Alina Dizik and Christine Mahin , say they ’re looking for colorful characters like Snooki and “ Jersey Shore ” co-star The Situation who know how to have a good time .
The cast does not need to be from Brooklyn ’s Little Odessa , a k a Brighton Beach , but will spend two months living in a house there .
Despite being wildly popular , MTV’s “ Jersey Shore ” was criticized by Italian - Americans for spreading negative stereotypes through its embrace of the word “ guido . ”
Dizik says their show ’s goal is to deal with Russian stereotypes head - on .
“ We ’re really proud of that identity , ” the writer said .
“ But we would never want to portray this insular community in a way that is n’t positive .
We ’re used to everyone asking if we ’re in the mafia and if we drink vodka and get chased by bears . ”
Since the casting site brightonbeachshow.com went live last week , Dizik said , they ’ve received hundreds of prospects .
“ It would be really funny if we got a Russian mail - order bride , ” she said .
Giving “ Jersey Shore ” a run for its money , they ’ve already received a fair share of uniquely nicknamed applicants .
“ We ’ve heard from ‘ The Entity , ’ ‘ B - Boy ’ and ‘ Mr. OTB ’ [ Off The Boat ] , ” Dizik said .
Boris Kantarovich , 21 , who works at a wireless store in Brighton Beach , was among those taking a shot at the limelight .
He said he deserves it because he embodies the neighborhood .
“ I ’m crazy , I like to party , and when I ’m drunk , I do a great impression of Boris Yeltsin , ” he said .

When training journalists , I joke that Americans use more commas than British journalists because they are rich and can afford the extra ink .
The same applies to Irish , Australian or New Zealand journalists .
You often find long , comma-packed sentences in American newspapers .
They do n’t make for easy reading .
Use plenty of full stops instead — periods if you ’re American — and spare the comma .
Keeping track of who does what to whom is hard in long , comma-laden sentences .
Breaking sentences into smaller units of meaning makes writing easier to follow .
Commas for understanding
Only use commas where they aid understanding .
Writers often underrate the comma ’s use as an aid to sense .
Some Americans put commas between all clauses and sub-clauses .
Grammar checking software tells you to do the same .
Ignore the nagging .
Even when these tools are not using American rules , they often dance to American usage .
British - trained writers avoid them between short clauses at the start of sentences .
Americans also use commas before and at the end of a list of items .
This is sometimes called the Oxford comma .
That subject opens a fresh can of worms .
In Britain the last comma only gets used when one of the sequence items includes an and .
Some experts say Americans are moving towards British patterns and commas are now less common on both sides of the Atlantic .
Let ’s hope so .

( CNN ) -- Lawmakers in Ukraine scuffled with each other , throwing punches and eggs , as parliament met Tuesday to ratify a treaty with Russia that extends the latter 's navy presence in the Ukraine 's Crimean peninsula until 2042 .
The ruling Regions party eventually ratified the treaty but not before howls of protest from the opposition .
Someone set off a smoke bomb inside the building , while Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn sought refuge behind an umbrella as he was pelted with eggs .
During a rally attended by thousands on Saturday , opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko -- the former prime minister who lost to Viktor Yanukovych in the presidential election run-off in February -- said the ratification must be prevented at all costs .
She claimed that Yanukovych is " selling out " Ukraine , has " openly embarked on the path of destruction of ( Ukraine 's ) national interests , and has actually begun the process of eliminating the state 's sovereignty . "
The deal was signed last week by Yanukovych and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev .
Tymoshenko said it violated part of the Ukrainian Constitution , which forbids the country from hosting foreign military bases after 2017 .
The deal extends Russia 's lease of a major naval base in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol for an additional 25 years , in exchange for a 30 percent cut in the price of natural gas that Russia sells to Ukraine .
The agreement may bring an end to years of disputes over natural gas prices , which culminated in Russia turning off the pipeline to Ukraine .
The dispute affected not only Ukrainians , but many Europeans who depend on Russian gas pumped through Ukraine .
The two countries had been at odds ever since the " Orange Revolution " swept Yanukovych 's fiercely anti-Russian predecessor Viktor Yushchenko to power in 2005 .
Throughout his time in office , Yushchenko repeatedly threatened to expel Russia 's Black Sea Fleet from Sevastopol .
The Russian military lease there was scheduled to expire in 2017 .
Yanukovych said the new deal added a " concrete and pragmatic dimension " to centuries of relations between Ukrainians and Russians .
Opposition groups in Ukraine , however , were quick to denounce the agreement .
Yuschenko's " Our Ukraine " party said the treaty would lead to the " Russification " of Ukraine .
The rugged little boxes are similar to the so - called Baghdad batteries dating to the early centuries A.D. that some researchers believe were the first voltage - creating devices .
Fitted with magnesium plates inside , the MetalCell can be charged up with nothing more than the addition of saltwater .
The sodium in the salt reacts with the magnesium to create a dose of low - voltage power that can power up laptop , a flashlight , night vision specs , etc. when no other source is available .
The output can keep a laptop humming for more than four hours and can be recharged with fresh saltwater until the magnesium begins to deteriorate .

Anat Baron , who directed Beer Wars , kept getting asked about a list of which brands are owned by which of the two big beer companies operating in the U.S. , Anheuser - Busch InBev and Miller Coors .
I thought I ’d help out by putting together this list , which still probably is n’t exhaustive since it does n’t include experimental releases being test - marketed ( or brands I simply missed ) .
Putting together a list of this type is harder than it looks , because so many of the arrangements between InBev and MillerCoors and their subordinate brands are n’t all straightforward ownership deals .
Some involve partial ownership , distribution rights and alliances , limited ownership ( in certain markets ) and limited distribution rights ( ditto ) .
What should be included and what should n’t ?
Good question .
I tend to think that if the brand is controlled in a particular market ( usually that would be through distribution ) then it should be included .
To be clear , this is a snapshot of the U.S. market in 2009 .
Many of the relationships have since changed , while still others no longer exist .
Goose Island , for example , is now wholly owned by ABI , while Starr Hill Brewing no longer has any distribution arrangement with them .

Django 1.2 release schedule - Update 4
We 're getting close now !
We 're down to 46 open tickets , of which 32 are documentation or translation updates .
This leaves 14 substantive tickets before we can have a release candidate .
The good news for the week is that we are now at Zarro Boogs for the ORM component .
That means there are no known ORM issues blocking a release .
The bugs that remain are evenly spread between admin , forms , templating , and internationalization .
The bad news is that there has been one serious regression .
Revision 12889 fixed ticket # 12945 , but in the process introduced a backtracking regular expression that significantly slows down the parsing of { % url %} template tags in certain circumstances .
This problem has been logged as ticket # 13275 , and will be fixed before we make a release candidate .
In light of the otherwise good progress this week , we are not changing the expected release date .
This means we are still targeting a release candidate around April 19 , with a final release around April 26 .
As always -- any and all assistance is most welcome ; the more assistance we get , the faster 1.2 will land .
Russian fighter jets fly during the Victory Day military parade in Red Square in Moscow on May 9 , 2009 .
Today Russia celebrates the 64th anniversary of the World War Two victory over Nazi Germany .

LONDON , April 16 ( UPI ) -- Russia is increasingly flexing its military muscles by penetrating Western airspace .
European defense officials have been worried about an increasing number of Russian bombers entering Western airspace .
Advertisement
A pair of Tupolev Tu-160 Blackjack bombers -- the largest jet - powered combat aircraft ever built , capable of carrying nuclear missiles -- last month entered British airspace over Northern Scotland , Deutsche Welle reports .
Two Tornado fighter jets from the British air force intercepted the supersonic bombers , accompanying them for four hours until they left British airspace .
Similar incidents have occurred in recent years ; London has said Russian planes have penetrated British airspace more than 20 times since the start of 2009 .
Stefan Meister , a Russia expert with the German Council on Foreign Relations , said that some penetrations might be accidental .
He did n't rule out that there a Kremlin - authored strategy might be behind them .
" The infiltration into the airspace is one of the ways the Russians try to prove that Russia is still a power that should be treated with the respect , " Meister told United Press International in a telephone interview .
A friend of military muscle - flexing , Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in 2007 reactivated long - range patrols by nuclear - capable bombers after they had n't been sent out over the world 's oceans for 15 years .
The move came as the Kremlin expanded its grasp into the Arctic , as one of its submarines planted a flag in the seabed in territory it considers its own at the North Pole in 2007 .
The Arctic is being transformed by climate change .
Melting ice sheets will leave the oceans in the region possibly ice - free during the summer months .
This is opening a new Atlantic - Pacific shipping channel and makes the vast oil and gas resources lying under the seabed more accessible .
Patrol flights over Arctic waters have increased and Russia has given no sign that this will change – much the contrary .
Putin this year announced he wants to beef up the Russian air force .
The Kremlin in February unveiled its fifth - generation fighter jet and Putin wants his country 's military industry to start working on a new strategic bomber .
A launch of a new bomber program would be a giant project for the Russian aviation industry , which has been helped by numerous orders and major financial aid packages over the past years .
Yet it 's only one step of many that will see a major overhaul of the Russian air fleet .
Moscow plans to commission 1,500 new planes and helicopters to modernize the air force by 80 percent , the government said .
Patrick Kennedy leaves note for Ted on gravesite : " Dad , the unfinished business is done . "
( Photo : Courtesy John Dicker )
By Philip Rucker and Eli Saslow
The political odyssey of health care reform in many ways is the story of Ted Kennedy , and as President Obama signed the historic bill into law Tuesday , Kennedy 's gravesite was a place of quiet celebration and poignant reflection .
The late senator 's widow , Victoria Reggie Kennedy , spent hours Sunday at the simple white cross at Arlington National Cemetery marking where her husband was laid to rest only seven months ago .
Ted Kennedy 's youngest son , Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy ( D - R.I. ) , visited on Monday morning and left a hand - written note that read : " Dad , the unfinished business is done . "
And on a dreary Tuesday morning , dozens of school children and health care advocates paused at Kennedy 's tombstone to commemorate the man who for decades made overhauling the nation 's health - care system his life 's mission .
Kennedy 's legacy was not lost on anyone who filled the East Room of the White House for Obama 's bill - signing ceremony .
Members of Congress wore blue " TedStrong " wristbands in his honor and posed for pictures with Patrick Kennedy .
Caroline Kennedy , the senator 's niece , sat in the front row , with other members of the storied family .
Vicki Kennedy walked into the room with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) and Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid ( D - Nev. ) .
Obama received a thunderous applause when he evoked the ghost of Ted Kennedy near the climax of his speech .
" I remember seeing Ted walk through that door in a summit in this room a year ago , one of his last public appearances , and it was hard for him to make it , but he was confident that we would do the right thing , " Obama said .
When Obama sat to sign the bill , Patrick and Vicki Kennedy stood behind him .
Finally , Ted Kennedy 's dream became the law of the land .
update 16:00 : Steve Jobs answers to my open letter , see below .
Dear Steve Jobs ,
Having read your Thoughts on Flash , I could not agree with you more .
Flash is not the Web , and I am glad Apple seizes the opportunity of open standards to build better products for their customers .
But I am not so sure about your definition of the word Open in general .
I will not argue here that it is ironic you find the Apple Store more open than Flash .
I will not complain either that you like Openness so much that when you use “ Open Source ” Software to build your Mac operating system , you keep all the openness for yourself and do n’t give it to your customers , nor to the developers whose works have been very useful to you .
I figured that writing an open letter was an appropriate way to remind you of a couple of things that you may have forgotten — maybe in good faith — about open standards .
It is true that HTML5 is an emerging open standard , and I am glad that you adopted it ( well , did you really have the choice anyway ? ) .
However I have to say I am impressed in the way you succeed in saying how Apple has been doing great with open standards against Flash … while explaining Flash videos is not a problem , because Apple has implemented another video codec : H.264 .
May I remind you that H.264 is not an open standard ?
This video codec is covered by patents , and “ vendors and commercial users of products which make use of H.264/AVC are expected to pay patent licensing royalties for the patented technology ” ( ref ) .
This is why Mozilla Firefox and Opera have not adopted this video codec for their HTML5 implementation , and decided to chose Theora as a sustainable and open alternative .
Free Software Foundation Europe have been raising consensus and awareness on Open Standards for some years already .
I am sure we would be happy to help Apple make the good decision .
So , to begin with , here is the definition :
An Open Standard refers to a format or protocol that is subject to full public assessment and use without constraints in a manner equally available to all parties ; without any components or extensions that have dependencies on formats or protocols that do not meet the definition of an Open Standard themselves ; free from legal or technical clauses that limit its utilisation by any party or in any business model ; managed and further developed independently of any single vendor in a process open to the equal participation of competitors and third parties ; available in multiple complete implementations by competing vendors , or as a complete implementation equally available to all parties .

All video codecs are covered by patents .
A patent pool is being assembled to go after Theora and other “ open source ” codecs now .
Unfortunately , just because something is open source , it does n’t mean or guarantee that it does n’t infringe on others patents .
An open standard is different from being royalty free or open source .

Since it was an open letter , I think I have the right to publish his answer .
Glenn Stevens has delivered another glowing assessment of the Australian economy , and hinted that the string of rate rises might be nearing an end .
Speaking at a business forum in Toowoomba , Mr Stevens says Australia 's economy has surprised the Reserve Bank with its resilience through the financial crisis , and rapid recovery afterwards .
He says the unemployment rate is 2 percentage points lower than the RBA had forecast a year ago , and that GDP is 4 per cent higher than the bank expected .
" One would not expect the setting of interest rates to be unusually low , " Mr Stevens said .
" If the economy is growing close to trend , and inflation is close to target , one would expect interest rates to be pretty close to average .
" The Reserve Bank has moved early to raise the cash rate to levels that deliver interest rates for borrowers and depositors more like those that have been the average experience over the past 10 to 12 years .
Those interest rates are now pretty close to that average . "
Mr Stevens re-emphasised the role the re-emerging commodities boom is playing in boosting Australia 's national income .
" Demand for natural resources has returned and prices for those products are rising ...
Australia 's terms of trade will , it now appears , probably return during 2010 to something pretty close to the 50 - year peak seen in 2008 , " he explained .
" As usual with these things , we cannot know to what extent this change is permanent , as opposed to being a temporary cyclical event . "
He says that has the bank closely watching the effect on inflation , which it originally feared might fall below its 2 - 3 per cent target , but which it now worries may start accelerating again .
The Reserve Bank governor issued an appeal for understanding from home owners with mortgages .
He told the audience that interest rates had fallen to counter an emergency which , in Australia at least , did not eventuate .
" Eighteen months ago , the board moved quickly to establish a much lower level of interest rates in the face of a serious threat to economic activity , " he said .
" But interest rates could n't stay at those ' emergency ' lows if the threat did not materialise ...
Hence the cash rate has risen by 125 basis points over seven months - which is still only about a third the pace of the earlier declines . "
The Australian dollar slipped 0.15 cents to 92.46 US cents on the release of the speech , as investors interpreted Mr Stevens ' comments that rates were " pretty close " to average as slightly reducing the chance of a rate rise next month .
Last night representatives from the city DOT met with the Community Board 5 Transportation Committee to present the department 's plan [ pdf ] for turning a block of Broadway north of Union Square into another pedestrian plaza , which would extend along East 17th Street to the eastern corner of the park , at Park Avenue South .
Though some committee members seemed open to the idea ( no vote was taken ) , grievances were aired during the public comment portion of the evening .
" You 're taking the burden off of 17th Street and putting it on 18th Street , " area resident Roz Harris " fumed , " the Post reports .
" They should leave residential neighborhoods alone , " said another " irate " local , Madeline Renee .
" They are creating a big problem . "
And Bill Abrahamson , who owns 1 Union Square West , a mix of business and residential units , was worried about a proposal to banish cars from Union Square West between East 15th and 14th streets .
" I have n't heard anything about the economic impact , " said Abrahamson , who 's concerned about his tenants getting deliveries .
Between 2004 and 2008 , there were 95 pedestrian injuries along the entire corridor ( Broadway , Union Square West and Union Square East ) between 23rd Street and 14th Street , and the DOT says " safety and mobility are the main goals in the proposed new design . "
To that end , Broadway between 23rd Street and 18th Street would also be revamped under the proposal , changing the bike lane to a Class 1 dedicated bike lane physically separated from traffic by a row of parked cars .
Pedestrian refuge islands would also be added at those intersections .
The DOT plans to make the changes by Labor Day , and intends to add tables and chairs to East 17th Street between Broadway and Park Avenue South on the north side of the block , with much - needed a bike lane on the south side of the street , over Steve Cuozzo 's dead body .
Underwear Bomber : New Video of Training , Martyrdom Statements
Before suicide mission , Abdulmutallab says ' Jews and the Christians ' are enemy .
April 26 , 2010  --
New videos produced by al Qaeda in Yemen show the accused underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and others in his training class firing weapons at a desert camp whose targets included the Jewish star , the British Union Jack and the letters " UN . "
The videos , to be broadcast Monday on ABC World News with Diane Sawyer , appear to support Abdulmutallab's statements to the FBI that there are " others like me " who also trained with him in Yemen to carry out attacks against U.S. and western targets .
The tape also includes an apparent martyrdom statement in Arabic from the 23 - year old Nigerian justifying his actions against " the Jews and the Christians and their agents . "
He says , " the enemy is in your lands with their armies , the Jews and the Christians and their agents . "
He reads several passages from the Koran and adds , " God said if you do not fight back , He will punish you and replace you . "
Abdulmutallab was arrested on Christmas Day in Detroit after he allegedly attempted to set off a bomb on a Northwest Airlines jet .
He has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges but U.S. authorities say he is now cooperating in the investigation .
The videos , obtained by a Yemeni journalist working for ABC News , are the first to show Abdulmutallab with the al Qaeda group .
In the video he and others use automatic weapons to fire at targets that include a Jewish star , the British Union Jack and the a symbol of the United Nations .
Some , but not all , of the faces of others at the training camp are blurred in the video released by al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula .
Their logo is embedded in a corner of the screen .
" The other people in the video are presumably the people we are still looking for , " said Richard Clarke , an ABC News consultant and former White House counter - terrorism official .
The video also shows the purported al Qaeda fighters in Yemen firing at what appears to be an unmanned surveillance plane overhead .
As ABC News first reported , the U.S. launched a series of cruise missile strikes against suspected al Qaeda camps in Yemen , beginning Dec. 18 .
There is no indication of when the tape was recorded but U.S. officials believe Abdulmutallab was in Yemen between August and left in mid-December of 2009 on his suicide mission .
There was no immediate comment from Abdulmutallab 's lawyer about his statements on the tape .
On Tuesday , Attorney General Eric Holder confirmed that he had seen the Abdulmutallab video , but would not comment further , other than to say that Abdulmutallab is cooperating and the investigation continues .
" We 'll be looking at all of the information , all of the evidence that is uncovered , " said Holder , " and going through with him much of this information , so that we can glean actionable intelligence . "

Greece 's latest 3 - month bill auction shows just how little confidence markets have , still , in the nation 's short - term outlook .
Some were impressed by apparently high investor demand , but the fact of the matter is that 3 - month Greek bills sold at a yield of 3.65 % .
As a point of reference , Germany 's 10 - year bond yield is 3.11 % according to Bloomberg .
Thus Greece is paying far more to borrow for just 3 - months than Germany does for ten years .
Yet they both use the euro , and Greece is even widely expected to be bailed out by Germany in some form .
Ouch .
Much is being made of President Obama 's dismissal of George Stephanopoulos ' question about Sarah Palin 's criticism of the New START treaty , but let 's face it -- that was as easy as swatting a fly .
The really important question was asked by Steve Benen at The Washington Monthy :
... why is George Stephanopoulos using an idiotic quote from a dimwitted former half - term governor of a small state as the basis for a question to the president ?
In effect , the " GMA " host was saying , " Some conspicuously unintelligent right - wing media personality said something stupid about a subject she knows nothing about .
Mr. President , how do you respond ? "
Not so fast says George Stephanopoulos :
Whatever you think of Sarah Palin , she ’s a former VP candidate — and a potential challenger to President Obama — with a strong following in the GOP .
She made a pointed critique of a new Presidential policy .
By getting the President ’s response , I was doing my job .
Well , Ron Paul is a potential challenger to President Obama too , but his every utterance is n't breathlessly reported .
And while Palin may have a strong following in the GOP , the fact is , a majority of Republicans do n't think she 's qualified to be President , along with 71 % of Americans overall , making her potential challenge nothing more than a starburst in the tea party movement 's collective eye .
And a " pointed critique " of policy ?
It 's kind of like getting out there on a playground , a bunch of kids , getting ready to fight , and one of the kids saying , ' Go ahead , punch me in the face and I 'm not going to retaliate .
Go ahead and do what you want to with me . ' "
That 's not a pointed critique , it 's a Fox News contributor and future reality T.V. star , peddling her patented brand of folksy hate .
Rupert Murdoch nixes Sean Hannity Tea Party appearance Fox owner Rupert Murdoch has issued his own Tea Party manifesto .
Speaking earlier this week he said he did not think Fox News " should be supporting the Tea Party . "
So now it seems the romance might have faded for Fox News and the Tea Party .
The fair and balanced news channel is practically falling over itself to put quite some distance between Fox and the Tea Partyers .
Thursday the channel pulled mega conservative host Sean Hannity from a well - publicized spot at the Tea Party convention in Cincinatti .
Hannity was supposed to broadcast his show Thursday night from the rally but he was pulled out at the last minute .
The honchos at Fox said they had to pull Hannity out when they learned the rally organizers were charging the audience .
Head executive Bill Shine said , " Fox News never agreed to allow the Cincinnati Tea Party organizers to use Sean Hannity 's television program to profit from broadcasting his show from the event . "
“ We asked him to come back to New York once I realized the seriousness of what ’s was going on there , ” said Shine .
“ The Tea Party people were literally selling better seats of the program ” based on the Hannity show .
“ That crossed the line , yeah .
We told him to come back home . ”
Bet you dollars to donuts that it was Rupert Murdoch 's order that got carried out super pronto .

The future of the Web is everywhere .
The future of the Web is not at your desk .
It ’s not necessarily in your pocket , either .
It ’s everywhere .
With each new technological innovation , we continue to become more and more immersed in the Web , connecting the ever - growing layer of information in the virtual world to the real one around us .
But rather than get starry - eyed with utopian wonder about this bright future ahead , we should soberly anticipate the massive amount of planning and design work it will require of designers , developers and others .
The gap between technological innovation and its integration in our daily lives is shrinking at a rate much faster than we can keep pace with — consider the number of unique Web applications you signed up for in the past year alone .
This has resulted in a very fragmented experience of the Web .
While running several different browsers , with all sorts of plug-ins , you might also be running multiple standalone applications to manage feeds , social media accounts and music playlists .

This has resulted in a very fragmented experience of the Web .
While running several different browsers , with all sorts of plug-ins , you might also be running multiple standalone applications to manage feeds , social media accounts and music playlists .
You may also be interested in the following related posts :
Even though we may be adept at switching from one tab or window to another , we should be working towards a more holistic Web experience , one that seamlessly integrates all of the functionality we need in the simplest and most contextual way .
With this in mind , let ’s review four trends that designers and developers would be wise to observe and integrate into their work so as to pave the way for a more holistic Web browsing experience :
The browser as operating system , Functionally - limited mobile applications , Web - enhanced devices , Personalization .
1. The Browser As Operating System
Thanks to the massive growth of Web productivity applications , creative tools and entertainment options , we are spending more time in the browser than ever before .
The more time we spend there , the less we make use of the many tools in the larger operating system that actually runs the browser .
As a result , we ’re beginning to expect the same high level of reliability and sophistication in our Web experience that we get from our operating system .
For the most part , our expectations have been met by such innovations as Google ’s Gmail , Talk , Calendar and Docs applications , which all offer varying degrees of integration with one another , and online image editing tools like Picnik and Adobe ’s online version of Photoshop .
And those expectations will continue to be met by upcoming releases , such as the Chrome operating system — we ’re already thinking of our browsers as operating systems .
Doing everything on the Web was once a pipe dream , but now it ’s a reality .
Ubiquity
The one limitation of Web browsers that becomes more and more obvious as we make greater use of applications in the cloud is the lack of usable connections between open tabs .
Most users have grown accustomed to keeping many tabs open , switching back and forth rapidly between Gmail , Google Calendar , Google Docs and various social media tools .
But this switching from tab to tab is indicative of broken connections between applications that really ought to be integrated .
Mozilla is attempting to functionally connect tools that we use in the browser in a more intuitive and rich way with Ubiquity .
While it ’s definitely a step in the right direction , the command - line approach may be a barrier to entry for those unable to let go of the mouse .
In the screenshot below , you can see how Ubiquity allows you to quickly map a location shown on a Web page without having to open Google Maps in another tab .
This is one example of integrated functionality without which you would be required to copy and paste text from one tab to another .
Ubiquity ’s core capability , which is creating a holistic browsing experience by understanding basic commands and executing them using appropriate Web applications , is certainly the direction in which the browser is heading .
This approach , wedded to voice - recognition software , may be how we all navigate the Web in the next decade , or sooner : hands - free .
Tracemonkey and Ogg
Meanwhile , smaller , quieter releases have been paving the way to holistic browsing .
This past summer , Firefox released an update to its software that includes a brand new JavaScript engine called TraceMonkey .
This engine delivers a significant boost in speed and image - editing functionality , as well as the ability to play videos without third - party software or codecs .
Aside from the speed advances , which are always welcome , the image and video capabilities are perfect examples of how the browser is encroaching on the operating system ’s territory .
Being able to edit images in the browser could replace the need for local image - editing software on your machine , and potentially for separate applications such as Picnik .
At this point , it ’s not certain how sophisticated this functionality can be , and so designers and ordinary users will probably continue to run local copies of Photoshop for some time to come .
The new video functionality , which relies on an open - source codec called Ogg , opens up many possibilities , the first one being for developers who do not want to license codecs .
Currently , developers are required to license a codec if they want their videos to be playable in proprietary software such as Adobe Flash .
Ogg allows video to be played back in Firefox itself .
What excites many , though , is that the new version of Firefox enables interactivity between multiple applications on the same page .
One potential application of this technology , as illustrated in the image above , is allowing users to click objects in a video to get additional information about them while the video is playing .
2. Functionally - Limited Mobile Applications
So far , our look at a holistic Web experience has been limited to the traditional browser .
But we ’re also interacting with the Web more and more on mobile devices .
Right now , casual surfing on a mobile device is not a very sophisticated experiences and therefore probably not the main draw for users .
The combination of small screens , inconsistent input options , slow connections and lack of content optimized for mobile browsers makes this a pretty clumsy , unpredictable and frustrating experience , especially if you ’re not on an iPhone .
However , applications written specifically for mobile environments and that deal with particular , limited sets of data — such as Google ’s mobile apps , device - specific applications for Twitter and Facebook and the millions of applications in the iPhone App Store — look more like the future of mobile Web use .
Because the mobile browsing experience is in its infancy , here is some advice on designing mobile experiences : rather than squeezing full - sized Web applications ( i.e. ones optimized for desktops and laptops ) into the pocket , designers and developers should become proficient at identifying and executing limited functionality sets for mobile applications .
Amazon Mobile
A great example of a functionally - limited mobile application is Amazon ’s interface for the iPhone ( screenshot above ) .
Amazon has reduced the massive scale of its website to the most essential functions : search , shopping cart and lists .
And it has optimized the layout specifically for the iPhone ’s smaller screen .
Facebook for iPhone
Facebook continues to improve its mobile version .
The latest version includes a simplified landing screen , with an icon for every major function of the website in order of priority of use .
While information has been reduced and segmented , the scope of the website has not been significantly altered .
Each new update brings the app closer to replicating the full experience in a way that feels quite natural .
Gmail for iPhone
Finally , Gmail ’s iPhone application is also impressive .
Google has introduced a floating bar to the interface that allows users to batch process emails , so that they do n’t have to open each email in order to deal with it .
3. Web - Enhanced Devices
Mobile devices will proliferate faster than anything the computer industry has seen before , thereby exploding entry points to the Web .
But the Web will vastly expand not solely through personal mobile devices but through completely new Web - enhanced interfaces in transportation vehicles , homes , clothing and other products .
In some cases , Web enhancement may lend itself to marketing initiatives and advertising ; in other cases , connecting certain devices to the Web will make them more useful and efficient .
Here are three examples of Web - enhanced products or services that we may all be using in the coming years :
Web - Enhanced Grocery Shopping
Web - connected grocery store “ VIP ” cards may track customer spending as they do today : every time you scan your customer card , your purchases are added to a massive database that grocery stores use to guide their stocking choices .
In exchange for your data , the stores offer you discounts on selected products .
Soon with Web - enhanced shopping , stores will be able to offer you specific promotions based on your particular purchasing history , and in real time ( as illustrated above ) .
This will give shoppers more incentive to sign up for VIP programs and give retailers more flexibility and variety with discounts , sales and other promotions .
Web - Enhanced Utilities
One example of a Web - enhanced device we may all see in our homes soon enough is a smart thermostat ( illustrated above ) , which will allow users not only to monitor their power usage using Google PowerMeter but to see their current charges when it matters to them ( e.g. when they ’re turning up the heater , not sitting in front of a computer ) .
Web - Enhanced Personal Banking
Another useful Web enhancement would be a display of your current bank account balance directly on your debit or credit card ( as shown above ) .
This data would , of course , be protected and displayed only after you clear a biometric security system that reads your fingerprint directly on the card .
Admittedly , this idea is rife with privacy and security implications , but something like this will nevertheless likely exist in the not - too - distant future .
4. Personalization
Thanks to the rapid adoption of social networking websites , people have become comfortable with more personalized experiences online .
Being greeted by name and offered content or search results based on their browsing history not only is common now but makes the Web more appealing to many .
The next step is to increase the user ’s control of their personal information and to offer more tools that deliver new information tailored to them .
Centralized Profiles
If you ’re like most people , you probably maintain somewhere between two to six active profiles on various social networks .
Each profile contains a set of information about you , and the overlap varies .
You probably have unique usernames and passwords for each one , too , though using a single sign - on service to gain access to multiple accounts is becoming more common .
But why should n’t the information you submit to these accounts follow the same approach ?
In the coming years , what you tell people about yourself online will be more and more under your control .
This process starts with centralizing your data in one profile , which will then share bits of it with other profiles .
This way , if your information changes , you ’ll have to update your profile only once .
Data Ownership
The question of who owns the data that you share online is fuzzy .
In many cases , it even remains unaddressed .
However , as privacy settings on social networks become more and more complex , users are becoming increasingly concerned about data ownership .
In particular , the question of who owns the images , video and messages created by users becomes significant when a user wants to remove their profile .
To put it in perspective , Royal Pingdom , in its Internet 2009 in Numbers report , found that 2.5 billion photos were uploaded to Facebook each month in 2009 !
The more this number grows , the more users will be concerned about what happens to the content they transfer from their machines to servers in the cloud .
While it may seem like a step backward , a movement to restore user data storage to personal machines , which would then intelligently share that data with various social networks and other websites , will likely spring up in response to growing privacy concerns .
A system like this would allow individuals to assign meta data to files on their computers , such as video clips and photos ; this meta data would specify the files ’ availability to social network profiles and other websites .
Rather than uploading a copy of an image from your computer to Flickr , you would give Flickr access to certain files that remain on your machine .
Organizations such as the Data Portability Project are introducing this kind of thinking accross the Web today .
Recommendation Engines
Search engines — and the whole concept of search itself — will remain in flux as personalization becomes more commonplace .
Currently , the major search engines are adapting to this by offering different takes on personalized search results , based on user - specific browsing history .
If you are signed in to your Google account and search for a pizza parlor , you will more likely see local results .
With its social search experiment , Google also hopes to leverage your social network connections to deliver results from people you already know .
Rounding those out with real - time search results gives users a more personal search experience that is a much more realistic representation of the rapid proliferation of new information on the Web .
And because the results are filtered based on your behavior and preferences , the search engine will continue to “ learn ” more about you in order to provide the most useful information .
Another new search engine is attempting to get to the heart of personalized results .
Hunch provides customized recommendations of information based on users ’ answers to a set of questions for each query .
The more you use it , the better the engine gets at recommending information .
As long as you maintain a profile with Hunch , you will get increasingly satisfactory answers to general questions like , “ Where should I go on vacation ? ”
The trend of personalization will have significant impact on the way individual websites and applications are designed .
Today , consumer websites routinely alter their landing pages based on the location of the user .
Tomorrow , websites might do similar interface customizations for individual users .
Designers and developers will need to plan for such visual and structural versatility to stay on the cutting edge .
Conclusion
Each of these trends — browser operating systems , mobile , Web - enhanced devices and personalization — provides a foundation for the other .
First , traditional browsers will continue to expand their functional scope to meet our demands , ideally in a way that simplifies the user experience rather than just by adding more tabs or toolbars .
But our demands will ultimately drive mobile innovation as well , expanding points of entry to the Web far beyond our desks .
As people grow accustomed to being able to access the Web from anywhere , the next logical step will be to create unique entry points , specific to context and purpose and crafted especially for us .
This final stage will be truly transformative , imbuing our daily lives with a rich layer of uniquely targeted information that will make us more efficient and effective in what we do .
But reaching every step along the way will fully depend on the vision of designers and developers to refine existing interfaces and create completely new ones .
To Sum Up
Web browsers will continue to be refined and expanded to include new functionality that will approach an operating system ’s level of sophistication .
Designers and developers need to become proficient at identifying and executing functionally limited sets for mobile applications .
Previously unconnected objects will be enhanced with filters to send and receive contextual data across the Web .
The design of these objects will change as a result of new interface attributes .
Personalization trends will give users more control over their information and bring new , relevant information to them .

Muslim nurses CAN cover up ... but Christian colleagues can't wear crucifixes
Muslim doctors and nurses are to be allowed to wear long sleeves for religious reasons - despite the risk of spreading deadly superbugs .
The Department of Health will allow female Muslim staff to opt out of a strict NHS dress code to cover their arms and protect their modesty .
But campaigners warn that the NHS is putting lives at risk because guidance that all staff should be ' bare below the elbow ' was introduced after long sleeves were blamed for spreading MRSA .
Warning : Campaigners say that the NHS is putting lives at risk because guidance that all staff should be ' bare below the elbow ' was introduced after long sleeves were blamed for spreading MRSA
The change has been brought in after some female Muslims objected to being forced to bare their arms on wards .
The Department of Health has also relaxed its no jewellery rule to let Sikhs wear their Kara bangles as long as they can be pushed up to the elbow when dealing with patients .
The policy is in stark contrast to the treatment of nurse Shirley Chaplin who last week lost her discrimination battle against Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital Trust which claimed the cross she wore round her neck was a ' hazard ' in case it scratched patients .
Last night she accused the NHS of ' double standards . '
She added : ' What can you say ?
It seems that life is stacked up against Christians these days . '
Scrubbed up well : Surgeons in short sleeves washing hands before operation
Derek Butler , chairman of the MRSA Action UK , a group headed by respected microbiologist Hugh Pennington , said : ' Anything such as jewellery , long sleeves and ties can harbour bacteria and transfer superbugs to patients .
This is why they should be banned for all staff regardless of their religion . '
The new guidance says staff can wear uniforms with long sleeves as long as they roll them up securely above their elbows to wash and when they are on wards .
Those wanting to stay covered up when dealing with patients can use special disposable ' over sleeves . '
A Department of Health spokesman said : ' The overall purpose of the guidance , to ensure patient safety by adherence to good hand hygiene , is not prejudiced by the additional dress options that have now been identified . '

With my free trial time just about coming to an end , I figured this was as good a time as any to reflect on the experience .
I managed to finish the story before going dark , so I 'll start there ( spoiler free , o'course ) .
If you were to give a quick synopsis on the FFXIV : ARR story , it actually would n't be too bad .
Nothing special , but not too bad at all .
The last five levels were pretty good , and the actual story bits for the first 45 levels did their job .
However , that 's about where the compliments end .
The presentation of the story is awful .
There is SO MUCH FILLER I do n't even know where to begin , or how to explain it .
Basically , every few levels something interesting happens and you 're given a real story mission .
The type from FFXI , the type you ( mostly ) looked forward to .
They 're decent .
Now maybe it 's nostalgia talking , but I did n't mind nothing happening for a level or two while I leveled into the next story arc .. and I much prefer it to what ARR tried to do .
That is a story mission .
In fact , it is one of the last story missions right before the final showdown ( epic , right ? ) .
It 's not an abnormality , it 's FFXIV .
You do something cool and relevant , then get sent somewhere else in a somewhat related capacity .
When you arrive , the guy you 're supposed to talk to does n't trust you .
Or he does n't have the information you need just yet .
So here , do this random shit in the meantime .
Not once , not twice , but usually like 5 - 10 times before you get anywhere .
It sucks , and I hated it every step of the way .
And of course , there were other non-mission fetch quests in the vicinity to pile on once you arrived where ever you were supposed to be .
Great .
Maybe that would n't be so bad if the quest tracker could track more than five quests at a time .
Or let you choose what quests you wanted to track ( order of acceptance , then pushed off ) .
Or if you could see the quest locations on the map for something other than the five quests you were tracking ( not tracked = not mapped ) .
Or if , you know , the quests were at all interesting to do .
Sometimes I feel like they forgot that they already added certain things ..
It is what it is I guess .
It 's exclamation point gaming at it 's finest , so I really should n't be too surprised .
I knew it was going to be this kind of game , I 'm just disappointed it interfered with the story .
Now , with that being said , are you ready to see how you level up in ARR when you 're NOT doing the story ?
After all , there 's only one story and so many fetch quests .. and the staple of FF - MMO series is changing jobs on the fly .
Good old grind parties ?
Dungeon grinding ?
Keep dreaming .
Feast your eyes on the leveling content of ARR :
You stand in a centralized location until an event pops , run with the zerg , and then spam an AoE for a few seconds until it 's over .
Return to centralized location ; repeat .
Basically , a bastardized version of GW2 events .
The type of shit my nightmares were made off when I was sitting there wondering if Arena
Net could actually pull off what they set out to do .
Looks fun , does n't it ?
Ugh .
I guess you could avoid that if you wanted , even if it is at least twice as fast as everything else .
The game obviously has dungeons , and there is a cross server dungeon finder to help you find groups .
I believe I already touched upon it in my previous " archaic " post , so I wo n't rehash the critiques there ... but here 's something else .
It 's fucking slow .
And I 'm not talking about slow to find members , even though its slow there too .
I 'm talking about what happens after your party is full .
Yeah , after you 're queued to find a party .. you 're then queued to get in the actual dungeon .
Just find some people on your server and run in you say ?
Sorry , you can't even enter any dungeon without using the duty finder .
Even if you 're in a full group , you then have to use it and queue up .
What are the dungeons like when you actually get inside , you ask ?
HAH , well ... ok they 're actually pretty good .
No two fights are the same , and the mechanics are solid .
They 're also tuned pretty well , and plenty can be somewhat challenging if you roll in with a bunch of retards .
Definitely an enjoyable experience and one of the few bright spots of my playing time ( do n't get it twisted though , we 're talking about leveling dungeons here ) .
I 'm sure some people will be able to stick around for them .
Did you know it was purdy , btw ?
Did n't expect it to be all negative , did you ?
Here 's another positive !
I greatly enjoyed the company of all the old faces giving the game a whirl ( sup ) , and I may even toss $ 9 towards the game as a 3D chatroom until everybody dissipates again .
I 'm sure overall this comes off pretty harsh , but I 'm trying to be objective and judge the game on its own merits rather than judge it versus the turd that was 1.0 .
Things like " well they fixed the combat lag ! " are all well and good , but do you really give points to a game for NOT LAGGING ?
It 's great that they fixed it ( although its still a rubberbanding disaster visually ) , but it should never have been there to begin with .
So while it is definitely lightyears ahead of 1.0 by comparison , it 's still just not a very good game to me .
Obviously , I wo n't be playing come subscription time .
A check - in down the road for an expansion story ?
Meh , maybe , but I 'm gone the first time I have to bring lemon tea to the guard post .
Not again .
5/10 Cels .
Elite donors are pissed at Democrats .
And that 's a bad thing ?
There was a piece in Politico last week that did an impressive job of simultaneously capturing and embodying why so much of America thinks our political system sucks .
The headline read “ Elite Donors Dodge the DNC , ” and the gist was that the Obama administration has so badly bungled the care and feeding of big - money contributors that fat cat Dems are n’t flocking to write their party big checks at the same rate rich Republicans did when the Bushies ran this town .
Oh , sure , Politico acknowledges , “ the DNC ’s fundraising is humming along at a record pace , ” but last year ’s haul was nowhere near the level of money - grubbing achieved by the RNC under similar one - party rule .
And a prime reason , Politico posits , is that only 10 percent of the president ’s biggest fundraisers , many of whom are “ chafing at not getting enough love from the administration , ” have ponied up the max .
A special raspberry went out to the recently kicked - to - the - curb Desiree Rogers for , among other sins , failing to make sure important supporters got their White House Christmas cards .
Another notable outrage was not inviting enough big donors to the state dinner for Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .
One dissed contributor huffed that the event was treated more like “ a big staff party ” than an opportunity to smooch the backsides of those who ’d worked long and hard to fund Obama ’s campaign .
( Admittedly , the contributor did n’t put it in those exact terms . )
More broadly , according to Politico ’s interviews and its perusal of White House visitor logs , the Obamas have thus far failed to invite major funders to nearly as many private White House tours , holiday parties , Camp David sleepovers , and private legislative briefings as did their predecessors .
But all is not lost , Politico assures us .
Among other signs that lessons are being learned in Obamaland , Rogers ’s replacement will be Julianna Smoot , who “ brings a variety of strengths to the job :
She ’s detail - oriented , she ’s a strong manager , and she knows both the political and the donor worlds . ”
“ A lot of things need to be fixed , ” one White House insider confided .
Well , color me happy .
How nice to hear that this administration will at last begin showing big donors the proper degree of pucker .
By all means , screw change we can believe in .
Let ’s stick with the tried - and - true model of giving the most attention , access , and deference to those who fork over the most cash .
Financially aiding a presidential candidate who shares your progressive governing vision is all well and good , but , honestly , what ’s the point if the guy does n’t invite you over for movie night from time to time ?
I realize all the rich Dems who tirelessly squeezed checks out of their rich friends for the campaign just want to feel appreciated .
Fat cats need love too .
But was n’t part of Obama ’s explicit appeal his vow to move politics away from the business - as - usual , pay - for - access mentality ?
For big-money
Dems to jump on that bandwagon and then get their panties in a bunch when Obama tries to stick with that whole “ change ” mantra suggests a pathological arrogance : I knew he ’d keep all those other losers at arm ’s length , but I assumed he ’d make an exception for me .
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington DC recently stopped handling foster care and adoption in the District of Columbia because it refuses to abide by the law which , when same - sex marriage is implemented , will require it to consider same - sex couples as potential parents .
The seven staff members , 43 children and their families , and the 35 foster families involved were transferred to the National Center for Children and Families ( NCCF ) for future administration .
This is not a routine matter .
Given its theo - politics and the general track record of the Roman Catholic Church worldwide on child abuse , maybe it is better that way .
I would n’t want any child exposed to such bigotry especially when it ’s couched in religious language .
Nonetheless , I want to clarify from a theological perspective what is at hand and condemn from a moral standpoint the Archdiocese ’s actions .
Same - sex marriage is here to stay , whether the Catholic Church likes it or not .
No state will force the Church to perform or recognize such ceremonies .
But any agency that receives money from the government must conform to certain rules based on the common good .
That is how a democracy works .
Catholic Charities is not above the law .
When same - sex couples present themselves for parenthood with all the requirements met , there is no justification for refusing them unless , as some Catholic authorities reason , they are not fit parents because of their sexuality .
This is heterosexism raised ( better , lowered ) to the level of policy .
It has no place in public life even if it is introduced under religious cover .
Theologically , the Catholic Church is saying that its own outmoded ideas on sexuality are more sacred than the well - being of children .
Its outdated take on sexuality trumps the many studies that confirm that same - sex parents are equally up to the challenges of raising children .
In the institutional Catholic Church ’s theological view , marriage between a man and a woman is more important than commitment on the part of two loving adults to take on the care of a child , a monumental responsibility as any parent knows .
Happily , an increasing number of Catholics completely reject this view and support same - sex couples and families .
It is important to underscore that what is touted as “ the ” Catholic position by the hierarchy is but one among differing Catholic theologies of sexuality .
Note to lawmakers :
The hierarchy does not speak for the members on this and each member is a voter .
One would think that for all the Catholic Church ’s rhetoric on family and human life the Archdiocesan officials would have a little shame about abandoning their work with children .
If they could bring themselves to confront the dire needs of DC ’s foster children , they would hide their faces rather than be connected with any policy that would prevent children from being placed in loving homes regardless of the gender constellation of the parents .
Alas , there is a shortage of shame here .
However , it is important to underscore that no Catholic theology of sexuality , however narrow , trumps the demands of justice and the works of mercy as Catholic imperatives .
Several dynamics in this deal make it especially heinous .
First , the timing is suspicious since the DC marriage bill is still under review in Congress .
DC Councilman Jim Graham suggested that “ there may be a relationship between this action and the congressional deliberations on these issues . ”
Tactics are all .
I would not be surprised to find that this is part of the rationale given how desperate conservative Catholics are to keep their ideology afloat .
I hope members of Congress will see this move for what it is .
Second , the Archdiocese announced the move in an Alice in Wonderland press release filled with linguistic sleights - of - hand , claiming that they “ transitioned ” the program to the NCCF when in fact they quit the business .
Let ’s be clear even if we do not agree .
In the next sentence they announced that they “ remain committed to continuing to serve the vulnerable of the District of Columbia through the 82 programs the agency operates in the region . ”
It is a hard claim to substantiate given what they have just done .
Then they turned the tables and proclaimed that it was not their doing but that the DC Government told them that they “ would be ineligible to serve as a foster care provider due to the impending D.C. same sex marriage law . ”
Yes , dears , because you already announced that you would not obey the law .
What do you expect ?
They go on to laud their own work , then bemoan the fact that “ our efforts to avoid this outcome were not successful . ”
Once again they blame others for their refusal to conform to the law .
It would be laughable if it were not so pernicious .
I have my own suspicions about the Archdiocese ’s sanctimonious “ ensuring continuity of care … ” achieved by “ seamlessly ” transitioning the program .
Foster care and adoption are extremely difficult , not very lucrative , endlessly bureaucratic endeavors .
Social workers find the work taxing because so many of the children are in such difficult circumstances .
This is an easy program to jettison when money is tight .
I hope I am wrong about their motivation , but given the morals exhibited in this case nothing is surprising .
Third , what makes all of this so predictable is that this is precisely what the Archdioceses of Boston did in 2006 when same - sex marriage came to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts .
After a century of providing support services for children whose birth parents could not care for them , Catholic Charities there faced the same situation as in Washington .
Under the leadership of its then president , J. Bryan Hehir , Catholic Charities in Boston was faced with abiding by the state law or doing the Catholic Church ’s bidding .
They tried every trick in the book to skirt the law .
They asked then Governor Mitt Romney for an exemption , they launched various legislative strategies , all with the help of a powerful local law firm .
But that pesky democracy reared its head and they , too , were expected to obey the law .
So they went out of the adoption business .
They reasoned that it made up 4 % of their budget so it could be sacrificed in order to keep the rest of their government funding .
Religion is a dirty business .
In Catholicism , a lot of local activities are dictated by the Vatican .
Surely the “ success ” of the Boston move was made clear to the DC people who followed suit .
I expect more dioceses to fall in line as same - sex marriage becomes the law of the land .
I only hope there are agencies ready and willing to pick up the pieces .
Nothing less than children ’s lives are at stake .
Pope Benedict XVI , in his recent meeting with bishops from Ireland where a church official systematically covered up sexual abuse , and called it “ not only a heinous crime but also a grave sin which offends God and wounds the dignity of the human person . ”
Child neglect is a form of child abuse .
It is against the law .
Good people condemn it .
Let the Archdiocese of Washington DC take a lesson .
Paradise can always use some assistance …
For anyone planning a trip to Sydney , Australia in the near future and concerned about your ability to score blow , there ’s nothing to fear , the country is awash in the stuff the way a eucalyptus tree is awash in koala bears .
Reports news.com.au :
SYDNEY is the cocaine capital of Australia with use – and arrests – for the drug soaring .
And it ’s believed that a rise in cocaine arrests is not down to increased policing but rather a result of the growing desire for the drug .
“ The short but unhelpful answer is that more cocaine is getting into the country , ” said NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research Director Dr Don Weatherburn said .
Obviously this must be an open relief for most US travelers looking to maintain the habits that they are privy to the way one calls for a Domino ’s pizza on a Tuesday night .
But of course there is one caveat .
What caveat you are wondering ?
The prices our dears .
National Drug and Alcohol Research Training Australia spokesman Paul Dillon said the “ cocaine availability change has been quite remarkable ” in the past 18 months .
“ All the indications are that we are starting to see more cocaine around , ” he said .
“ The most interesting thing is there ’s different prices for different quality . ”
He said the regular $ 300 per gram still exists but people are paying $ 400 for even higher grades .
“ The problem with cocaine is that it ’s seen as a light and fluffy drug but it ’s a very addictive drug and it can be very destructive , ” he said .
After all as any coke head can tell you going straight to the source ( South America ) will probably net you a gram for $ 3 - $ 5 but then again you wont be amongst the company of sun bronzed Aussies snorting the stuff off their brief cases at the local pub which kind of makes the $ 395 premium almost worth it .
Ai n’t it a shame Sydney , Australia and Medelin , Columbia are so far from each other ?

One of the newest victims of the foreclosure crisis is infamous " Octomom " Nadya Suleman , who faces eviction from her $ 540,000 California house if she can't make a $ 450,000 balloon payment .
Adult entertainment company Vivid is offering a bailout of sorts , promising to pay off the balance of Suleman 's house if she agrees to make a pornographic film .
With 14 children to feed and shelter , should Suleman accept Vivid 's offer ?
( Watch Wendy Williams talk about Octomom 's porn possibility )
There has to be a better way : " Please , please , please " let Suleman keep her clothes on , says Christie D'Zurilla in the Los Angeles Times .
Yes , she has that " new ' bikini body , ' " but this is n't the right way to use it — for her , or for us .
Should n't there be " some provision in the stimulus bill to keep this from happening " ?
" Porn producer offers ' Octomom ' Nadya Suleman help with the mortgage "
Making porn is the responsible thing to do , in this case : Has n't Suleman taken enough handouts ? , asks blogger Radical Mommy at MomLogic .
In this economy , she should be grateful someone 's offering to pay off her home for such a small price .
Suleman took on the responsibility of having 14 kids , and she needs to take care of them .
Besides , it 's not like a few pornos will " make people look down on her more than they already do . "
" Octomom SHOULD do porn ! "
If Octomom goes for it , she 's not alone : Vivid knows what it 's doing , says Tracy Clark - Flory in Salon .
" Tons of people find hopelessness extremely titillating , " and Suleman is the embodiment of " total desperation . "
Unfortunately , in " these dark financial days , " Suleman 's not the only desperate woman considering a turn to the sex industry .
" Offer to Octomom : Do porn , save home "
With the end of the world apparently scheduled for December 31 , 2012 , there ’s sure to be a number of opportunistic companies looking to cash in on the upcoming apocalypse .
One such company is Vivos , which envisions a network of 20 underground shelters located near major cities across the U.S. with accommodation for up to 4,000 people .
Aside from some unspecified end of the world scenario brought about by the end of the Mayan calendar , the shelters will also be built to survive the stock standard reasons for the apocalypse such as nuclear war and collision with an asteroid .
Each fully self - contained Vivos shelter complex will accommodate a community of 172 – 200 people in spacious quarters for up to one year or autonomous survival to “ ride out the potential events . ”
The airtight shelters are designed to survive virtually any catastrophe , or threat scenario including natural disasters , a nuclear blast , chemical and biological weapons , or even just good ol ’ social anarchy .
The US$ 10 million luxury Vivos shelter design is based on a spoke cluster of 10 radiating residential wings surrounding a two story , 60 foot diameter central dome .
The complex includes community gathering areas and private suites providing comfortable accommodations with about 100 square feet per person – well above the 40 and 50 square feet minimums advised by the Red Cross and FEMA respectively for long - term underground shelter .
Each Vivos facility is equipped with its own internal power generation system , backup battery banks , deep water wells , biological , chemical and radiation air filtration systems , sewage disposal systems , abundant food and clothing storage , security devices , medical equipment and supplies and critical support equipment including off - road vehicles – presumably for doing battle with mutant road warriors once the dust settles topside .
All shelters include complete and fully furnished living quarters , with semi-private bedrooms , deluxe bathrooms , kitchen and dining areas , spacious lounges and meeting areas , computers , theater electronics , exercise equipment , well stocked educational and entertainment materials , an urgent medical and dental care center , security facilities with a detention area , vaults for valuables and munitions , a communications center , laundry facilities , a repair shop , and abundant storage areas for food , fuel , water , medicine , supplies and a wardrobe inventory with a large selection of comfortable clothing and footwear in all sizes .
Prior to any engagement of a shelter the Vivos Group will provide operational oversight of each Owner ’s Association for ongoing maintenance , replenishment , security , monitoring , surveillance , notifications and advisories .
Then , once a facility is occupied and under lock down the co-owners will elect a board and take over autonomous operation and management of their particular facility .
All members need to do is arrive before the facility is sealed and secured .
The Vivos network already includes a group of existing nuclear hardened shelters .
Varying in size , these shelters will be completely retrofitted with state of the art security , mechanical , electrical , filtration and air handling systems and will be the first shelters in the network due to come on line this year .
Vivos plans to complete construction and commissioning of the remaining network of underground community shelters within time for the possible end of the world on December 31 , 2012 .
Spaces in the bunkers are likely to be in the US $ 50,000 price range and so far over 1,000 applications have been received to reserve a place .
So , if you ’re the overly cautious , paranoid or just plain gullible type , you might want to get along to the Vivos site where there is a handy doomsday clock counting down to New Years Eve 2012 to let you know just how long you ’ve got to get your pennies together .

From the Niels Bohr Institute – Studies agree on a 1 meter rise in sea levels
New research from several international research groups , including the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen provides independent consensus that IPCC predictions of less than a half a meter rise in sea levels is around 3 times too low .
The new estimates show that the sea will rise approximately 1 meter in the next 100 years in agreement with other recent studies .
The results have been published in the scientific journal , Geophysical Research Letters .
Since IPCC published the predictions in 2007 , that the sea would rise less than half a metre in the next 100 years , it became clear that there was a problem with the prediction models as they did not take into account the dynamic effects of the melting ice sheets .
The estimates were therefore too low .
Better prediction models
However , the new model estimates , from international research groups from England , China and Denmark , give independent support for the much higher predictions from other recent studies .
” Instead of using temperature to calculate the rise in sea levels , we have used the radiation balance on Earth – taking into account both the warming effect of greenhouse gasses and the cooling effect from the sulfur clouds of large volcanic eruptions , which block radiation ” , explains Aslak Grinsted , PhD in geophysics at the Centre for Ice and Climate , the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen .
The research is based on observations of sea levels from the 1700s to the present and estimates of the radiation balance through approximately 1000 years .
The sun ’s heat varies periodically and currently there is a solar minimum , but even if solar radiation were to reach its lowest level in the past 9300 years , it will have only a minimal impact on sea levels .
Some have suggested that you could inject sulfur into the atmosphere and get a kind of artificial volcanic eruption cooling effect , but the calculations show that it would only slow down the rise in sea levels for 12 - 20 years .
What are important are greenhouse gasses like CO2 , the research shows .
Reduced emissions
The results are that the sea level will rise between 0.7 and 1.2 meters during the next 100 years .
The difference depends on what mankind does to stop the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
If we seriously reduce the emissions of CO2 globally , the sea will only rise 0.7 meters , while there will be a dramatic rise of 1.2 meter if we continue indifferent with the current use of energy based on fossil fuels .
In the calculations the researchers assume that we continue to emit CO2 , but that we move more towards other energy supplies and reduce our use of fossil fuels and with that reduce the emission of greenhouse gases .
This scenario would give a rise in sea levels of around 1 meter .
Other energy sources important now
Even a one meter rise in sea levels would have a big impact in some places in the world with low lying areas , which will become much more susceptible to extreme storm surges , where water could easily sweep over the coasts .
” The research results show that it is therefore important to do something now to curb the emission of CO2 – there is about a half meter difference in sea level depending on whether nations of the world continue to pump greenhouse gases from fossil fuels into the atmosphere or whether we slam on the brakes and use other energy sources ” , explains Aslak Grinsted .

Car Accident Attorneys – Personal Injury Lawyers
There are plenty of drivers on the roads every day , creating traffic and increasing the possibility of car accidents .
Whether you are a native of the area , a visitor looking at the historic sites , or a traveler passing through on one of its busy thoroughfares , you risk of getting into a car accident in just as much as anyone else ’s .
If you have been in a car accident , get in touch with a car accident lawyer to assist you with your case .
It is true that many car accidents are simple fender benders , when one car bumps another car at low speeds or while stopped .
These rarely result in serious injuries and do not usually cost much money to repair the car .
However , all too frequently , car accidents are much more serious than a simple fender bender .
If you have been hit by another car at a high speed , or from the front or the side , the chance of your car sustaining major damage and of you receiving serious injuries is much higher .
Although car accidents are always stressful experiences , they can be even worse when they occur on busy streets or highways that see many more accidents .
Getting into a car accident on a busy highway also increases the risk of getting involved in a particularly dangerous accident with large vehicles like buses or tractor trailers , which can increase your car damage and your injuries .
If you have been involved in a car accident , the first thing you need to do is to call the police and report the accident , if you are able to .
The police can respond to the accident and begin an accident report that will detail how the accident happened and whose fault it was .
Then , you need to seek medical care right away even if you do not think you have been hurt .
Often , injuries from car accidents seem minor or do not even show up until much later .
The best way to make sure that your injuries do not worsen is by seeking immediate medical care after the accident , whether you go to your physician or to the emergency room .
The police officer can assist with this by calling an ambulance when you report the accident .
Other important information after a car accident is to try to get photographic evidence of the damage to the car , to try to find any witnesses who saw what happened during the accident , and to exchange insurance information with the other driver .
Again , the police officer who responds to your accident can often assist with this , especially if you have been hurt and need medical attention .
Unfortunately , many people find out too late just how expensive it can be to treat your injuries and to repair or replace your vehicle after a car accident .
A single trip to the emergency room can cost hundreds of dollars , and even one day ’s stay in the hospital can put you out around a thousand dollars , even if you have health insurance .
These costs only increase if you have to have any kind of medical procedure like surgery , or if you need continued care after the accident such as prescription medicine or physical therapy .
The worst situations are when individuals are permanently disabled after a car accident and cannot even work to make an income so that they can begin paying off their accumulated medical bills .
If your car has been damaged or totaled in the accident , that is another financial burden you must take on after an accident .
Getting it repaired can vary anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars , and of course replacing a car can be thousand dollars if your car was totaled .
Although this may seem like a helpless situation , a car accident attorney can help you with your case if this has happened to you or someone you love .
Our lawyers have years of experience handling car accident cases just like yours , and our expertise can help you get the compensation you deserve to cover the medical bills and car repair costs you have incurred because of your car accident .
Information gathered at the scene of the accident , such as photographs , witness statements , and the other driver ’s insurance , can all be extremely useful when you and your lawyer begin to prepare your case .
It is also important to review your own insurance policy , because if the other driver does not have insurance , you may need to rely on your own policy for some or all of the compensation you need .
Using this information , we will be able to prove that the other vehicle was at fault for your accident .
That evidence will show the other driver ’s insurance company that they are the ones legally responsible for paying your medical bills and car repair and even for your pain and suffering .
If the insurance company does not cooperate , our car accident lawyers are not afraid to take your case to a court if the company will not fairly negotiate your compensation and give you the full amount that you deserve as a victim of a car accident that you did not cause .
Do not hesitate to get in touch with one of our car accident lawyers if you have been involved in a car accident .
We are ready and willing to help you with your case and will fight to make sure that your rights are protected and that you are fully compensated for your medical bills , your car repair or replacement , lost wages , and any pain and suffering you experienced after the accident .

( CNN ) --
If you 're looking for alien life in the solar system , it might be best to start small .
That was the message from NASA on Wednesday as researchers listed eight possible missions that would look for alien life by closely examining microorganisms and minerals .
" Astrobiology and the search for life is central to many of the most important missions that we are studying , " Steve Squyres , a researcher with Cornell University , said on a conference call with reporters .
" It is one of the key drivers for solar system exploration . "
The possible missions , which include using robots to get soil samples from Mars and looking for life in water on distant moons , have not been approved .
NASA has to decide which of the missions to fund .
By looking for patterns created by living organisms , NASA hopes to learn about the scope of life in the solar system and also to probe for clues about how life began on Earth .
The continuing search could include the following missions : sending landers to Mercury ; analyzing methane on Mars ; probing into the oceans of Europa , a moon of Jupiter ; looking for organic material on Titan , one of Saturn 's moons ; and even looking for signs of life on comets .
The news comes as much public attention is focused on the search for alien life -- both in our solar system and beyond .
British physicist Stephen Hawking said recently that aliens might be traveling the cosmos right now .
Hawking talks about his view in a Discovery Channel series , " Into the Universe With Stephen Hawking , " which began airing this week .
On the show , Hawking suggests that extraterrestrial beings might not harbor goodwill toward people on earth .
He imagines that aliens might have the technology to harness energy from whatever star they 're near .
The process , he proposes , could open a wormhole that could let them travel large distances .
Hawking 's warning contrasts with the excitement some are showing about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence .
Just last week , the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence said it was releasing its data to astronomers and researchers all over the world , hoping more people would join the search .
NASA 's search has extended outside the solar system as well .
Last year , NASA launched a Kepler spacecraft equipped with a special telescope to try and find Earth - size planets in this galaxy .
The spacecraft is on a three - and - a - half - year mission hunting planets , but NASA has been able to download data .
But even without the evidence from Kepler , some believe there are aliens floating somewhere out there .
The CNN Wire Staff contributed to this report .
In a garden dotted with daffodils overlooking open fields , a trio of English Sussex hens strut their stuff .
Two small boys stroke their resplendent white and black plumage while feeding them .
The youngest child takes advantage of the diversion to dive into the birds ' dark - red wooden coop to play hide - and - seek .
" We get two eggs every day , which go towards making pancakes , " says Tibo Duijsters , a blond eight - year old , as he scatters grain around the ground .
Their father Michel Duijsters points proudly to his fast - disappearing compost heap .
Most of the food scraps and vegetable peelings have been eaten by the hens .
The Duijsters and many of their neighbours in Dilsem - Stokkem , a small town of neat detached houses a few miles from Belgium 's border with the Netherlands , have no agricultural background or training in poultry farming .
But they have joined a chicken - rearing craze which has taken hold with tens of thousands of hens now living in coops in family gardens .
The boom is thanks to own - a- chicken schemes launched by the Belgian authorities in a bid to cut down on household waste .
In the region of Limburg , near the Dutch border , more than 2,500 families adopted hens just last year , a 306 per cent rise on the previous year .
There have been similar successes in other parts of the country .
The Duijsters family were egged on by a marketing campaign by the authorities , which also subsidises the cost of buying the hens .
One hen only costs around € 4 ( £ 3.50 ) , but comes with expectations .
" We expect owners to look after them properly and provide a lot of reading material for them to go through , " said Annick De Paepe , an official with the Limburg regional authority .
" It 's been a huge success and it's proving ever more popular " .
She believes the boom has been fuelled by the recession .
" There is very much a mood of getting back to nature right now and people love picking up their own eggs from the garden .
But it 's also a great way to cut down on household waste as the chickens will eat any leftovers and cut organic waste by half . "
" So far , we have n't had any bad experiences , but of course , we can't be sure that people are n't just throwing them into the oven .
Not everyone wants to take on a chicken for life . "
Mr Duijsters , a civil servant , leads the twice - daily feeding round and says the hens have become part of the family .
" They look so lovely and they do all have their own personalities .
They get very impatient if they do n't get fed on time and come pecking at the windows to complain .
" But it 's nothing unusual around here .
Everyone seems to own hens , it 's the thing to do "
In the Flemish regions of Belgium , authorities typically apply a stringent approach to ensuring the well - being of the chickens .
" We have proper training courses in rearing and feeding the hens and we watch out for anyone who might not be suitable , " said Christophe Deneve , who recently launched a chicken scheme in Mouscron .
The town , a stone 's throw from the Belgian - French border , is distributing 50 pairs of chickens for free to families with sufficient space to keep the birds in their gardens .
Details are being kept internally between team members right now but what we do know is that the CyanogenMod has been ported onto an iPhone 3GS .
Everyone is pretty tight lipped for now but this seems so far to be legitimate , as one of the team members has confirmed the port is working via twitter .
It was only a few days ago when reports surfaced of the Android OS having been ported onto the iPhone 2G which was crazy enough to hear but now the advent of CyanogenMod on the 3GS is almost downright insane .
Progress
So far there is n’t any word on how far things have progressed when talking about the functionality of the ROM on the iPhone 3GS , however Nate Tellari ( aka @rikupw ) has stated that they have the camera and radio working :
People , I cannot disclose any more information outside of the #team !
But for your info : camera and radio work on iphone 3gs !
The tweet above followed an earlier tweet by @rikupw retweeting @ ChrisSoyars who was in turn quoting @ Cyanogen himself :
G1 / Magic sorry , cyanogenmod5 is now running on the iphone 3gs !
RT @ChrisSoyars 18:21 <+ cyanogen >
IT WORKS # teamdouche # teamiphone #android
For those who do n't know , Team Douche is what Cyanogen and a bunch of other Cyanogenmod folks call themselves .
Unfortunately right now this is all we currently know but as more information is released , you can be sure we will be bringing it to you stat .
In the meantime , you can monitor the progress on twitter via this search : " iphone 3gs cyanogen " .
Go Team Douche !
Update : It Was A Prank
We were afraid of this but the truth is the whole thing was a prank .
The following confirms it :
It was n't April Fools anymore , guys .
Not too funny ( just a little bit ) .
Since the doldrums of last off - season , we have been trying to figure out how Joe Nieuwendyk can possibly improve this team under the budgetary constraints placed on him by Tom Hicks and HSG that prevents them from spend to anywhere near the cap .
The more we looked ( like here : " Will Dallas Stars Be Able to Keep Their Young Talent ? " ) the more the question shifted from " How can he improve it ? " to " How can he even afford to keep the young RFA 's the team has developed and ice a team next year ? "
We now have several more pieces of the puzzle that we did not have last August when those discussions became hot and heavy :
( The important thing to remember when having a conversation about Dallas Stars payroll , is that unlike other teams ' conversations , we do not care in the least about cap hits .
We talk about real payroll dollars )
Stephane Robidas contract extension in October .
His cap number is $ 3.3 million , but his salary next season is only $ 3.25 million .
Loui Eriksson extended in October .
His cap number is $ 4.267 million , but the first year of the deal ( next season ) is only $ 3.2 million .
Steve
Ott 's contract does the same thing ...
Follow the jump for a detailed look at the entire budgetary picture for 2010 - 2011 ...
Steve
Ott 's deal is a $ 2.95 million cap hit , but his first year on the deal only pays $ 2.1 million .
Toby Petersen extended yesterday .
His salary next year is $ 750 k next season , then goes up to $ 800 k the next .
Same thing with Tom Wandell , extended last week .
$ 700 k next year , $ 850 the year after that .
Every single deal is back - loaded , which , let 's face it , might be a bad thing for 2011 - 2012 , but that 's not our main concern at the moment .
All those projections and guess we were doing were based on average value of the deals , and we were right on the money with some of those guesses .
What Gm Joe has done in back - loading them , is he 's given himself breathing room to come into next season with a team at least as good as the one he has now , without losing his RFA's .
Here 's where they now stand for 2010 - 2011 :
David Blume – Executive Director I.I.E.A .
EPA 's Failure to Approve E15 Ruling : A Quiet End to American Energy Independence
Delay Prevents Creation of an Estimated 490,000 Non-exportable Jobs , Impacts BioFuel Availability and Grain Futures for 2010 .
Over the last several months my organization , the International Institute for Ecological Agriculture ( IIEA ) , along with farm organizations across the country , numerous state and national representatives , environmental agencies , and ethanol producer associations , have been advocating for a seemingly minor Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) ruling change regarding the amount of allowable alcohol fuel that can be used as a gasoline additive across the country .
Why did we need this change ?
States have tried to raise the alcohol requirement in gas to 15 % or in the case of Minnesota to 20 % to keep millions of fuel dollars in the local economy , to save tens of thousands of direct and indirect alcohol - based jobs , reduce the cost of fuel to its residents , and reduce poisonous tailpipe emissions , the oil companies refused to comply .
They hide behind an out of date 1980 ’s EPA 10 % rule claiming , “ Sorry we are complying with the EPA maximum of 10 % so individual states ca n’t make us buy additional fuel . ”
On December 1st EPA was to announce whether increase its maximum alcohol addition to 15 % .
To some this ruling seemed about as significant as the United States Department of Agriculture ’s elimination of a regulation governing the length of buggy whips .
Hidden in this almost meaningless line of regulatory detail is a massive and devastating blow to : agriculture , the development of hundreds of thousands of non-exportable green jobs , the building of clean cars , dependence on oil from hostile dictatorships , and the much ballyhooed conversion from fossil fuels to renewable fuel .
Rather than move forward with all these positive agendas , the EPA decided they needed another six months to further study on the issue .
Alcohol has been , by far , the most studied additive to gasoline ever .
There are countless studies ( some of which I perform and others I cover in my book Alcohol Can Be A Gas ! ) that demonstrate the benefits of alcohol ’s clean , cool and filth - free output .
The December 1st non-ruling sits in direct contradiction to the fact that the EPA originally demanded as part of the Clean Air Act , that alcohol be added to gasoline in order to reduce gasoline ’s extremely toxic emissions .
It beggars the imagination to contemplate that the EPA now questions whether 15 % alcohol raises or lowers emissions .
In my book I demonstrate dramatic reductions in toxic emissions from gasoline directly related to the increased amount of alcohol additive .
In fact , the already approved 85 % alcohol mixture sold at the pump as E - 85 can be as much as 90 % lower in toxics .
For Alcohol Can Be A Gas , I performed a study with E50 or 50/50 alcohol , the maximum amount of alcohol many vehicles can use without modification .
I showed a 94 % reduction in nitrous oxides ( NOx ) , the brown stuff in smog , an 83 % reduction in carbon monoxide ( CO ) , Dr. Kevorkian ’s death gas , and a 25 % reduction in hydrocarbons ( HC ) , soot , in a 1987 3 / 4 ton pickup truck .
At 100 % , alcohol exhaust is more than 99 % toxin free in all categories .
In tests I did on jet engines with astronaut and aerospace engineer Gordon Cooper in the 1980s , we were able to demonstrate that the exhaust coming out of an alcohol - powered jet engine was cleaner than the Los Angeles air going in .
I sometimes humorously say that this translates to alcohol being 105 % cleaner than gasoline .
The conclusion is obvious to anyone short of an oil sheik , or apparently an EPA bureaucrat : the more alcohol you add to gasoline , the lower the emissions of carbon monoxide , hydrocarbons , and nitrous oxides .
The EPA can ignore my review of studies , but the real proof beyond any controlled study is the living example of Brazil .
Today 85 % of the cars in Brazil run on 100 % alcohol ( available at the pump . )
All of the rest of the gasoline cars ( so old they are not fuel injected ) there run on 24 % alcohol and have for decades .
If the issue for the delay , as the EPA claims , is the ability of older cars to cleanly run high alcohol fuel blends , then the Brazilian experience should more than satisfy their curiosity .
That Brazilians that have older fuel injected engines originally intended for gasoline only , have been routinely mixing low cost alcohol with gasoline 50/50 every time they fill up since gas prices rocketed - up 10 years ago .
This mix , called rabo de gallo , a nickname for a mixed cocktail , requires the driver to use two pumps to fill their car .
The EPA has reams and reams of data and peer reviewed studies from Brazil to rely upon to make its decision to permit alcohol levels higher than 10 % .
But better than that they have decades of real - world experience of alcohol blends reducing pollution that they are currently denying exists in delaying their approval .
That begs the questions : what does the EPA delay portend for our country ?
First of all , unlike bankers or oil companies , alcohol fuel plants were not beneficiaries of bailouts .
Because big oil buys 99 % of the alcohol produced in the US , by default it is the one customer for alcohol fuel plants .
When oil companies refuse to buy more alcohol than is required of them by law , even when the alcohol is less expensive to purchase than petroleum octane boosters , alcohol plants have to either take prices that are lower than the cost of production or shut down .
Many production plants that are not shut down are limping along at half or two - thirds capacity .
Last year and in 2009 , numerous working farmers who had contracts to sell their corn to alcohol plants ( that subsequently went bankrupt ) lost everything .
With the enormous surpluses of corn the U.S. has produced over the last three years , literally billions of bushels go unused so farmers have nowhere to sell contracted produce that stalls due to financial default .
On Labor Day this year , when 9 - octane premium gas in California was $ 3.53 a gallon , 105 - octane alcohol in Wisconsin was $ 1.71 at the pump .
Its now pretty clear that most of the 85 % ( E85 ) alcohol now sold at the pump in the United States is “ splash blended ” Brazilian style by the drivers .
In other words all those SUV gasoline drivers are buying half a tank of regular and half a tank of alcohol to save money .
With this in mind , some states are now installing blender pumps that will allow people to choose what mix of alcohol and gasoline they want to put in their car .
The oil companies are desperate to keep this information sequestered .
The EPA debate over the modest upgrade to 15 % is absurd since millions of Americans already are running on higher percentage blends and gloriously passing their smog tests with shockingly low emissions .
The reality is that every day more people have discovered that their cars run just great on 50 % alcohol and are choosing to save both money and the environment by voting with their fuel budget .
Why is the EPA ’s six - month delay potentially devastating to America ’s quest for energy independence and a clean tech economic future ?
The delay is a central part of a strategy started two years ago by Big Oil to crush the alcohol fuel movement .
In interviews , articles and news releases over the last few months , I have predicted that many alcohol plants that have been barely hanging on waiting for the expected 15 % approval on December 1st will now go belly up .
The multibillion - dollar American Petroleum Institute ( API ) Food vs. Fuel anti-alcohol propaganda campaign has been stalled by the reality that far from there being any sort of grain shortage there have actually been record huge surpluses .
As I intimated earlier , how can there be a food shortage problem when we ca n’t even sell all we grow ?
However , there has been a huge amount of damage done to alcohol ’s reputation in the public ’s mind as a result of this propaganda campaign .
This sets the stage for next year when most of the tiny federal incentives for alcohol fuel will expire without public support .
Of course none of the oil incentives , nearly $ 6 per gallon of gasoline , have expiration dates .
Next year we can expect the oil companies to spend at least 5 billion dollars ( 4 % of their profit ) to convince America to abandon renewable fuel .
If E15 were approved , alcohol plants ( and up to 500,000 people ) would be back at full production and generating profit .
The industry might be able to put up some sort of fight against Big Oil .
However , with the EPA - enforced alcohol plant lockdown for yet another six months , the industry is essentially as helpless as an ICU patient to stop an oil company roustabout from unplugging their life support .
Of course it would be harder to demonize alcohol if the EPA had recognized alcohol this December as a pollution - fighting fuel .
With Big
Oil getting all the subsidies and alcohol losing its trivial share , the entire independent fuel production industry faces certain bankruptcy .
The oil companies will buy the plants out of bankruptcy court at pennies on the dollar .
Valero bought up plants from the failed alcohol producer Verasun a few months ago .
Once Big
Oil owns the plants they will no longer have to share any alcohol revenue with farmers and can export all the money they make from alcohol and our tax dollars to foreign tax - free shelters .
If farmers think that they have had a hard time dealing with selling crops to the grain giants like ConAgra and Cargill , they are in for a world of pain trying to deal with oil - owned distilleries that would just as soon buy their land as their corn .
Of all of the consequences of the EPA ’s non-ruling , the thing I am probably the most angry and concerned about is the loss of the hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs that could be created by the increase to 15 % .
Those jobs would make a huge difference to local economies all across rural America and for our nation as a whole .
At a time when the current administration is extolling the virtues of job creation and bringing work back home , the EPA steps up and puts a stopper in this vital market .
Along with employment opportunities lost , come additional farm failures .
In December working farmers and their banks , who are right now planning next year ’s crops , are figuring out what to grow based on best data for the coming year ’s market demands .
With the EPA blocking new demand for corn and grains and with the past year ’s surpluses , planting very much corn in 2010 would be far too risky .
So corn futures prices may drop and for the first time in years we may actually have a shortage of corn next fall , for which we will have the EPA and Big Oil to blame ( though as they have done in the past , they will say it is the fault of the alcohol fuel producers and farmers . )
It 's time for President Obama to show America he cares about farmers , citizens , our economic future , and America ’s ability to lead the global movement to truly renewable energy independence , and that he is ready to stop toxic fossil fuel use and the consequences of its related pollution .
The president can execute an executive order increasing ethanol provisionally to 15 % and have the EPA get to work on studying and approving a new 30 % alcohol level in unmodified vehicles by June .
After all , we get 30 % of our oil from the Middle East .
If we produced that much alcohol fuel and began looking at alcohol fuel as a solution for home and office heating and energy generation as well , we would have true homeland security .
We would have all of the food , fuel , energy , and jobs we need now and well into our future .
If we do n’t need Mideast oil , it would be hard to imagine a reason for our sons and daughters to be there to defend our access to it .
Right now it all hinges on a single number , 15 % , in a single set of antiquated regulations .
We need to shine light into the shadows in which the oil companies are hiding an alcohol solution to so many problems .
They have proven over and over it is their bottom line they care about , not the people of this country .
That ’s why we depend on our government to protect us against the predation of giant corporate entities .
When the government joins with business to suppress solutions to our nation ’s problems , it requires all of us to illuminate and shame our representatives into taking the action that would benefit this country .

Despite the recent interest in adopting HTML5 ’s video tag , there is still one major problem : there is no mandated standard video codec for the video tag .
The two main contestants are the proprietary and patended h264 , and the open and free Theora .
In a comment on an LWN . net article about this problematic situation , LWN reader Trelane posted an email exchange he had with MPEG - LA , which should further cement Theora as the obvious choice .
As most of you are probably aware of , there ’s a bit of a codec war going on with the HTML5 video tag .
The struggle is between the patented and proprietary h264 codec and the open and free Ogg Theora .
While I ’m still not entirely sure about which one is better from a pure quality standpoint ( a lot of contradicting reports on that one , and I ’m not skilled enough to perform my own tests ) .
Theora has the benefit because it ’s open and free , whereas h264 has the advantage of having better hardware support .
The big disadvantage with h264 is that you need to pay lots and lots of money for a license to be able to ship and have your users use it .
You need a license for encoding , distributing , and even decoding – which is obviously quite problematic for open source projects .
Apple and Google have both paid for the license , and as such , both Safari and Chrome support h264 ; however , since the license does not extend downstream , Linux distributors cannot ship Google Chrome .
Chromium , the non-Google variant of the browser , does not have h264 support either .
Both Mozilla and Opera refuse to pay for the h264 license .
Thanks to Trelane , we now have the word straight from the horse ’s mouth with regards to the downstream possibilities ( or , better put , lack thereof ) of h264 .
He contacted the MPEG - LA and asked them if Free and open source developers and products need to pay for the license as well , since he could n’t find said information in the FAQ .
The answers were clear .
“ In response to your specific question , under the Licenses royalties are paid on all MPEG - 4 Visual / AVC products of like functionality , and the Licenses do not make any distinction for products offered for free ( whether open source or otherwise ) , ” explains Allen Harkness , MPEG - LA ’s Director of Global Licensing , “ But , I do note that the Licenses addresses this issue by including annual minimum thresholds below which no royalties are payable in order to encourage adoption and minimize the impact on lower volume users . ”
In other words , h264 is simply not an option for Free and open source software .
It is not compatible with “ Free ” , and the licensing costs are prohibitive for most Free and open source software projects .
This means that if the web were to standardise on this encumbered codec , we ’d be falling into the same trap as we did with Flash , GIF , and Internet Explorer 6 .
The MPEG - LA further reiterated that individual users are just as liable as distributors or companies .
“ I would also like to mention that while our Licenses are not concluded by End Users , anyone in the product chain has liability if an end product is unlicensed , ” Harkness explains , “ Therefore , a royalty paid for an end product by the end product supplier would render the product licensed in the hands of the End User , but where a royalty has not been paid , such a product remains unlicensed and any downstream users / distributors would have liability . ”
I ’m not sure how this would extend towards countries outside of the United States , since software patents are n’t a sure thing all around the world .
This perceived unencumberedness of h264 is actually a threat , though , according to Christopher Blizzard .
“ […]
These heavily patented formats gain much of the same advantage as free formats – lots of free tools and tons of ad - hoc support from free software people – but with the ability to still enforce and monetize in parts of the world where patents are enforced , ” Blizzard warns , “ It ’s actually a brilliant strategy , even though the outcome is that the true costs of patents are hidden from the view of most people . ”
I ’ll be blunt and direct , and this most likely wo n’t be appreciated by everyone , but I do n’t care : using h264 for HTML5 video is short - sighted , ignorant , and simply plain stupid .
Every web developer choosing to use h264 has learned nothing from GIF , Flash , and Internet Explorer 6 .
I find it almost delightfully hypocritical that someone like John Gruber , who rails and rails against Flash , finds h264 totally acceptable , telling Mozilla to “ get with the program “ .
A cynical me would say this is somehow related to Apple hating Flash but loving h264 , but I ’m not in a cynical mood today .
Despite all this talk about h264 vs .
Theora , the fact of the matter is that the latter is the best supported HTML5 video tag codec .
All browser makers who have implemented HTML5 video have included support for Theora – Chrome , Firefox , and Opera all support it – except for Apple .
In other words , the most compatible choice right now for HTML5 video is Theora – not h264 .
Yes , h264 has the better hardware support , and yes , it is claimed its quality is higher than Theora ’s – but is the short term really all you care about ?
Are web developers really that ignorant ?
History suggests yes – Flash , IE6 – but I had hoped we would ’ve learned from all this by now .
I ’d rather face some technological difficulties now that we can actually overcome ( hardware , quality ) than face a patent and lock - in mess down the road .
Web developers , the choice is yours .
Are you ignorant and short - sighted , or are you willing to make a stand for keeping the web open , and finally breaking video loose from its proprietary shackles ?
A Taliban splinter group in the tribal belt has executed a former intelligence officer and prominent jihadi activist , raising fears for two other hostages being held by the same group .
Khalid Khawaja 's body was found dumped by the road near Mir Ali , a notorious centre of militant activity in North Waziristan .
Khawaja , a retired Inter - Service Intelligence ( ISI ) agent , had been shot in the head and chest .
A note pinned to his body warned that other " American spies " would face a similar fate .
A previously unknown group named Asian Tigers claimed responsibility in an email to the Guardian titled " khalid khawaja ( episode is over ) " .
It read : " Khalid Khwaja is no more ...
We have given the deadline in order to approve our demands .
The ISI and government did n't take it serious .
This is the last warning to set your minds .
What would be the next ? "
Khawaja was a retired Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) official who boasted of his links with Osama bin Laden .
He was kidnapped just over a month ago while travelling with another well known ex-ISI official , Colonel Imam , and Asad Qureshi , a journalist .
Their fate is not known .
The militants recently sent the Guardian hostage videos of the three men from the same email address .
Asian Tigers is believed to be a cover name for a group of Punjabi sectarian militants belonging to the notorious Lashkar I Jhangvi group .
In recent weeks sectarian attacks on Shias have increased in the tribal belt , including one against a UN aid distribution centre .
Asian Tigers is demanding the release of dozens of militant prisoners in Afghanistan in return for hostages , stoking suspicions that it has links with a larger Taliban group .
Colonel Imam , whose real name is Sultan Amir Tarar , trained jihadi fighters with CIA funding in the 1980s and helped nurture the Taliban movement in Afghanistan in the 1990s .
He is widely referred to as the " father of the Taliban " .
The three men entered North Waziristan in late March on a mission to meet and film Taliban groups .
Before leaving Islamabad Khawaja told journalists he had proof that the Taliban leader , Hakimullah Mehsud , had survived a CIA drone attack last January – something that a senior ISI official confirmed to the Guardian this week .
Khawaja may have promised Qureshi , the journalist , that he would broker a meeting with Mehsud .
Khawaja occupied a prominent , if ambiguous , position in the murky world of Pakistan 's jihadi politics .
He boasted of being a close associate of Osama bin Laden during the 1980s ; last year he said he brokered a meeting between Bin Laden and the opposition leader Nawaz Sharif in 1990 with a view to ousting the government of then prime minister Benazir Bhutto .
After retiring from the ISI Khawaja became a prominent champion of jihadist causes and , when necessary , turned against his former spymasters .
He spent time in jail after the Red Mosque siege in central Islamabad in 2007 .
He became a human rights activist of sorts , championing the rights of the " disappeared " – Islamist suspects who had been illegally abducted , detained and sometimes tortured by Pakistani intelligence , often at the behest of the CIA and , less frequently , MI6 .
But by several accounts he was playing a complex game – one that appears to have caught up with him .
In his hostage video Khawaja said he was secretly working for the ISI during the Red Mosque crisis and helped engineer the arrest of Maulana Abdul Aziz , an extremist cleric who was caught fleeing the mosque wearing a woman 's burqa .
Ali Dayan Hasan , a Human Rights
Watch researcher who had worked with Khawaja , described him as an ambiguous operator who balanced an implacable belief in jihadist causes with a concern for the plight of those victimised by the " war on terror " .
" He made an essential contribution in bringing to attention the disappearances by the Pakistani intelligence agencies at the behest of the US authorities – whatever his motivations , " Hasan said .

We have an economy run on smoke and mirrors , based on the manipulation of markets .
That was accomplished via the executive order signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1988 in the aftermath of the stock market collapse of October 19 , 1987 , known as the “ President ’s Working Group on Financial markets . ”
This order intended to be implemented during emergencies has been used to manipulate markets worldwide 24/ 7 .
We experienced an example of this misuse of power when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 6,500 to 10,900 over this past year .
This rise was aided by TARP and a host of other programs that injected trillions of dollars into the economy , which , of course , the American citizen is responsible for .
The result is we do not have free investment markets .
A secret group led by the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury Department runs them .
The SEC and the CFTC play their parts as government agencies to make sure the public does n’t know what is going on .
Another recent example is the CFTC testimony of Andrew Maguire , who informed the CFTC the date on which the market in silver was going to be manipulated by JPMorgan Chase .
The manipulation occurred as outlined by Maguire and the CFTC did nothing to stop it .
Thus , we have heavily manipulated markets that are part of control planning by our government in order to shape economic policy .
If you happen to be on the right side of the trade it is fine .
That is in this case if you are long the market .
The other side of the trade is you lose as your government suppressed the gold and silver markets .
You lose in a rigged market .
This is the new American way .
Seeing 72 % of NYSE trades are black box created Wall Street wins and you lose .
Better yet you just were allowed to bailout Wall Street and banking .
Such a deal brought to you by the masters of the universe members of the Illuminist Skull & Bones .
Elitists believe that everything you have belongs to them because they created it are managing your financial life .
A good example of that was on March 18th our President passed the most recent stimulus act , the $ 17.5 billion Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act HR 2487 , which is now not only known as HIRE , but the Capital Controls Act as well .
It requires foreign banks to withhold 30 % of all outgoing capital flows to the Treasury and to disclose the full details of non-exempt account holders to the IRS .
That is because the elitists allowed you to make that money and so they demand their 30 % cut .
If this demand is illegal in a foreign destination then the US government demands that the account be closed .
The bottom line is if a foreign financial institution operates in the US or has a subsidiary in the US , they have to comply .
That means the law is easy to get around , but the very fact that government has implemented Capital Controls is ominous .
Who do they think they are ?
Is there no privacy left ?
We also understand that those who have offices in the US must reveal all information in a foreign account in a foreign country and if that information is not forthcoming the US government demands the account be closed .
Many banks will leave the US and that is understandable .
Very few Americans have foreign accounts , thus this is just more harassment , and an attempt to further control the lives of Americans .
As the world turns its something new monthly from government .
We are averaging ten emails a day because of this and medical legislation from people who are very serious about leaving the country .
As you can see manipulation of the public masses and the market are part of official public policy , as well as of that of Wall Street .
It has been for many years .
We started to write on the subject in 1965 .
Today it is becoming public knowledge .
This manipulation has become the nexus or mainstay of economic and political policy .
The resultant financial policy has produced zero interest rates and more money and credit than at any time in modern history .
They , the planners , expect that soon unemployment will reverse , but as yet that has not occurred , in spite of trillions of dollars being poured into G - 20 countries , plus tens of trillions more in guarantees .
In the US $ 1.5 to $ 2 trillion was put into financial companies , while the public was thrown a bone .
Now that interest rates are rising and will continue to do so for some time to come , our master planners are getting nervous .
The Fed is withdrawing funds from the system and stimulation has ended .
What our geniuses are finding out are that once having achieved this withdrawal the US and world economy will start stepping back from this so - called recovery .
Massive monetization has to continue to buy sovereign debt .
If it is not available there are a minimum of 19 sovereign nations that will go bankrupt .
America and the world have n’t gone under due to massive quantitative easing .
The Fed is reducing money and credit , which is a major mistake .
They are going to find there is going to be no exit .
As a result of very low interest rates investors have been attracted by high yielding junk bonds , which is a fatal mistake .
Sooner or later 12 to 15 percent will go under as yields rise and bond prices fall in the future .
The ability of companies to increase earnings during a depression is via layoffs and forced productivity increases , as well as quantitative easing and stimulus .
When you have 22 - 1/8 % unemployment you have far less consumers to sell too .
As this situation persists it can only be a matter of time before earnings fall .
That means that at current levels the stock market is very overpriced .
The crowding out caused by sovereign debt sales is exerting tremendous pressure on bond yields and as we have said we expect the 10 - year Treasury note to soon be over 4 % and up to 5 % over the next nine months .
These events will bring the housing market to an abrupt halt .
We see no way that can be halted .
What will it be , foreign governments dumping US Treasuries and other sovereign debt or a massive oversupply of such debt ?
Probably a combination of both .
It is hard to declare a recovery when 92 % of small businessmen say they as yet see no recovery and 60 % say if it comes it ’s 14 to 18 months away .
These kinds of poll results mean less not more spending and the selling of shares and bonds .
That means a higher commodity market and gold and silver prices as a place of refuge .
Bond yields are telling you something is not right .
The bond market speaks with a very loud voice .
As we said before yields are rising , which can be viewed in an overall sense as normal .
The real problem , which is getting much worse daily , is the overhang of sovereign debt and sales by formerly large Treasury buyers .
Now that China has been accused as a currency manipulator and for keeping US goods out of China , I think we can expect more sales rather than buys in the future .
Debt is the Achilles heel of our financial system .
The yuan is strengthening .
That means US imports from China will rise in price and the US will experience higher inflation .
All these factors will bring a lower stock market .
Everyone on Wall Street is well aware of what the plunge protection team has been up to for a long time , No one says anything because as long as the market rises they do not care .
It is a conspiracy of silence .
They know the market is selling where it is because of manipulation , but they could care less .
They believe the Fed will keep the 10 - year note under 4 % .
We disagree – we will see .
Irrespective to the damage to the economy they want a goldilocks economy .
There has even been talk of negative interest rates .
Government will pay you to borrow money to accelerate the economy and , of course , at the same time create more inflation .
We wonder what Wall Street will do when more Treasury debt hits the market ?
It is $ 50 billion a week now .
We cannot envision monetary tightening without a collapse .
We see tariffs versus China that will grow to include the world and that has to mean Chinese sales of Treasuries .
Confrontation is on the way , which means everyone is going to suffer .
While all this transpires commodities continue their relentless move upward in price as investors seek safety .
Oil , copper , platinum , palladium , gold and silver look like they are headed higher .
The dollar rally as we said in the last issue has run its course at 82 on the USDX and the next stop is 74 .
There are certainly complicating factors .
The bottom line is there will be more stimuli and quantitative easing this year , accompanied by higher inflation .
If the Fed is audited 2011 will be a wild year .
Hold on tight .
The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index expanded less than expected in March as it slipped to 58.8 from 62.6 in February .
The experts predicted 61 .
The employment component of the Index edged up to 53.1 from 53 .
New orders fell to 61.8 from 62.2 .
New factory orders rose for a 5th straight month in February .
Orders for manufactured goods increased 0.6 % after a 2.5 % jump in January .
The MBA Purchase application Index was 6.8 % .
Refis fell 1.3 % .
The 30 - year fixed rate mortgage rose 3 bps to 5.04 % , the 15 ’s rose 1 bps to 4.34 % .
Having seen so many fragile markets over the past 50 years we say to ourselves what untoward even will bring this one down ?
Fundamentals versus share prices are 1/3 of what they were just several months ago .
Stock yields are as slim as bond yields .
Richard Russell and Joe Granville tell us the market is headed lower and we agree .
Not only is the stimulus induced recovery faltering , unemployment still is n’t in the plus column , banks are not lending to small companies and individuals , and the cost of money is rising .
The political situation is deplorable ; 81 % of Americans do not trust their government and 92 % of small businessmen do not see any kind of a recovery for at least 14 to 18 months .
Business is not expanding and has no intention of doing so .
We now have nationalized Soviet style health care that 70 % of Americans do not want passed by the Democrats by unconstitutional trickery .
We ask ourselves what will trigger the coming collapse ?
We believe that if $ 500 billion in stimulus is not forthcoming and $ 500 billion in additional money and credit is not injected into the system that it will collapse .
Wall Street , banking and government are almost totally corrupt .
The people are disgusted and are more and more angry every day .
They see the US and world economy is again faltering .
They see the sovereign debt crisis , especially that of the US .
They know that soon America will lose its AAA sovereign debt rating because we have a government that keeps on spending and refuses to cut costs .
They know that such a course can only lead to bankruptcy .
They see the beginnings of capital controls being erected and the vote buying in Congress .
The world economy is beginning to again slow as quantitative easing ends and stimulus packages of the G - 20 countries run out of steam .
As a result of these previous methods of propping up economies inflation is rising , as wages remain stagnant .
Taxes and fees are rising as home foreclosures hit new records .
What is left of people ’s assets is about to disappear as home prices fall further and stock and bond markets finally fall .
The purging that should have taken place three years ago is upon us and the temporary antidote is more , more and credit again .
There is no real growth ; it is a mirage .
In 50 years America ’s leadership has led it to financial , economic and political suicide .
We know where this is headed ; we just hope this year we can stop it .
If we ca n’t we tremble to think what the outcome will be .
The number of planned layoffs rose in March to 67,611 from February ’s 42,090 , says Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
The first quarter saw 181,183 layoffs , which was 69 % lower than the 578,510 announced in the first quarter of 2009 , which was the peak of downsizing .
The US Commercial paper market fell for a third straight week , off $ 5.2 billion to 41,109 trillion .
The Fed 's help to big banks comes at a big cost to savers .
In February 2006 , when Ben Bernanke was first sworn in as chairman of the Federal Reserve , the federal - funds target rate stood at 4.5 % .
That same year , the average yield on a one - year certificate of deposit was 5.4 % .
A retiree who diligently saved for a lifetime and had amassed a nest egg of $ 100,000 could count on an added $ 5,400 in retirement income per year .
That may not sound like much to the average Wall Street Journal subscriber , but for a senior on fixed incomes that extra money improved the quality of his life .
Today 's average rate for an identical one - year CD is roughly 1.3 % .
On the same nest egg , that retiree will now get annual payout of just $ 1,300 — a 76 % decline in four years .
To put the scale of this problem in context , consider the fact that more than $ 7.5 trillion in American household wealth is held today in short - term , interest - bearing products such as checking and savings accounts , retail money funds and CDs .
At today 's low interest rates , the return on those savings is hundreds of billions less than it would have been at 2006 interest rates .
Retirees feel the consequences disproportionately , but because much of that income would have made its way into the economy , spending and job creation also suffer .

Never say never .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner broke that cardinal rule last week when he said a ratings downgrade " will never happen to this country . "
Yet his remark , made during an ABC TV interview , reflects fears that at times swirl through the market , fears that the U.S. government could indeed lose its coveted AAA rating .
Because of heightened concern about unsustainable long - term obligations in Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security , the ratings agencies Moody's , Standard Poor 's and Fitch all recently opined about the possibility of a downgrade one day .
Companies in the U.S. unexpectedly cut payrolls in March , according to data from a private report based on payrolls .
The 23,000 decline was the smallest in two years and followed a revised 24,000 drop the prior month , data from ADP Employer Services showed today .
Over the previous six months , ADP ’s initial figures have overstated the Labor Department ’s first estimate of private payroll losses by as little as 2,000 in February to as much as 151,000 in November .
Companies are still hesitant to add workers until they see sustained sales gains and are convinced the economic recovery has taken hold .
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News anticipate the government ’s report April 2 will show payrolls increased by 184,000 , in part due to temporary hiring by the federal government to conduct the 2010 census and because of better weather compared with February .
“ Just because things are getting better tomorrow does n’t mean that things are good today , ” Guy LeBas , chief fixed - income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia , said before the report .
“ Weak labor markets remain the single - biggest risk to economic growth for the coming years . ”
The ADP figures were forecast to show a gain of 40,000 jobs , according to the median estimate of 35 economists surveyed by Bloomberg .
Projections ranged from a loss of 20,000 to a 100,000 gain .
A nonstop airline ticket from New York to Paris on the first weekend in May costs $ 1,142 .
A Continental Airlines Inc. flight to attend Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha , Nebraska the same weekend : $ 1,433 .
As investors have been making plans to attend the event that Berkshire ’s chairman , Warren Buffett , calls the “ Woodstock for capitalists , ” airlines including Continental and Delta Air Lines Inc. have been raising prices for the weekend of the meeting .
They ’re asking four times the normal rate for round trip tickets , which means New Yorkers will pay more to visit Omaha for the May 1 meeting than London , Rome or Barcelona .
Continental has added one flight from the New York area on April 29 and three on April 30 , said Mary Clark , a spokeswoman for the airline .
Attendees who bought tickets earlier paid less for their seats , she said .
Now , the Houston , Texas - based company is demanding a premium for the spots that remain .
“ There does appear to have been high demand , ” Clark said .
“ Since many of those fares have already been sold and there are very few seats left , the seats that are left are at the higher fares . ”
Dan Fuss , whose Loomis Sayles Bond Fund beat 95 percent of competitors in the past year , says Bill Gross got it right by forecasting declines for U.S. Treasuries .
U.S. 10 - year yields will rise past 4 percent next year as the government sells record amounts of debt , from 3.86 percent today , Fuss said in an interview from Tokyo on Bloomberg Television .
“ Bonds have seen their best days , ” Gross , who runs the world ’s biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co. , said last week on Bloomberg Radio .
“ I agree with what Bill is saying but I do n’t go to the degree that he does , ” Fuss said .
“ I do think very strongly that we will soon see -- soon being next year sometime -- the start of a long , gradual rise in interest rates in the U.S. and in other parts of the world . ”
Treasuries headed for their first monthly loss this year on concern President Barack Obama ’s attempts to sustain economic growth by borrowing unprecedented amounts will overwhelm demand .
The U.S. ca n’t ignore the effect of the growing federal deficit on Treasury yields , Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said yesterday .
[ We are projecting 5 % , not 4 % .
The crowding out effect is going to be enormous .
The Federal Reserve supposedly has ended quantitative easing if that in fact is the case rates could hit 5 % by the end of the year on the 10 - year US T - note .
We believe that if more stimuli , perhaps $ 500 billion , is not forthcoming , and that the Fed does not inject another $ 500 billion in quantitative easing , then the economy will collapse .
Father Andrew Lawrence pulls a fat red binder from a shelf inside his cramped office , where he edits a weekly Roman Catholic newspaper .
Inside the binder are reams of documents from its decade - long dispute with Malaysia 's government over the right to refer to God as " Allah , " as Muslims do .
For a small paper like the Herald ( circulation : 14,000 ) , such a legal case can be ruinous .
But the row has spiraled into a litmus test of tolerance and political maturity in this multifaith country of 28 million people .
The " Allah " row stirs strong emotions here in part because it is as much about race and language – and politics – as it is about religion .
It also exposes the historical divisions between west and east Malaysia , where the majority of the country 's roughly 1.4 million Roman Catholics live .
On Dec. 31 , the Herald won a three - year battle in the High Court , which overturned a government ban on its use of " Allah . "
The verdict sparked small protests by Malay Muslims and a spate of attacks on Catholic churches , a Sikh temple , and three mosques , allegedly by Muslim agitators .
The government has obtained an injunction and appealed the verdict , arguing that the ban is essential for national security .
For centuries , Christian Malay speakers have prayed to Allah , the Arabic word for God .
In neighboring Indonesia , a majority Muslim country with a near - identical language , the use of " Allah " by Christians is uncontroversial , as it is across much of the Middle East .
" It is n't complicated .
We use it in our churches .
It 's part of our prayers , " says Father Lawrence .
Opponents say that Christians can use other Malay words for their translations and should leave " Allah " for Muslims .
" For me , ' Allah ' should n't be used by other religions .
If they use ' Allah , ' our kids might get confused , " says Nur Fadilla Zaaba , a resident .
The government has also used this argument , saying that it increases the risk of conversions of Muslims , which is illegal in Malaysia .
The High Court rejected this and other similar arguments , pointing out that the Herald is sold only to Christians and " had never intended or caused any conflict , discord of misunderstanding " in its use of " Allah . "
Opposition lawmakers claim that Malaysia 's coalition - run government , dominated by the United Malays National Organization ( UMNO ) , uses the " Allah " issue to rally its base among Malay Muslims , who make up about 55 percent of the population .
Khairy Jamaluddin , a UMNO executive , argues that the party is trying to tamp down communal tensions .
He says comparisons with Indonesia are misleading , as Islam has taken a more syncretic path there .
" Malay Muslims have linguistic , religious , and ethnic ownership of the word because of the way that it came to Malaysia .
For it to be used for a Christian God , it is an affront to them , " he says .
While UMNO supports a ban , the opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party has argued that there is no theological reason for it .
In recent years , the party has moved toward the center .
It even invited Lawrence to speak on the issue , he says .
In his office , Lawrence pulls out a rare 1619 Latin - Malay Bible that translates " God " as " Allah . "
" We have every right to use this word , " he says .
After 24 hours of no sleep , 31 - year old Kris Lines , a self - admitted heavy - sleeping British professor of Staffordshire University , was flying from Calgary to Vancouver on Air Canada Flight No. 8229 when he dozed off .
When he woke up , he was surprised to find himself in a a Hangar at Vancouver International Airport .
It seems like no one bothered about the sleeping passenger in the back seat and he kept on sleeping 90 minutes after the flight had landed .
He was flying from London ’s Heathrow Airport to Vancouver via Calgary .
“ It ’s absolute craziness , ” said the 31 - year - old , who is head of sports law at Staffordshire University .
“ The last thing I remember was taking off from Calgary .
I knew I was safely on board and there was no further destinations and it was all good , ” Lines added .
“ Somebody would wake me up at the end . ”
“ I ’m a heavy sleeper , so I drank Coca - Cola on the transatlantic leg to help stay awake , ” said Lines , speaking from his home in England .
“ I had n’t been drinking alcohol . ”
“ I ’d been up for about 24 hours , ” he explained .
Lines said that when the Vancouver mechanic woke him , he was disoriented and in a rush to grab his bags and jacket and get off the plane .
“ He said , ‘ Do n’t worry .
You should have got off an hour - and - a - half ago , ’ ” Lines recalled .
“ They took me off the plane down the steps into a hangar , took me into a room , photocopied my boarding pass and said , ‘ This sort of thing should n’t be happening .
Somebody ’s neck ’s going to be on the line for this . ' ”
“ If I ’d been a vulnerable passenger , a young girl or elderly , it could have been a lot worse , ” he added .
“ The other implication is that if I was a terrorist , then I ’ve got an hour - and - a - half after the plane ’s landed , all by myself , in a secure area on a plane . ”

WASHINGTON 
To the growing list of grievances between the United States and China , add one more : the Obama administration is reviving American pressure on China to stop artificially depressing its currency , a policy that fuels its persistent trade gap with the United States .
The administration has told Chinese officials that currency policy will be high on its agenda this year for economic talks with China , a senior official said on Wednesday .
The White House is also weighing whether to designate China as a country that manipulates its currency , when the Treasury Department issues its semiannual report on foreign currencies in April .
President Obama signaled the tougher line on Wednesday , telling Democratic senators that the United States needed “ to make sure our goods are not artificially inflated in price and their goods are not artificially deflated in price ; that puts us at a huge competitive disadvantage . ”
Reopening the battle with Beijing over its currency may pay political dividends for Mr. Obama at a time of double - digit unemployment and growing fears that China is stealing American jobs .
But experts say the president will have even less leverage over Beijing than President George W. Bush did .
Mr. Bush prodded China for years to adjust its exchange rate with little success .
In an astute op - ed piece in the Christian Science Monitor , James Bovard points out that the love of liberty by the Tea Party crowd usually takes a backseat to a hatred of President Obama and the Left .
After attending a tax day Tea Party event in Rockville , Md. , a suburb of the nation ’s capital , Bovard reported that the Tea Partiers oppose big government from the Left but not from the Right .
Big government from the Right usually involves warfare and its accompanying enhanced police powers at home , which usually severely erode the liberty Tea Partiers claim to stand for .
For example , the tea sippers extended their pinkies in a salute to torture , harsh policies toward Iran , and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
They did n’t seem to mind the National Security Agency ’s warrantless wiretapping and vacuuming up of ordinary Americans ’ phone calls either , according to Bovard .
Yet of all the causes of big government in human history , warfare is the most important .
The nation - state originally came into being because wars had become too expensive for mere kingdoms to handle .
And then the welfare state followed the warfare state .
In fact , a militaristic conservative , Otto von Bismarck , created the first modern welfare state in Germany in the latter part of the 19th century .
In American history too , welfare has followed warfare .
The roots of the Social Security system were planted with pensions for Civil War veterans .
The progressive movement – with its counterproductive regulations on business that hurt the consumers it was trying to help – followed the Spanish - American colonial war .
But World War I was what allowed big government a vast and permanent foothold in American society .
War had become so expensive and large scale that the U.S. government took over the entire economy to fight it – historically , the first time that had happened .
Equally important , the government crushed dissent with the worst violations of civil liberties in American history .
The war ’s only rivals in stifling free political discourse were the Alien and Sedition Acts passed in the late 1700s – ostensibly needed by the government to fight off the French in the Quasi War but really aimed at political opponents .
After World War I , resulting anti-foreign sentiments led to a red scare and the Palmer raids by law enforcement on innocent people .
During the Great Depression , Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt brought back many of the World War I wartime agencies designed to " manage " the economy and simply renamed them .
The war had set the bad precedent that no sector of the American economy was immune from government meddling .
World War II , the most horrific war in world history , also gave us the most government .
During the war , government again took over regulation of the economy and even accounted for more than 40 percent of the American economy ’s output , an all - time high .
Although for the general population , civil liberties erosion was not as great as during World War I , that was little comfort to Japanese - Americans , who had not a single instance of disloyalty but were thrown into unconstitutional internment camps anyway .
The Cold War , although spawning only periodic hot wars , corroded civil liberties because it lasted so long .
The McCarthyite witch hunts for communists in the 1950s and presidential wiretapping during the Vietnam War era that led to Watergate both began over fears of compromising information to unfriendly ears during those periods .
And of course , we have George W. Bush , a big - government conservative , who curiously wins , as Bovard notes , a 57 percent approval rating from the " small government " Tea Partiers .
Yet in parallel with his war on terror , domestic spending increased more than any president since Lyndon Johnson , and he dramatically increased executive power to near tyrannical proportions by illegally using torture , wiretapping , and indefinite detentions without trial .
As Bovard notes , Tea Partiers are right - wing Obama - haters rather than liberty - lovers .
And like their icon Sarah Palin , they seem proudly ignorant of history .
Even the Boston Tea Party , from which the supposedly anti-tax Tea Party movement gets its name , hardly promoted liberty .
The original Tea Party was caused by the British reducing taxes , not increasing them .
The British had reduced the tariff on tea , thereby ruining the smuggling business in which many of the Bostonian vandals were engaged .
After the violent and unnecessary destruction of private property by a mob – which other American cities had avoided and no true proponent of liberty should celebrate – the British cracked down on Boston .
This crackdown thus eventually triggered the American Revolution , which likely decreased liberty in America .
Wars almost always do .
Coburn ( Okla . ) spoke at a recent town hall meeting that was taped by KGOU Radio .
When discussing the short - term unemployment benefits extension that he is stalling , to the chagrin of Democrats , Coburn said he is " 180 degrees in opposition " to Pelosi but that " she is a nice lady . "

That comment drew boos and jeers from the crowd , but Coburn asked the crowd for calm and spoke about civility .
“ Come on now .
She is nice — how many of you all have met her ?
She ’s a nice person , ” Coburn said .
" Let me give you a little lesson here .
I hope you will listen to me .
Just because somebody disagrees with you do n’t [ sic ] mean they ’re not a good person .
And i want to tell you , I 've been in the Senate for five years and I ’ve taken a lot of that , because I ’ve been on the small side — both in the Republican Party and the Democrat Party . "
The Oklahoma senator is seen by many as a divisive figure .
A physician , he is known as " Dr. No " for his penchant to grind the legislative process to a halt .
Democrats have put him in the spotlight the last few weeks , saying that because he stalled the benefits extension , 200,000 unemployed people lost their federal assistance starting Monday .
But Coburn says he wants the benefits package funded before it passes .
To underscore his point about civility , Coburn formed a friendship in 2004 when he joined the Senate with then - Sen .

It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach MORE ( D - Ill. ) , who was also a freshman at the time .
After an audience member suggested that the government could jail people for not buying health insurance under the new healthcare law , Coburn said " that makes for good TV news on Fox but that is n’t the intention . "
The senator continued , telling the mostly conservative crowd not to be fooled by the " biased " information from Fox News .
" What we have to have is make sure we have a debate in this country so that you can see what ’s going on and make a determination yourself , ” Coburn said .
" So do n’t catch yourself being biased by Fox News that somebody is no good .
The people in Washington are good .
They just do n’t know what they do n’t know . "

Look for two new Athlon II X3 processors on store shelves in the not - too - distant future .
According to Fudzilla , AMD is cooking up an Athlon II X3 445 and an Athlon II X3 450 , and the latter is primed for a launch in the third quarter of this year .
The two processors will run at 3.1GHz and 3.2GHz , respectively , providing not - so - small speed boosts over today ’s triple - core Athlon II flagship , the 3GHz X3 440 ( which retails for $ 84.99 ) .
Fudzilla says the Athlon II X3 450 will have a 45 - nm Rana core with 1.5MB of L2 cache , no L3 cache , and a 95 W power envelope , so the new additions should otherwise resemble their predecessors .
Prior reports also suggest AMD is readying a quad - core Athlon II X4 640 , presumably with a 3GHz clock speed ( assuming consistency in the firm ’s model numbering scheme ) .
So , odds are good we ’ll see either faster models or speed boosts in the lower echelons of AMD ’s product lineup by the end of next quarter .
Last time AMD introduced a bunch of new Athlon IIs , some speed increases propagated downward .
The arrival of the Athlon II X4 635 pushed the Athlon II X4 630 from $ 119 to just $ 100 , for instance .
TOKYO —
In a bid to shore up a deflation - plagued economy , Japan ’s central bank eased monetary policy further Wednesday by increasing a loan program for banks .
The move sets the country , the world ’s second - largest economy after the United States , on a path divergent from those of other industrialized nations .
Central banks around the world have in recent weeks contemplated rolling back stimulus steps put in place during the global economic crisis , gradually shrinking excess liquidity in their banking systems .
The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that it would let a mortgage - security purchase program expire at the end of March in the United States .
But in Japan , where prices have remained sluggish in a lackluster recovery from the country ’s worst recession since World War II , the government has urged the monetary authorities to stimulate the economy further by flooding the banking sector with cash .
The Way We Live Now : Putting our foot down .
You know we love you , kids .
But you 're going to have to get the fuck out , because we can't afford you .
You 're 35 .
You 'll make it out there .
( Not really ) .
Do you know who this recession is really tough on ?
The young adult children of formerly well - to - do parents .
Their somewhat less well - to - do parents have been laid off or are just making less money and they can no longer support these young adults to the extent they did during the good old days !
We 're being assholes here .
Long story short :
In the modern American economy you 're fucked if you do n't go to college , but college prices have risen to ridiculously high levels , and the upper middle class people who were financing these college prices can no longer afford to , so everyone is fucked .
The good news is that in this situation , it 's only a matter of time before college prices come down , or elite colleges become the exclusive province of the superwealthy 1 % that controls the world .
Probably the latter !
The days of wealth and upward mobility are already a laughable dream for the less delusional among us .
Mansions in the Hamptons are being ransacked for copper piping like so many inner city Baltimore row houses .
Is that what you dreamed of , when you purchased your Hamptons mansion ?
We thought not .
Without college money , the upper middle class will flounder , while Obamanomics gives every advantage to the poor kids in the fashionable style of socialism .
The worst news : Alan Greenspan is talking about economic " momentum . "
If that does n't scare you , I do n't know what will .
( Except a four million year - old shark that is back . )

About Dr. Weston A. Price
In the early 1930s , a Cleveland dentist named Weston A. Price ( 1870 - 1948 ) began a series of unique investigations .
His portrait on the left is provided courtesy of the Price - Pottenger Nutrition Foundation who owns the copyright .
For over ten years , he traveled to isolated parts of the globe to study the health of populations untouched by western civilization .
His goal was to discover the factors responsible for good dental health .
His studies revealed that dental caries and deformed dental arches resulting in crowded , crooked teeth are the result of nutritional deficiencies , not inherited genetic defects .
The groups Price studied included remote villages in Switzerland , Gaelic communities in the Outer Hebrides , indigenous peoples of North and South America , Melanesian and Polynesian South Sea Islanders , African tribes , Australian Aborigines and New Zealand Maori .
Wherever he went , Dr. Price found that beautiful straight teeth , freedom from decay , good physiques , resistance to disease and fine characters were typical of native groups on their traditional diets , rich in essential nutrients .
When Dr. Price analyzed the foods used by isolated peoples he found that , in comparison to the American diet of his day , they provided at least four times the water - soluble vitamins , calcium and other minerals , and at least TEN times the fat - soluble vitamins , from animal foods such as butter , fish eggs , shellfish , organ meats , eggs and animal fats — the very cholesterol - rich foods now shunned by the American public as unhealthful .
These healthy traditional peoples knew instinctively what scientists of Dr. Price ’s day had recently discovered — that these fat - soluble vitamins , vitamins A and D , were vital to health because they acted as catalysts to mineral absorption and protein utilization .
Without them , we cannot absorb minerals , no matter how abundant they may be in our food .
Dr. Price discovered an additional fat - soluble nutrient , which he labeled Activator X , that is present in fish livers and shellfish , and organ meats and butter from cows eating rapidly growing green grass in the spring and fall .
All indigenous groups had a source of Activator X , now thought to be vitamin K2 , in their diets .
The isolated groups Dr. Price investigated understood the importance of preconceptual nutrition for both parents .
Many tribes required a period of special feeding before conception , in which nutrient - dense animal foods were given to young men and women .
These same foods were considered important for pregnant and lactating women and growing children .
Price discovered them to be particularly rich in minerals and in the fat - soluble activators found only in animal fats .
The isolated people Price photographed — with their fine bodies , ease of reproduction , emotional stability and freedom from degenerative ills — stand in sharp contrast to civilized moderns subsisting on the “ displacing foods of modern commerce , ” including sugar , white flour , pasteurized milk , lowfat foods , vegetable oils and convenience items filled with extenders and additives .
The discoveries and conclusions of Dr. Price are presented in his classic volume , Nutrition and Physical Degeneration .
The book contains striking photographs of handsome , healthy , indigenous people that illustrate in an unforgettable way the physical degeneration that occurs when human groups abandon nourishing traditional diets in favor of modern convenience foods .
The photographs Dr. Weston Price took illustrate the difference in facial structure between those on native diets and those whose parents had adopted the “ civilized ” diets of devitalized processed foods .
The “ primitive ” Seminoles pictured on the left have wide , attractive faces with plenty of room for the dental arches .
The “ modernized ” Seminole girl on the right , born to parents who had abandoned their traditional diets , has a narrowed face , crowded teeth and a reduced immunity to disease .

Characteristics of Traditional Diets – 11 Principles
The diets of healthy , nonindustrialized peoples contain no refined or denatured foods or ingredients , such as refined sugar or high fructose corn syrup ; white flour ; canned foods ; pasteurized , homogenized , skim or lowfat milk ; refined or hydrogenated vegetable oils ; protein powders ; synthetic vitamins ; or toxic additives and artificial colorings .
All traditional cultures consume some sort of animal food , such as fish and shellfish ; land and water fowl ; land and sea mammals ; eggs ; milk and milk products ; reptiles ; and insects .
The whole animal is consumed — muscle meat , organs , bones and fat , with the organ meats and fats preferred .
The diets of healthy , nonindustrialized peoples contain at least four times the minerals and water - soluble vitamins , and TEN times the fat - soluble vitamins found in animal fats ( vitamin A , vitamin D and Activator X , now thought to be vitamin K2 ) as the average American diet .
All traditional cultures cooked some of their food but all consumed a portion of their animal foods raw .
Primitive and traditional diets have a high content of food enzymes and beneficial bacteria from lactofermented vegetables , fruits , beverages , dairy products , meats and condiments .
Seeds , grains and nuts are soaked , sprouted , fermented or naturally leavened to neutralize naturally occurring anti-nutrients such as enzyme inhibitors , tannins and phytic acid .
Total fat content of traditional diets varies from 30 percent to 80 percent of calories but only about 4 percent of calories come from polyunsaturated oils naturally occurring in grains , legumes , nuts , fish , animal fats and vegetables .
The balance of fat calories is in the form of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids .
Traditional diets contain nearly equal amounts of omega - 6 and omega - 3 essential fatty acids .
All traditional diets contain some salt .
All traditional cultures make use of animal bones , usually in the form of gelatin - rich bone broths .
Traditional cultures make provisions for the health of future generations by providing special nutrient - rich animal foods for parents - to - be , pregnant women and growing children ; by proper spacing of children ; and by teaching the principles of right diet to the young .
Dietary Guidelines
Eat whole , unprocessed foods .
Eat beef , lamb , game , organ meats , poultry and eggs from pasture - fed animals .
Eat wild fish ( not farm - raised ) , fish eggs and shellfish from unpolluted waters .
Eat full - fat milk products from pasture - fed cows , preferably raw and / or fermented , such as raw milk , whole yogurt , kefir , cultured butter , full - fat raw cheeses and fresh and sour cream .
Use animal fats , such as lard , tallow , egg yolks , cream and butter liberally .
Use only traditional vegetable oils — extra virgin olive oil , expeller - expressed sesame oil , small amounts of expeller - expressed flax oil , and the tropical oils — coconut oil , palm oil and palm kernel oil .
Take cod liver oil regularly to provide at least 10,000 IU vitamin A and 1,000 IU vitamin D per day .
Eat fresh fruits and vegetables , preferably organic .
Use vegetables in salads and soups , or lightly steamed with butter .
Use organic whole grains , legumes and nuts that have been prepared by soaking , sprouting or sour leavening to neutralize phytic acid , enzyme inhibitors and other anti-nutrients .
Include enzyme - rich lacto - fermented vegetables , fruits , beverages and condiments in your diet on a regular basis .
Prepare homemade stocks from the bones of pastured poultry , beef , pork and lamb fed non-GMO feed , and from wild seafood .
Use liberally in soups , stews , gravies and sauces .
Use filtered water for cooking and drinking .
Use unrefined salt and a variety of herbs and spices for food interest and appetite stimulation .
Make your own salad dressing using raw vinegar , extra virgin olive oil and a small amount of expeller - expressed flax oil .
Use traditional sweeteners in moderation , such as raw honey , maple syrup , maple sugar , date sugar , dehydrated cane sugar juice ( sold as Rapadura ) and green stevia powder .
Use only unpasteurized wine or beer in strict moderation with meals .
Cook only in stainless steel , cast iron , glass or good quality enamel .
Use only natural , food - based supplements .

Dietary Dangers
Do not eat commercially processed foods such as cookies , cakes , crackers , TV dinners , soft drinks , packaged sauce mixes , etc. Read labels !
Avoid all refined sweeteners such as sugar , dextrose , glucose , high fructose corn syrup and fruit juices .
Avoid white flour , white flour products and white rice .
Avoid all hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fats and oils .
Avoid all industrial polyunsaturated vegetable oils made from soy , corn , safflower , canola or cottonseed .
Avoid foods cooked or fried in polyunsaturated oils or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils .
Do not practice veganism .
Animal products provide vital nutrients not found in plant foods .
Avoid products containing protein powders as they usually contain carcinogens or damaged proteins formed during processing .
Likewise , avoid lean meat , skinless poultry , reduced - fat milk and egg whites without the yolks .
Consumption of protein without the cofactors occurring in animal fats can lead to deficiencies , especially of vitamin A. Avoid processed , pasteurized milk ; do not consume ultrapasteurized milk products , lowfat milk , skim milk , powdered milk or imitation milk products .
Avoid factory - farmed eggs , meats and fish .
Avoid highly processed lunch meats and sausage .
Avoid rancid and improperly prepared seeds , nuts and grains found in granolas , quick rise breads and extruded breakfast cereals , as they block mineral absorption and cause intestinal distress .
Avoid canned , sprayed , waxed and irradiated fruits and vegetables .
Avoid genetically modified foods ( found in most soy , canola and corn products ) .
Avoid artificial food additives , especially MSG , hydrolyzed vegetable protein and aspartame , which are neurotoxins .
Most soups , sauce and broth mixes and most commercial condiments contain MSG , even if not indicated on the label .
Avoid caffeine and related substances in coffee , tea and chocolate .
Avoid aluminum - containing foods such as commercial salt , baking powder and antacids .
Do not use aluminum cookware or deodorants containing aluminum .
Do not drink fluoridated water .
Avoid synthetic vitamins and foods containing them .
Avoid distilled liquors .
Do not use a microwave oven .
Confused About Fats ?
The following nutrient - rich traditional fats have nourished healthy population groups for thousands of years :
For Cooking
Butter
Tallow and suet from beef and lamb
Lard from pigs
Chicken , goose and duck fat
Coconut , palm and palm kernel oils
For Salads
Extra virgin olive oil ( also okay for cooking )
Expeller - expressed sesame and peanut oils
Expeller - expressed flax oil ( in small amounts )
For Fat - Soluble Vitamins
Fish liver oils such as cod liver oil ( preferable to fish oils , which do not provide fat - soluble vitamins , can cause an overdose of unsaturated fatty acids and usually come from farmed fish . )
The following industrial fats can cause cancer , heart disease , immune system dysfunction , sterility , learning disabilities , growth problems and osteoporosis :
All hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils
Industrially processed liquid oils such as soy , corn , safflower , cottonseed and canola
Fats and oils ( especially polyunsaturated vegetable oils ) heated to very high temperatures in processing and frying .
The Many Roles of Saturated Fat
Saturated fats , such as butter , meat fats , coconut oil and palm oil , tend to be solid at room temperature .
According to conventional nutritional dogma , these traditional fats are to blame for most of our modern diseases — heart disease , cancer , obesity , diabetes , malfunction of cell membranes and even nervous disorders like multiple sclerosis .
However , many scientific studies indicate that it is processed liquid vegetable oil — which is laden with free radicals formed during processing — and artificially hardened vegetable oil — called trans fat — that are the culprits in these modern conditions , not natural saturated fats .
Humans need saturated fats because we are warm blooded .
Our bodies do not function at room temperature , but at a tropical temperature .
Saturated fats provide the appropriate stiffness and structure to our cell membranes and tissues .
When we consume a lot of liquid unsaturated oils , our cell membranes do not have structural integrity to function properly , they become too “ floppy , ” and when we consume a lot of trans fat , which is not as soft as saturated fats at body temperature , our cell membranes become too “ stiff . ”
Contrary to the accepted view , which is not scientifically based , saturated fats do not clog arteries or cause heart disease .
In fact , the preferred food for the heart is saturated fat ; and saturated fats lower a substance called Lp( a ) , which is a very accurate marker for proneness to heart disease .
Saturated fats play many important roles in the body chemistry .
They strengthen the immune system and are involved in inter-cellular communication , which means they protect us against cancer .
They help the receptors on our cell membranes work properly , including receptors for insulin , thereby protecting us against diabetes .
The lungs cannot function without saturated fats , which is why children given butter and full - fat milk suffer less often from asthma than children given reduced - fat milk and margarine .
Saturated fats are also involved in kidney function and hormone production .
Saturated fats are required for the nervous system to function properly , and over half the fat in the brain is saturated .
Saturated fats also help suppress inflammation .
Finally , saturated animal fats carry the vital fat - soluble vitamins A , D and K2 , which we need in large amounts to be healthy .
Human beings have been consuming saturated fats from animals products , milk products and the tropical oils for thousands of years ; it is mainly the advent of modern processed vegetable oil that ihas caused the epidemic of modern degenerative disease ―not the consumption of saturated fats .
The Fat - Soluble Activators
The crux of Dr. Price ’s research has to do with what he called the “ fat - soluble activators , ” vitamins found in the fats and organ meats of grass - fed animals and in certain seafoods , such as fish eggs , shellfish , oily fish and fish liver oil .
The three fat - soluble activators are vitamin A , vitamin D and a nutrient he referred to as Activator X , now considered to be vitamin K2 , the animal form of vitamin K .
In traditional diets , levels of these key nutrients were about ten times higher than levels in diets based on the foods of modern commerce , containing sugar , white flour and vegetable oil .
Dr. Price referred to these vitamins as activators because they serve as the catalysts for mineral absorption .
Without them , minerals cannot be used by the body , no matter how plentiful they may be in the diet .
Modern research completely validates the findings of Dr. Price .
We now know that vitamin A is vital for mineral and protein metabolism , the prevention of birth defects , the optimum development of infants and children , protection against infection , the production of stress and sex hormones , thyroid function , and healthy eyes , skin and bones .
Vitamin
A is depleted by stress , infection , fever , heavy exercise , exposure to pesticides and industrial chemicals , and excess protein consumption ( hence our warnings against the consumption of excess protein in the form of lean meat , lowfat milk and protein powders . )
Modern research has also revealed the many roles played by vitamin D , which is needed for mineral metabolism , healthy bones and nervous system , muscle tone , reproductive health , insulin production , protection against depression , and protection against chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease .
Vitamin K2 plays an important role in growth and facial development , normal reproduction , development of healthy bones and teeth , protection against calcification and inflammation of the arteries , myelin synthesis and learning capacity .
Modern literature on diet and health is rife with misinformation about the fat - soluble vitamins .
Many health writers claim that humans can obtain adequate vitamin A from plant foods .
But the carotenes in plant foods are not true vitamin A. Instead , they serve as precursors that are converted into vitamin A in the small intestine .
Human beings are not good converters of vitamin A , especially as infants or when they suffer from diabetes , thyroid problems or intestinal disorders .
Thus , for optimal health , humans require animal foods containing liberal amounts of true vitamin A . Similarly , many claim that adequate vitamin D can be obtained from a short daily exposure to sunlight .
But the body only makes vitamin D when the sun is directly overhead , that is , in the summer months , during midday .
For most of the year ( and even in the summer for those who do not make a practice of sunbathing ) , humans must obtain vitamin D from foods .
As for vitamin K2 , most health books mention only its role in blood clotting , without recognizing the many other vital roles played by this nutrient .
Vitamins A , D and K2 work synergistically .
Vitamins A and D tell cells to make certain proteins ; after the cellular enzymes make these proteins , they are activated by vitamin K2 .
This synergy explains reports of toxicity from taking vitamins A , D or K2 in isolation .
All three of these nutrients must come together in the diet or the body will develop deficiencies in the missing activators .
The vital roles of these fat - soluble vitamins and the high levels found in the diets of healthy traditional peoples confirm the importance of pasture - feeding livestock .
If domestic animals are not consuming green grass , vitamins A and K2 will be largely missing from their fat , organ meats , butterfat and egg yolks ; if the animals are not raised in the sunlight , vitamin D will be largely missing from these foods .
Because it is so difficult to obtain adequate fat - soluble activators in the modern diet , Dr. Price recommended cod liver oil to provide vitamins A and D , along with a source of vitamin K2 , such as butter from grass - fed animals or what he called high - vitamin butter oil , made by low - temperature centrifuging of butter from cows eating rapidly growing grass .
( Aged cheese and the fat of ducks and geese are other excellent sources of vitamin K2 .. ) Consumed in liberal amounts during pregnancy , lactation and the period of growth , these nutrients ensure the optimal physical and mental development of children ; consumed by adults , these nutrients protect against acute and chronic disease .
It is important to choose cod liver oil with care as many brands contain very little vitamin D , with potential toxicity of vitamin A . For recommended brands see westonaprice.org / cod-liver -oil / .
What ’s Wrong With “ Politically Correct ” Nutrition ?
“ Avoid saturated fats . ”
Saturated fats play many important roles in the body .
They provide integrity to the cell wall , promote the body ’s use of essential fatty acids , enhance the immune system , protect the liver and contribute to strong bones .
The lungs and the kidneys cannot work without saturated fat .
Saturated fats do not cause heart disease .
In fact , saturated fats are the preferred food for the heart .
Because your body needs saturated fats , it makes them out of carbohydrates and excess protein when there are not enough in the diet .
“ Limit cholesterol . ”
Dietary cholesterol contributes to the strength of the intestinal wall and helps babies and children develop a healthy brain and nervous system .
Foods that contain cholesterol also provide many other important nutrients .
Only oxidized cholesterol , found in most powdered milk and powdered eggs , contributes to heart disease .
Powdered milk is added to 1 % and 2 % milk .
“ Use more polyunsaturated oils . ”
Polyunsaturates in more than small amounts contribute to cancer , heart disease , autoimmune diseases , learning disabilities , intestinal problems and premature aging .
Large amounts of polyunsaturated fats are new to the human diet , due to the modern use of commercial liquid vegetable oils .
Even olive oil , a monounsaturated fat considered to be healthy , can cause imbalances at the cellular level if consumed in large amounts .
“ Avoid red meat . ”
Red meat is a rich source of nutrients that protect the heart and nervous system ; these include vitamins B12 and B6 , zinc , phosphorus , carnitine and coenzyme - Q10 .
“ Cut back on eggs . ”
Eggs are nature ’s perfect food , providing excellent protein , the gamut of vitamins and important fatty acids that contribute to the health of the brain and nervous system .
Americans had less heart disease when they ate more eggs .
Egg substitutes cause rapid death in test animals .
“ Restrict salt . ”
Salt is crucial to digestion and assimilation .
Salt is also necessary for the development and function of the nervous system .
“ Eat lean meat and drink lowfat milk . ”
Lean meat and lowfat milk lack fat - soluble vitamins needed to assimilate the protein and minerals in meat and milk .
Consumption of lowfat foods can lead to depletion of vitamin A and D reserves .
“ Limit fat consumption to 30 percent of calories . ”
Thirty percent of calories as fat is too low for most people , leading to low blood sugar and fatigue .
Traditional diets contained 30 percent to 80 percent of calories as healthy fats , mostly of animal origin .
“ Eat 6 - 11 servings of grains per day . ”
Most grain products are made from white flour , which is devoid of nutrients .
Additives in white flour can cause vitamin deficiencies .
Whole grain products can cause mineral deficiencies and intestinal problems unless properly prepared .
“ Eat at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day . ”
Fruits and vegetables receive an average of ten applications of pesticides from seed to storage .
Consumers should seek out organic produce .
Quality counts !
“ Eat more soy foods . ”
Modern soy foods block mineral absorption , inhibit protein digestion , depress thyroid function and contain potent carcinogens .

Myths and Truths About Nutrition
Myth : Heart disease in America is caused by consumption of cholesterol and saturated fat from animal products .
Truth : During the period of rapid increase in heart disease ( 1920 - 1960 ) , American consumption of animal fats declined but consumption of hydrogenated and industrially processed vegetable fats increased dramatically ( USDA - HNIS ) .
Myth : Saturated fat clogs arteries .
Truth :
The fatty acids found in artery clogs are mostly unsaturated ( 74 % ) of which 41 % are polyunsaturated ( Lancet 1994 344:1195 ) .
Myth : Vegetarians live longer .
Truth :
The annual all - cause death rate of vegetarian men is slightly more than that of non-vegetarian men ( 0.93 % vs 0.89 % ) ; the annual all - cause death rate of vegetarian women is significantly more than that of non-vegetarian women ( 0.86 % vs 0.54 % ) ( Wise Traditions 2000 1:4:16 - 17 ) .
Myth : Vitamin B12 can be obtained from certain plant sources such as blue - green algae and fermented soy products .
Truth : Vitamin B12 is not absorbed from plant sources .
Modern soy products actually increase the body ’s need for B12 ( Soybeans : Chemistry & Technology Vol 1 1972 ) .
Myth :
For good health , serum cholesterol should be less than 180 mg /dl .
Truth :
The all - cause death rate is higher in individuals with cholesterol levels lower than 180 mg / dl ( Circulation 1992 86:3 ) .
Myth : Animal fats cause cancer and heart disease .
Truth : Animal fats contain many nutrients that protect against cancer and heart disease ; elevated rates of cancer and heart disease are associated with consumption of large amounts of vegetable oil ( Federation Proceedings July 1978 37:2215 ) .
Myth : Children benefit from a lowfat diet .
Truth : Children on lowfat diets suffer from growth problems , failure to thrive and learning disabilities ( Am J Dis Child 1989 May ; 143(5):537-42 ) .
Myth : A lowfat diet will make you “ feel better … and increase your joy of living . ”
Truth : Lowfat diets are associated with increased rates of depression , psychological problems , fatigue , violence and suicide ( Br J Nutr 1998 Jan ; 79 ( 1 ) 23-30 ) .
Myth :
To avoid heart disease , we should use margarine instead of butter .
Truth : Margarine eaters have twice the rate of heart disease as butter eaters ( Nutrition Week 3/22/91 21:12 ) .
Myth : Americans do not consume enough essential fatty acids ( EFAs ) .
Truth : Americans consume far too much of one kind of EFA ( omega - 6 EFAs found in most polyunsaturated vegetable oils ) but not enough of another kind of EFA ( omega - 3 EFAs found in fish , fish oils , eggs from pasture - fed chickens , dark green vegetables and herbs , and oils from certain seeds such as flax and chia , nuts such as walnuts and in small amounts in all whole grains ) ( American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 1991 54:438-63 ) .
Myth :
The “ cave man diet ” was low in fat .
Truth : Throughout the world , indigenous peoples sought out and consumed fat from fish and shellfish , water fowl , sea mammals , land birds , insects , reptiles , rodents , bears , dogs , pigs , cattle , sheep , goats , game , eggs , nuts and milk products ( Abrams , Food & Evolution 1987 ) .
Myth : A vegetarian diet will protect you against atherosclerosis .
Truth : The International Atherosclerosis Project found that vegetarians had just as much atherosclerosis as meat eaters ( Laboratory Investigations 1968 18:498 ) .
Myth : Lowfat diets prevent breast cancer .
Truth : A recent study found that women on very lowfat diets ( less than 20 % ) had the same rate of breast cancer as women who consumed large amounts of fat ( New England Journal of Medicine 2/8/96 ) .
Myth : Coconut oil causes heart disease .
Truth :
When coconut oil was fed as 7 % of calories to patients recovering from heart attacks , the patients had greater improvement compared to untreated controls , and no difference compared to patients treated with corn or safflower oils .
Populations who consume coconut oil have low rates of heart disease .
Coconut oil may also be one of the most useful oils to prevent heart disease because of its antiviral and antimicrobial characteristics ( Journal of the American Medical Association 1967 202:1119 - 1123 ; American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 1981 34:1552 ) .
Myth : Saturated fats inhibit production of anti-inflammatory prostaglandins .
Truth : Saturated fats actually improve the production of all prostaglandins by facilitating the conversion of essential fatty acids ( “ Tripping Lightly Down the Prostaglindin Pathways , ” westonaprice.org ) .
Myth : Arachidonic acid in foods like liver , butter and egg yolks causes production of “ bad ” inflammatory prostaglandins .
Truth : Series 2 prostaglandins that the body makes from arachidonic acid both encourage and inhibit inflammation under appropriate circumstances .
Arachidonic acid is vital for the function of the brain and nervous system ( Ibid ) .
Myth : Beef causes colon cancer
Truth : Argentina , with higher beef consumption , has lower rates of colon cancer than the US .
Mormons have lower rates of colon cancer than vegetarian Seventh Day Adventists ( Cancer Research 1975 35:3513 ) .
Myths and Truths About Soy
Myth :
Use of soy as a food dates back many thousands of years .
Truth : Soy was first used as a food during the late Chou dynasty ( 1134 -246 BC ) only after the Chinese learned to ferment soy beans to make foods like tempeh , natto and tamari .
Myth : Asians consume large amounts of soy foods .
Truth : Average consumption of soy foods in China is 10 grams ( about 2 teaspoons ) per day and up to 60 grams in parts of Japan .
Asians consume soy foods in small amounts as a condiment , and not as a replacement for animal foods .
Myth : Modern soy foods confer the same health benefits as traditionally fermented soy foods .
Truth :
Most modern soy foods are not fermented to neutralize toxins in soybeans , and are processed in a way that denatures proteins and increases levels of carcinogens .
Myth : Soy foods provide complete protein .
Truth : Like all legumes , soybeans are deficient in sulfur - containing amino acids methionine and cystine .
In addition , modern processing denatures fragile lysine .
Myth : Fermented soy foods can provide vitamin B12 in vegetarian diets .
Truth :
The compound that resembles vitamin B12 in soy cannot be used by the human body ; in fact , soy foods cause the body to require more B12 .
Myth : Soy formula is safe for infants .
Truth : Soy foods contain trypsin inhibitors that inhibit protein digestion and affect pancreatic function .
In test animals , diets high in trypsin inhibitors led to stunted growth and pancreatic disorders .
Soy foods increase the body ’s requirement for vitamin D , needed for strong bones and normal growth .
Phytic acid in soy foods results in reduced bioavailabilty of iron and zinc which are required for the health and development of the brain and nervous system .
Soy also lacks cholesterol , likewise essential for the development of the brain and nervous system .
Megadoses of phytoestrogens in soy formula have been implicated in the current trend toward increasingly premature sexual development in girls and delayed or retarded sexual development in boys .
Myth : Soy foods can prevent osteoporosis .
Truth :
Soy foods can cause deficiencies in calcium and vitamin D , both needed for healthy bones .
Calcium from bone broths and vitamin D from seafood , lard and organ meats prevent osteoporosis in Asian countries — not soy foods .
Myth : Modern soy foods protect against many types of cancer .
Truth : A British government report concluded that there is little evidence that soy foods protect against breast cancer or any other forms of cancer .
In fact , soy foods may result in an increased risk of cancer .
Myth : Soy foods protect against heart disease .
Truth :
In some people , consumption of soy foods will lower cholesterol , but there is no evidence that lowering cholesterol lowers one ’s risk of developing heart disease .
Myth : Soy estrogens ( isoflavones ) are good for you .
Truth : Soy isoflavones are phyto - endocrine disrupters .
At dietary levels , they can prevent ovulation and stimulate the growth of cancer cells .
Eating as little as 30 mg isoflavones ( from about 30 g soy protein ) per day can result in hypothyroidism with symptoms of lethargy , constipation , weight gain and fatigue .
Myth :
Soy foods are safe and beneficial for women to use in their postmenopausal years .
Truth :
Soy foods can stimulate the growth of estrogen - dependent tumors and cause thyroid problems .
Low thyroid function is associated with difficulties in menopause .
Myth : Phytoestrogens in soy foods can enhance mental ability .
Truth : A recent study found that women with the highest levels of estrogen in their blood had the lowest levels of cognitive function ; in Japanese Americans , tofu consumption in midlife is associated with the occurrence of Alzheimer ’s disease in later life .
Myth : Soy isoflavones and soy protein isolate have GRAS ( Generally Recognized as Safe ) status .
Truth : Archer Daniels Midland ( ADM ) recently withdrew its application to the FDA for GRAS status for soy isoflavones following an outpouring of protest from the scientific community .
The FDA never approved GRAS status for soy protein isolate because of concern regarding the presence of toxins and carcinogens in processed soy .
Myth : Soy foods are good for your sex life .
Truth : Numerous animal studies show that soy foods cause infertility in animals .
Soy consumption lowers testosterone levels in men .
Tofu was consumed by Buddhist monks to reduce libido .
Myth : Soybeans are good for the environment .
Truth :
Most soybeans grown throughout the world are genetically engineered to allow farmers to use large amounts of herbicides , creating toxic runoff .
Myth : Soybeans are good for developing nations .
Truth : In Third World countries , soybeans replace traditional crops and transfer the value added of processing from the local population to multinational corporations .
Soy Infant Formula : Birth Control Pills for Babies
Babies fed soy - based formula have 13,000 to 22,000 times more estrogen compounds in their blood than babies fed milk - based formula .
Infants exclusively fed soy formula receive the estrogenic equivalent ( based on body weight ) of at least five birth control pills per day .
Male infants undergo a “ testosterone surge ” during the first few months of life , when testosterone levels may be as high as those of an adult male .
During this period , baby boys are programmed to express male characteristics after puberty , not only in the development of their sexual organs and other masculine physical traits , but also in setting patterns in the brain characteristic of male behavior .
In animals , soy feeding indicates that phytoestrogens in soy are powerful endocrine disrupters .
Soy infant feeding reduces testosterone levels in male marmoset monkeys as much as 70 % and cannot be ignored as a possible cause of disrupted development patterns in boys , including learning disabilities and attention deficit disorder .
Male children exposed to DES , a synthetic estrogen , had testes smaller than normal on maturation .
Almost 15 percent of white girls and 50 percent of African - American girls show signs of puberty , such as breast development and pubic hair , before the age of eight .
Some girls are showing sexual development before the age of three .
Premature development of girls has been linked to the use of soy formula and exposure to environmental estrogen - mimickers such as PCBs and DDE .
Animal studies indicate that consumption of more than minimal amounts of phytoestrogens during pregnancy may have adverse affects on the developing fetus , the timing of puberty later in life , and thinking and behavior patterns , especially in male offspring .

Coronary Heart Disease : What the Experts Say
“ In Framingham , Massachusetts , the more saturated fat one ate , the more cholesterol one ate , the more calories one ate , the lower people ’s serum cholesterol .
. . we found that the people who ate the most cholesterol , ate the most saturated fat , ate the most calories weighed the least and were the most physically active . ”
– William Castelli , MD , Director , The Framingham Study
“ The diet - heart hypothesis has been repeatedly shown to be wrong , and yet , for complicated reasons of pride , profit and prejudice , the hypothesis continues to be exploited by scientists , fund - raising enterprises , food companies and even governmental agencies .
The public is being deceived by the greatest health scam of the century . ”
– George Mann , ScD , MD , Former Co-Director , The Framingham Study
“ An analysis of cholesterol values . . . in 1,700 patients with atherosclerotic disease revealed no definite correlation between serum cholesterol levels and the nature and extent of atherosclerotic disease . ”
– Michael DeBakey , MD , Famous Heart Surgeon
“ The relevant literature [ on CHD ] is permeated with fraudulent material that is designed to convert negative evidence into positive evidence with respect to the lipid hypothesis .
That fraud is relatively easy to detect . ” – Russell L. Smith , PhD
“ Whatever causes coronary heart disease , it is not primarily a high intake of saturated fat . ” – Michael Gurr , PhD , Renowned Lipid Chemist , Author of authoritative study on CHD

Principles of Holistic Dentistry
In addition to his work on nutrition , Dr. Price conducted extensive research into the destructive effects of root canals , detailed in his two - volume work Dental Infections Oral & Systemic and Dental Infections & the Degenerative Diseases .
His conclusions , ignored by the orthodox dental establishment for over fifty years , are gaining renewed acceptance as holistic practitioners are discovering that the first step to recovery from degenerative disease often involves removal of all root canals from the patient ’s mouth .
The principles of holistic dentistry , based on the research of Weston Price , are as follows :
Eat nutrient - dense whole foods , properly grow and prepared .
Avoid root canals .
If you have root canals and suspect that they are causing disease , have them removed by a knowledgeable dentist .
Avoid mercury ( amalgam ) fillings .
If you have amalgam fillings and suspect they are contributing to health problems , have them removed by a holistic dentist who specializes in mercury filling replacement .
Orthodontics should include measures to widen the palate .
When it is necessary to extract teeth , do so in such a way as to avoid leaving the jaw bone with cavitations , which can become focal points of infection .
Dr. Price consistently found that healthy isolated peoples , whose diets contained adequate nutrients from animal protein and fat , not only enjoyed excellent health but also had a cheerful , positive attitude to life .
He noted that most prison and asylum inmates have facial deformities indicative of prenatal nutritional deficiencies .

The Weston A. Price Foundation
The Weston A. Price Foundation is a nonprofit , tax - exempt charity founded in 1999 to disseminate the research of nutrition pioneer Dr. Weston Price , whose studies of isolated nonindustrialized peoples established the parameters of human health and determined the optimum characteristics of human diets .
The Foundation is dedicated to restoring nutrient - dense foods to the American diet through education , research and activism and supports a number of movements that contribute to this objective including accurate nutrition instruction , organic and biodynamic farming , pasture - feeding of livestock , community - supported farms , honest and informative labeling , prepared parenting and nurturing therapies .
Specific goals include establishment of universal access to clean , certified raw milk through A Campaign for RealMilk ( www.realmilk.com) and a ban on the use of soy formula for infants through its Soy Alert ! project .
The Foundation seeks to establish a laboratory to test nutrient content of foods , particularly butter produced under various conditions ; to conduct research into the “ X ” Factor , discovered by Dr. Price ; and to determine the effects of traditional preparation methods on nutrient content and availability in whole foods .
The board and membership of the Weston A. Price Foundation stand united in the belief that modern technology should be harnessed as a servant to the wise and nurturing traditions of our ancestors rather than used as a force that is destructive to the environment and human health ; and that science and knowledge can validate those traditions .
The Foundation ’s quarterly magazine , Wise Traditions in Food , Farming and the Healing Arts , is dedicated to exploring the scientific validation of dietary , agricultural and medical traditions throughout the world .
It features illuminating and thought - provoking articles on current scientific research ; human diets ; nontoxic agriculture ; and holistic therapies .
In addition , it serves as a source for foods that have been conscientiously grown and processed .
An extensive system of local chapters also helps consumers find healthy foods available in their communities ..

Advertisement 24 August , AD79 .
The day one volcanic mountain came to life and two cities met their deaths .
Pompeii and the nearby settlement of Herculaneum were consumed by a mixture of heat , falling pumice stone and ash .
Mount Vesuvius , about 9 km ( 5.5 miles ) away , had exploded , sending a mass of volcanic debris high into the air , which then landed like a military bombardment on the citizens of the two cities below .
Estimates of deaths in both places range from between 10,000 and 25,000 .
In Pompeii , the effects of the cataclysm were especially vivid , leaving as they did a city almost frozen at the moment of its expiration .
So fast and vast was the tonnage of volcanic rock and dust dumped on its residents and livestock that many were killed on the spot .
Skeletal remains
It is these emblematic " figures " of Pompeii that are now the subject of an extraordinary new exhibition .
They are the skeletal remains of the victims that have been preserved under a thin veneer of plaster , to give them their life form .
A third of the area at Pompeii remains to be excavated " Until now , these figures have been dispersed around Pompeii itself , or to other museums around the world , " says Grete Stefani , the organiser of the exhibition at the nearby Antiquarium de Boscoreale , a five - minute drive from Pompeii .
" They 've never been seen together . "
The process of unearthing the bones and preserving them in plaster has gone on since the 19th Century , when archaeologists really began the work of prising out Pompeii 's buried existence .
One of the exhibits shows a figure , probably a man , clasping a step .
Another shows a man with his arm over his mouth , most likely trying to hold back the choking dust .
A third shows a family , their arms raised , as though trying to fend off the calamity that was engulfing them .
Trapped animals
The figures are exactly how the archaeologists found them buried in the layers of ash .
Once discovered , the cavity containing the skeleton is filled with a liquid plaster mixture .
After 48 hours the plaster hardens and the life - like figure can be lifted out .
Among the exhibits is the contorted figure of a dog
Not even the animals had the speed to escape .
The exhibition includes a pig and alongside a dog , his four legs contorted together to form one point and his mouth open .
You can see a tooth and a collar , and even make out the lines of his fur .
" The detail of the figures is remarkable " says Mrs Stefani .
" They have been preserved at the very second of their death . "
On another figure you can make out the creases of a scarf they were wearing as they struggled to breathe .
One of the saddest is the figure of a child .
The exhibition reflects the merciless , indiscriminate nature of the volcanic eruption .
The authorities decided to mount the displays partly because of the ignorance surrounding the figures .
" Many visitors to Pompeii thought they were sculptures , the work of artists , " says Mrs Stefani .
" But they are the remains of real people " .
' Human archaeology '
The work of preservation falls to Pompeii 's workshop of experts .
Set in a former villa in the city , the team prepare the plaster mixture .
Too thin and it would not be strong enough to support the skeletal frame , too thick and it would obliterate the detail of the person or animal being covered .
Preparing the plaster is a delicate operation " It is a very delicate operation , " says Stefania Giudice , one of the preservers working here .
" The bones are very brittle , so when we pour in the plaster we have to be very careful , otherwise we might damage the remains and they would be lost to us forever . "
A little more than 100 figures have been preserved in plaster , though not all are on show at the exhibition .
That is out of a total of about 1,150 bodies that have been discovered in Pompeii .
Some are not suitable to be covered as they have already been damaged , either by the debris of the volcano , or when they were unearthed .
As a third of Pompeii has yet to be excavated , more human and animal remains could be found .
Where possible these , too , will be treated with the plaster , removed and preserved .
To preservers like Ms Giudice , it is more than just a job .
" It can be very moving handling these remains when we apply the plaster , " she says .
" Even though it happened 2,000 years ago , it could be a boy , a mother or a family .
It 's human archaeology , not just archaeology . "
The exhibition lasts until the end of the year .

No one could exactly hail Google Inc. ’s Nexus
One a marketing success , so it comes as little surprise to see the search engine giant seeking to bolster its marketing team for the device and its future generation .
In a job listing spotted this week , Google said it was searching for a product marketing manager – of both Android and Nexus One – to be based in its Mountain View , Calif . , headquarters .
The listing notes that “ the Android space is a big opportunity for Google , and an area of strategic importance .
As Product Marketing Manager for Android and Nexus One , you support the Direct - To - Consumer marketing plans and initiatives that will be rolled out in the coming months .
You are focused on increasing the number of device sales and increasing awareness of the Nexus One brand . ”
Applicants , says Google , should have at least seven years of work experience , with at least three years of experience in mobile - related ventures , with e-commerce and retail experience a plus .
The firm is also looking for a candidate with good understanding of Google ’s strategic and competitive position in Android / mobile , and demonstrated analytical success .
Interestingly , the position also states that the chosen candidate would be required to “ work closely with global counterpoints in Android marketing to ensure global cohesion , communication , and scalability for local strategy , campaigns , and launches . ”
Why interesting ?
Well , for a start Nexus One has only officially been launched in the U.S. with a direct connection to one operator ( T - Mobile USA Inc. ) , which is hardly what one can call a global effort thus far .
( Google does offer a Nexus One compatible with AT&T Mobility ’s 3G network , but that device is only available for an unsubsidized price of $ 529 .
Verizon Wireless is expected to get its own version of the device later this year . )
Indeed , whereas Motorola Inc. ’s Droid running Google ’s Android sold more than one million units in its first 74 days , according to market research outfit Flurry ’s estimates , the Nexus One only sold 135,000 units in the same period , which sounds somewhat pathetic .
But herein lies the crux of the matter .
Those who slam Google for what appears to be a rather flimsy marketing campaign for the Nexus One may be missing the point .
Because the underlying assumption for such criticism is that Google actually wants to sell phones .
But , maybe Google ’s master plan does n’t lie in the selling of the actual phones at all , but of opening up new business opportunities .
At this year ’s Mobile World Congress event Google CEO Eric Schmidt noted that 60,000 Android handsets were shipping every day – a run-rate equivalent to 21.9 million per year .
And according to Gartner , 6.8 million Android handsets were sold in 2009 , accounting for a 3.9 % share of global smartphone sales – up from .5 % in 2008 .
Looking at just the U.S. smartphone market , Comscore Inc. reckons Android took a 9 % share of all U.S. smartphones in circulation in February 2010 – up from 2.8 % in October 2009 .
Google is a search engine giant , which makes the bulk of its money from advertising , not from phones .
And pushing Android firmly into the smartphone space is a smart move as it ensures that Google will be making much more mobile advertising revenue as the platform gains popularity .
After all , Google is n’t going to be making any money out of Nokia Corp. users surfing the net on their Symbian offerings .
It would therefore appear that rather than being in the phone business , Google is setting itself up to be in the business of creating business , for itself .
If this assumption is correct , then what Google has been trying to do is to push the market forward and get it moving along faster , in the Android direction .
This also means that if it ’s only really the Android platform Google cares about as a money maker , then the Droid and other Android - powered devices with their millions and millions of sales are already enough .
If that ’s the case , then perhaps the Nexus One was n’t meant to sell a lot of volume at all , instead , it was meant as a wakeup call for the entire industry , to show what is possible , and to set a standard for others to hold up and follow .
And in that sense , one could argue that Google ’s strategy has worked .
Just look at all the copycat efforts out there , including HTC Corp . ’s Logo phone and the Desire .
No phone maker out there wants to launch a smartphone worse than the Nexus One , because it has become something of a Google standard for partners to follow .
A bellwether .
And examined in that way , while the Nexus One might be in dire need of some marketing help , it ’s not a flop by any measure .
Google has proved shrewd in terms of pricing the device too .
Whilst almost mind - numbingly expensive in its unsubsidized form , the Nexus has proved to phone makers that if you build the right product people will pay for it , an important lesson in today ’s battered economy .
A lesson previously shown by the original launch of Apple Inc. ’s iPhone at its $ 400 and $ 600 price points . )
If we were to offer a comparable analogy , we might use that of Rolls Royce manufacturing aircraft engines .
You ’d better believe that if Rolls Royce could afford to , it would build its own plane that would blast any competitors out of the sky , but why bother when the firm can simply build a fantastic engine and then scale back as engine sales took off ?
Astute indeed .
So , if Google is n’t all that bothered about selling millions of phones , why even bother to hire a better marketing manager ?
Well , to keep the Android momentum going for one thing , and to keep pushing the industry and Google ’s handset partners to go one better than Apple .
If Google ’s Android platform is to win , there can be no resting on the Nexus One ’s laurels , and the phone perfecting process ca n’t just stop in its tracks .
In order to grow Android ’s market share , Google has to ensure it is setting the right tone , the right standard for its better selling partners to mimic , and that is why it will continue to raise that mobile bar higher and higher , pushing the industry as a whole to step it up .
That is a truly big job , whoever eventually takes it on .

Relations between Israel and the United States have been uneasy ever since Mr. Obama took office with a plan to rekindle the peace process by coupling a demand for a full freeze in Jewish settlement construction with reciprocal confidence - building gestures by Arab countries .

But the president was outraged by the announcement of 1,600 housing units in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood in East Jerusalem during Mr. Biden ’s visit , administration officials said .
Mr. Obama was deeply involved in the strategy and planning for Mr. Biden ’s visit and orchestrated the response from Mr. Biden and Mrs. Clinton after it went awry , these officials said .

' Jihad Jane's ' Arrest Raises Fears About Homegrown Terrorists Experts say the Pennsylvania woman was easy to find , and there could be more .
WASHINGTON , March 10 , 2010  --
The arrest of a suburban Pennsylvania woman known by the alias Jihad Jane , who allegedly plotted with Islamic radicals abroad to kill a Swedish cartoonist , has raised fears about homegrown terrorists in the United States who may be difficult to spot .
" This woman might as well have advertised in the Washington Post , " former White House counterterrorism official and ABC News consultant Richard Clarke said on " Good Morning America " today .
" It was easy for the FBI to find her , but there are other people who are much more covert . "
" There will likely be more attacks , " Clarke said .
" Hopefully , they will be small , and hopefully , we can catch them early . "
Colleen R. LaRose , 46 , of Montgomery , Pa. , was arrested in October 2009 and charged with trying to recruit Islamic fighters and plotting to assassinate a Swedish cartoonist who made fun of prophet Mohammed , according to a federal indictment unsealed Tuesday .
The FBI had kept the case secret while it looked for more suspects in the United States and abroad .
The case was made public after seven men were arrested in Ireland this week , suspected of plotting to kill the Swedish cartoonist .
LaRose 's case is rare , Clark said , but it shows the capability of international dissident groups to reach out to Americans via the Internet .
" This is a very rare case of a disturbed woman , " he said , but it signifies how " the Internet not only allows them to communicate , it allows them to recruit . "
Their persuasive speeches and sermons , which have been effective in recruiting men and women in the Middle East , are " beginning to work for some misfits in the United States , " he said .
LaRose was arrested in Philadelphia Oct. 16 , 2009 , and has been in federal custody ever since , without bail .
She has not entered a plea .
If convicted , she faces a potential sentence of life in prison and a $ 1 million fine .
Her three federal public defender lawyers have yet to return calls from ABC News .
LaRose could easily fit the part of a soccer mom .
She was described by neighbors as an average housewife .
" Oh , my God , unbelievable , I can't believe that , " one neighbor told ABC News .
Another said the news was an " amazing , shocking surprise . "
Clarke said there is likely a small group of people like LaRose .
But their numbers are less of a concern than the idea that radical groups can convey their ideology via this " remote control through cyberspace , " he said .
" I think it 's very small but it does n't have to be very large , " he said .
" So it 's not so much a matter of size .
It 's the fact that it 's going on . "
Authorities said LaRose 's U.S. citizenship and appearance made her appealing to the Islamic radicals she first contacted on the Internet .
" The terrorists figured out that they can't all look like Middle Eastern people , whether they be male or female , " former FBI agent and ABC News consultant Brad Garrett said .
" And so they 've put a lot of time and energy particularly into the Internet , of recruiting people . "
LaRose is better known to federal authorities as Fatima Rose or Jihad Jane .
On June 20 , 2008 , LaRose allegedly posted a video on YouTube calling herself JihadJane and stating she was " desperate to do something somehow to help " ease the suffering of Muslims , according to news station WPVI .
The indictment , obtained by ABC News , charged LaRose with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and conspiracy to kill in a foreign country , and making false statements to a government official and attempted identity theft .
Alleged Traget Identified as Lars Vilks
LaRose is also accused of making false statements to a government official and of attempted identity theft , a passport she allegedly stole with the intention of giving to an Islamic fighter .
The court papers alleged that LaRose reached out through the Internet to jihadist groups saying she was " desperate to do something to help " suffering Muslim people , and that she desired to become a martyr .
She stated in her e-mails " that her physical appearance would allow her to ' blend in with many people ' which ' may be a way to achieve what is in my heart , ' " the indictment stated .
In her e-mails with five unindicted co-conspirators in South Asia , Eastern and Western Europe , LaRose allegedly agreed to recruit men and women for jihad , to raise money for Islamic fighters , and agreed on the Internet to one jihadist 's request to " marry me to get me inside Europe . "
In March 2009 , the indictment stated , she allegedly received a directive to " got to sweden ... find location of [ Resident of Sweden ] ... and kill him ... this is what i say to u . "
LaRose was instructed to kill Vilks in a way that would frighten " the whole Kufar [ non - believer ] world . "
Federal officials identified the target as Lars Vilks , who had drawn Muhammed with the body of a dog .
LaRose replied , " I will make this my goal till I achieve it or die trying , " according to court documents .
She traveled , according to the FBI , on or around Aug. 29 , 2009 to Europe " with the intent to live and train with jihadists " and to " find and kill " Vilks .
In September , she joined an online community hosted by Vilks and eventually moved into Vilks ' artist enclave in Sweden .
" Today 's indictment , which alleges that a woman from suburban America agreed to carry out murder overseas and to provide material support to terrorists , underscores the evolving nature of the threat we face , " David Kris , assistant attorney general for the National Security Division of the Justice Department , said in a statement Tuesday .
" I applaud the many agents , analysts and prosecutors who worked on this important investigation . "
Special Agent - in - Charge Janice K. Fedarcyk of the Philadelphia Division of the FBI said in the Justice Department statement , " This case demonstrates that the FBI and our partners in the law enforcement and intelligence communities must continue to remain vigilant in the face of the threats that America faces , in whatever form those threats may present themselves or no matter how creative those who threaten us try to be .
We must use all available technologies and techniques to root out potential threats and stop those who intend to harm us . "
U.S. Attorney Michael Levy told the Associated Press the indictment does n't link LaRose to any organized terror groups .
ABC News ' Pierre Thomas contributed to this report .
The Texas Border Watch Program — the web - based border camera surveillance project Gov. Rick Perry launched in 2006 — is meeting its goals for the first time since its inception .
But that 's only because the targets have been scaled back so dramatically that the program hardly resembles the wide - reaching virtual border neighborhood watch Perry initially promised .
During his 2006 re-election campaign , Perry promised to launch a virtual neighborhood - watch program on the border , allowing internet viewers to troll for illegal crossers .
He said he would spend $ 5 million and line the border with " hundreds " of cameras .
Lawmakers did n't go for the idea , refusing to fund the cameras with state dollars .
But four years later , Perry has invested a total of $ 4 million of federal grant money that he controls in the Texas Border Watch Program .
Twenty - nine cameras have been installed on the 1,200 - mile Texas - Mexico border , or one camera for every 41 miles of border .
Internet viewers have helped police make a total of 26 arrests — that ’s about $ 153,800 per arrest .
And some border law agencies are not even using the cameras for police work .
Perry first gave the Texas Border Sheriff 's Coalition $ 2 million in 2008 to launch the border camera program .
Progress reports from that year showed the program fell far short of nearly all its law enforcement goals , including arrests , cash forfeitures and immigration apprehensions .
Only a fraction of the cameras Perry initially wanted had been installed , and the program had generated none of the self - sustaining advertising revenue called for in the camera contract .
In 2008 , the cameras were expected to generate 1,200 arrests , $ 25,000 in cash forfeitures , 50,000 incident reports and 4,500 immigration referrals .
Under the grant objectives , the coalition was supposed to install 200 cameras .
Instead , that year 13 cameras generated three arrests , zero cash forfeitures , eight incident reports and six immigration referrals .
Still , Perry gave the coalition another $ 2 million to keep the cameras rolling in 2009 .
According to the most recent six - month progress report obtained under Texas open records laws , the camera program finally achieved its objectives in the last half of 2009 .
But the objectives , set out by Perry 's Criminal Justice Division , were drastically reduced .
Instead of 15 different objectives , the camera program now has five .
Only two of them are law - enforcement related .
Gone are the goals for arrests , money seizures or immigration referrals .
Katherine Cesinger , a spokeswoman for Perry , said the goals were changed to “ reflect the metrics that can be directly linked to the utility of the border cameras . ”
The new objectives include the number of cameras installed , the number of landowners who allow cameras on their property and sightings reported to local law enforcement .
Even those goals are minimal : 17 cameras , 17 property owners and 230 sightings .
The coalition met or exceeded all but two of the new , smaller goals .
They have installed a total of 29 cameras now , said Don Reay , executive director of the coalition .
At least 19 landowners have agreed to allow cameras on their property , and the six - month report showed 318 sightings from the cameras were reported to law enforcement .
Reay said the new goals better reflect the reality of the program .
The coalition , he said , should not be responsible for gathering data about arrests , apprehensions and seizures from the various agencies that respond to calls from camera watchers .
And , he said , Perry ’s goal of 200 cameras on the border was not feasible .
“ That was a misstatement , ” Reay said .
“ We knew we could never put up 200 of these cameras . ”
When it comes to the advertising dollars that were supposed to be generated from the site , Reay granted that was the one aspect of the program that remains a failure .
“ I wished we had it , ” he said .
“ I wished it was self - sustaining , but the bottom line is we do n’t have it . ”
Perry still contends the camera program has been a success .
“ As we have discussed time and again , the Virtual Border Watch program continues to serve as an efficient tool that augments and amplifies the ability of law enforcement to monitor , detect , prevent and deter criminal activity along the border by utilizing advanced technology and the public interest in this program , ” Cesinger wrote in an e-mail .
The cameras , Cesinger said , are meant to supplement the $ 200 million Perry and state lawmakers have spent on border operations since 2006 for additional law enforcement and equipment for state and local police .
“ This program is just one of many tools the state is using to secure a border that our federal government has neglected to do , and without this technology , we would be at a disadvantage , ” she wrote .
It ’s unclear , though , which law enforcement agencies are gaining an advantage from the camera technology .
Coalition director Reay said Border Patrol agents told him they are happy with the cameras .
But , he said , the cameras are n’t used much in the El Paso Sector , which is mostly in New Mexico .
When contacted about the cameras , Marfa Border Patrol Sector spokesman Bill Brooks said he was n’t sure whether agents in that region , which includes the Big Bend area , had access to the camera footage .
“ We really do n’t have anything to do with the Texas watch system or whatever we call that .
I ’m not sure why you were referred to us , ” he said .
“ I have no idea where they ’re even located . ”
Over in the Del Rio Sector , just to the east of the Marfa Sector , spokesman Dennis Smith referred a request for comment to Border Patrol headquarters in Washington , D.C .
Not even all of the 20 sheriffs in the coalition use the cameras .
Lt. Larry Guerra in El Paso County , directly across from the violence stricken city of Juárez , said there are n’t any cameras there .
Sheriff Lupe Treviño in Hidalgo County and Sheriff Omar Lucio in Cameron County said they told the coalition they wanted nothing to do with the project .
Treviño , whose county is adjacent to the frequent shootouts in Reynosa , Mexico , said his department would n’t have the manpower to respond to potentially hundreds of calls from border web watchers .
“ I would n’t have time to do anything else , ” he said .
Plus , Treviño said , he would n’t trust the reports of untrained observers watching from their computers hundreds of miles away .
Lucio , whose county borders the recent murders , kidnappings , shootouts and a jailbreak in Matamoros , Mexico , said he worried the web watchers would send his deputies on wild goose chases .
Even if they did report crimes , Lucio said , by the time his deputies got the information , the perpetrators would be long gone .
He has seen smugglers load 1,000 pounds of marijuana into a station wagon and take off within 29 seconds .
“ Tell me , tell me , what is a camera going to do ? ” he asked .
“ I never thought it would work , and I do n’t believe it will work . ”
Lucio scoffed at results the coalition reported from the camera program — 26 arrests and the seizure of about 7,400 pounds of narcotics in two years .
“ I arrest more than that in a month , ” he said .
The camera money , he said , could be better spent on patrol officers and equipment .
“ On a yearly basis here , I confiscate six to seven tons [ of narcotics ] .
I do n’t need the cameras .
I just need the manpower . ”

Surveying the geography of time ( Image : Huw Evans / Rex Features )
Time Lords walk among us .
Two per cent of readers may be surprised to discover that they are members of an elite group with the power to perceive the geography of time .
Sci -fi fans – Anglophile ones , at least – know that the coolest aliens in the universe are Time Lords : time - travelling humanoids with the ability to understand and perceive events throughout time and space .
Now it seems that people with a newly described condition have a similar , albeit lesser ability : they experience time as a spatial construct .
Synaesthesia is the condition in which the senses are mixed , so that a sound or a number has a colour , for example .
In one version , the sense of touch evokes emotions .
Advertisement
To those variants we can now add time - space synaesthesia .
I see… time
“ In general , these individuals perceive months of the year in circular shapes , usually just as an image inside their mind ’s eye , ” says David Brang of the department of psychology at the University of California , San Diego .
“ These calendars occur in almost any possible shape , and many of the synaesthetes actually experience the calendar projected out into the real world . ”
One of Brang ’s subjects was able to see the year as a circular ring surrounding her body .
The “ ring ” rotated clockwise throughout the year so that the current month was always inside her chest with the previous month right in front of her chest .
Regenerating patterns
Brang and colleagues recruited 183 students and asked them to visualise the months of the year and construct this representation on a computer screen .
Four months later the students were shown a blank screen and asked to select a position for each of the months .
They were prompted with a cue month – a randomly selected month placed as a dot in the location where the student had originally placed it .
Uncannily , four of the 183 students were found to be time - space synaesthetes when they placed their months in a distinct spatial array – such as a circle – that was consistent over the trials .
A second test compared how well time - space synaesthetes and ordinary humans could memorise an unfamiliar spatial calendar and reproduce it .
Time - space synaesthetes turned out to have much better recall than the time - blind majority .
Brang suspects that time - space synaesthesia happens when the neural processes underlying spatial processing are unusually active .
“ This enhanced processing would generalise to other functions of spatial processing – mental rotation , map navigation , spatial manipulation , ” he says .
Brang did not speculate on whether time - space synaesthetes could regenerate , or if they have two hearts : both key characteristics of Time Lords .

GM CEO Ed Whitacre announced in a Wall Street Journal column last Wednesday that his company has paid back its government bailout loan " in full , with interest , years ahead of schedule . "
He is even running TV ads on all major networks to that effect — a needless expense given that a credulous media is only too happy to parrot his claims for free .
Detroit Free Press ' Mike Thompson , for example , advises bailout proponents to start " warming up their vocal chords " to jeer their opponents with chants of " I told you so . "
But before belting out their victory aria , GM - boosters ought to hear the whole story — not just the fairytale version about Government Motors ' grand comeback that Whitacre is feeding them .
Uncle Sam gave GM $ 49.5 billion last summer in aid to finance its bankruptcy .
( If it had n't , the company , which could n't raise this kind of money from private lenders , would have been forced into liquidation , its assets sold for scrap . )
So when Whitacre publishes a column with the headline , " The GM Bailout : Paid Back in Full , " most ordinary mortals unfamiliar with bailout minutia would assume that he is alluding to the entire $ 49.5 billion .
That , however , is far from the case .
Because a loan of such a huge amount would have been politically controversial , the Obama administration handed GM only $ 6.7 billion as a pure loan .
( It asked for only a 7 percent interest rate — a very sweet deal considering that GM bonds at that time were trading below junk level . )
The vast bulk of the bailout money was transferred to GM through the purchase of 60.8 percent equity stake in the company — arguably an even worse deal for taxpayers than the loan , given that the equity position requires them to bear the risk of the investment without any guaranteed return .
( The Canadian government likewise gave GM $ 1.4 billion as a pure loan , and another $ 8.1 billion for an 11.7 percent equity stake .
The U.S. and Canadian government together own 72.5 percent of the company . )
But when Whitacre says GM has paid back the bailout money in full , he means not the entire $ 49.5 billion — the loan and the equity .
In fact , he avoids all mention of that figure in his column .
He means only the $ 6.7 billion loan amount .
But wait !
Even that 's not the full story given that GM , which has not yet broken even , much less turned a profit , can't pay even this puny amount from its own earnings .
So how is it paying it ?
As it turns out , the Obama administration put $ 13.4 billion of the aid money as " working capital " in an escrow account when the company was in bankruptcy .
The company is using this escrow money — government money — to pay back the government loan .
GM claims that the fact that it is even using the escrow money to pay back the loan instead of using it all to shore itself up shows that it is on the road to recovery .
That actually would be a positive development — although hardly one worth hyping in ads and columns — if it were not for a further plot twist .
Sean McAlinden , chief economist at the Ann Arbor - based Center for Automotive Research , points out that the company has applied to the Department of Energy for $ 10 billion in low ( 5 percent ) interest loan to retool its plants to meet the government 's tougher new CAFÉ ( Corporate Average Fuel Economy ) standards .
However , giving GM more taxpayer money on top of the existing bailout would have been a political disaster for the Obama administration and a PR debacle for the company .
Paying back the small bailout loan makes the new — and bigger — DOE loan much more feasible .
In short , GM is using government money to pay back government money to get more government money .
And at a 2 percent lower interest rate at that .
This is a nifty scheme to refinance GM 's government debt — not pay it back !
GM boasts that , because it is doing so well , it is paying the $ 6.7 billion five years ahead of schedule since it was not due until 2015 .
So will there be an accelerated payback of the rest of the $ 49.6 billion investment ?
No .
That goal has been pushed back , as it turns out .
In order to recover that investment , the government has to sell its equity .
It plans to do that only when GM becomes a publicly traded company once again .
GM was hoping to turn a profit by the end of 2010 and float an initial public offering this winter .
However , GM Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell , when queried about that timeline a few days ago , demurred .
The offering will be made , he said , " when the markets and the company are ready . "
( Take that , taxpayers ! )
The reality is that there is no certainty that GM will ever be able to make taxpayers whole .
Some analysts such as Center for Automotive Research 's Sean McAlinden and Global Insight 's George Magliano believe that it will — eventually .
McAlinden maintains that this will happen when the company 's market capitalization touches $ 60 billion .
( At GM 's peak in 2000 , this level was only $ 57 billion . )
This is a challenging but not an impossible goal — provided the economy does not dip into another recession , he maintains .
Magliano too maintains that the company will be able to pay back taxpayers if the industry is able to ramp up annual vehicle sales from the expected 10.8 million this year to 17 million in 2014 and GM captures 20 percent of these sales .
The General Accountability Office , on the other hand , remains deeply pessimistic .
It concluded in a December report ( which a more recent April report has said nothing to contradict , despite media spin to the contrary ) that : " The Treasury is unlikely to recover the entirety of its investment in Chrysler or GM , given that the companies ' values would have to grow substantially more than they have in the past . "
Whitacre 's bailout payback ploy is a desperate attempt to win back the car - buying public deeply disgusted by the spectacle of GM rattling its tin-cup before Uncle Sam .
But the fact of the matter is that the company is still deep in the hole .
It might claw its way back — or it might not .
But surely it 's premature for its media boosters to pop open the champagne bottle without getting their story straight ?

Microsoft Not Liking Chamber of Commerce over Climate Change
March 3rd , 2010 by Tina Casey
An epic battle has been brewing over climate change in the world of commerce , and things just got a lot more epic-er .
Global giant Microsoft has become the latest corporate leader to challenge the U.S. Chamber of Commerce over its position on climate change .
Talking Points Memo reports that Microsoft has posted a statement on its sustainability blog , making it clear that the Chamber does not speak for it on climate issues .
Memo to Chamber of Commerce , what part of “ Microsoft has stated that climate change is a serious issue that demands immediate , worldwide attention and we are acting accordingly ” do you not get ?
[ social_buttons ]
The fossil fuel industry will never die , but fossil fuels are on the road to marginalization , and jobs in that sector will not drive the economy .
Instead of trying to prop up a fading industry , the Chamber should stop fiddling around and start supporting companies like Peerless Industries , Inc .
The sustainability - minded company has just announced that it has shifted 100 % of its jobs back from overseas , and moved them all into a new energy efficient LEED certified building in Illinois .
Who Does the Chamber of Commerce Really Represent ?
Short answer : not all of the same companies they used to .
Last month , just one day before Nike along with Starbucks and a bunch of other companies launched the Race for American Jobs ( a national campaign in support of new climate legislation ) the Chamber of Commerce upstaged them by filing a petition blocking the EPA ’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act .
How ’s that for support ?
No wonder Nike has withdrawn from its position on the Chamber ’s board .
Apple , Exelon ( the nation ’s largest utility ) , Pacific Gas & Electric , and several other leading companies quit outright last fall .
Who is the Chamber Helping ?
Think Progress reports that an organization called the American Legislative Exchange Council ( ALEC ) is behind a state - based drive against greehouse gas regulation that backs up the Chamber ’s position .
The organization ( which is partly funded by Exxon , according to Sourcewatch.org ) promotes a resolution opposing EPA ’s endangerment finding on greenhouse gasses ( an endangerment finding is needed in order to establish the EPA ’s authority to regulate emissions ) .
So far at least 15 state legislatures have embarked on parallel resolutions challenging the EPA ’s authority .
Many contain inflammatory language that basically positions climate science as a vast global conspiracy , and according to Think Progress all include language claiming that greenhouse gas regulation will hurt the economy .
What was that about Exxon again ?
The Arizona Clean Energy Canary
If Arizona is any indication of where this is headed , fasten your seatbelts .
The global clean energy giant Suntech , which is bringing green jobs to Arizona , was among the companies and organizations that successfully lobbied the Arizona state legislature to drop a bill that would have stifled incentives for clean energy .
The bill ’s own primary sponsor was among those dropping it like a hot potato after hearing public testimony .
On the other side of the coin is the Arizona legislature ’s ALEC / Exxon style resolution , which according to Think Progress states that the U.S. Congress does n’t have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas pollution .
For a clue where this is going , follow the money – and I do n’t mean corporate money .
Fewer jobs in the fossil fuel industry , more jobs in the clean energy sector , and that many less voters in support of anti-climate shenanigans .

Last night , the House of Representatives passed health care reform and moved the bill to the President 's desk for a final signature .
The bill is littered with tax increases in order to fund the expansion of health coverage for Americans , and the Reconciliation Act , now in the Senate , has similar increases .
Despite Sega 's roots , the former console maker is currently defending PC gaming , claiming that there 's big money to be made in that particular arena .
Although the physical retail sales of PC games continue to slide in 2010 , Sega ’s UK MD John Clark told MCVUK that those particular sales numbers are n't indicative of the actual PC gaming market .
Indeed , the company is enjoying its fair share of revenue on the digital front .
" The PC market is third in terms of its year - on - year performance with a decline of 26 per cent , but this does n’t really reflect the full picture , " Clark said in an interview .
" The PC digital download business is now a viable sector but somewhat invisible as it ’s not yet covered by ( UK's ) Chart - Track .
The PC market overall is actually performing much better than is currently reported , and remains a vital and strong sector to be involved in . "
Surprisingly , Sega is becoming a dominant factor in the PC gaming market , taking its 12.8 - percent share in corporate 2009 thanks to the three - pronged attack of Aliens vs. Predator , Napoleon : Total War , and the continued sales of Football Manager 2010 .
As Clark pointed out , all three games have different styles of gameplay yanked from three different genres : FPS , strategy , and sim .
" They can all drive a strong , community fan base with the ability to consistently deliver endless hours of gameplay , " he said .
" For 2009 , Sega was ranked the second biggest PC publisher in the market .
In 2010 year - to - date , we are once again ranked second .
Long may it continue . "
( CNN ) -- Nathanael
Paul likes the convenience of the insulin pump that regulates his diabetes .
It communicates with other gadgets wirelessly and adjusts his blood sugar levels automatically .
But , a few years ago , the computer scientist started to worry about the security of this setup .
What if someone hacked into that system and sent his blood sugar levels plummeting ?
Or skyrocketing ?
Those scenarios could be fatal .
" If your computer fails , no one dies , " he said in a phone interview .
" If your insulin pump fails , you have problems . "
As sci -fi as it sounds , Paul 's fears are founded in reality .
Researchers say it is possible for hackers to access and remotely control medical devices like insulin pumps , pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators , all of which emit wireless signals .
In 2008 , a coalition of researchers from the University of Washington , Harvard Medical School and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst wrote that they remotely accessed a common cardiac defibrillator using easy - to - find radio and computer equipment .
In a lab , the researchers used their wireless access to steal personal information from the device and to induce fatal heart rhythms by taking control of the system .

In the two years since that finding , some computer scientists have been on a quest for security fixes for these potentially life - saving devices .
Pacemaker passwords
Paul , a research scientist with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee , is among them .
He 's mocking up a design for a more secure insulin pump that cuts some of the wireless connections between parts of the system .
Others are looking for security solutions for pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators , which are embedded inside a patient and can adjust his or her heart rhythms .
At the Computer - Human Interaction conference in Atlanta , Georgia , this week , Tamara Denning , a PhD student at the University of Washington , presented a number of prototypical security safeguards for pacemakers and defibrillators .
View Denning 's full presentation ( PDF )
Some of the suggestions would protect the devices with passwords .
But that poses further complications , Denning said , because doctors and nurses have to be able to control the devices in the event of an emergency , even if the patient who knows the password is unconscious .
It may be possible to get around that issue by tattooing a barcode containing the password on the patient 's skin , either with visible ink or ink that can be seen only under ultraviolet light , she said .
Patients also could wear bracelets with their passwords on the inside , or doctors could carry devices that would de-activate a pacemaker or defibrillator 's security protections in the event of an emergency .
Denning said it will be important to standardize security measures .
" If you have a patient that 's unconscious on the ground , you really do n't want the medical staff to have to figure out what security system they 're using , " she said in the presentation .
Regulation
Some people are prodding the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to further regulate these devices , perhaps requiring them to be more secure .
In an April 1 article in The New England Journal of Medicine , Dr. William Maisel , an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School , wrote that the FDA should lead an effort to develop appropriate legislation for the medical devices .
The pacemakers and defibrillators are more open to attack as they become more sophisticated , he wrote .
" Medical devices have provided important health benefits for many patients , but their increasing number , automation , functionality , connectivity and remote - communication capabilities augment their security vulnerabilities , " he wrote .
He added : " The security of medical devices is not a luxury . "
FDA spokeswoman Karen Riley declined to say whether the FDA is looking into new regulations of wireless medical devices ; she added that the responsibility for making the devices secure falls primarily on the manufacturer .
" The FDA shares concerns about the security and privacy of medical devices and emphasizes security as a key element of device design , " she said .
Wendy Dougherty , spokeswoman for Medtronic Inc. , a large maker of implantable medical devices , said the company is willing to work with the FDA to establish " formal device security guidelines . "
The company is aware of potential security risks to implanted medical devices , she said .
" Safety is an integral part of our design and quality process .
We 're constantly evolving and improving our technologies . "
In a written statement , Dougherty described the risk of someone hacking into a wireless medical device as " extremely low . "
Wireless connections
The security concerns stem from the fact that pacemakers , defibrillators and insulin pumps emit wireless signals , somewhat like computers .
These signals vary in range and openness .
Researchers who reported hacking into a defibrillator said some in - the - body devices have a wireless range of about 15 feet .
Many devices do not have encrypted signals to ward off attack , the researchers say .
Encryption is a type of signal scrambling that is , for example , employed on many home Wi-Fi routers to prevent unknown people from accessing the network .
Researchers urged people who use wireless medical devices not to panic .
While security threats to medical devices theoretically exist , there have been no documented cases of wireless attacks on medical devices , the researchers said in papers and interviews .
The real concern will come when these devices are further connected -- to phones , the Internet and other computers , said Kevin Fu , an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst .
" Today , there should be no reason for concern , " he said .
" If I were prescribed a device by a doctor , I would certainly take it .
The concern about the security of the devices is for the future . "
Motive
There 's some question as to why a person would hack into a pacemaker or insulin pump and how the hacker would know a person uses a medical device .
Maisel listed some possible scenarios in his New England Journal article .
" Motivation for such actions might include the acquisition of private information for financial gain or competitive advantage ; damage to a device manufacturer 's reputation ; sabotage by a disgruntled employee , dissatisfied customer or terrorist to inflict financial or personal injury ; or simply the satisfaction of the attacker 's ego , " he wrote .
Denning , from the University of Washington , said the current risk of attack is very low , but that someone could hack into a pacemaker without apparent motive .
She referenced a case from 2008 in which a hacker reportedly tried to induce seizures in epilepsy patients by putting rapidly flashing images on an online forum run by the Epilepsy Foundation .
Convenience
Paul , the diabetic who is concerned about his insulin pump , said researchers face many challenges in making medical devices more secure .
Patients do n't want to have to enter passwords constantly or adopt security measures that would make daily tasks inconvenient , he said .
But with cooperation and increased awareness , he said the security gap can be closed .
" It 's definitely a problem , but the good thing is we have people looking at this problem now and I think we should start seeing some good solutions soon , " he said .
M.I.A.’s controversial “ Born Free ” video has not , it turns out , been deleted from Google ’s YouTube site .
The video still lives but has become nearly impossible to find , because of the combined efforts of disturbed users and YouTube ’s content - monitoring staff .
The video , which you can view on YouTube to the right , shows military forces rounding up and executing red-headed children .
Contrary to news reports that YouTube removed the violent video , the site simply put it behind an age - restricted click - through .
That renders the video impossible to find unless you already know the URL .
At least one instance of the video was removed from YouTube and originally marked with a copyright - takedown notice ( no longer online ) that cited a request by XL Recordings , M.I.A. ’s UK label , while UMG sells her music in the US .
However , M.I.A. press manager Jennie Boddy told us , “ YouTube took it off , not UMG . ”
Copyright is not the issue here .
Rather , it all has to do with YouTube ’s 13 - year - old - and - up users stumbling across a violent video in which one child is shot in the head at point - blank range and another is blown up , in graphic detail , by bombs .
YouTube ’s head of communications ( who declined to be named in accordance with Google corporate practice ) told Wired.com that the site does not comment on the flagging or removal of individual videos , but she did point us to a 2008 blog post in which YouTube lays out its policy of burying videos in “ ‘ Most Viewed , ’ ‘ Top Favorited , ’ and other browse pages , ” after enough users flag a given video as objectionable .
So why ca n’t anyone find this video using YouTube ’s search function ?
As it turns out , YouTube users do not have the ability themselves to to bury a video in search results , no matter how many times they flag something as objectionable .
If YouTube ’s crowdsourced objectionable - content - detection system alerts staff to a video that should probably be age - restricted , a Google staffer watches the video and decides whether to age - restrict it , which then buries the video in the search results .
And Google confirmed that that is precisely what happened here .
“ The demotion that happens [ in browsable pages ] is based on a number of signals , including user flagging activity potentially indicating that the video could be controversial , ” said the YouTube spokeswoman .
“ For the more severe demotion , in terms of not showing up in search results , that ’s actually only when a video has been reviewed and age - restricted .
However many user flags , or a flagging campaign , could never lead to a video being taken off of search results .
It would have to be somebody from the policy - enforcement team reviewing that video and saying ‘ Yes , this is in fact not suitable for a general audience . ' ”
Given Google ’s stance towards censorship of its own search engine by the Chinese government , one would hardly expect it to censor YouTube users .
Indeed , Google ’s policy represents a more open and nuanced approach than what Apple is doing with its App Store .
There , presumably overworked employees decide whether to censor content before it even shows up in the store .
The notion that YouTube censored the video completely appears to have originated with the BBC , subsequently spreading to The New York Times ( which later updated its article ) and then to the rest of the web .
Even M.I.A. was confused , at one point tweeting , “ FUCK UMG WHO WONT SHOW IT ON YOUTUBE !
FOR THE U.S >>>>>>
WATCH HERE http://miauk.com/,” following that up with “ OK NOT UMG FAULT ! ”
It took a little digging , but now you know what really went on here : Google ’s YouTube buried , but did not delete , the video for M.I.A. ’s “ Born Free . ”

Updated : UMG is not the parent company of XL Recordings ; the former sells the new M.I.A. album in the US , the latter in the UK .
For many Anzac Day is a solemn day of remembrance , but much of what Australians believe about it have been products more of recent PR and propaganda than of memory , writes Noel Turnbull .
In Alan Bennett ’s play The History Boys one of the characters says : “ The best way to forget something is to commemorate it . ”
Nothing exemplifies that more than the way that Anzac Day commemoration has resulted in Australians either forgetting what they knew about Gallipoli , or never learning the truth .
For many returned servicemen and women and their families Anzac Day is a solemn day of remembrance , but much of what Australians believe about it , and what images and ideas it inspires , have been products more of recent PR and propaganda than of memory .
Alec Campbell , socialist , trade unionist , republican and the last Australian who served at Gallipoli , was almost deified by John Howard .
Brendan Nelson wanted all Australian schools to teach “ values ” through the prism of John Simpson Kirkpatrick , ( the famous Simpson and his donkey ) who , it is generally agreed , was a drinker and a brawler ; jumped ship and came to Australia as an illegal immigrant ; was a bit of a slacker at times and probably acquired the donkey as a way of avoiding working with anyone else ; was in favour of a revolution to “ clear out millionaires and dukes ” ; and , had enlisted so that he could get back to his family in Britain .
These realities were conveniently omitted from the Howard - Nelson version of history , although it is tempting to think school kids would be better off learning about the Campbell and Kirkpatrick values than some other ones stuffed down their throats .
The basic facts about Gallipoli are also well - known , but seemingly feature little in either Anzac iconography or political rhetoric .
For a start Australia suffered 8709 casualties at Gallipoli ( Department of Veterans Affairs Anzac website ) compared with 86,692 Turks , 21,255 Britains and 9798 French .

There were also 1358 Indians and 49 Newfoundland casualties .
Gallipoli has been a battleground for millennia and its modern significance is probably mainly due to Kemal Ataturk ’s role there , and subsequently in modern Turkey .
Yet Australians have been persuaded to believe that its significance is primarily Australian through a process that framed the event as a founding national event ; promoted it as a unique opportunity to express Australian patriotism ; and then commercialised it through tourism and other activities .
The legend was shaped from the very beginning by British journalist Ellis Ashmead - Bartlett ; Australian war historian C.E.W.
Bean ; Sir Keith Murdoch ; and C.J.Dennis in The Sentimental Bloke .
But why it has became newly iconic after being in long - term decline from the 1960s is a puzzle .
Ken Inglis ’ view of Anzac as providing something sacred for a secular society is persuasive .
Inge Clendinnen is right to remind us of the significance of his work just as Henry Reynolds and Marilyn Lake are right to ask why we celebrate Anzac Day and not our pioneering role in unionism , social welfare and women ’s suffrage .
But the full picture is impossible to grasp without considering the expensive and well - planned PR programs designed to help us remember Anzac Day in a particular way .
The long - term decline was reversed from the 1990s , first , by Bob Hawke at the Anzac Day 75th anniversary .
It was then consolidated with the Australian Remembers campaign in 1994 - 95 to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II .
And it culminated in the Howard government ’s deification of the digger and militarism .
While the speeches , events and commemorations were the public face of a memorial campaign , behind them all were PR and marketing campaigns .
The Australia Remembers campaign was run by the minister for veterans affairs , Con Sciacca , his chief - of - staff Greg Rudd , John Engledow , deputy head of an Australia Remembers Taskforce and Peter Thomas as a roving ambassador .
Peter Thomas , a former army officer , and an experienced PR practitioner who had headed Telstra PR , said in a case study summary of the campaign that it was “ possibly the last opportunity for many veterans , servicemen and servicewomen to be honoured .
These people , and those who served but are no longer with us , have a special place in the history of Australia .
They are an enduring beacon for us all ” .
And many of us who worked on the campaign sincerely believed that .
Yet there is little doubt that there was also political calculation involved — and it was fairly easy for some of us to believe in the Australia Remembers and the Labor cause at the same time .
Traditionally the RSL leadership ( although many ordinary diggers were on the left ) were strong supporters of Empire , Crown , conservatism and strongly anti-Labor .
Australia Remembers gave the ALP the opportunity to re-position itself as the patriotic party — which it had always been but which conservatives had managed to frame as otherwise .
Later state ALPs adopted similar tactics .
Victorian ALP veterans affairs adviser and Vietnam vet John Phillips played a brilliant role in building bridges with ex-service people and the RSL , working to get a better deal for veterans and using skilful commemorative tactics to re-position the Bracks and Brumby governments among veterans .
Australia Remembers used the full gamut of PR activities — particularly at grassroots level .
Grants were made to local communities to conduct events including community events around local Anzac Day services that , instead of the main Anzac Day March , became ( and continue to be ) the focal point of Anzac Day services around the country .
Forty years ago there were fewer and fewer marchers and fewer and fewer onlookers .
After the Australia Remembers campaign there were thousands of small community events involving hundreds of thousands of people across Australia .
Many of the campaign elements — re-enactments , commercial tie-ups , events — were standard PR techniques that tapped into the patriotism that had been kindled as part of the 1988 Bicentennial celebrations ; the 75th Anzac Day anniversary ; and gave local people an opportunity to develop forms of commemoration distinctive to their community .
They also , unfortunately , produced a platform for the new nationalism ; distrust of foreigners and refugees ; and , the military adventurism of the Howard government .
All the techniques used in the US to promote war — farewells for troops ; the concept that criticising the wars was wrong because it was disloyal to “ our troops ” ; symbolic visits to the troops in combat zones — were also used by the Howard government .
The Australian military now even employs brand managers just like fast - food companies .
However , the US efforts are far more comprehensive simply because the US military employs more PR people than any other organisation in the world .
As long as wars go on , politicians continue to think of new ways to commemorate them , new PR gestures , and new ways to “ honour ” those who served .
People I served with in Vietnam are still fighting to get better health and pension entitlements , but we have now been awarded more medals in the past 10 years than we were awarded for serving in the first place .
With every one of these additional postwar decorations we were all given the opportunity of having presented them by our local MP or getting them through the post .
Most chose Australia Post .
Ritual declaration of interest :
My former firm provided a contractor ( at cost ) to Australia Remembers , I worked on the campaign as a volunteer , I am a returned serviceman but , as a good republican , am more likely to celebrate Oliver Cromwell ’s birthday on April 25 than Anzac Day .
The National Geographic Museum will open a new exhibition this Wednesday , April 28 called Design for the Other 90 % , a touring exhibition from the Smithsonian ’s Cooper - Hewitt , National Design Museum .

Another option to start being an active participant of eco living is to neuter or spay your cat .
No , I do n’t mean to convey that I believe one can start greening a kitten by not giving it a chance to live .
That ’s really absurd .
The part that I want to point out is the necessity to control pet population , especially your absolutely fast birthing furry pets .
Pet population , cats in particular , has ballooned beyond the capacity of household to sustain them .
Hence , there is that astounding number of cats getting euthanized every year .
Pet shelters often end up full - handed with all the stray and deposited cats and dogs .
These shelters end up needing to euthanize some of the pets in order to deliver sufficient care to the remaining number of pets they can still cater .
Neutering or spaying your cat may not save all those in the shelters but you can save the whole neighborhood from one or two more feral kittens and cats and even dogs and puppies .
Limiting your cat ’s capacity to reproduce would give them and their young ones all the attention and care that they want and require from you .
Imagine the possibilities of not neutering your pet cats .
In years time , you ’ll find your household full of cats .
So if no pet parents would neuter their cats , imagine the world loaded with cats .
Neutering or castrating your pet cats is surely a beneficial way of greening not solely your pets but the environment as a whole .
Raising green cats is only possible when you raise them in a green environment .

Here 's how it will all end for those unfamiliar with the process :
1. Goldman will hire the best lawyers in the history of the universe , making OJ's Dream Team look like Ally McBeal .
2 . They will make public statements about their " vigorous defense " while negotiating a settlement that will involve a large check and quite possibly the sacrifice of " Fabulous " Fabrice Tourre .
3 . Upon the writing of this check , Goldman will admit no wrongdoing and the White House will claim victory .
4 . Not one of you will be safer , more employed or in better shape as a result of any of this .
5 . The lawyers and PR reps involved in the case will buy Maseratis and vacation homes .
Lots of them .
6. Fabrice Tourre will be running his own hedge fund within 3 years .
7 . Everyone connected to this case will still have more money in the bank , in real estate and in investments than you could ever dream of .
8 . The sun will come up the next day , you will go to work , then pick up your kid at Karate , then pay the utility bill .
That 's it , folks .
Let 's not pretend otherwise .
The Protomen is an American rock band best known for composing original rock operas based on the popular video game series Mega Man .
Because of the group 's insistence on wearing costumes and using code - names , even when being interviewed , The Protomen remain a mysterious entity within the video game music scene .
Their costumes and general stage presence has been compared to that of Daft Punk .

The slogan is “ Wake Up and Stand Up . ”
The mission statement declares that the federal government is “ not the enemy of the people , but the expression of our collective will , and that we must participate in the democratic process in order to address the challenges we face as Americans . ”
Local chapters are planning meetings in cities from Washington to San Antonio to Los Angeles ( where there have been four in the last month . )
The party ( coffeepartyusa.org ) is planning nationwide coffee houses for March 13 , where people can gather to decide which issues they want to take on and even which candidates they want to support .
This summer , Ms. Park said , the party will hold a convention in the Midwest , with a slogan along the lines of “ Meet Me in the Middle . ”
The party has inspired the requisite jokes : why not a latte party , a chai party , a Red Bull party ?
But Ms. Park said that while the Coffee Party — and certainly the name — was formed in reaction to the Tea Party , the two agree on some things , like a desire for fiscal responsibility and a frustration with Congress .
“ We ’re not the opposite of the Tea Party , ” Ms. Park , 41 , said .
“ We ’re a different model of civic participation , but in the end we may want some of the same things . ”

The Tea Party argues for stripping the federal government of many of its roles , and that if government has to be involved , it should be mostly state governments .
A young Liberal - National Party ( LNP ) member who called Barack Obama a " monkey " on Twitter says he is not a racist and his comments have been misunderstood .
Griffith University medical student Nick Sowden is facing expulsion from the Queensland party for the comments on his Twitter feed during Kerry O'Brien 's exclusive interview with the US president .
" If i wanted to see a monkey on TV id [ sic ] watch Wildlife Rescue # justsaying # obama730 , " read one comment .
Another said : " Im [ sic ] not sure why they paid kerry to fly to america .
if they wanted an interview with a monkey surely a Ferry to Taronga would have sufficed . "
Mr Sowden 's
Twitter account has now been deleted , but there are hundreds of references to the comments on the internet .
The 22 - year - old says it was a poor attempt at irony which has been blown out of proportion .
" It 's meant to be more of a joke against the Tea Party movement , the crazy right wing conservatives , Fox News type thing , " he said .
" And it 's something maybe that they would say and I think that 's where the joke is .
People who do n't know me who read the retweets of it , they do n't really realise the context ... have claimed me to be a racist when I 'm quite clearly not .
" I had n't really thought much about it at the time and that 's probably where it went a bit wrong ...
It 's not against Barack as a person . "
Apology
Mr Sowden says he does a lot of work for Indigenous health and charities in Ghana and Fiji which shows he is not a racist person .
He says he now regrets his comments and he would apologise to Mr Obama .
" I 'm sure Barack Obama has a lot worse things in his life to deal with than a tweet from someone with 200 followers on the Gold Coast , but if he has taken offence , sure , I 'll apologise , " he said .
Mr Sowden 's Facebook site contains a picture of Hitler in a parody of an Obama election poster but he says that too has been misconstrued .
" That picture of Obama was everywhere , there was all this hype which I did n't agree with - I did n't think it was warranted at the time - and I think that was one way of showing how the masses can be influenced like that , " he said .
" If people want to call me a Nazi then that 's obviously another ridiculous thing , I had family in a concentration camp , I had family who were migrants . "
LNP President Bruce McIver says action will be taken to expel Mr Sowden from the party .
" Disciplinary action will be taken under our constitution , " he said .
" This young LNP man is obviously not a fit and proper person to be involved with the party . "
Mr Sowden says he has not heard from the LNP officially about moves to expel him .
" Obviously I think it would be fairer if they spoke to me first , " he said .
" It would be a bit sad I think if the LNP do expel me and I think it 's only really narrowing their view of their membership a little bit . "
On Facebook , Nick Sowden is a fan of pages titled ' I hate it when I wake up in the morning and Barack Obama is President ' and ' Obama screwed more people than Tiger Woods ' .
His page includes a photo of a beaming Mr Sowden with his arm around former Liberal leader Brendan Nelson at a John Howard testimonial dinner .
Young LNP Queensland president Rod Schneider says Mr Sowden 's comments are not the views of the Young Liberals and he welcomes the LNP 's move to expel him from the party .
He says this was the latest in a " long line of indiscretions " from Mr Sowden .
PRESS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
World Homeopathy Awareness Week 2010 : A Celebration with No Substance
Toronto , Ont. ( Date , 2010 ) — Starting on April 10 , 2010 , Homeopaths will be celebrating World Homeopathy Awareness
Week in honor of their founder , 17th century homeopath Samuel Hahnemann .
There will be free lectures , discounted visits , homeopathic first aid courses and displays .
Sadly , one fact will be missing from all of these promotional materials : homeopathy does n’t work .
The theme for WHAW this year is Mental Well Being : Mind and Body in Balance and many of the resources offered in Canada will be directed toward mental health and wellness areas .
In an attempt to ensure the public gets all of the correct information before entrusting their mental well being to a homeopath , the Committee for the Advancement of Scientific Skepticism ( CASS ) will be mustering its scientific advisory ranks in order to answer the unsubstantiated claims made by the homeopathic community .
Homeopathic practice is based upon the outdated theory of “ like - cures - like ’ ’
What results from this are individualized preparations of various remedies that use profoundly diluted versions of substances thought to cause the symptoms of an illness in order to allow the body to heal itself .
Homeopathy is one of several alternative medical theories based upon “ vitalism , ” a 19th century idea proposing a mystical life - force that animates the body .
This was wholly abandoned by modern medicine by the beginning of the 20th century when the germ theory of disease , genetic heredity , and molecular biology started to discover the chemical underpinnings of human physiology .
What homeopaths fail to tell us is that not only do their preparations rarely contain a molecule of the active ingredient , but they defy the laws of modern physics and chemistry and they have not been able to prove efficacy beyond that of placebo in modern scientific trials .
The modern scientific method , the best tool we have to evaluate claims like this , has shown that homeopathy can not and does not work .
WHAW will be proposing a lot of ideas that contradict modern medical knowledge and the CASS will ensure that the claims are correctly evaluated .

A while back , Aaron Renn at the Urbanophile did an interesting post on Portland .
Anyone who loves the city will find it engaging and challenging , as I did , and I wanted to expand on a comment I made there at the time .
( I lived there from 1969 to 1980 and was later based there as a transit planning consultant , 1994 - 2003 . )
Comparing Portland to his hometown , Indianapolis , he notices that the two cities score about the same on many metrics — job growth , domestic in - migration , GDP , etc. — even though Portland is a nationally renowned achievement in urban planning and lifestyle while Indianapolis is a pretty ordinary Midwestern city surrounded by lots of sprawl .
The core of his observation is in this quotation from Alissa Walker at Good :
Portland , Oregon — the misty evergreen Shangri - La for the young , the creative , and the progressive — has an interesting problem .
Its miles of bike lanes , its rock - bottom rents , its deep vats of craft brews are all far too good .
Yes , Portland has actually made itself too attractive .
According to one study that compared May of 2009 with May of 2008 , Oregon ’s unemployment has grown faster than any other state in the country , 3 percent .
For large metropolitan areas in the country , Portland has one of the highest unemployment rates , which topped out at about 11.8 percent — even higher than Detroit .
To blame , some economists believe , are the large numbers of designers and artists who have been moving there without jobs , dubbed the dubious “ young creatives . ”
Aaron goes on to tell the story of one woman , Nikki Sutton , who moved to Portland without a job , because she loved the city , the landscape , the lifestyle .
She spent a year trying to find work — even Starbucks had a huge backlog of applicants — and finally moved back to Indianapolis .
Aaron asks :
“ What ’s the carbon impact of Nikki not being able to get a job in Portland ?
I wonder what the carbon footprint of the city would look like if it counted people who had to leave for economic reasons , or who wanted to move there but decided discretion was the better part of valor
when they could n’t secure advance employment . ”
Reflecting on this , I wrote a comment on Aaron ’s piece that I thought I ’d expand on here .
People do go to Portland for the lifestyle at every point on the economic ladder .
That includes the young unemployed such as Nikki Sutton , but there ’s a rung of the ladder below them : the teen runaways who seem especially attracted to the city , and who often end up on its streets .
Compared to all other cities that I ’m used to , I ’m always struck by how young the panhandlers in Portland are .
I connect that to the remarkably womblike quality of Portland ’s physical environment .
The gentle embrace of the forested hills , the wet and mild climate , the famously intimate built scale , the relative lack of crushing big -city monumentalism in its architecture .
There ’s a quality about Portland that has profound subconscious appeal to people who want to detach , who are cut off from home , maybe consciously thinking of themselves as rebels — but who still need to be consoled or embraced .
I think that applies to people of all ages and classes , from teenage runaways to retirees to affluent professionals who can move their wired career anywhere , and choose Portland .
To bring this back to Aaron ’s point :
This cultural history explains , I think , why Portland is particularly resistant to metrics .
In a recent post I pointed out the astounding fact that in the last 12 years , when four major rail transit lines have been built in the City of Portland , the percentage of workers commuting by transit did not increase at all .
In many cities , that metric would matter .
In Portland it really does n’t .
Nobody cared much that ridership on the first light rail line was less than predicted , either .
I was asked about that many times myself when I was a Portland - based consultant in the 90s , flying around the US trading on Portland ’s mystique .
I gave the standard Portland answer , which is something like : “ We ’re not doing this to win a race or score points or achieve performance targets .
We ’re doing this to build a civilized city . ”
The streetcar advocates today , who argue that streetcars are a transit improvement even if they ’re slower than buses , are making
basically the same kind of argument .
Portland ’s success in “ lifestyle ” may be inseparable from the fact that metrics do n’t explain it .
That may be exactly why , to so many people , it feels like home .
So why ca n’t Portland grow its economy enough to retain environmentally conscious domestic migrants like Nikki Sutton ?
And do n’t tell me it ’s because there ’s not enough parking downtown .
People who are unhappy in life are unlikely to find satisfaction at work .
This is the finding of a study published online April 1 , 2010 , in the Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology .
Assistant Professor Nathan Bowling of Wright State University , USA , and colleagues Kevin Eschleman and Qiang Wang undertook a meta-analysis on the results of 223 studies carried out between 1967 and 2008 .
All of the studies had investigated some combination of job satisfaction and life satisfaction ( or subjective well - being ) .
Assistant Professor Nathan Bowling said : " We used studies that assessed these factors at two time points so that we could better understand the causal links between job satisfaction and life satisfaction .
If people are satisfied at work , does this mean they will be more satisfied and happier in life overall ?
Or is the causal effect the opposite way around ? "
The causal link between subjective well - being and subsequent levels of job satisfaction was found to be stronger than the link between job satisfaction and subsequent levels of subjective well - being .
" These results suggest that if people are , or are predisposed to be , happy and satisfied in life generally , then they will be likely to be happy and satisfied in their work , " said Nathan Bowling .
" However , the flipside of this finding could be that those people who are dissatisfied generally and who seek happiness through their work , may not find job satisfaction .
Nor might they increase their levels of overall happiness by pursuing it . "

If you 're itching to put a webOS device on your AT&T account and do n't mind having half the now - standard RAM , the developers at jictechnology have released what they 're claiming is an official , permanent SIM unlock for the original Palm Pre .
A few bugs to get through , but it 's apparently legitimate enough ( we have n't tried , but the happy customers in the forums seem to suggest success ) for the group to charge around £ 25 .
Great news all around , but if you 're the sort whose fixation on Palm has n't been so grand that you resisted switching to Sprint or Verizon , you can probably wait for the AT&T's Plus - sized model .

Steve Jobs has gone public about his problems with Flash , the omnipresent web multimedia format which he will not allow on iPhones , iPods and iPads .
Coming a little more than a week after Adobe said it would no longer try to get Flash onto Apple 's suite of mobile internet devices , this looks like the definitive split .
There 's no chance of reconciliation , and the parties have moved from grumbling and sniping to publicly airing their grievances .
" Flash was created during the PC era – for PCs and mice .
" In a rare blog posting on Apple 's site , Jobs recounts a once cooperative relationship with Adobe , with Apple making visits to the then - startup 's Silicon Valley garage .
And he acknowledges that the companies have long had intertwined fortunes , sharing many customers and , at one time , equity .
But the new public remarks echo some he made in private at a recent Apple Town Hall meeting where he disparaged Adobe as " lazy . "
Now the Apple CEO says he has many technical and philosophical problems with Flash – six , to be precise – which would appear to make their differences irreconcilable .
" Flash was created during the PC era – for PCs and mice , " Jobs writes .
" Flash is a successful business for Adobe , and we can understand why they want to push it beyond PCs .
But the mobile era is about low - power devices , touch interfaces and open web standards – all areas where Flash falls short . "
The most difficult circle Jobs squares is the issue of open vs. proprietary :
He acknowledges that Apple 's products are closed but that devices and products are different than the web .
" Apple has many proprietary products , too , " Jobs writes .
" Though the operating system for the iPhone , iPod and iPad is proprietary , we strongly believe that all standards pertaining to the web should be open .
Rather than use Flash , Apple has adopted HTML5 , CSS and JavaScript –- all open standards . "
Of the notion that mobile Safari can't serve up " the full web , " Jobs ' answer is that an open video standard , H.264 , is better , while not addressing the issue of adoption and critical mass .
Tech history is littered with examples of better standards not becoming dominant .
Jobs dodges the issue with games , too : " Another Adobe claim is that Apple devices cannot play Flash games .
This is true .
Fortunately , there are over 50,000 games and entertainment titles on the App Store , and many of them are free .
There are more games and entertainment titles available for iPhone , iPod and iPad than for any other platform in the world . "
Jobs does not indicate how many Flash - based games are available on the open web .
Similarly , Jobs knocks
Flash for having security holes , taxing battery life and being out of step in a multitouch world .
The latter defect he spins as an opportunity to go with open standards rather than updating Flash itself : " Apple ’s revolutionary multitouch interface does n’t use a mouse , and there is no concept of a rollover .
Most Flash websites will need to be rewritten to support touch - based devices .
If developers need to rewrite their Flash websites , why not use modern technologies like HTML5 , CSS and JavaScript ? "
But the coup de grâce is his contention that a dependency on Adobe to keep pace with Apple platforms is fundamentally flawed .
" We know from painful experience that letting a third - party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in substandard apps and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform , " Jobs writes .
" We can not be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers . "
With this critical point Jobs addresses the contentious and until - now unexplained reason that the next development kit for the iPhone–iPod Touch–iPad product line , iPhone OS 4 , will only allow apps to be written in native , approved coding languages such as C++ and Objective C , not cross-compilers which translate code from other languages into Apple - approved ones .
That rules out , for example , content created with Adobe 's Creative Suite .
" This becomes even worse if the third party is supplying a cross- platform development tool .
The third party may not adopt enhancements from one platform unless they are available on all of their supported platforms .
Hence developers only have access to the lowest common denominator set of features , " Jobs writes .
" Again , we cannot accept an outcome where developers are blocked from using our innovations and enhancements because they are not available on our competitor ’s platforms . "
Adobe has not yet responded to Wired 's request for comment .

A few years ago , my wallet got stolen at school .
I can make a long story short , and briefly tell you what happened .
Instead of locking my purse away in a cabinet as usual , I stored it in a desk drawer that day because I had forgotten my keys at home .
During class , my cell phone could be heard ringing in the drawer , indicating that I had my valuables in there .
So , unbeknownst to me , a student helped himself .
Opened the drawer , opened my purse , and took my wallet .
Left my phone , left my camera , just took my wallet .
In my wallet was eight dollars , my license , my debit card , and my social security card ( I know Mom , I ’m not supposed to carry that with me .
Lesson learned the hard way . )
After discovering the theft , I quickly reported it to my principal , the police , and the credit card company , which informed me that $ 40 had been charged at a gas station around the corner .
The wallet was already out of the school , passed from one student to another .
An officer came to the school , and together we spoke to each student who was in my classroom .
He told them that there was a surveillance tape at the gas station that they were in the process of reviewing ( not true , ) and what the consequences were if the person did n’t come clean .
I told them that I did n’t care about the eight dollars , they could keep the cash , and I just wanted my cards back due to the hassle of replacing them .
I advised the kids to get it back , and anonymously drop the wallet somewhere where it could be found , and no charges would be pressed .
Amazingly , they did exactly what I asked .
The next morning , my wallet and all of its contents ( minus the eight dollars ) were on a table in the library .
The $ 40 charge was taken off of my credit card , and the incident was forgotten .
Over the course of the next few days , word traveled through the grapevine that one of my favorite students was the culprit .
( For as much as my kids talk about not “ snitching , ” they unknowingly snitch on each other all the time . )
Because of the relationship I had with this particular student , I was overwhelmed with conflicting emotions regarding the incident .
My first reaction was “ How could he do this to me ?
To me , of all people ! ! ”
My second reaction was , “ Well , it was my own fault .
If I had locked my purse up like I was supposed to , the temptation would n’t have been there . ”
Teachers at my school talk all the time about how our kids just ca n’t help themselves , they have been brought up by the street and will do what they need to do to get by .
And as much as I understand that , the feeling of betrayal still stays with me , almost three years later .
At what point should everything I ’ve done for that kid outweigh eight dollars ?
Clearly , I thought we were there .
And clearly , he did not .
And that hurt .
This kind of thing happens all the time .
Another teacher ’s purse got stolen , and we matched up a muddy footprint to find the thief .
My kids steal from teachers , other students , anyone .
I ’ve heard stories about a kid who broke into his best friend ’s mother ’s house and stole from her .
What ’s going on here ?
Are there no boundaries ?
If I went to one of my kids and told them that a stranger robbed me on the street , they would stand up and yell “ Oh no they did n’t !
Not from Mrs. M ! ” And it would be all I could do to keep them from going after the guy themselves .
They would hate that I had been treated so disrespectfully .
So why is it ok to do it themselves ?
The hardest part was the way the kids were so angry with me for calling the police .
They were angry with me .
Visibly so .
Very obviously so .
I seriously considered talking with them and trying to rationalize my actions , and then realized I did n’t owe them an explanation for doing what was right .
So , I ’ll ask again .
What ’s going on here ?
What would you have done if this happened to you , because I still have a hard time wrapping my head around it .
New
York chef makes cheese out of wife 's breast milk
In the world of haute cuisine , pushing the boundaries of taste has become commonplace .
But in a move that has delighted some and disgusted others , a chef has made cheese out of his wife 's breast milk .
The idea struck chef Daniel Angerer eight weeks ago after his wife gave birth and she began freezing her excess milk .
I 'll pass , thanks : Chef Daniel Angerer has put breast milk cheese dishes on his menu such as this maple caramelized pumpkin seed encrusted cheese with concord grapes
As she produced far more than she could use for their their daughter Arabella , Daniel became curious as to whether human milk could be used in the kitchen .
So he began to experiment in using it to make cheese .
He aged it for a fortnight before testing it - and was amazed at its sweet taste .
Now the unusual cheese is on sale at the chef ’s Klee Brasserie in New York .
He is using it in a range of upmarket dishes including maple caramelized pumpkin encrusted cheese with concord grapes , and cheese rolled in dehydrated porcini mushroom powder with burned onion chutney .
How to make it ... if you should ever want to
Ingredients :
4 cups mother ’s milk 1½ teaspoons yogurt ( must be active cultured yogurt ) 1/8 tablet rennet 1 teaspoon sea salt For recipe , see Daniel Angerer 's blog
Daniel said : ' Being a chef , you 're curious about anything in terms of flavour - you look out for something new and what you can do with it .
' After two weeks ageing , it was somewhat like a raw - milk cheese - it had all the flavours in there .
It tastes just like really sweet cow 's milk .
‘ It was n't like , “ Hey , this is such an amazing cheese . ”
It 's just like , “ Can you use human milk ?
Yes , you absolutely can ! ”
' Our baby has plenty of back - up mother 's milk in the freezer , so whoever wants to try it is welcome to try it as long as the supply lasts . '
He added that his ' cooking instincts are rather natural ... such as sourcing ingredients from the local market ... but this is a whole other level of “ natural ” . ’
Daniel offers a recipe for the adventurous to make their own .
It requires four cups of milk , a small amount of yogurt , rennet and a teaspoon of sea salt , which he said will yield half a pound of cheese .
The chef , who first announced the project on his blog , received responses ranging from ' gross .. who's supposed to eat this ' , to ' fabulous ' .
His supporters are now urging him to consider making breast milk butter and breast milk ice cream .

Steve Benen draws our attention to a speech given by Sarah Palin last Friday in Kentucky to an evangelical women 's group called Women of Joy , one in which she appears to deny the existence of church - state separation :
I beg you , Women of Joy , to bring light and be involved , loving America and praying for her .
Really , it is our solemn duty .
Praying for true spiritual awakening to overcome deterioration .
That is where God wants us to be .
Lest anyone try to convince you that God should be separated from the state , our Founding Fathers , they were believers .
And George Washington , he saw faith in God as basic to life .
As Greg Sargent observes , this is historical nonsense ; many of the Founders were practicing Deists who ardently believed in separating religion from the conduct of secular politics :
There was a time when this sort of thing would provoke widespread media mockery and perhaps even be seen as a potential disqualifier for the presidency .
Ah , but we live in an age where a cable - TV network is doing the presidential qualifying for us .
What was perhaps most noteworthy -- and disturbing -- about Palin 's speech , though , was how she publicly called out and thanked the " Prayer Warriors " who were out there on her side :
Palin :
Given the chaos these days , just kind of standing up and speaking out for common sense has kind of become a full - time job .
And it 's keeping me pretty busy .
And some days are kind of crazy .
And my faith , my family -- they are what keep me grounded , keep me going .
Prayer Warriors all across the country -- and I know some of you are here tonight -- your prayer shield allows me and others to go forth .
You give out strength , providing a prayer shield .
That is the only way to put one foot in front of the other , and get through some of these days with joy .
I do n't know how any politician could , or would want to do this , without knowing that there were prayer warriors out there , holding you up and seeking strength and wisdom for you .
... I am so appreciative of their efforts .
Thanks largely to the reportage of Max Blumenthal , we 've known for some time that Palin was religiously affiliated with the " Prayer Warriors , " but this is perhaps her first open public acknowledgment of it .
Who are the " Prayer Warriors " ?
Funny you should ask that : Bill Berkowitz explored that question for AlterNet :
Imagine a religious movement that makes geographic maps of where demons reside and claims among its adherents the Republican Party 's most recent vice presidential nominee and whose leaders have presided over prayer sessions ( one aimed at putting the kibosh on health - care reform ) with a host of leading GOP figures .
It 's a movement whose followers played a significant role in the battle over Proposition 8 , California 's anti-same - sex marriage initiative , and Uganda 's infamous proposed Anti-Homosexuality Law , more commonly associated with the Family , a religious network of elites drawn from the ranks of business and government throughout the world .
But the movement we 're imagining encompasses the humble and the elite alike , supporting a network of " prayer warriors ” in all 50 states , within the ranks of the U.S. military , and at the far reaches of the globe -- all guided by an entire genre of books , texts , videos and other media .
Imagine that , and you 've just dreamed up the New Apostolic Reformation , the largest religious movement you 've never heard of .
NAR 's videos , according to researcher Rachel Tabachnick , " demonstrate the taking control of communities and nations through large networks of ' prayer warriors ' whose spiritual warfare is used to expel and destroy the demons that cause societal ills .
Once the territorial demons , witches , and generational curses are removed , the ' born - again ' Christians in the videos take control of society . "
The movement 's notion of " spiritual warfare " has spread from the California suburbs to an East - Coast inner city , and has impacted policy decisions in the developing world .
Movement operatives are well - connected enough to have testified before Congress and to have received millions of dollars in government abstinence - only sex-education grants , and bizarre enough to maintain that in its prototype communities , the movement has healed AIDS , purified polluted streams and even grown huge vegetables .
Leaders in the NAR movement refer to themselves as " apostles . "
Berkowitz also reported on Palin 's ties to them :
Presidential campaign watchers got their first taste of the New Apostolic Reformation when it was revealed that Sarah Palin , while mayor of Wasilla , had been prayed over in a laying - on - of - hands by Rev. Thomas Muthee of Kenya , director of the NAR East Africa Spiritual Warfare Network , in a ceremony designed to protect Palin from witches and demons .
Muthee , it turns out , is famous in his native land for driving out of town a woman he deemed a witch , a charge that had her neighbors calling for her stoning .
Palin , according to Alaskan Apostle Mary Glazier , became part of her prayer network at the age of 24 .
You can't blame Benen for being perplexed and outraged :
[ F ] ar less amusing is the fact that Palin and others of her radical ilk reject any notion that " God should be separated from the state . "
It 's the 21st century , for crying out loud .
There are some countries that endorse Palin 's worldview and intermix God and government -- Iran , Saudi Arabia , and Afghanistan under Taliban rule come to mind -- but they 're generally not countries the United States tries to emulate .
...
Palin not only thinks the Founding Fathers opposed church - state separation -- in other words , she thinks those who came up with the idea opposed the idea -- she also suggests religious people necessarily reject the constitutional principle .
This is just astounding .
But then , he 's probably never encountered a True Believer like Sarah Palin before .
If you polled most of the " Christian nation " evangelicals , you would find a large majority of them refuse to accept church - state separation -- and truly believe that God guides their every step .
Just ask Sarah .
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. officials said they knew as far back as August 2008 that regulators were examining controversial mortgage securities created by the firm but were stunned by the bombshell civil fraud suit lodged against it Friday , with most having learned about it from news reports .
Firms typically get a chance to settle such suits , but not in this case , Goldman said .
The Wall Street giant said it was alerted to the probe in the summer of 2008 and was warned that it might face a suit in July 2009 .
It says it then responded in detail to the Securities Exchange Commission 's inquiry in September , but heard nothing back from the government until Friday 's unveiling of the civil suit .
The SEC usually notifies firms ahead of a lawsuit as a courtesy to give them a chance for a last - ditch settlement or to prepare for the public fallout .
The move showed a combative streak from the SEC , which has been under mounting pressure after letting slip through its fingers early probes into the Ponzi scheme of Bernard Madoff and the alleged fraud of Texas financier R. Allen Stanford .
The case , SEC v. Goldman Sachs & Co. and Fabrice Tourre , sets the stage for what could become the signature lawsuit from the financial - crisis era .
It comes at a time when the Obama administration is trying to move through Congress a bill to overhaul financial regulations in the wake of the crisis — legislation that would likely affect the regulation of products used in the Goldman deal .
Lawsuits by the SEC are subject to a vote by the agency 's five commissioners , and the tally on the Goldman case will be closely watched in Washington , as the current commission is split along party lines — with two Republicans and two Democrats , plus one independent who was appointed by President Obama .
I just went to brush my teeth but we were out of toothpaste so I pulled out this tiny little travel tube that the stewardess gave me when I went to Japan and it ’s the size of a hamster femur so I squeezed it all out onto the toothbrush and then I started to feel really sorry for the people who live in Japan because that shit is awful .
Then it got worse and worse and it started making my mouth all dry and sticky and when I tried to spit it out it was sticking to my teeth and and I wondered if maybe toothpaste can go bad in Japan so I looked at the tube to see if it had an expiration date and that ’s when I realized that I had just brushed my teeth with FUCKING EYELASH GLUE .
No shit , people .
Like , the glue you use to keep fake eyelashes on .
And then I panicked because I was afraid that I was going to die or that my teeth were going to get glued together and so I opened my mouth as wide as it would go and looked on the internet for “ Will eating eyelash glue kill you ? ” and the internet was all “ Um…maybe ? ” so I went on twitter and asked them and everyone was like “ This is twitter , dude .
Not poison control .
What the fuck is wrong with you ? ” and they had a point but I did n’t want to call poison control , both because I ’d have to explain that I just ate eyelash glue and also because I did n’t know if I could talk on the phone without accidentally closing my mouth and then I started to worry that if I went to sleep I might wake up dead or with my teeth permanently glued together and then I ’d have to pretend that I somehow caught contagious lockjaw because there ’s no way in hell that I was going to confess to Victor that I ’d accidentally brushed my teeth with glue .
So then I called the ASPCA because they were very helpful a few months ago when Barnaby Jones Pickles ate that bottle of homeopathic cold meds but they told me that they did n’t give medical advice to humans and I told them that that seemed vaguely racist and they insisted that I call poison control .
So I did .
And they were dicks .
I mean , technically they were very nice but I had to explain the problem like three times before they finally seemed to understand the situation and then they assured me that eyelash glue was non-toxic and that I ’d be fine but they kept asking me why I ’d done it and every time I ’d explain they ’d say that they did n’t understand and I assumed they were making a tape of all of this to play to their friends later or possibly they honestly just could n’t understand what I was saying since I was n’t using my lips so that they would n’t get glued to my teeth .
I tried to explain that to them but there was a lot of silence on their end so I finally just hung up .
It ’s bad enough I just ate a bunch of glue , poison control .
I do n’t need your damn judgement .
PS .
I just woke Victor up to tell him what happened so that he could check to make sure I ’m still breathing every few hours and Victor rolled over and said something about how I brought this on myself because “ who the fuck confuses glue with toothpaste ? ”
Well , obviously * I* do , Victor .
Way to blame the victim , asshole .
PPS .
For real y’all .
They look EXACTLY ALIKE .
ANYONE COULD MAKE THIS MISTAKE .
PPPS .
This post is probably full of typos and run-on sentences and I ’m sorry about that but I JUST GOT FUCKING POISONED , Y’ALL .
It ’s kind of heroic that I ’m even able to write this post at all , you guys .
If anything , I deserve a goddam medal .
Comment of the day : You ’re right .
Medical professionals are often nosy and judgmental .
I almost cut my hand off with a skilsaw one time ( severed 3 tendons ) , and after the surgeon assessed the damage , he was like , “ and what ’s with this ? ” as he motioned toward his own eye .
I was like , “ With what ?
What the fuck is this ? ” motioning toward my own eye .
“ The black eye , ” he says .
I forgot that I had gotten a black eye a couple days earlier when my dog headbutted me while we were wrestling .
I explained and he gave me that look that says , “ I know your game , you goddamn shiftless tweaker .
You ’ll do anything to get on disability , wo n’t you ?
Well , you ’re not gonna get away with it this time , buddy boy . ”
But I totally did .

In this must watch Real News Network interview with William Black , the outspoken critic of all that is wrong and broken with the current system spares no words to once again denounce the ( purposeful ) ineffectiveness of the administration , and rightfully predicts that with Obama 's current track record of inactivity in dealing with the corruption and criminality at the nexus of finance and politics , there will be a massive loss for Democrats at the upcoming mid-term elections .
In Black 's words : " We knew as soon as we saw Summers and Geithner that the finance side of the administration would be a disaster , but we hoped that political side would be preeminent and say a ) this is substantively wrong to continue get in bed with finance and b ) it 's terrible politics .
The democratic party will be crushed if it does this .
The political side has failed to get involved .
This is one of those rare things where doing the right thing is really good politics , so support candidates that will actually do the right thing .
And if the Obama administration continues this way , it 's going to have a record disaster at the mid-term elections .
There 's going to be a massive loss of democratic seats . "
Everyone should ask themselves the same rhetorical question that forms the basis of Black 's conclusion : " What would it take if the greatest economic catastrophe in 80 years , if an epidemic of fraud by your top elites , if the corruption of your most senior professionals , in accounting , law , appraisal , rating agencies , is n't enough to make you fundamentally reconsider and say we are headed along a disastrous path .
What will it take , because the next big one will be even worse . "

Meditation is often credited with helping people feel more focused and energetic , but are the benefits measurable ?
A new study suggests that they are .
When researchers tested the alertness of volunteers , they found that the practice proved more effective than naps , exercise or caffeine .
The results were presented at a recent conference of the Society for Neuroscience .
The researchers , led by Prashant Kaul of the University of Kentucky , took 12 students who did not meditate and taught them the basics in two short sessions .

Then , over a series of weeks , the students were asked to come in and take a test devised to measure skills like reaction time .
The tests involved a series of visual cues on a display screen that the volunteers had to react to by pushing the correct button .
Over the past several years , when he complained again and again about American attacks in his country that were killing civilians in surprising numbers and remarkably often , he was generally humored and dealt with as an irrelevance or an annoyance .
Now , given the rampant drug trade , the corruption , the " tantrums , " the emotional outbursts , the threats to join the Taliban , and his embracing of the Iranians and the Chinese , he is dealt with in Washington as a cross between a big baby , an unstable adult , an overemotional drug - taker , and a prime danger to the American project in Afghanistan .
He was given a lot of TLC by the previous resident of the White House , while being studiously ignored or reproved by this one .
American officials have lavished praise -- and scorn -- on him .
They have brandished hard power -- and laid on the soft power -- to tame him .
They have regularly tried “ new tacks ” in dealing with him , and then tacked -- and tacked again .
I ’m talking , of course , about Hamid Karzai , the American - installed president of Afghanistan , our man in Kabul , as Alfred McCoy so aptly dubs him .
He ’s our boy , our nemesis , the definition of our problem in Afghanistan , our worst mistake , and our missing conscience all wrapped in one .
McCoy , a historian at the University of Wisconsin and an expert on the Vietnam War , the CIA , and the drug trade , offers a powerful reminder that we ’ve been here before .
And he ’s not the only one who knows it .
After all , Richard Holbrooke , the president ’s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , spent his first six years in government service in , or focused on , Vietnam during the war years .
And as the Obama administration was setting its Afghan course in the fall of 2009 , a number of key figures in the White House , including the president , took time out to study Gordon Goldstein ’s book , Lessons in Disaster : McGeorge Bundy and the Path to War in Vietnam , which recounts , among other things , the grim tale of Ngo Dinh Diem , the Hamid Karzai of that moment , and the CIA plot that led to his overthrow and assassination , as well as a wider , more disastrous war for the U.S .
As McCoy makes clear , however , the history lesson in all this goes deeper than Karzai and Diem , despite the unbelievably eerie parallels between them .
As that old Seinfeld break - up line goes :
It ’s not you , it ’s me .
And whatever Karzai ’s problems are , it ’s not , in the end , him , it ’s us .
It ’s a problem that goes to the riven imperial heart of the matter .

The crisis has come suddenly , almost without warning .
At the far edge of American power in Asia , things are going from bad to much worse than anyone could have imagined .
The insurgents are spreading fast across the countryside .
Corruption is rampant .
Local military forces , recipients of countless millions of dollars in U.S. aid , shirk combat and are despised by local villagers .
American casualties are rising .
Our soldiers seem to move in a fog through a hostile , unfamiliar terrain , with no idea of who is friend and who is foe .
After years of lavishing American aid on him , the leader of this country , our close ally , has isolated himself inside the presidential palace , becoming an inadequate partner for a failing war effort .
His brother is reportedly a genuine prince of darkness , dealing in drugs , covert intrigues , and electoral manipulation .
The U.S. Embassy demands reform , the ouster of his brother , the appointment of honest local officials , something , anything that will demonstrate even a scintilla of progress .
After all , nine years earlier U.S. envoys had taken a huge gamble : rescuing this president from exile and political obscurity , installing him in the palace , and ousting a legitimate monarch whose family had ruled the country for centuries .
Now , he repays this political debt by taunting America .
He insists on untrammeled sovereignty and threatens to ally with our enemies if we continue to demand reforms of him .
Yet Washington is so deeply identified with the counterinsurgency campaign in his country that walking away no longer seems like an option .
This scenario is obviously a description of the Obama administration ’s devolving relations with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in Kabul this April .
It is also an eerie summary of relations between the Kennedy administration and South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem in Saigon nearly half a century earlier , in August 1963 .
If these parallels are troubling , they reveal the central paradox of American power over the past half - century in its dealings with embattled autocrats like Karzai and Diem across that vast , impoverished swath of the globe once known as the Third World .

With his volatile mix of dependence and independence , Hamid Karzai seems the archetype of all the autocrats Washington has backed in Asia , Africa , and Latin America since European empires began disintegrating after World War II .
When the CIA mobilized Afghan warlords to topple the Taliban in October 2001 , the country ’s capital , Kabul , was ours for the taking -- and the giving .
In the midst of this chaos , Hamid Karzai , an obscure exile living in Pakistan , gathered a handful of followers and plunged into Afghanistan on a doomed CIA - supported mission to rally the tribes for revolt .
It proved a quixotic effort that required rescue by Navy SEALs who snatched him back to safety in Pakistan .
Desperate for a reliable post - invasion ally , the Bush administration engaged in what one expert has called “ bribes , secret deals , and arm twisting ” to install Karzai in power .
This process took place not through a democratic election in Kabul , but by lobbying foreign diplomats at a donors ’ conference in Bonn , Germany , to appoint him interim president .
When King Zahir Shah , a respected figure whose family had ruled Afghanistan for more than 200 years , returned to offer his services as acting head of state , the U.S. ambassador had a “ showdown ” with the monarch , forcing him back into exile .
In this way , Karzai ’s “ authority , ” which came directly and almost solely from the Bush administration , remained unchecked .
For his first months in office , the president had so little trust in his nominal Afghan allies that he was guarded by American security .
In the years that followed , the Karzai regime slid into an ever deepening state of corruption and incompetence , while NATO allies rushed to fill the void with their manpower and material , a de facto endorsement of the president ’s low road to power .
As billions in international development aid poured into Kabul , a mere trickle escaped the capital ’s bottomless bureaucracy to reach impoverished villages in the countryside .
In 2009 , Transparency International ranked Afghanistan as the world ’s second most corrupt nation , just a notch below Somalia .
As opium production soared from 185 tons in 2001 to 8,200 tons just six years later -- a remarkable 53 % of the country ’s entire economy -- drug corruption metastasized , reaching provincial governors , the police , cabinet ministers , and the president ’s own brother , also his close adviser .
Indeed , as a senior U.S. antinarcotics official assigned to Afghanistan described the situation in 2006 , “ Narco corruption went to the very top of the Afghan government . ”
Earlier this year , the U.N. estimated that ordinary Afghans spend $ 2.5 billion annually , a quarter of the country ’s gross domestic product , simply to bribe the police and government officials .
Last August ’s presidential elections were an apt index of the country ’s progress .
Karzai ’s campaign team , the so - called warlord ticket , included Abdul Dostum , an Uzbek warlord who slaughtered countless prisoners in 2001 ; vice presidential candidate Muhammed Fahim , a former defense minister linked to drugs and human rights abuses ;
Sher Muhammed Akhundzada , the former governor of Helmand Province , who was caught with nine tons of drugs in his compound back in 2005 ; and the president ’s brother Ahmed Wali Karzai , reputedly the reigning drug lord and family fixer in Kandahar .
“ The Karzai family has opium and blood on their hands , ” one Western intelligence official told the New York Times during the campaign .
Desperate to capture an outright 50 % majority in the first round of balloting , Karzai ’s warlord coalition made use of an extraordinary array of electoral chicanery .
After two months of counting and checking , the U.N. ’s Electoral Complaints Commission announced in October 2009 that more than a million of his votes , 28 % of his total , were fraudulent , pushing the president ’s tally well below the winning margin .
Calling the election a “ foreseeable train wreck , ” the deputy U.N. envoy Peter Galbraith said , “ The fraud has handed the Taliban its greatest strategic victory in eight years of fighting the United States and its Afghan partners . "
Galbraith , however , was sacked and silenced as U.S. pressure extinguished the simmering flames of electoral protest .
The runner - up soon withdrew from the run-off election that Washington had favored as a face - saving , post - fraud compromise , and Karzai was declared the outright winner by default .
In the wake of the farcical election , Karzai not surprisingly tried to stack the five - man Electoral Complaints Commission , an independent body meant to vet electoral complaints , replacing the three foreign experts with his own Afghan appointees .
When the parliament rejected his proposal , Karzai lashed out with bizarre charges , accusing the U.N. of wanting a “ puppet government ” and blaming all the electoral fraud on “ massive interference from foreigners . ”
In a meeting with members of parliament , he reportedly told them : “ If you and the international community pressure me more , I swear that I am going to join the Taliban . ”
Amid this tempest in an electoral teapot , as American reinforcements poured into Afghanistan , Washington ’s escalating pressure for “ reform ” only served to inflame Karzai .
As Air Force
One headed for Kabul on March 28th , National Security Adviser James Jones bluntly told reporters aboard that , in his meeting with Karzai , President Obama would insist that he prioritize “ battling corruption , taking the fight to the narco - traffickers . ”
It was time for the new administration in Washington , ever more deeply committed to its escalating counterinsurgency war in Afghanistan , to bring our man in Kabul back into line .
A week filled with inflammatory , angry outbursts from Karzai followed before the White House changed tack , concluding that it had no alternative to Karzai and began to retreat .
Jones now began telling reporters soothingly that , during his visit to Kabul , President Obama had been “ generally impressed with the quality of the [ Afghan ] ministers and the seriousness with which they ’re approaching their job . ”
All of this might have seemed so new and bewildering in the American experience , if it were n’t actually so old .
Our Man in Saigon
The sorry history of the autocratic regime of Ngo Dinh Diem in Saigon ( 1954 - 1963 ) offers an earlier cautionary roadmap that helps explain why Washington has so often found itself in such an impossibly contradictory position with its authoritarian allies .
Landing in Saigon in mid-1954 after years of exile in the United States and Europe , Diem had no real political base .
He could , however , count on powerful patrons in Washington , notably Democratic senators Mike Mansfield and John F. Kennedy .
One of the few people to greet Diem at the airport that day was the legendary CIA operative Edward Lansdale , Washington ’s master of political manipulation in Southeast Asia .
Amid the chaos accompanying France ’s defeat in its long , bloody Indochina War , Lansdale maneuvered brilliantly to secure Diem ’s tenuous hold on power in the southern part of Vietnam .
In the meantime , U.S. diplomats sent his rival , the Emperor Bao Dai , packing for Paris .
Within months , thanks to Washington ’s backing , Diem won an absurd 98.2 % of a rigged vote for the presidency and promptly promulgated a new constitution that ended the Vietnamese monarchy after a millennium .
Channeling all aid payments through Diem , Washington managed to destroy the last vestiges of French colonial support for any of his potential rivals in the south , while winning the president a narrow political base within the army , among civil servants , and in the minority Catholic community .
Backed by a seeming cornucopia of American support , Diem proceeded to deal harshly with South Vietnam ’s Buddhist sects , harassed the Viet Minh veterans of the war against the French , and resisted the implementation of rural reforms that might have won him broader support among the country ’s peasant population .
When the U.S. Embassy pressed for reforms , he simply stalled , convinced that Washington , having already invested so much of its prestige in his regime , would be unable to withhold support .
Like Karzai in Kabul , Diem 's ultimate weapon was his weakness -- the threat that his government , shaky as it was , might simply collapse if pushed too hard .
In the end , the Americans invariably backed down , sacrificing any hope of real change in order to maintain the ongoing war effort against the local Viet Cong rebels and their North Vietnamese backers .
As rebellion and dissent rose in the south , Washington ratcheted up its military aid to battle the communists , inadvertently giving Diem more weapons to wield against his own people , communist and non-communist alike .
Working through his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu -- and this should have an eerie resonance today -- the Diems took control of Saigon ’s drug racket , pocketing significant profits as they built up a nexus of secret police , prisons , and concentration camps to deal with suspected dissidents .
At the time of Diem 's downfall in 1963 , there were some 50,000 prisoners in his gulag .
Nonetheless , from 1960 to 1963 , the regime only weakened as resistance sparked repression and repression redoubled resistance .
Soon South Vietnam was wracked by Buddhist riots in the cities and a spreading Communist revolution in the countryside .
Moving after dark , Viet Cong guerrillas slowly began to encircle Saigon , assassinating Diem ’s unpopular village headmen by the thousands .
In this three - year period , the US military mission in Saigon tried every conceivable counterinsurgency strategy .
They brought in helicopters and armored vehicles to improve conventional mobility , deployed the Green Berets for unconventional combat , built up regional militias for localized security , constructed “ strategic hamlets ” in order to isolate eight million peasants inside supposedly secure fortified compounds , and ratcheted up CIA assassinations of suspected Viet Cong leaders .
Nothing worked .
Even the best military strategy could not fix the underlying political problem .
By 1963 , the Viet Cong had grown from a handful of fighters into a guerrilla army that controlled more than half the countryside .
When protesting Buddhist monk Quang Duc assumed the lotus position on a Saigon street in June 1963 and held the posture while followers lit his gasoline - soaked robes which erupted in fatal flames , the Kennedy administration could no longer ignore the crisis .
As Diem ’s batons cracked the heads of Buddhist demonstrators and Nhu ’s wife applauded what she called “ monk barbecues , ” Washington began to officially protest the ruthless repression .
Instead of responding , Diem ( shades of Karzai ) began working through his brother Nhu to open negotiations with the communists in Hanoi , signaling Washington that he was perfectly willing to betray the U.S. war effort and possibly form a coalition with North Vietnam .
In the midst of this crisis , a newly appointed American ambassador , Henry Cabot Lodge , arrived in Saigon and within days approved a plan for a CIA - backed coup to overthrow Diem .
For the next few months , Lansdale ’s CIA understudy Lucien Conein met regularly with Saigon ’s generals to hatch an elaborate plot that was unleashed with devastating effect on November 1 , 1963 .
As rebel troops stormed the palace , Diem and his brother Nhu fled to a safe house in Saigon ’s Chinatown .
Flushed from hiding by promises of safe conduct into exile , Diem climbed aboard a military convoy for what he thought was a ride to the airport .
But CIA operative Conein had vetoed the flight plans .
A military assassin intercepted the convoy , spraying Diem ’s body with bullets and stabbing his bleeding corpse in a coup de grâce .
Although Ambassador Lodge hosted an embassy celebration for the rebel officers and cabled President Kennedy that Diem 's death would mean a " shorter war , ” the country soon collapsed into a series of military coups and counter - coups that crippled army operations .
Over the next 32 months , Saigon had nine new governments and a change of cabinet every 15 weeks -- all incompetent , corrupt , and ineffective .
After spending a decade building up Diem 's regime and a day destroying it , the U.S. had seemingly irrevocably linked its own power and prestige to the Saigon government -- any government .
The “ best and brightest ” in Washington were convinced that they could not just withdraw from South Vietnam without striking a devastating blow against American “ credibility . ”
As South Vietnam slid toward defeat in the two years following Diem ’s death , the first of 540,000 U.S. combat troops began arriving , ensuring that Vietnam would be transformed from an American - backed war into an American war .
Under the circumstances , Washington searched desperately for anyone who could provide sufficient stability to prosecute the war against the communists and eventually , with palpable relief , embraced a military junta headed by General Nguyen Van Thieu .
Installed and sustained in power by American aid , Thieu had no popular following and ruled through military repression , repeating the same mistakes that led to Diem ’s downfall .
But chastened by its experience after the assassination of Diem , the U.S. Embassy decided to ignore
Thieu ’s unpopularity and continue to build his army .
Once Washington began to reduce its aid after 1973 , Thieu found that his troops simply would not fight to defend his unpopular government .
In April 1975 , he carried a hoard of stolen gold into exile while his army collapsed with stunning speed , suffering one of the most devastating collapses in military history .
In pursuit of its Vietnam War effort , Washington required a Saigon government responsive to its demands , yet popular with its own peasantry , strong enough to wage a war in the villages , yet sensitive to the needs of the country ’s poor villagers .
These were hopelessly contradictory political requisites .
Finding that civilian regimes engaged in impossible - to - control intrigues , the U.S. ultimately settled for authoritarian military rule which , acceptable as it proved in Washington , was disdained by the Vietnamese peasantry .
Death or Exile ?
So is President Karzai , like Diem , doomed to die on the streets of Kabul or will he , one day , find himself like Thieu boarding a midnight flight into exile ?
History , or at least our awareness of its lessons , does change things , albeit in complex , unpredictable ways .
Today , senior U.S. envoys have Diem ’s cautionary tale encoded in their diplomatic DNA , which undoubtedly precludes any literal replay of his fate .
After sanctioning Diem ’s assassination , Washington watched in dismay as South Vietnam plunged into chaos .
So chastened was the U.S. Embassy by this dismal outcome that it backed the subsequent military regime to a fault .
A decade later , the Senate ’s Church Committee uncovered other U.S. attempts at assassination - cum - regime - change in the Congo , Chile , Cuba , and the Dominican Republic that further stigmatized this option .
In effect , antibodies from the disastrous CIA coup against Diem , still in Washington ’s political bloodstream , reduce the possibility of any similar move against Karzai today .
Ironically , those who seek to avoid the past may be doomed to repeat it .
By accepting Karzai ’s massive electoral fraud and refusing to consider alternatives last August , Washington has , like it or not , put its stamp of approval on his spreading corruption and the political instability that accompanies it .
In this way , the Obama administration in its early days invited a sad denouement to its Afghan adventure , one potentially akin to Vietnam after Diem ’s death .
America ’s representatives in Kabul are once again hurtling down history ’s highway , eyes fixed on the rear - view mirror , not the precipice that lies dead ahead .
In the experiences of both Ngo Dinh Diem and Hamid Karzai lurks a self - defeating pattern common to Washington 's alliances with dictators throughout the Third World , then and now .
Selected and often installed in office by Washington , or at least backed by massive American military aid , these client figures become desperately dependent , even as they fail to implement the sorts of reforms that might enable them to build an independent political base .
Torn between pleasing their foreign patrons or their own people , they wind up pleasing neither .
As opposition to their rule grows , a downward spiral of repression and corruption often ends in collapse ; while , for all its power , Washington descends into frustration and despair , unable to force its allies to adopt reforms which might allow them to survive .
Such a collapse is a major crisis for the White House , but often -- Diem ’s case is obviously an exception -- little more than an airplane ride into exile for the local autocrat or dictator .
There was -- and is -- a fundamental structural flaw in any American alliance with these autocrats .
Inherent in these unequal alliances is a peculiar dynamic that makes the eventual collapse of such American - anointed leaders almost inevitable .
At the outset , Washington selects a client who seems pliant enough to do its bidding .
Such a client , in turn , opts for Washington ’s support not because he is strong , but precisely because he needs foreign patronage to gain and hold office .
Once installed , the client , no matter how reluctant , has little choice but to make Washington ’s demands his top priority , investing his slender political resources in placating foreign envoys .
Responding to an American political agenda on civil and military matters , these autocrats often fail to devote sufficient energy , attention , and resources to cultivating a following ; Diem found himself isolated in his Saigon palace , while Karzai has become a “ president ” justly , if derisively , nicknamed “ the mayor of Kabul . ”
Caught between the demands of a powerful foreign patron and countervailing local needs and desires , both leaders let guerrillas capture the countryside , while struggling uncomfortably , and in the end angrily , as well as resentfully , in the foreign embrace .
Nor are such parallels limited to Afghanistan today or Vietnam almost half a century ago .
Since the end of World War II , many of the sharpest crises in U.S. foreign policy have arisen from just such problematic relationships with authoritarian client regimes .
As a start , it was a similarly close relationship with General Fulgencio Batista of Cuba in the 1950s which inspired the Cuban revolution .
That culminated , of course , in Fidel Castro 's rebels capturing the Cuban capital , Havana , in 1959 , which in turn led the Kennedy administration into the catastrophic Bay of Pigs invasion and then the Cuban Missile Crisis .
For a full quarter - century , the U.S. played international patron to the Shah of Iran , intervening to save his regime from the threat of democracy in the early 1950s and later massively arming his police and military while making him Washington ’s proxy power in the Persian Gulf .
His fall in the Islamic revolution of 1979 not only removed the cornerstone of American power in this strategic region , but plunged Washington into a succession of foreign policy confrontations with Iran that have yet to end .
After a half - century as a similarly loyal client in Central America , the regime of Nicaragua ’s Anastasio Somoza fell in the Sandinista revolution of 1979 , creating a foreign policy problem marked by the CIA 's contra operation against the new Sandinista government and the seamy Iran - Contra scandal that roiled President Reagan ’s second term .
Just last week , Washington ’s anointed autocrat in Kyrgyzstan , Kurmanbek Bakiyev , fled the presidential palace when his riot police , despite firing live ammunition and killing more than 80 of his citizens , failed to stop opposition protesters from taking control of the capital , Bishkek .
Although his rule was brutal and corrupt , last year the Obama administration courted Bakiyev sedulously and successfully to preserve U.S. use of the old Soviet air base at Manas critical for supply flights into Afghanistan .
Even as riot police were beating the opposition into submission to prepare for Bakiyev ’s “ landslide victory ” in last July ’s elections , President Obama sent him a personal letter praising his support for the Afghan war .
With Washington ’s imprimatur , there was nothing to stop Bakiyev ’s political slide into murderous repression and his ultimate fall from power .
Why have so many American alliances with Third World dictators collapsed in such a spectacular fashion , producing divisive recriminations at home and policy disasters abroad ?
During Britain 's century of dominion , its self - confident servants of empire , from viceroys in plumed hats to district officers in khaki shorts , ruled much of Africa and Asia through an imperial system of protectorates , indirect rule , and direct colonial rule .
In the succeeding American “ half century ” of hegemony , Washington carried the burden of global power without a formal colonial system , substituting its military advisers for imperial viceroys .
In this new landscape of sovereign states that emerged after World War II , Washington has had to pursue a contradictory policy as it dealt with the leaders of nominally independent nations that were also deeply dependent on foreign economic and military aid .
After identifying its own prestige with these fragile regimes , Washington usually tries to coax , chide , or threaten its allies into embracing what it considers needed reforms .
Even when this counsel fails and prudence might dictate the start of a staged withdrawal , as in Saigon in 1963 and Kabul today , American envoys simply cannot let go of their unrepentant , resentful allies , as the long slide into disaster gains momentum .
With few choices between diplomatic niceties and a destabilizing coup , Washington invariably ends up defaulting to an inflexible foreign policy at the edge of paralysis that often ends with the collapse of our authoritarian allies , whether Diem in Saigon , the Shah in Tehran , or on some dismal day yet to come , Hamid Karzai in Kabul .
To avoid this impending debacle , our only realistic option in Afghanistan today may well be the one we wish we had taken in Saigon back in August 1963 -- a staged withdrawal of U.S. forces .

Microsoft today released the Windows Internet Explorer Platform Preview to the public .
The release is meant to demonstrate the capabilities of Internet Explorer 9 to Web developers while at the same time providing feedback to the IE9 team .
Microsoft says it is committed to updating the Platform Preview to keep a more effective rhythm for discussion , and it will be updated every eight weeks or so .
Microsoft will share feedback with standards - setting bodies in addition to using it for internal development .
The Platform Preview is a minimal wrapper : it 's not a full - fledged browser .
It has no tabs .
It has no address bar .
It has no back button .
So what is included ?
Everything that Web developers need to see : the rendering engine , of course , as well as the new JavaScript engine , hardware acceleration features , and the developer tools .
The IE9 team told Ars that each update will use one of the latest internal engineering builds , at which point the feedback loop will start again .
In short , Microsoft has found an alternative to having nightly builds , answering a long - standing criticism of its development process .
Microsoft believes its solution is better , as it does n't have the hitches that come with nightly builds .
We asked Microsoft why it chose eight weeks as the update period .
" We found that eight weeks is the minimum amount of time for the feedback period to work and actually resolve issues , " Dean Hachamovitch , general manager of IE told Ars .
Regardless of whether updates every eight weeks will be frequent enough , it is certainly an improvement over the IE team 's previous stance of releasing one or two betas and one or two RCs over the space of many months .
In addition to the rendering engine , the Platform Preview has a start page where Microsoft showcases five Speed Demos , five HTML5 demos , and five Graphics Demos .
Naturally they all work better , or at least as well , in IE9 as in any other browser ; Microsoft is n't going to show off tests where its browser is n't as good as the competition .
We were impressed with what Microsoft had to show off ( we saw 28 tests in total , not 15 ) , but there is still room for improvement .
Microsoft agrees , which is why it is being a little more open about feedback and frequency of updates .
HTML5
" We love HTML5 so much that we want to do it right , " Hachamovitch told Ars.
Microsoft is putting a huge emphasis on HTML5 with IE9 , but its approach is still very strict .
Since HTML5 is not complete , and likely wo n't be anytime soon , the IE9 team is being very careful about which features it implements .
Other browser makers are n't concerned about implementing a part of HTML5 one way in one version , then changing it in a subsequent version , and then changing it again ...
Redmond , on the other hand , is taking the same approach with IE9 as it did with IE8 : support the current Web while pushing the new Web forward , according to Rob Mauceri , Principal Group Program Manager of IE .
" Our approach to it is , let 's really get the standard right , " Mauceri told Ars .
He admitted , however , that standards change and that it is quite likely there will be parts of HTML5 that change even after IE9 is released .
As you can see in the screenshot above , the IE9 team has made ( some ) progress in the Acid3 test .
IE8 scores 20/100 on the test , and the IE9 build demonstrated at PDC scored 32/100 , so given that the IE9 build from MIX10 is at 55/100 , we can see Microsoft is certainly taking standards a lot more seriously .
The company 's stance on the test , however , has not changed .
Microsoft refuses to simply give in and implement everything the test requires to pass ; the company continues to downplay the test as it barely encompasses HTML5 but instead tests some technologies that are still in the " working draft " stage of standardization , including many edge cases and error conditions .
While Microsoft has no plans to score 100/100 , it is not ignoring the test ; instead , the company is focusing on what it believes developers actually want supported .
" As we support more of the markup , our Acid3 score will go up , " Hachamovitch told Ars .
Microsoft 's stance is debatable .
The Acid3 test , even if not that useful , is nonetheless influential .
IE 's continued mediocre score creates the perception that the browser is far behind its competitors , and will likely do little to lessen Web developers ' dislike for the browser .
It 's also another barrier to convincing the world Microsoft truly cares about standards .
We did see one cool HTML5 feature we were n't expecting : IE9 working using YouTube 's implementation of the HTML5 video element .
This actually required a little tinkering on the part of the IE9 team , since the YouTube HTML5 Video Player has no support for browsers other than Chrome or Safari .
Even so , it worked brilliantly .
Microsoft admitted there is still a little work to do in this area , however , so today 's release of the Platform Preview wo n't work with YouTube HTML5 , but the software giant promised a later build will .
SVG
Speaking of implementing more features in later builds , let 's take a look at Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG ) , an XML - based file format for describing static and dynamic 2D vector graphics .
The 800 - page standard has been in development by W3C since 1999 , but only earlier this year did Microsoft join W3 C's SVG working group and promise to collaborate on future versions of the standard .
Now , the company is getting a little more specific about what it 's going to support in IE9 :
Functionality Platform Preview Internet Explorer 9 Document Structure Partial Yes Basic Shapes Yes Yes Paths Yes Yes Text Partial Yes Transforms Partial Yes Painting Filling Color Partial Yes Scripting Styling Partial Yes Gradients and Patterns Partial Yes Clipping and Masking No Yes Markers and Symbols No Yes Filter Effects No No Declarative Animation No No SVG Fonts No No
As you can see , only Basic Shapes and Paths are done today .
Microsoft is promising to have a lot more done for the IE9 release , and while it has started most of those , it has n't begun work on a few of them .
Microsoft is not expecting to implement the last three in IE9 at all .
The " Yes " in the IE9 column means that 95 to 100 percent of the implementation will be done , according to Microsoft .
What Web developers have to know about the Platform Preview today is that SVG available on the Web will simply not look right , but Microsoft is promising to finish it to a point where it works .
When asked about SVG Fonts , which some other browsers implement , Microsoft answered that TrueType fonts work better , and so the company does not see it as a priority since there really is no need for yet another way to do fonts in SVG .
SVG
Fonts are very sophisticated in terms of API , but not very important in terms of uses out there , in Microsoft 's eyes .
Microsoft cited the number of image editors and applications that currently have the option to output as SVG as one of the many reasons it decided to back the specification with IE9 .
The company also showed off how the included Developer Tools let you edit SVG just like editing HTML .
That means developers can very easily debug problems with SVG .
" A lot of sites are sniffing for IE and rendering their content as Vector Markup Language ( VML ) , " Patrick Dengler , Senior Program Manager of IE , explained .
" We want them to stop doing that and start rendering as SVG . "
Development of the VML format ceased in 1998 , but it 's included in IE5 and higher .
Microsoft even released a VML to SVG Migration Guide ( 880 KB ) today to help developers .
As a result , many websites do n't bother to check for the version of IE , and simply tell all versions not to render the SVG , something that will have to change with IE9 .
For example , Google Maps currently uses VML for vector paths when it detects IE and SVG for all other browsers .
The laptops are designed for use by children in the developing world
The UN in the Gaza Strip has begun distributing thousands of laptop computers to children in its schools .
The rugged laptops are made by the non-profit organisation One Laptop Per Child , which aims to give a computer to every child in the developing world .
One Laptop Per Child say computers are a good way of improving the education of children living in poverty .
Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated in the Gaza Strip in the last three years , the UN says .
Israel and Egypt maintain a blockade on Gaza , which was tightened in 2007 after Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip , and all but humanitarian supplies are prevented from entering .
Unrwa , the UN agency for refugees , began distributing 2,100 laptops on Thursday in Rafah , a town in the south of the strip .
This is part of a wider ambitions to distribute 500,000 laptops to children in Gaza by 2012 .
Connected
One Laptop Per Child has built the energy efficient XO laptop especially for children in developing countries .
" The XO laptop has a special place in children 's education in regions that are disrupted by ongoing violence , " said Nicholas Negroponte , founder of the organisation .
" With the XO the children can continue to stay connected and gain the skills and knowledge required to participate fully and thrive in the 21st century - even when getting to school is impossible . "
The UN agency which looks after Palestinian refugees , UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) provides housing , health services , education and emergency food supplies to more than four million refugees in five countries .
The computers are to be loaded with textbooks and teaching aids that cover the primary school curriculum , a statement from UNWRA said .

It would be " preposterous " for Labour to have its leader remain in Number 10 if it came third in terms of votes , says Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg .
He told the BBC it was " potty " Labour could get fewer votes than their rivals but still try to form a government .
His comments come as four opinion polls point to a hung parliament .
Tory leader David Cameron said that would lead to " bickering " .
Gordon Brown said he would not " assume an outcome " but " accept the people 's verdict " .
A hung parliament is one in which no party has an overall majority - that is , more than half of the MPs in the House of Commons .
A party can stay in power by trying to forge an alliance with a smaller party to create a coalition government or the biggest party may form a minority government and try to form majorities over individual bills .
Up until today Nick Clegg has been very very careful to stick to a carefully drawn - up formula about how the Liberal Democrats would react to a hung parliament
Nick Robinson , BBC political editor
Nick Robinson 's Newslog Read more opinions on a coalition
In such a scenario , the existing prime minister remains in power until he or she resigns , and may try to stay on even if his or her party does not win the largest number of seats .
Sunday 's opinion polls all suggested the Conservatives would win the most seats but still fall short of a majority .
Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show , Mr Clegg referred to the fact that three of the polls also indicated Labour might poll fewer votes than the Lib Dems yet still secure more seats .
He said : " It is just preposterous the idea that if a party comes third in the number of votes , it still has somehow the right to carry on squatting in No 10 .
" A party which has come third - and so millions of people have decided to abandon them - has lost the election spectacularly ( and ) cannot then lay claim to providing the prime minister of this country . "
In Sunday 's other developments : Senior Scottish figures from the main political parties have clashed on the economy in a live television debate also touching on issues such as jobs , banking and the future of public spending
Gordon Brown has urged his party to " fight for fairness , " attacking the Conservatives over reports of plans to introduce " top - up fees " for nurseries
David Cameron has told parents he will give them powers to set up " great schools " for their children , if his Conservatives are elected
Mr Clegg defended his party 's policy of offering an amnesty for long - term illegal immigrants as a " one - off solution to a one - off problem " .
Strict checks would ensure they were not criminals , spoke English and would pay tax , he said .
The Lib Dem leader said whoever formed the next government would have to accept that reform of the electoral system - one of his party 's key demands - was inevitable , and that any Tory opposition to electoral reform would be a " massive strategic error " .
And he spoke for the first time about the possibility of sitting in cabinet with rival parties , after the general election .
However , when asked if he would be happy to remain as prime minister should Labour have only the third - highest number of votes , Mr Brown said : " I do n't think that 's going to happen .
" When the electorate make up their mind we 've got to accept the verdict . "
In an interview with Dermot O'Leary , to be screened on BBC3 on Wednesday , he said it would be " arrogant " to make assumptions about the situation after the election .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson told the BBC it would be a " difficult " situation , should Labour finish third in terms of the popular vote .
" Look , it does n't take a genius to think that if you are third in the popular vote , then ... you are not best - placed to deal with it , " he said .

" We want to be first in the popular vote .
We are going out over the next 11 days - and there is an awful lot of uncommitted voters . "
Mr Johnson insisted his assertion that " after the election there will be a debate on proportional representation on the electoral system " was not " waving the flag " at the Lib Dems to say he would be prepared to do a deal with them to secure a coalition .
" It is empowering the voters that matters , " he said , adding that Mr Brown recognised the need for " dramatic change " to the constitution .
Mr Cameron , meanwhile , repeated his assertion that a hung parliament would lead to weak government , saying it could lead to " bickering , argument , drift and dithering " .
He added that he was against proportional representation , although a Conservative source told the BBC if voters returned a hung parliament he would be " constructive " .
That could pave the way for a coalition agreement between the parties .
' Tweedle Dem ' Mr Cameron said : " My fear is ... we 'll all potter down to the polling station , we 'll all put a cross in the box , we 'll think we 've changed our government .
" We 'll wake up the next day and find that Tweedle Dum is talking to Tweedle Dee , who 's talking to Tweedle Dem and they 're all jumbled up again into a new government with the same people in the same places .
They'd be picking the prime minister , not you . "
The BBC's Nick Robinson said Mr Clegg saying Labour could not govern if they had the most seats but the least votes marked a shift in his position , as previously he has said the party with the biggest mandate should get the chance to govern .
The Conservatives unveiled their latest poster campaign , comprising 2,200 billboard advertisements showing the leader along with slogans such as " Let 's scrap ID cards " and " Let 's fund new NHS cancer drugs " .

Meanwhile , more than 45 TV stars , including Harry Enfield , Jo Brand , Eddie Izzard and former Dr Who star David Tennant , signed a letter to Sunday 's Observer criticising Tory plans for the BBC .
However , a party spokesman said the Conservatives had " continually expressed our support for a strong and independent BBC " .
Editor of the BBC 's political research unit , David Cowling , said the latest polls for Sunday 's newspapers suggested the Conservatives could narrowly nudge ahead of Labour as the largest single party in the Commons but still not secure an overall majority .
A ComRes poll of 1,006 adults on Friday and Saturday for The Independent on Sunday and Sunday Mirror showed the Tories on 34 % - up three points on last Sunday 's poll - the Lib Dems in second place with 29 % ( no change ) and Labour third on 28 % ( up one ) .
For the Sunday Times , a YouGov poll of 1,412 voters conducted on the same days put the Conservatives up two points on last week at 35 % , the Lib Dems down one on 28 % and Labour down three on 27 % .
Meanwhile Ipsos - Mori - for the News of the World - put the Tories up four points on 36 % , Labour up two on 30 % and the Lib Dems down nine points since Monday , on 23 % .
It surveyed 1,245 adults on Friday .
An ICM survey for the Sunday Telegraph put the Tories on 35 % ( up two points on last Sunday ) , Lib Dems on 31 % ( up one ) and Labour on 26 % ( down two ) .

Without referring to a possible July 7 inquiry or the inquests to be held later this year , he criticised the expense of the Bloody Sunday inquiry in Northern Ireland and said there was a “ danger that we look at the past rather than look at the future . ”

Changes in social roles of men and women may cause the increase of gender violence .
When sexist men feel their power threatened within their relationship , they may use violence as a way to restore their lost power .
Thus , violence becomes either an instrument to control their threatened power and a way to restore it .
Currently , many men " feel threatened by the change that their relationship with women has undergone .
They are unable to understand their relationship with women in terms of equality despite the prevailing social rules " .
Such conclusions were drawn from a research conducted by Prof.
Mª Carmen Herrera Enríquez , from the Department of Social Psychology and Methodology of Behavioural Science of the University of Granada , coordinated by Prof. Francisca Expósito Jiménez and Miguel C. Moya Morales .
This study was undertaken to obtain an answer to the following question : " Why do certain men batter certain women ? "
The research conducted in the University of Granada employed a psycho-social perspective based on two factors : sexism and power imbalance in marriage .
Concretely , the author 's purpose was to get a more thorough perspective and so she tried to investigate to what extent men's perception of losing power may be a cause of gender violence .
As Mª Carmen Herrera states : " it is not only the person 's behaviour what causes violence , but also the social context and its influence on men's behaviour " .
Women forgo their ambitions
According to the University of Granada , our society has a problem : women accept benevolent sexism - which is defined by the author as " sexism with positive connotations , care to and paternalism towards women " - may lead them to forego their ambitions to avoid conflicts with their partners .
In other words : Women who are afraid that their husbands will react violently against them if they do not stick to their traditional role opt for forgoing equality in exchange for security .
Benevolent sexism " can be deemed as a lens that distorts reality due to its positive tone that weakens women 's will in situations of inequality , discrimination or violence against them .
This behaviour makes individuals accept this type of situation .
This research confirms the relevance of ideological factors in gender - based violence .
It emphasizes the importance of power in sentimental relationships and its influence on men's reactions in an effort to maintain or restore their lost / threatened power .
The results obtained from this study may be essential in the prevention of and action against gender violence .
The author has not only revealed the importance to the aggressor of ideological factors , but she has also highlighted the role of benevolent sexism in making women become potential victims .

Security officials in Ghana are cracking down on migrant Fulani herdsmen , accusing them of rape , vandalism , destruction of farms and armed robbery , but conflict resolution specialists say the herdsmen are being manipulated and the government must abide by regional right - of - passage laws .
On 24 April Ghana Immigration Service officials arrested five Fulani herdsmen on the Ghana - Togo border , and drove their 700 cattle back into Togo .
“ We are leading the attack and if they resist we will call in the military , ” police commander for the Volta Region , which borders Togo , Deputy Commissioner of Police David Ampah - Benin told IRIN .
The herdsmen will be tried under a provisional charge of illegal entry into Ghana , he said .
Individuals must have papers stamped , or cross at established border crossings to enter Ghana legally .
Several days earlier on 19 April in the same region , a Fulani herdsman was shot and severely wounded in a gun battle with the police after allegedly attempting to rob passengers along a highway .
Conflict resolution NGO the West African Network for Peace Building ( WANEP ) identifies Fulani herdsmen as a major security threat for the country in its quarterly Ghana Alert report , released on 7 April 2010 .
“ They cross over into the country fully armed and with no regard for our laws .
If unchecked they will escalate the many dormant conflicts especially in the north over land , ” WANEP national coordinator Justin Bayor told IRIN .
Fulanis hail from Niger , Mali , Burkina Faso , Nigeria and Ghana itself , criss - crossing borders in search of pasture for their cattle .
But Fulanis say it is farmers who stoke conflict .
Ibrahim Abubakar , a Ghanaian Fulani herdsman with about 90 cattle , told IRIN many Fulani herdsmen often legitimately lease land on which to graze their cattle for several years at a time , paying up to US $ 3,000 for several hectares .
WANEP ’s Bayor confirmed that traditional leaders often hire out their land without consulting local residents .
Kwesi Aning , who heads the Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution Department of the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre in Accra , told IRIN Fulani herdsmen pose no national security threat .
“ What poses a threat to our collective security is the way that the so - called “ indigenous ” Ghanaians perceive the Fulanis , most of whom are actually Ghanaian citizens , ” he told IRIN .
Ghana ’s handling of the Fulani grazers is a complete violation of the ECOWAS Protocol on Trans - Humans , which Ghana has signed up to , he said .
The protocol regulates the movement of nomadic herdsmen within West Africa .
“ It spells out rules and regulations about where they should pass with the cattle , where there should be boreholes for their water and where there should be veterinary outposts to treat them …
We [ the Ghanaian authorities ] are not following the protocol , ” he noted .
“ This is a failure of the state , plus a deliberate manipulative process by communities in which Fulanis either pass through or are located , to intimidate , to steal , to abuse and to attack them , ” he continued .
Herdsman Abubakar told IRIN : “ We are not criminals .
Nomads sometimes have their cattle straying into people ’s farms .
But the local farmers often kill the cattle instead of reporting the destruction to the cattle owners .
That is how conflict often begins .
” Herdsmen sometimes have to carry guns to protect their cattle , he pointed out , but a very small minority use these guns for robbery .
“ There are just a few bad ones among us …
All we want the authorities to do is to come and talk to us [ to help identify those who are committing crimes ] .
” The General Agricultural Workers Union , many of whose members are affected by the tensions , is raising awareness among its members of the need for peaceful co-existence between farmers and herdsmen .
“ Some members are saying they just think they [ Fulani herdsmen ] should be driven away , but I doubt if that will solve the problem , ” Hippolyte Alua , an industrial relations officer for the Union , told IRIN .
The Ministry of Agriculture needs to engage with Fulani herdsmen and implement the ECOWAS protocol rather than treating them like criminals , he said.em/aj/cb
There 's an interesting linguistic side to the eruption of the volcano Eyjafjallajökull , and that 's that a large number of people suddenly seem very intent on an accurate native pronunciation of Eyjafjallajökull .
Here 's one of many videos on the question , showing proper Icelandic pronunciation compared to that being said by reporters .
Just a small sample of the articles on Eyjafjallajökull 's pronunciation can be seen here , here , here , here , here , and here .
And there are many , many more .
So why the sudden stress over the proper pronunciation of a foreign name ?
Why does n't anybody care that the Korean surname Kim after another syllable ( like the word Mister ) does n't soften to a G and sound like Geem ?
Why does n't it matter that Medvedev is pronounced as spelled in English and not with the tiny j- or y - like sound ( Myedvyedyev ) that it requires ?
Why does Baghdad have a hard g and a short a instead of a long aw sound ?
Why do n't reporters worry about pronouncing Chinese cities and names with the proper tone ?
It 's Hú Jǐntāo ( 胡錦濤 ) , not Hù Jintào .
Why do n't reporters know that a ğ in Turkish just lengthens the preceding vowel ?
Why do n't they ever pronounce German cities with an r with a voiced uvular fricative , as in Bremen [ ˈbʁeːmən ] ?
Why ?
Because 1 ) these sounds often do n't exist in English in the first place , and 2 ) alphabets are codes for native speakers to pronounce their own languages , not a magic script that gives anybody and everybody the ability to correctly pronounce any language that they lay their eyes upon .
So loosen up a bit , and pronounce Ejyafjallajökull as Ay - ya - fyalla - jeu - kool .
It does n't matter that you do n't sound like a born and bred Icelander .
Really .
It 's that date again , folks .
If you 've seen an amazing new service or something that sounds too good to be true , it probably is — very few companies take April 1 seriously .

We 'll keep updating the post , so send us your ideas in the comments .
We expected a lot from Reddit on this particular day and boy , did it deliver .

Directly from Google : " Early last month the mayor of Topeka , Kansas stunned the world by announcing that his city was changing its name to Google .
We ’ve been wondering ever since how best to honor that moving gesture .
Today we are pleased to announce that as of 1 AM ( Central Daylight Time ) April 1st , Google has officially changed our name to Topeka . "
Nice move .
I 'll Topeka Google , and you Google Topeka , OK ?

The idea is amazing , but I have to admit all I got from it was a headache .
Do n't be afraid to experiment with it , however — some areas work better than others .

To be honest , we 're still not sure exactly how much these RedWire DLX iPod Jeans from Levi's will retail for , but we 're guessing the price - to - fashion ratio will be astronomical .
At least the RedWire moniker is explained by a snazzy red ribbon that tethers your iPod to its assigned sidepocket , but the dork factor is quite evident in the retractable headphone doo- hickey and the overly obvious control pad .
Or is that the whole point ?
We never claimed to be fashionable , only to be practiced in lambastating the fashion of others .
Keep reading for a picture of the dorkiness in full effect ( i.e. no sexy models to get in the way ) .
