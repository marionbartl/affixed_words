The European elections are only two weeks away , and Pirate Party candidates vie for seats in different countries .
We speak with some of them , starting with Andreas Popp , lead candidate for the German Piraten Partei .
The German Pirate Party ( or Piratenpartei ) is often overshadowed by the success and popularity of their Swedish brethren .
Recently they were even removed and banned from a major German social networking site .
They should n’t be discounted though , as they have every bit as much grit and determination as their Nordic associates , as one of their adverts for their European Election campaign shows .
TorrentFreak spoke with their lead candidate , Bavarian party chairman Andreas Popp , to discuss his views on the upcoming election .
What do you see as being the most important issue in the election ?
Currently the most important issue in EU ( but also national ) politics are the civil rights .
This includes the fight against the censorship of the Internet as well as against the transformation of our western societies into police states .
IT , especially the Internet , plays a very important role in these topics .
The politicians who are in power right now fear the Internet and are doing everything to get control over it , just like the content industry does .
What makes these topics so important is the immediate danger we are facing .
If we do not fight for our civil liberties now , we might just find ourselves in a new form of dictatorship .
What is your opinion of Commissioner McCreevy ’s attempts to extend copyright terms in the EU ?
This extension really was some kind of a joke .
They said they wanted to enhance the financial situation of retired musicians .
This is already strange , since while other people have to save money for their retirement , musicians get their pension for free by copyright .
But then all the experts stated that musicians will not benefit from this extension , because they normally sell all their rights in buy - out - contracts .
So only music labels benefit from the law .
They passed it anyways .
What about copyright in general ?
I think it would take too long to explain what needs to be changed here , but you can read about it on the program ( english ) page of our campaign site .
How many members does the German Pirate Party have right now , and has there been any boost from the Pirate Bay trial , as the Swedish party has seen ?
Nationally , we just had our 1000th member .
Yes , we have had a great boost during the last few weeks , but I cannot tell you if it is because of the Pirate Bay trial or because of the new censorship law .
Are you seeing the ‘ older generations ’ supporting the party in significant numbers , or is it mainly 18 - 30 year - olds ?
Of course the generation of the “ Digital Natives ” are the main supporting group for the Pirate Party .
But there are also a lot of people who are already out of their thirties and are supporting our activities .
Even if you look at our list of candidates there are only three people who have not passed thirty yet .
So I would say yes , there is a significant number of ‘ older ’ people supporting the pirates .
I think the only difference is the medium we use to communicate .
You can get in touch with the younger ones mostly through the net .
The older ones are more likely to come and talk to you when you are standing on the street .
What is the method of election in Germany for the European Parliament ?
It is basically the same as in our national elections .
Each party nominates a list of candidates for the election and the citizens can put their cross next to one of the party .
Germany has 99 seats in the EU parliament .
These seats are divided proportionally among all parties with more than 5 % of the total votes .
5 % would be roughly how many votes ?
There are about 60 million voters , but Germans are not really interested in EU elections so only about 50 % of them are going to vote .
So that might be round about 1.5 million votes to break the 5 %- line .
50 % is rather low compared to national or local elections , but the turnout is falling .
People here get kind of annoyed with politics .
The 60 million figure is about 10 years old , but there is a small difference to the national elections because citizens of other EU countries can register for voting in the EU elections in Germany too .
It is a fair number to base things on though .
Some say you have little chance of making that 5 % barrier , so why should people vote for you ?
One of the most important chances in the EU elections is to get enough votes ( 0.5 % ) to qualify for public party funding .
That is one of the things I like to tell all the people out there who do not want to vote for us , because they think we cannot make the 5 % threshold .
Even if we do not , qualifying for public funding would be a big step .
One of the parties who gets public funding and is about the same size as we are , got around 80,000 Euro ( about $ 108,000 ) last year – that would mean more than tripling our funds – and making it it possible to hire people for the administrative tasks , giving us more time for politics .
How much of an issue is funding in German elections ?
It is a big issue .
As a small party we do not get any public funding yet , so we have to get along with the money we get from our membership fees and donations .
All of us are working unsalaried right now .
Considering the organizational stuff that has to be done , we are limited in activity .
If people want to make a donation , they can do so either to the national party , or directly to their state party .
And if they cannot afford to donate money , voluntary helpers to do local work are always a big help .
The European elections take place in early June .
The Germany party has a campaign website , www.piratenpartei.net
CES 2009 brought us a new player in the smartphone upper-echelon .
Let 's drill down and see how the Palm Pre compares with the iPhone and Android's G1 .
Advertisement
1. Multitouch touchscreen / gesture control :
All three are capacitive , only the Pre and iPhone have multitouch .
The Pre 's glowy little " gesture area " has dropped the touchable real estate all the way down tto the bottom of the phone , which is great for being able to navigate with one hand and not interfere with the screen at all .
The wavey dock you bring up from the bottom looks awesome , but can you use it out of the box without a second thought or page through the manual ?
That 's my question .
Advantage : iPhone / Pre tossup .
2. Multitasking : One of the beefiest of our beefs with the iPhone SDK is its insistence on Apps running one at a time .
The G1's notifications drawer was definitely a step in the right direction , but the Pre 's interface is the first smartphone OS that was built with multitasking as a core design element .
Resembling the Xbox 's old Blades , or a less - jarring OS X Expose even , the Pre 's " Cards " interface always places you in the context of every app running for fast switching , and notifications from other apps do n't pull you away completely from the task at hand .
Multitasking is hugely important on a phone , and it's a good sign that Palm recognizes .
Advantage : Pre

3. Hardware : Adrian says :
While the hardware is definitely high quality , I 'm not entirely blown away by the design .
It looks really nice , and original , but it 's a little too cutesy in shape and kind of reminds me of an oversized pebble .
A slightly larger screen could have definitely been put to good use , and I really do n't like the black space on the sides of the screen .
A phone with a built - in QWERTY still has n't touched the iPhone in terms of sleekness and pure sex .
And it might still be a while .
Advantage : iPhone
4. Development platform : The Pre's " Web OS " sure sounds nice — all developers need to know is JavaScript , HTML and CSS ?
Sounds good in theory , but building a mobile app will never be as easy as cranking out a new theme for your Tumblr .
Palm 's stressing ease of development , though , so it will be interesting to see how it stacks up against Apple 's solid , familiar - to - devs OS X - based SDK and Android 's fully open source approach .
Advantage : Pre ?
If it 's straight - up JavaScript , that 's a lot of programmers ready to go .
Note : we had iPhone here before , but we 've switched with a qualification .
Developer community still goes to iPhone for volume .
Advertisement
5. Web Integration : The Pre subtly integrates the internet into the phone at every opportunity , and it 's awesome .
Contacts get pulled in from Facebook , Gmail , IM and and scanned for dupes ; the messaging app shows your last several emails , IMs and SMS with that contact in a single window .
Really , really smart stuff .
Advantage : Pre
6. App Store / developer community : A smartphone is only as good as the software it runs .
On the Pre , Palm is still keeping application delivery details like pricing behind the curtain , but they did say the app delivery will be entirely handled by the phone ( without a desktop app ) , which is a shame .
They 're saying that they 're not going to duplicate Apple 's Hobbesian app approval black box mistake , which Android has also has n't fallen for , but there will be an approval process based on " security and stability . "
But as we know with Android , a dev community needs enough devices in the hands of consumers to reach critical mass , which the Pre will have to match .
Advantage : iPhone , even with the black box , but Android and Pre 's more open stances are reassuring .

7. Wireless charger :
We 've seen wireless charger tech for years at CES , but it 's taken this long for a major consumer gadget to come bundled with its own wireless charger in the box .
Whoops , it 's not in the box , sold separately for unknown $ $ .
But still : Bravo .
Advantage : Pre
8. The Network : Dan Hesse , Sprint 's CEO , gave our coast - to - coast 3G test a shout out in his press conference .
Of course he did : Sprint won ( in download speeds ) .
Sprint was the only major carrier without a powerful , hype - catching smartphone choice , and now they have one .
The Pre is a data - centric phone with a network we 've proven to be strong in a large swatch of the country — that 's a good combo .
But would you switch to Sprint for the Pre ? Ugh .
Advantage :
Not cut and dry for everyone , but we stand by our numbers : Sprint is the best 3G network in our tests .

9 . Physical keyboard :
It 's preference , but one held by a large swathe of the gadget buying public : physical QWERTY keypads are still the mainstream input of choice .
Touch is getting better all the time , but a lot of people still want physical keyboards .
But better yet is the ability to choose ; unfortunately , the Pre does n't have a soft onscreen keyboard , and its slide - out is the same meh QWERTY from the Treo Pro.
Advantage :
It 's preference , but on me , the iPhone 's soft keyboard can't be beat .
Advertisement
10 . Camera : The Pre has an LED Flash for its 3 MP camera , something both the iPhone and G1 lack .
Flash cellphone photos are ugly , but for a lot of people , they 're good enough .
So credit for throwing it in .
Advantage : Pre
11 . Battery : Apple 's still an outlier with their non-removable battery ; like the G1's , the Pre 's comes out for a spare swap too .
We 've heard Apple 's reasons for this a million times , we know the drill , but removable batteries will never stop being handy .
Advantage : Pre
Advertisement
12 . Copy & Paste : Yep ,
Pre 's got it .
i Phone still does n't .
Advantage : Pre/G1
13 . Browser :
All three use a browser based on WebKit , which has become the standard for the mobile web .
We could n't put it through our Mobile Browser Battlemodo ringer obviously , but what we saw looked great , and it 's the only other mobile browser besides the iPhone that supports multitouch zooming .
Advantage : iPhone / Pre

So there you have it .
We 're excited .
Are you ?
Domas Mituzas mentioned this recently .
It ’s so cool I just have to write about it .
Here ’s an easy command to fork off a bunch of jobs in parallel : xargs .
seq 10 20 | xargs -n 1 -P 5 sleep
This will send a sequence of numbers to xargs , which will divide it into chunks of one argument at a time and fork off 5 parallel processes to execute each .
You can see it in action :
$ ps -eaf | grep sleep baron 5830 5482 0 11:12 pts/2 00:00:00 xargs -n 1 -P 5 sleep baron 5831 5830 0 11:12 pts/2 00:00:00 sleep 10 baron 5832 5830 0 11:12 pts/2 00:00:00 sleep 11 baron 5833 5830 0 11:12 pts/2 00:00:00 sleep 12 baron 5834 5830 0 11:12 pts/2 00:00:00 sleep 13 baron 5835 5830 0 11:12 pts/2 00:00:00 sleep 14
There are basically unlimited uses for this !
It 's always nice to get comments from someone who knows what I am talking about , and the appearance in a comment thread of " Tevist " , a lawyer who has actually argued a case in front of Judge Selna is a case in point .
He thinks I am exaggerating the threat to science teaching .
The writer and / or readers completely misunderstand the judge 's ruling here .
The decision does NOT find that science teachers cannot say and / or explain how creation " science " is , in fact , no such thing .
It finds that science teachers cannot make derogatory statements toward religion .
It 's not an unreasonable finding under American law .
I understand the desire to manufacture a controversy on a hot - button issue , but let 's be fair and describe this situation as it is .
He also says that Selna is a perfectly good judge .
I would n't argue with that at all .
In fact , I am not sure that I 'd argue with Tevist in any way ( how 's that for not manufacturing controversy ? ) except to say that I think I did understand the ruling .
The judge does not say that creationism can be taught in schools – of course he does n't ; nor does he say that evolution may not be taught in schools ; again , he goes out of his way to quote earlier decisions denying that evolutionary biology is the product of a quasi- religious system , as fundamentalists argue .
But what he does say , very clearly , is thet teachers may not systematically disparage religious beliefs in class .
They should deal with ID , or creationism by saying it 's religion , not science , and so can not be taught in schools .
They may not go on to say that it 's pernicious nonsense because it 's religion and not science .
Logically this makes perfect sense and provides a clear policy for teachers to follow .
But politically , and emotionally , in the context of the present debates about atheism , it looks like a win for the fundies .
You have only to read some of the comments here , or on the major atheist blogs to understand that for many of the most passionate opponents of creationism religion is pernicious nonsense and that is one of the most important lessons of evolutionary biology .
This certainly seems to have been Corbett 's position ( note that he is not himself a science teacher ) and I do n't doubt that there are thousands of people who share his views teaching in public schools across America .
Selna does n't set a precedent .
But he has set an example .
And if the law is as clear as it appears to be from his judgement ( and he quotes from the same case as established that creationism is not science under Californian law ) public school teachers may not call religion pernicious nonsense in their classrooms :
There is no question that " [t ] he government neutrality required under the Establishment Clause is . . . violated as much by government disapproval of religion as it is by government approval of religion . "
This is n't a matter of truth or falsehood .
It is a matter of constitutionality .
But good teachers care passionately about truth or falsehood , and it 's fairly obvious that some of them are going to overstep that line .
And one of the contributing factors will be that they have been egged on to it by the people who see atheism as a moral crusade .
For all those people , the point of court cases against ID and creationism , from Scopes to Dover , and , apparently , endlessly , on , is to establish that creationism is false , and therefore should not be taught in schools .
But in fact , the courts , where they have ruled against it , have done so on the grounds that it is religion .
There is a distinction .
It 's logically clear , but to many atheists emotionally invisible .
What Judge Selna 's judgement makes clear is that to blur or deny the distinction in schools is every bit as unconstitutional as claiming inside them that any religious doctrine is true .
Given the political and emotional climate in which these debates are conducted , yes , I think it will have an effect , even if there is legally nothing startling in it .
There are many cases of well - established legal principles which come as a tremendous shock to the general public .
In his final installment as Gizmodo 's cherished Astroblogger , real - life astronaut Leroy Chiao covers the taboo topic of sex in space .
Will it happen ?
Has it happened ?
Guess you 'll have to read to find out ...
Advertisement
Has anyone had sex in space ?
To date , I can tell you emphatically , no .
Why am I so sure ?
It 's simple .
Guys are guys .
If a guy had sex in space , he would not be able to stand not bragging about it .
Am I right , or am I right ?
Sorry to disappoint you , but there it is .
We would all know about it .
Or , I should say , we will all know about it when it happens .
So , what 's the deal ?
Do we have blow up dolls or robots to take care of business ?
No , and not that we 'd really want such a thing !
Humans look a lot better .

Besides , would sex in space — bragging rights aside — really be so great ?
This week , I 've given you a look at the difficulties of doing things in microgravity , and the potential for making some pretty disgusting messes .
So , apply all you 've learned , and honestly assess whether or not sex would be better up there .
You 'd have to anchor yourselves , somehow ( in all six degrees of freedom ) , otherwise it would be more than the headboard you might bang up against .
And , some objects , while not sharp ( we are careful about that ) , might really hurt to run into during a moment of passion !
So what do we have ?
What do you think ?
There is a rule that even alcohol ( for drinking ) is not allowed onboard , because NASA is worried about bad PR .
Can you imagine NASA wanting to address the issue of sex ?
Ha !
What about the future , as we fly longer and farther into space ?
That 's easy .
Crews are already mixed , and crews will become larger .
As this happens , there will be a gradual transition from crew to colony ( for example , a permanent moon base ) .
Just like in your office now , romances will sprout ( which the participants will think are secret ) and things will take their natural course .
And , people back on Earth ( the guy 's friends ) will hear about it , almost immediately after it happens .
The news will quickly spread from there .
And then , you 'll know .

Linux FCS IBM , the first and biggest IT vendor to champion Linux , has been gently rebuked for initially tolerating the community to further its own interests .
And IBM was forced to concede .
IBM was identified during a Linux Foundation conference debate on community participation as emblematic of big companies who 've made the mistake of joining the efforts around Linux to further their own goals first , and to help development of the kernel second .
James Bottomley , Novell distinguished engineer , kernel maintainer , and chairman of the Foundation 's technical advisory board , said IBM initially approached Linux with the belief it had key technologies that should be in Linux , and pushed them upstream into the kernel .
These technologies , he said , first benefited IBM and only secondarily benefited the kernel .
" They broke down the technology into elements that would benefit IBM , " Bottomley said .
He did not identify the technologies involved , but IBM engineers and expertise have been poured into making Linux work on its Power architecture and Intel - based servers .
Back before the wider world understood Linux , IBM was there with its own Technology Center ( LTC ) in 1999 , manned by 185 IBMers in six countries .
IBM 's server and global services business has since become one of the biggest beneficiaries of making the kernel - via Red Hat and SuSE - work well on its hardware .
How did IBM respond to this characterization ?
It agreed .
The vice president for open systems development in IBM 's systems and technology group Dan Frye said : " Absolutely - we learned a lot from that lesson . "
What IBM learned exactly was how to join and participate more effectively in the community , he said .
Clearly there was a lot of this kind of thinking going around in the late 1999s and early 2000s .
IBM created the Eclipse open - source tools project in late 2001 with a major code - dump from its Visual Age for Java tools , and with backing by its engineers .
The goal was to stop the pointless and costly task of re-building basic development - tools frameworks and tap a broader market of plug - in providers .
Also , to outmaneuver tools and Java competitors .
The project worked better than expected on all fronts .
But eight years later IBM remains the single largest participant in the resulting Eclipse Foundation and its projects .
The whole subject came up during a panel debate on how to measure community contributions to Linux during the Linux Foundation 's Collaboration Summit in San Francisco .
Along with Frye and Bottomley , participating were Red Hat developer - community manager and Fedora Project board member Karsten Wade , and Ubuntu community manager Jono Bacon .
The debate had turned to how to encourage participation and mistakes commonly made .
According to Bottomley , there are open - source projects that claim to be open but only involve a " tiny bit of community " - and nobody knows who they are .
The biggest success of Linux was drawing on more than just a core set of contributors , he said .
" It 's almost the lifeblood of the OS , " he explained .
Frye claimed there exist other community projects that let you only scratch their particular itch - or solve a specific problem that only the participants are interested in , and that have little broader benefit .
Again , there were no names .
Wade said companies had to learn that they could n't apply the closed - source model of software development to open source by hiring people and then telling them to code .
He called this stacking a project by hiring all the people to make sure the programming goals are met .
" [ Companies ] need to focus on not stacking - up a project by hiring all the people to make it happen , " Wade said .
Bottomley called this an " industrial process " of paying people to achieve a goal that 's different from the community approach of working collaboratively . ®
For years , Jon Ronson had heard tell of a clandestine band of dizzyingly powerful politicans and industrialists who were said to be the real rulers of the world , making and breaking presidents , contriving wars .
Surely they could not exist .
Could he find them ?
The trail took him - and his newfound companion , an oddball Washington reporter who had made the quest his life 's mission - to a luxury resort in Portugal . . .
At the National Press Club on Pennsylvania Avenue , Washington DC , Big Jim Tucker left a coded message on the answer - machine of a friend .
" Mother .
Your dutiful son is playing kick the can on Pennsylvania Avenue , Tuesday morning , 10.30 am , thank you . "
Big Jim replaced the telephone receiver .
He lit a cigarette and glanced around the lobby with a routine vigilance .
Even here at his club , his gentleman 's club , he considered himself not entirely safe .
Anyone could discover that this was where he had breakfast every day : three strong black coffees and some pastries on the side .
" If they ever got me , " he said , " they 'd make it look like a typical Washington mugging .
A mugging on the sidewalk .
Killed for a couple of dollars .
Another three paragraphs in the newspaper . "
Jim paused .
He pulled on his cigarette .
His heart is not strong due to his habit of smoking unfiltered Camels at all times , pack after pack .
He is quite huge , an elderly southern gentleman in a crumpled suit and a newshound trilby .
He has a voice like gravel ( a result of cigarette - induced emphysema , which , by a happy accident , gives his speech an enigmatic rhythm , like a charismatic Sam Spade down on his luck ) and an office downtown with Venetian blinds .
He said , " The thing is , we do n't know how much time we 've got left .
And suppose I just so happen to ' drop dead ' in my office on Tuesday afternoon .
It could be the following Monday before someone says , ' Where is that boy ? '
I do n't want to be burnt bacon when they find me .
I guess I 'm just too vain to be found that way . "
Big Jim laughed in a hollow manner .
" So I phone my friend every day just to announce I 'm still kicking the can and still hunting the macaroon .
Still breathing , see ?
The day she does n't get that call is the day she makes enquiries . "
Here at his private members ' club , Big Jim could pass for a venerable commentator for a heavyweight daily newspaper , but he is n't .
He works for an underground journal called the Spotlight .
Mainstream journalists keep away from him .
This is , Jim said , because certain high - ranking members of the overground media , even some members of his own club , are in league with the secret rulers of the world .
And it is they who would make his death look like a typical Washington mugging .
When I began hearing about the Bilderberg Group - about the notion that a tiny band of insidious and clandestine powermongers meet in a secret room from which they rule the world - I was sceptical .
But I kept hearing about them , and I finally decided to try to settle the matter once and for all .
Which is why I visited Big Jim Tucker .
Within anti-Bilderberg circles , Big Jim is considered a pioneer , a trailblazer , risking his life to attempt to locate the geographical whereabouts of the secret room .
" They exist all right , " said Big Jim , " and they 're not playing pinochle in there . "
Big Jim Tucker has spent 30 years documenting the facts .
He 's been after them since the 70s when he first got the hunch that they existed .
He abandoned a good career in sports journalism on a big city paper .
It has been cat and mouse ever since , he said .
Good against evil .
" Those sick luminaries are always on the move , " said Jim .
" They never come together in the same place twice , so as to evade detection .
They only meet once a year , for a long weekend in May or June . "
They have been ruling the world in secret since 1954 , Jim said , when a man called Joseph Retinger , whose name rarely appears in the history books , decided to create them .
One of many mysteries is how Retinger - a Polish immigrant employed as secretary to the novelist Joseph Conrad - had the wherewithal and the contacts to organise such a mighty endeavour .
Their first meeting took place in the Bilderberg Hotel , Holland , which is why the secret rulers of the world go by the name of the Bilderberg Group .
Big Jim said that I happened to have caught him at a very good time .
He was ready to take things further , to turn up the heat and cause some trouble .
" So you 've actually managed to obtain the address of the next Bilderberg meeting ? " I asked Jim .
" Yes , sir , " he said .
" You know exactly where it is ? " I asked .
" Yes , I do , " he said .
Big Jim said he fully intended to thwart their security and barge in unannounced to catch them red - handed going about their covert wickedness .
I was welcome to tag along , he said , " Just so long as you do n't step on twigs or fall off walls while we 're on the prowl .
" The plan is this , " said Jim .
" We 'll leave Washington on the last day of May , and we 'll arrive at the target destination on the Sunday morning .
We 'll start patrolling that same afternoon .
Patrol Sunday and Monday .
Develop sources .
Waiters , chambermaids . . . "
" So they still meet in hotels ? " I said .
" Yes , sir , " said Jim .
" The chambermaids will be gun -shy at first .
They 'll know something big and spooky is going on , but they wo n't know what .
But then they 'll begin to realise that whatever 's happening at their hotel is evil .
And that 's when they 'll open up . "
" So what else will we do on the Sunday and Monday ? "
" Scout around the resort .
Figure out ways to penetrate . "
" Scout around looking for what ? "
" Where the short wall is , " said Jim .
" Where the big drainpipe is . "
" So we 'll actually be climbing up drainpipes ? " I asked .
" Climbing up drainpipes , " said Jim , " trying not to sneeze or cough or step on twigs .
Trying to avoid the guard dogs . "
" What 's the name of the hotel ? "
" I 've - uh - got it written down here somewhere , " said Jim .
He riffled through his pockets .
" Here it is .
The Caesar Park golfing resort , Sintra , Portugal . "
I looked quizzically at Jim .
" Are you sure about all of this ? "
" They are evil and their evil occurs in the dark shadows , " replied Jim , emphatically .
" Behind closed doors .
Ruling the world from a room .
Imagine that .
Let 's get a drink . "
Jim took me to the Men 's Bar upstairs .
We drank beers and watched sport on the TV above the bar .
Framed front pages of big news stories of days gone by lined the walls .
" War in the Persian Gulf ! " " Thatcher Resigns ! "
Jim said that both acts were orchestrated by Bilderberg .
" Margaret Thatcher is one of the good guys , " said Jim .
" Bilderberg ordered her to dismantle British sovereignty , but she said no way , so they had her sacked . "
Big Jim said he once found himself at a drinks party with Thatcher and he took the opportunity to sidle up to her .
" How does it feel to have been denounced by those Bilderberg boys , ma'am ? " he growled .
She whispered back that she considered it a " great tribute to be denounced by Bilderberg " .
I considered the significance of the endeavour we were about to undertake .
For the other people I had met , Bilderberg was an inviolable almighty .
Big Jim was the first man to have the tenacity to discover the address , and to plan on going in , and damn the consequences .
This might change everything .
Jim would n't tell me how he discovered the room 's whereabouts , but a few moments later , as we sat at the bar , a tall man with a moustache bounded over and cheerfully introduced himself to me as Jim 's mole from inside Bilderberg .
" I'm an accountant , " he explained .
" Some very big clients use our firm .
One guy happened to mention to me that he was on his way to somewhere near Lisbon in June for a very private meeting . "
Jim appeared a little annoyed by his mole 's instantaneous candour , but then he shrugged and joined in with the story .
" We know , " said Jim , " that the Bilderberg Group always meet in May or June . "
" So Jim , " said the mole , " started telephoning every five - star hotel near Lisbon . "
" They always meet at a five - star hotel with golfing facilities , " explained Jim .
" Always golfing facilities ? " I asked .
Jim picked up on my subtext at once .
" Believe me , " he said , " they 're not there to play golf .
They 're too busy starting wars . "
" They may play golf when they 're there , " clarified the mole , " but they 're not there to play golf . "
" Okay , " I said .
" So , " said Jim , " I finally got around to calling a hotel up in the hills , and I said to the receptionist , ' I 've been invited to the Bilderberg conference in June , but I 'm afraid I 've been very silly and lost my invitation .
Could you confirm that this is the correct venue ? '
And she said , ' Why , of course , sir .
Oh yes , sir .
This is exactly where you 're supposed to be , and we 're very much looking forward to serving you . ' "
Jim and his mole laughed .
A nearby barfly heard their laughter and came over to join us .
Jim and his mole stopped laughing .
They turned their backs on the new guy and myself .
There was a moment 's awkwardness .
" So what 's all this about ? " asked the new guy .
" Well , " I whispered , " that big old man in the trilby has tracked down the tiny group of people who rule the world in secret .
Anyway , the two of us are going to Portugal next week to confront them . "
" Oh , right , " he said , unimpressed .
" What do they do , these secret rulers of the world ? "
I shrugged .
" Everything , I guess , " I said .
" They 're called the Bilderberg Group . "
" Ca n't say I 've heard of them , " he said .
" Jim 's dedicated his life to exposing them , " I said .
" It 's not so surprising that I 've never heard of them , " said the new guy .
He scanned the room .
Every bar stool was occupied .
Retired newsmen in suits stared into their beer glasses .
The Men's Bar seemed to be where the Washington press corps went when there were no more deadlines , no stories left to file .
" It 's not so surprising , " he said .
" Pretty much everyone here has dedicated his life to something or other that nobody 's ever heard of . "
The next morning , Jim took me to the office of the Spotlight , just around the corner from Capitol Hill .
It is pristine from the outside , gleaming white , on a lovely tree - lined street .
But it is dark and dusty inside , and there are boxes everywhere .
He introduced me to Andy , his editor .
We sat in the courtyard and drank iced tea .
" Jon , " said Jim to Andy , " thinks those Bilderberg boys are just playing pinochle in there . "
" Well , first off , " said Andy , impatiently , " you get a lot of people , including newspaper editors , who say there is no Bilderberg Group , that it does n't even exist . "
" They 've kept the vow of silence like they 're going to nun school , " said Jim .
" This is after you 've had Prince Charles attend , " said Andy .
" This is after you 've had Bill Clinton attend .
And still people say it does n't exist .
Not that it 's just a social meeting , but that it does n't exist . "
" If they 're just going to play golf and swap lies and chase girls , " said Jim , " why the armed guards ?
Know what I 'm saying ? "
" They exist all right , " said Andy .
" Prince Charles and Bill Clinton , " explained Jim , " are small - fry .
The rulers of the world are the ones who do the inviting .
The steering committee .
Clinton was just a small - fry from somewhere called Arkansas when he got his invitation back in ' 91 .
Yeah , they had big plans for that boy . "
" You be careful , " said Andy .
" You 're dealing with dangerous forces . "

" Mother , " said Big Jim Tucker , " your dutiful son is playing hunt the macaroon at the Paris Hotel , Portugal , Monday morning , 10.30 am , thank you . "
It was a week later , and our first working day in Portugal .
Our plan was to scout the target five - star golfing resort situated six miles north , develop sources and look for the short wall and the big drainpipe in preparation for the midnight penetration later in the week .
Jim lay back on his bed .
Our hotel was built on a busy roundabout .
The ocean glistened in the distance , beyond a railway track and a couple of main roads .
Even up here on the sixth floor you could hear the never - ending roar of the traffic .
" Unlike the Bilderberg luminaries , " said Jim , ruefully , scanning the dirty walls of this bad hotel , " some of us are working on a tight budget . "
Jim lit a Camel .
He is a large , elderly man , and I am not athletic .
Our agility levels were impeded by our smoking habits , and we wheezed in the Portuguese heat .
I was unsure as to how successful the two of us would be in climbing up drainpipes .
I pictured slapstick scenarios that would be hilarious to onlookers but not to us .
Jim was acting breezily , but I could sense his nervousness .
" I'm a quarterback , " he said , " gearing up for the Superbowl . "
By Jim 's reckoning , the Bilderberg Group was not scheduled to arrive in Portugal until Wednesday night .
He said he had heard reports that their private security guards had already set up camp at the Caesar Park and were planning to operate a shoot - to - kill policy for all penetrators .
This somewhat diminished the potential for slapstick hilarity .
I was not feeling cocksure .
We had that morning fruitlessly scanned the news - stands for references to the meeting .
" Surprise , surprise , " growled Jim .
" Media black - out . "
There was , however , one notable exception .
The Weekly News , a tiny English - language parish newspaper , circulation 8,000 , for Algarve tourist workers and regular English visitors such as Sir Cliff Richard , had gone big on the story .
Very big : " As speculation on the internet runs rife , the News checks it out and it does seem that . . . secret world government group is meeting here ! "
The Weekly News made me feel less vulnerable down here on the ground .
Jim said he wanted to touch base with its editorial team later in the week .
" If the Weekly News boys can help us expose those Bilderberg jackasses , " he said , " I 'm all for pooling information . "
I had rented a car from Budget .
We drove into the mountains , away from the boisterous , good - time package - tour Estoril , towards the more serene and ancient pastures of Sintra , seven miles up the road .
On the way , we discussed cover stories in case we incurred suspicion .
We elected to be holidaymakers , getting a drink at the poolside bar because we'd heard so many good things about the resort , which was undoubtedly the finest around .
The Caesar Park is situated three miles from the main Estoril - Sintra road - two and a half miles down a narrow country lane , through the wilderness of a national park , followed by another half - mile private driveway .
It became evident , as we approached the big peach gates that led into the resort , that the midnight penetration would be an even more formidable task than we had anticipated .
The hotel is surrounded on all sides by dense undergrowth and sheer mountains .
Jim silently pondered these obstacles from the passenger seat .
He photographed the mountains .
We drove through the gates ( the gatekeeper let us in with a wave ) and down the half - mile - long driveway .
And then the hotel appeared - a peach - coloured resort of purpose - built luxury .
" The civilians have n't been shifted out yet , " muttered Jim , as we left the car and wandered towards the colossal marble reception area .
Jim whipped out his camera and photographed the tourists .
These photographs would later appear in the Spotlight as " unaware civilians " .
We were not inconspicuous , Jim and I , strolling around the Caesar Park in our open - necked shirts .
We were , in fact , an unlikely holidaymaking duo .
At a very big push , Jim could resemble a benevolent , wealthy , southern sugar daddy and I his gawky , early - 30s toy - boy .
But I doubted the persuasiveness of the scenario .
" I do n't think , " I murmured , as we wandered out to the swimming pool , " that the holidaymaking cover is a convincing one .
I think we should think of something else . "
" We 're salesmen , " said Jim .
" We 're just salesmen getting lunch . "
" What do we sell ? " I asked .
" We do n't like to talk business when we 're having lunch , " said Jim .
We sat on stools at the poolside bar .
Unaware young women sunbathed in bikinis .
" Ma'am , " said Jim to a young passing waitress , bowing slightly , his newshound trilby now replaced by a tourist 's straw sunhat , " I 'm a little confused .
I tried to book a room here for Thursday , and they told me that the whole hotel had been closed down for some big meeting .
Must be a pretty damned big important meeting if you ask me . . . "
The waitress shrugged .
" I do n't know , " she said .
She smiled slightly and left us .
Jim got out his notepad .
He wrote notes and then he read them out to me :
Dateline Portugal
Tension filled the air inside the posh Caesar Park resort on Monday .
At the poolside bar , the pretty barmaid 's face filled with tension when asked to speculate on the big important meeting taking place from Thursday .
She shrugged her shoulders and feigned ignorance , but the tension on her face spoke volumes .
Jim put down his notepad .
" Is that accurate ? " he said .
" I do n't know , " I said .
" We may be imbuing her with our own feelings of tension . "
" Still , " said Jim , finishing his iced tea , " now we know what the drinks of the rich taste like . "
We paid and patrolled the resort some more .
I was disappointed with the Caesar Park , its Eurotrashy aircraft - hangar spaces , its cold approximation of luxury .
The lobby shops have names such as " Fashionable " .
I would have assumed that Bilderberg would meet somewhere classier .
Jim explained that I still had n't quite got it .
They are not there for classy holidaying .
They are there to start wars .
Also , Jim added , there is a finite number of international hotels that can transform themselves into walled fortresses , that have their own helicopter pads and nearby military air bases .
Jim and I split up .
I looked at the prints on the wall outside the upstairs bar .
A half - hour passed .
I wandered aimlessly through the lobbies and the bars .
There were other aimless wanderers , too : a woman in a red dress and a man in his 30s wearing a tweed jacket .
It struck me that we all seemed to be wandering aimlessly in some kind of unison , but it did n't cross my mind - right up until the moment that the man in the tweed jacket marched across the room and began questioning me in an angry whisper - that I was being tailed .
" We 've watched you for an hour .
I 'm the hotel manager .
You take pictures .
You ask questions about some big important meeting .
Who are you ? "
" I . . . " I paused .
Then I clumsily announced , " I 'm from England . "
It was the only thing I could think of .
This works , of course , in other circumstances abroad .
But it did n't work here .
" What do you want ? "
I stared blankly at him .
" What is your business here ? "
I continued to stare blankly .
And then another man appeared .
This new man was older , with a tan , and he spoke with a smooth European accent .
" It 's okay ! " he laughed .
" Everything 's fine !
There 's no problem ! "
He gave the hotel manager 's shoulder a little squeeze .
" I am your servant , " he said to me .
" If there 's anything you 'd like , please be my guest .
Think of this hotel as your home .
If I can be of any service to you , any service whatsoever , do n't hesitate to ask . "
I glanced over with anxiety at the hotel manager , who was now standing a little way off ; overruled , slighted and silent .
" I mean , " he smiled , " what could you possibly be doing here that could cause any harm to anybody ? "
" Are you . . . " I paused .
There was something indistinctly alarming about the things he was saying to me .
I could not imagine that he really did want me to think of this hotel as my home .
So why did he say that ?
I presume , in retrospect , that the message he was sending to me was : " We have noticed you , you are not welcome , but we are allowing you to leave without incident , just so long as you do n't come back . "
At the time , however , the message I picked up was : " I am extremely sinister and powerful .
This is so evident that I can afford to feign generous subservience . "
" Are you with the Caesar Park ? " I asked the charming man .
" Oh , no , " he laughed .
" No , I am not with the hotel .
So , as I say , think of this hotel as your home .
Really , everything 's fine and there 's no problem .
What problems could there be ? "
What problems could there be ?
I wanted the young hotel manager to intervene .
I suddenly felt that he could be my ally in this situation .
But he remained impassive .
" Do n't feel as if you have to go , " said the charming man , his arms outstretched .
" Stay as long as you like .
Enjoy the facilities .
Have a swim ! "
" So if you 're not with the hotel , " I said , " who are you with ? "
" I am with . . . " he paused " . . . another organisation . "
" Which is called . . .? "
He laughed and looked at the ground .
" Enjoy your afternoon , " he said .
I waited for Jim down in the lobby , right by the revolving doors that led outside to the car park .
The hotel manager stood nearby , watching me with a constant , even gaze .
After five minutes , Jim ambled towards us .
When he noticed the hotel manager , he slowed his gait to the laziest of strolls - a little gesture of southern gentlemanly defiance .
There was something new in the car park now , a dozen police motorcycles lined up by the revolving doors .
" The big shut - down is beginning , " whispered Jim .
He pulled out his camera and photographed the police .
" We 're lucky , " he said .
" An hour later , we would n't have gotten near the place . "
" What did that man say to you ? " I asked .
" Oh , " said Jim , " he would just love to be of service and provide any help I needed , blah blah blah . "
" How can you say blah blah blah ? " I said .
" That was n't blah blah blah .
That was actually fucking sinister . "
" Those Bilderberg boys can be pretty sinister , " said Jim .
We climbed into our car .
I started the engine .
" So I told him that I did n't need any help wandering around the hotel , thank you all the same , " said Jim .
" Then he asked where we were staying . . . "
" Did he ? "
" And I said , ' Oh , just some flea - pit down the road . ' "
***
That evening , when I went for dinner , I put a sliver of paper in the crack between my hotel room door and the frame , as I had seen James Coburn do in Our Man Flint .
Actually , Coburn put a single hair in his door .
But my door crack was too large for single hairs , and they kept falling on to the floor and disappearing into the carpet .
I was standing there in the corridor tugging my hair out .
So I switched to a sliver of paper .
When I returned from dinner , the sliver was still there .
There was always a possibility , of course , that they 'd taken a look around and put the sliver back where they 'd found it .
I slept fitfully that night , but nothing happened .
" Mother . "
It was Tuesday morning .
Jim was leaving his regular answerphone message with his friend back in Washington DC to confirm he had not been murdered during the previous 24 hours .
" Your dutiful son is playing kick the can in Portugal .
Thank you very much . "
This was supposed to be an easy day .
Jim simply wanted to verify that the complete shut - down of the Caesar Park had been accomplished .
We would drive up there and be turned away at the gate .
Jim would ask why , for the record , and document the response in his notepad .
Then we would turn around and drive back to our hotel for a leisurely afternoon by the pool and in the bar .
But this was not to be .
We arrived at the Caesar Park to discover no police , no cordon , no shut - down .
The gatekeeper lifted the barrier and waved us on with a cheerful smile .
For the first time , Jim appeared sidestepped .
" That 's surprising , " he admitted .
" That 's surprising already . "
" Do we drive in ? "
" I'm confounded , " murmured Jim .
" We saw the shut - down begin yesterday .
We saw it with our own eyes .
And now no shut - down .
This is not what 's supposed to happen . "
The gatekeeper approached the car .
" Just drive in , " said Jim urgently .
Impulsively , I took my foot off the brake and we cruised up the drive .
This was a disconcerting new twist .
We were venturing into a place where it had been made perfectly clear that we were not welcome , and we did n't even want to be there .
We were accidental agents provocateurs , simply because we had been waved on at the gate .
" The hotel is deserted , " I said , as we pulled into the car park .
" We 're the only people here . "
" Let 's get lunch , " said Jim .
" Just two guys getting lunch . "
We wandered through the now - deserted marble lobby .
There were no more civilians .
We walked out into the silent grounds and sat at the poolside bar , the only two customers in a hotel designed for thousands .
A young waitress appeared .
" Ma'am , " said Jim , raising his trilby .
" Sir ? " she said .
" What time do you get off work ? "
The question seemed to startle her .
" Nine o'clock , " she said , cautiously .
" And what bars do you like drinking in ? " said Jim .
" There are some nice bars in the village near the cathedral . "
" Any bars in particular ? " Jim laughed .
" Do n't worry .
I 'm buying . "
" Just lots of nice bars in the village , " she said , evenly .
" That 's good information , " said Jim .
" Thank you , ma'am , " he called after her .
He turned to me .
" Now we know where the waiting staff drink .
Could be good contacts . "
" So , " I said , " shall we try the bars near the cathedral ? "
" Sure , " he said .
" Will we go , then ? "
" Okay , " said Jim .
We walked back to the car and began driving the half - mile towards the exit .
I glanced into my rear - view mirror .
A dark green Lancia had pulled out behind us .
" Jim , " I said .
" Mmm ? "
" I think we 're being followed . "
Jim turned around .
" No shit , " he grinned .
" Do n't worry .
Once we 're on the public highway , they'd be pretty foolish to try anything . "
" Okay , " I said .
" They 're not going to want to have a fat old dead reporter on the side of the road , " said Jim .
" That 's too big a news story . "
" Okay , " I said .
" But here they could say , ' Oh , we thought they were armed .
They looked threatening .
We told them to stop but they did n't stop . '
Bango ! "
" I get the picture , " I said .
A flock of geese wandered idly up the drive in front of me .
I honked my horn .
We finally reached the peach gates .
" You watch , " said Jim .
" He 'll turn around now .
He 's done his job .
Poor fool . "
But the Lancia did n't turn around .
It began to follow us down the deserted lane .
" Uh oh , " said Jim .
***
" British Embassy . "
" Okay , " I said , " I 'm a journalist from London .
I 'm calling you on the road from Sintra to Estoril . . . "
" Hold on . "
" Press office . "
" I'm a journalist from London , " I said .
" I 'm calling you on the road from Sintra to Estoril .
I 'm being tailed , right now , by a dark green Lancia belonging to the Bilderberg Group . "
There was a sharp intake of breath .
" Go on , " she said .
" I 'm sorry , " I said , " but I just heard you take a sharp breath . "
" Bilderberg ? " she said .
" Yes , " I said .
" They watched us scouting around the Caesar Park Hotel and they 've been following us ever since .
We have now been followed for three hours .
I was n't sure at first , so I stopped my car on the side of a deserted lane and he stopped his car right in front of us .
Can you imagine just how chilling that moment was ?
This is especially disconcerting because I 'm from England and I 'm not used to being spied on . "
" Do you have Bilderberg 's permission to be in Portugal ? " she said .
" Do they know you are here ? "
" No , " I said .
" Bilderberg are very secretive , " she said .
" They do n't want people looking into their business .
What are you doing here ? "
" I am essentially a humorous journalist , " I explained .
" I am a humorous journalist out of my depth .
Do you think it might help if we tell them that ? "
From the corner of my eye , I saw Jim wind down his window .
He leant his head out and blew an antagonising lady - like kiss at the Lancia .
" Hold on a second , " I said .
" Jim ! " I said , sternly .
" Please stop that . "
I lowered my voice .
" I 'm here with an American , " I said , " called Big Jim Tucker .
He 's an agent provocateur .
That might be the problem .
Perhaps you can phone Bilderberg and explain that I may be in the car with Jim Tucker , but I 'm not actually with him . "
" Listen " ' she said , urgently , " Bilderberg is much bigger than we are .
We 're very small .
We 're just a little embassy .
Do you understand ?
They 're way out of our league .
All I can say is go back to your hotel and sit tight . "
" I 'm actually just pulling into our hotel car park right now .
The Paris Hotel in Estoril .
He 's right behind me .
He 's pulling up on the street right next to the hotel .
He 's getting out of his car . . . "
" Sit tight , " she said .
" I 'll make some phone calls .
Whatever happens , do n't incite them in any way .
Do n't fan the flames . "
Before the chase had begun , Jim was lumbering and supine .
Now he jumped out of the car with the agility of a young deer .
The man from the Lancia climbed out of his car and took up a position behind a tree .
He was young , in his 30s , with short black hair .
He wore sunglasses and a dark green suit .
" I can see you ! " sang Jim .
" You 're behind the tree .
Peek - a - boo !
Smile pretty for my idiot - proof camera . "
" Jim , " I said , " will you stop that . "
But everything was beyond my control .
It was as if the invigoration of the chase had transformed Jim into a sprightly teenager .
A one - sided game of peek - a- boo ensued , during which the chaser maintained a steely expression behind his sunglasses , Jim performed a little ballet dance , and I sidled towards the swimming - pool area , attempting to distance myself from the unfolding crisis .
Jim wandered over to me .
" Am I being paranoid , " he said , " or did Bilderberg set a trap for us ?
No , listen .
Yesterday , we saw the shut - down begin .
We saw it with our own eyes .
Today , surprise surprise , no shut - down .
They let us in with a smile . . . "
Jim trailed off .

Pasadena , Calif . --
An odd , six - sided , honeycomb - shaped feature circling the entire north pole of Saturn has captured the interest of scientists with NASA 's Cassini mission .
NASA 's Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft imaged the feature over two decades ago .
The fact that it has appeared in Cassini images indicates that it is a long - lived feature .
A second hexagon , significantly darker than the brighter historical feature , is also visible in the Cassini pictures .
The spacecraft 's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer is the first instrument to capture the entire hexagon feature in one image .
" This is a very strange feature , lying in a precise geometric fashion with six nearly equally straight sides , " said Kevin Baines , atmospheric expert and member of Cassini 's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer team at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" We 've never seen anything like this on any other planet .
Indeed , Saturn 's thick atmosphere where circularly - shaped waves and convective cells dominate is perhaps the last place you 'd expect to see such a six - sided geometric figure , yet there it is .
" The hexagon is similar to Earth 's polar vortex , which has winds blowing in a circular pattern around the polar region .
On Saturn , the vortex has a hexagonal rather than circular shape .
The hexagon is nearly 25,000 kilometers ( 15,000 miles ) across .
Nearly four Earths could fit inside it .
The new images taken in thermal - infrared light show the hexagon extends much deeper down into the atmosphere than previously expected , some 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) below the cloud tops .
A system of clouds lies within the hexagon .
The clouds appear to be whipping around the hexagon like cars on a racetrack .
"
It 's amazing to see such striking differences on opposite ends of Saturn 's poles , " said Bob Brown , team leader of the Cassini visual and infrared mapping spectrometer , University of Arizona , Tucson .
" At the south pole we have what appears to be a hurricane with a giant eye , and at the north pole of Saturn we have this geometric feature , which is completely different .
" The Saturn north pole hexagon has not been visible to Cassini 's visual cameras , because it 's winter in that area , so the hexagon is under the cover of the long polar night , which lasts about 15 years .
The infrared mapping spectrometer can image Saturn in both daytime and nighttime conditions and see deep inside .
It imaged the feature with thermal wavelengths near 5 microns ( seven times the wavelength visible to the human eye ) during a 12 - day period beginning on Oct. 30 , 2006 .
As winter wanes over the next two years , the feature may become visible to the visual cameras .
Based on the new images and more information on the depth of the feature , scientists think it is not linked to Saturn 's radio emissions or to auroral activity , as once contemplated , even though Saturn 's northern aurora lies nearly overhead .
The hexagon appears to have remained fixed with Saturn 's rotation rate and axis since first glimpsed by Voyager 26 years ago .
The actual rotation rate of Saturn is still uncertain .
" Once we understand its dynamical nature , this long - lived , deep - seated polar hexagon may give us a clue to the true rotation rate of the deep atmosphere and perhaps the interior , " added Baines .

Well I was perusing some youtube channels and found an “ 8 - bit remix of a song that I thought I recognized by Amon Amarth …
Then I looked it up and realized it ’s a new song and they have a new album coming out in two weeks !
Here ’s the real song :
For completeness sake , here ’s the song I THOUGHT it was ( Twilight of the Thunder God ) .
Give me a break , a lot of their songs have something to do with gods and stuff .
Plus it was a 8 - bit version and there are parts that are similar …

Usage notes [ edit ]
When the preposition a is followed by a masculine definite article , el or els , it is contracted with it to the forms al and als respectively .
If el would be elided to the form l’ because it is before a word beginning with a vowel , the elision to a l ’ takes precedence over contracting to al .
The same occurs with the salat article es , to form as except where es would be elided to s’ .

Usage notes [ edit ]
The definite article o ( in all its forms ) regularly forms contractions when it follows the prepositions a ( “ to ” ) , con ( “ with ” ) , de ( “ of , from ” ) , and en ( “ in ” ) .
For example , con a ( “ with the ” ) contracts to coa , and en a ( “ in the ” ) contracts to na .
Also , the definite article presents a second form that could be represented as <-lo/- la/- los/- las > , or either lack any specific representation .
Its origin is in the assimilation of the last consonant of words ended in -s or -r , due to sandhi , with the /l/ present in the article in pre-Galician - Portuguese period .
So Vou comer o caldo or Vou come - lo caldo are representations of / ˈβowˈkomelo̝ˈkaldo̝ / ( " I 'm going to have my soup " ) .
This phenomenon , rare in Portuguese , is already documented in 13th century Medieval Galician texts , as the Cantigas de Santa Maria . [ 1 ]

Clearly there is no question or doubt about the names of the vowels A , E , I , O , U .
They are simply long A , long E , etc. ( ā , ē , ī , ō , ū ) .
Nor is there any uncertainty with respect to the six mutes B , C , D , G , P , T .
Their names are bē , cē , dē , gē , pē , tē ( each with a long E ) .

A “ friend ” of Vice President Joseph Biden ’s daughter , Ashley , is attempting to hawk a videotape that he claims shows her snorting cocaine at a house party this month in Delaware .
UPDATE : Ashley Biden ’s Past of Parties & Pot
PHOTOS : Ashley Biden
The anonymous male acquaintance of Ashley took the video , said Thomas Dunlap , a lawyer representing the seller .
Dunlap and a man claiming to be a lawyer showed The Post about 90 seconds of 43 - minute tape , saying it was legally obtained and that Ashley was aware she was being filmed .
The Post refused to pay for the video .
The video , which the shooter initially hoped to sell for $ 2 million before scaling back his price to $ 400,000 , shows a 20 - something woman with light skin and long brown hair taking a red straw from her mouth , bending over a desk , inserting the straw into her nostril and snorting lines of white powder .
She then stands up and begins talking with other people in the room .
A young man looks on from behind her , facing the camera .
The lawyers said he was Ashley ’s boyfriend of a few years .
The camera follows the woman from a few feet away , focusing on her as she moves around the room .
It appears not to be concealed .
At one point she shouts , “ Shut the f — up ! ”
The woman appears to resemble Ashley Biden , 27 , a social worker for a Delaware child - welfare agency and a visible presence during her father ’s campaign for the White House .
The dialogue is difficult to discern , but the woman makes repeated references to the drugs , said the lawyers , who said they viewed the tape about 15 times .
“ At one point she pretty much complains that the line is n’t big enough , ” said the second lawyer , who declined to identify himself .
“ And she talks about her dad . ”
Biden has been an outspoken crusader against drugs , coining the term “ drug czar ” in 1982 while campaigning for a more forceful “ war on drugs . ”
The lawyers declined to name the person who shot the video , but said he knew Ashley well and had attended other parties with her at which there were illegal drugs .
The lawyers said the shooter used a camera with a hard - disc drive that he later destroyed , drilling into the device and tossing it into a lake .
The woman in the video acknowledges the camera in a way that makes it clear she knows she ’s being recorded , the lawyers said , waving at it during a part of the video not shown to The Post .
No one else in the video is seen using the drugs .
The portion of the tape shown to The Post ends shortly after the woman ’s alleged ingestion .
The shooter claims that he previously tape - recorded Ashley at a party in August , but was unsuccessful in his attempts to sell that video , they said .
An American media company offered $ 250,000 for the footage and access to the person who shot the tape , according to the lawyers .
Another company , based overseas , offered $ 225,000 , they said .
The unnamed lawyer hinted that his client had additional information that could embarrass the vice president ’s daughter .
“ The higher the price , the more he ’ll reveal , ” said the lawyer .
The lawyers said the video shooter was afraid of being identified and prosecuted for his role in the alleged drug use .
“ He ’s got a criminal - defense attorney , ” said Dunlap , who has offices in Virginia and the District of Columbia .
The other lawyer said Ashley did n’t have Secret Service protection at the time of the party because she complained about agents blocking her driveway .
“ She complained to her dad about it and he got rid of them , ” he said .
This is n’t the first brush with scandal for Ashley , who was arrested in 2002 when she yelled at a cop trying to arrest her disorderly friend outside a Chicago club , according to published report .
She was charged with obstructing , but the rap was later dropped after she apologized .
Ashley is the youngest of three siblings , and the only one born to the vice president and his second wife , Jill .
Joe Biden ’s first wife , Neilia , and 13 - month - old daughter , Naomi , died in a 1972 car crash .
Her two half - brothers are Beau , 40 , and Hunter , 39 .
Phone messages left at the offices of Vice President Biden and Jill Biden , who were in Chile last night for meetings with South American leaders on economic issues , were not immediately returned .
Ashley also did not respond to messages left at her Delaware home .
To woo the young , the GOP could also use some new voices ; a recent Pew poll even reports that 75 percent of Republicans have no idea who the leader of their party is .
Lately , the two most prominent spokesmen have been Newt Gingrich and Dick Cheney , which should tell you plenty .
Gingrich peaked in 1998 , when he was compelled to quit as House speaker .
And one can only imagine how young voters view Cheney .
Not only does he epitomize the rot of the Bush era , he also looks like a haunted - house character in an old Charles Addams cartoon .

I ’ve been fairly quiet about Jenny McCarthy ’s campaign against childhood vaccinations , partly because Dr. David Gorski has covered the issue so thoroughly already , and partly because of my “ do not engage ” policy relating to the deeply irrational ( i.e. there ’s no winning an argument with “ crazy . ” )
But this week I was filled with a renewed sense of urgency regarding the anti-vaccinationist movement for two reasons : 1 ) I received a personal email from a woman who is being treated with hostility by her peers for her pro-science views on vaccines and 2 ) a friend forwarded me a video of Jenny McCarthy speaking directly to moms , instructing them to avoid vaccinating their kids or giving them milk or wheat because of their supposed marijuana - like addictive properties .
Anti-Vaccination Views Are A Status Symbol ?
I was surprised to discover that some pro-science moms are being mocked by peers who are uninterested in evidence , choosing to believe any dubious source of health information that questions the “ medical establishment . ”
This concerned mom writes :
I am the mother of two young children , and I live in the trenches of the anti-vax woo .
In my circle of about 14 mothers , my anecdotal analysis is that the rate of complete vaccination hovers around 60 % .
The mothers in this group are all very well educated , middle - class or affluent , predominantly stay - home mothers .
One problem is what they consider reliable sources of information .
They rely on anecdotes and dismiss scientific evidence in part because they are very anti-medical establishment .
The group is self - validating and many shared values ( and myths ) increase in intensity over time .
Many of the mothers practice “ Natural Family Living ” which has some appealing aspects , but also harbors elements of a cult .
In this environment , anti-vaccination becomes a very powerful status symbol …
I have lost friendships and been partially ousted from this circle because of my views .
This note struck a chord with me , since I experienced similar hostility in the past for voicing my concern about pseudoscience and misleading consumer health information .
I was accused of being “ paternalistic , narrow - minded , a dinosaur – part of a dying breed , a racist against complementary and alternative medicine , and a Bible school teacher , preaching evidence - based medicine , ” insulted for my desire to be accurate about what was known and not known about treatment options , and my expertise , training , and academic credentials were called into question publicly on many occasions .
I endured all of this primarily at the hands of someone who supposedly believed in “ natural healing ” and the “ art of kindness ” as an integral part of patient care .
I am troubled by the mounting antagonism towards those of us who ’d like to use critical thinking and scientific reasoning to learn what we can about medicine and our health .
I ’m not sure what to do about it except to encourage one another to stand strong for science and reason – to expect all manner of attacks and insults , and to be firmly committed to the objective quest for truth .
It shall set us free .
Jenny McCarthy – Inaccurate , Unhelpful And Dangerous Advice
Although I find Jenny McCarthy ’s advice and opinions painful to watch , I committed myself to viewing her recent video at my friend ’s request .
In order to spare you similar discomfort , let me simply summarize what she said so you can get a high level overview of the sort of bizarre and misinformed claims she promotes ( feel free to check out the video for yourself ) .
“ Autism is not primarily a genetic disorder , but caused by vaccine - related toxins ( including mercury , aluminum , ether , anti-freeze , and human aborted fetal tissue ) and pesticides . ”
A recent study published in Nature links genetic alternations in DNA that codes for neuronal cell adhesion molecules to autism spectrum disorders .
A mercury - autism link has been fully debunked .
An aluminum - autism link has been disproven .
There is no ether , anti-freeze or human tissue in vaccines .
There is no conclusive evidence of a link between pesticides and autism .
“ Kids get ‘ stoned ’ by wheat and dairy toxins .
Giving them wheat or dairy proteins is like giving children marijuana . ”
There is currently no evidence that any diet improves or worsens the symptoms of autism spectrum disorders .
In fact , whole grains and dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet for most children .
“ Food allergies are like Iran and Iraq .
Glial cells ( they ’re like chef cell ) provide food to the neuron kings .
Glial cells can turn into Rambo to fight Iran and Iraq .
If a child is allergic to everything , the Rambo cells stop feeding the neurons and the neurons starve .
That causes the symptoms of autism . ”
I do n’t know what to say about this strange analogy – clearly no science - based information here .
“ To treat autism , you need to give your child supplements to fight off the yeast in their bodies .
I recommend Super Nathera , Culturelle , Cod Liver Oil , Caprylic Acid , CoQ10 , Calcium , Vitamin C , Selenium , Zinc , Vitamin B12 , B6 , and Magnesium . ”
There is no evidence of efficacy for any of these supplements in the treatment of autism .
“ You need to consult with a DAN !
Practitioner . ”
DAN !
Practitioners recommend chelation therapy for the treatment of autism .
There is no evidence that chelation therapy has any benefit for children with autism , and in fact , can be fatal .
“ Whatever you think becomes your reality .
Imagine your child going to his / her prom and he ’ll be cured . ”
I think it ’s pretty clear that Jenny McCarthy ’s recommendations range from ineffective ( imaginary healing ) to harmful ( malnutrition related to absent dairy and wheat in the diet , excessive levels of vitamins ) to deadly ( chelation therapy with DAN !
Practitioners ) .
Will mothers watching her new show on Oprah fall for her pseudoscience and poor advice ?
I was pleased to see this open letter to Oprah from one concerned mom .
Here ’s an excerpt :
To me , it is clear that a significant number of people look up to you , and trust your advice and judgment .
That is why it is such a huge mistake for you to endorse Jenny McCarthy with her own show on your network .
Surely you must realize that McCarthy is neither a medical professional nor a scientist .
And yet she acts as a spokesperson for the anti-vaccination movement , a movement that directly impacts people ’s health .
Claims that vaccines are unsafe and cause autism have been refuted time after time , but their allure persists in part because of high - profile champions for ignorance like McCarthy .
In fact , ten of the thirteen authors of the paper that sparked the modern anti-vaccination movement retracted the explosive conclusions they made due to insufficient evidence .
Furthermore , it is now clear that the study ’s main author , Andrew Wakefield , falsified data to support these shaky conclusions .
We have come close to eradicating life - threatening and crippling illnesses because of vaccines , but are now struggling to prevent outbreaks because of parents ’ philosophical beliefs that vaccines are harmful .
Realize this : when someone chooses not to vaccinate their child , they are n’t just putting their own child at risk , they are putting everyone else around them at risk .
Diseases with vaccines should normally be of little concern even to unprotected individuals due to herd immunity – with the majority of the population immune , unprotected individuals are less likely to come into contact with the pathogen .
Unfortunately , herd immunity disintegrates as fewer people are vaccinated , putting everyone who has n’t yet been vaccinated at greater risk for infection .
Now , the rates of infection by diseases for which we have safe and effective vaccines are climbing , thanks to anti-vaccination activists like Jenny McCarthy .
You reach millions of people everyday and your words and endorsements carry an incredible amount of weight .
If you say to buy a certain book , people will buy it .
If you do a segment on a certain charity , people will contribute .
And if you say that what Jenny McCarthy is saying has merit , people will believe you …
Conclusion
A certain segment of society appears to be emotionally invested in medical beliefs that are not based on science , but rather anecdotes , conspiracy theories , and magical thinking .
Those who recommend a more objective method of inquiry may be subject to ridicule and hostility by that segment .
Nonetheless , it is important ( for public health and safety purposes and the advancement of science ) for critical thinking to be promoted and defended .
While some celebrities , like Jenny McCarthy , are committed to misinforming the public about their children ’s health – parents who recognize the deception are speaking out against it .
Perhaps the best way to combat Jenny ’s propaganda is to boycott Oprah .
Refusing to support the promotion of dangerous pseudoscience may be our best defense .

OTTAWA – Industry Minister Tony Clement is warning U.S. Steel that Ottawa may take legal action against the company over its temporary lay - off of Canadian workers .
In a letter to the company today , Clement said U.S. Steel must live up to the commitments on production and other business dealings the firm made when it was allowed by the federal government to take over Stelco Inc. in 2007 .
" I am concerned by the actions of U.S. Steel in cutting operations in Canada and by the impact this will have on its workers , " Clement said in the letter , which is the first step in the enforcement process under the Investment Canada Act that governs foreign acquisitions of Canadian corporations .
" While I recognize that these are challenging economic times , we expect the company to live up to its commitments . "
In March , U.S. Steel said it was temporarily shutting down most of its production at two large former Stelco operations in Ontario – in Hamilton and Nanticoke – which has left the future of 1,500 employees up in the air .
Speaking with reporters , Clement threatened that the government could go as far as trying to nullify U.S. Steel 's takeover or ask a court of levy fines on the American corporation .
" We have a number of options that are available to us , including unwinding the deal , seeking court penalties of $ 10,000 per day and seeking a court ruling that would force a rectification of the situation to the deal that was signed , " he said .
" What I 'm signalling to you is I take these agreements seriously .
When you have signed a deal with the Canadian government to invest in Canada , we expect you to honour the deal . "
The company is expected to respond today .
A predawn blast from an explosive device damaged a sidewalk bench and shattered windows at a Starbucks coffee shop on the Upper East Side on Monday , the police said .
No one was injured , but the authorities were investigating whether it was linked to previous blasts in Manhattan .
Residents near the Starbucks , at 1642 Third Avenue , at 92nd Street , were jolted awake about 3:30 a.m. , when the device exploded , setting off car alarms .
“ It sounded like a bomb , to the extent that I know what a bomb sounds like , ” said Casey Mallinckrodt , who lives one block north .
Emergency workers briefly evacuated occupants from five apartments above the coffee shop , in case it had been a gas explosion .

Meraz Ahmad Jalaluddin Ansari lost everything in the riots .
Pics : Soutik Biswas
Muslims in India 's Gujarat state who bore the brunt of religious riots in 2002 say they have been abandoned by the political parties .
The BBC's Soutik Biswas met some riot victims ahead of the general election in the state .
The acrid smell of burning oil singes your nose and eyes as you walk into Bombay Hotel , a sprawling ghetto of Muslim - owned homes on the eastern flank of Ahmedabad , the main city in western Gujarat state .
A pall of black factory smoke hangs over this untidy patchwork of squat , ugly houses .
Residents pay 150 rupees ( $ 3 ) a month to a private contractor who supplies yellow - coloured drinking water through dirty garden pipes .
Sewage flows out into the street .
Bombay Hotel , which takes it name after a local roadside eatery , is one of the places where many Muslims displaced by the 2002 Gujarat riots moved to .
Over the past seven years , it has transformed from a remote industrial colony to become a busy refugee settlement .
The anti-Muslim riots , sparked off by the death of Hindu pilgrims in the firebombing of a train , led to the death of 1,392 people in five districts , according to official records .
NGOs say the toll is closer to 2,000 .
Shambolic
The riots also left some 140,000 people homeless .
They were put up in camps and given 2,500 rupees by the government - the majority of the displaced were in Ahmedabad city .
Thirty - six - year - old Meraz Ahmad Jalaluddin Ansari is one of them .
Bombay Hotel is a Muslim ghetto which lacks basic amenities
He was lucky that he did not lose any relatives in the riots .
He and his family fled their home in the Chamanpura area after Hindu neighbours warned them that the rioters were closing in .
But he did lose his home and livelihood .
He had hired a dozen workers and owned 15 sewing machines .
He would make , he says , 15,000 to 20,000 rupees a month from embroidery work .
After fleeing the riots and panic - selling his house to a local Hindu neighbour for 275,000 rupees , Mr Ansari moved into Bombay Hotel .
His living standards are shambolic , the markets where he can sell his wares are now 10 - 12 km away , and his children are soon going to lose their neighbourhood municipal school .
It will be scrapped to make way for a bus lane .
Mr Ansari has picked up the pieces again , built a new home and managed to buy about five sewing machines to start work .
He can no longer afford to employ people .
The government , he says , gave him compensation of 300 rupees for the damage to his house in Chamanpura .
" Once I was fairly well to do .
Now I work a lot more and just manage , " he says .
" Life ca n't come to a halt .
But sometimes I feel we are the living dead . "
Noor Banu and her husband are still trying to pay back a loan
The riots do not find any echo in the general elections in Gujarat .
Seven years after the incident , both the ruling BJP and Congress party remain silent on the shoddy rehabilitation of the victims or the delay in bringing the culprits to justice .
" We can not vote for the BJP and the Congress almost has a fixed deposit on our votes .
So it 's a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea , " says Mr Ansari .
There is little talk of the impending polls at Bombay Hotel .
When you raise the subject , the residents turn their faces away in disgust .
" Before the 2002 riots , there were just a few houses here .
Now there are 15,000 houses and 80,000 people .
Muslims have moved in from all over .
They feel relatively safe here , " says Shabit Ali Ansari , 32 , who owns a sweets shop .
" But no party does anything for Muslims .
The authorities do nothing for people here unless we raise a storm , " he says .
Cynical Barber shops , groceries , sweets shops and even a photo studio that have sprung up in the grubby lanes do brisk business .
But residents work on pitifully low wages .
Riot victims like Noor Banu , 45 , and her husband , Ashik Ali Badar Ali , 50 , who moved here after their house was attacked in the Saraspur area , are struggling to make ends meet .
The neighbourhood school is being demolished Mr Ali used to drive an auto rickshaw and bring home up to 150 rupees a day .
Now he earns barely 1,800 rupees a month working as a security guard .
Their three daughters chip in making lacquered bangles to help pay back a loan of 70,000 rupees the family borrowed for the two - room hovel in which they live .
Next door , Asiyana Ahmed Sheikh , 12 , makes kites .
And Zarin Aslambhai Ghanchi gets less than one US cent for cutting and stitching together a campaign banner for a political party .
" Even the political parties exploit us when giving us jobs .
This is the state of affairs here , " says Zarin .
Ashik Ali Badar
Ali says he is going to vote for the Hindu nationalist BJP , which was blamed for inaction during the rioting .
" The BJP is an open enemy of the Muslims , and the Congress is a hidden enemy .
I 'd rather vote for the open enemy , so I can go to them for protection . "
Muslims comprise barely 10 % of the population in Gujarat .
" Despite the riots and the headlines , the political parties here feel that they can ignore them , because they do n't comprise a decisive vote bank , " says analyst Achyut Yagnik .

EA is no stranger to piracy trouble .
Spore was leaked online before the game 's retail release , and ironically the DRM the game shipped with to stop piracy caused a huge backlash with gamers , leading to Amazon getting review - bombed .
Well buckle up : it looks as is if Sims 3 is the latest game to be leaked .
You can't really verify this news directly without ... you know .... breaking the law , so we can't say for sure if the files are real .
We 're also not going to point you in any particular direction .
What we can say is that a torrent claiming to be the game has popped up in a number of places , with downloaders reporting that the game is working fine .
The release notes on the torrent gives pirates instructions , and a stern moral warning : " Be sure to have a firewall prevent the launcher and main game from going online , " it warns .
" Support the software developers .
If you like this game , BUY IT ! "
This is bad news for EA as the game is still two weeks away from release .
The game also does n't require online activation to play .
" The game will have disc - based copy protection — there is a Serial Code just like The Sims 2 .
To play the game there will not be any online authentication needed , " EA said on the official site .
" We feel like this is a good , time - proven solution that makes it easy for you to play the game without DRM methods that feel overly invasive or leave you concerned about authorization server access in the distant future . "
Ars contacted EA for comment , but has yet to hear back — which is not all that surprising .
" Yes , the file is real ? "
ACE
Team recently had some success talking directly to pirates and asking them to buy the game instead of pirating it , but EA can have something of a tin ear when it comes to listening to what gamers want .
At the Game Developers Conference this year Microsoft announced technology that would require games such as Sims 3 to be activated once online before the game would work , allowing publishers to control the spread of a game even if street date were to be broken .

MESSENGER Reveals Mercury as a Dynamic Planet
Press Release From : Johns Hopkins University
Posted : Thursday , April 30 , 2009
Analyses of data from the MErcury Surface , Space ENvironment , GEochemistry , and Ranging ( MESSENGER ) spacecraft�s second flyby of Mercury in October 2008 show that the planet�s atmosphere , magnetosphere , and geological past are all characterized by much greater levels of activity than scientists first suspected .
On October 6 , 2008 , the probe flew by Mercury for the second time , capturing more than 1,200 high - resolution and color images of the planet unveiling another 30 percent of Mercury�s surface that had never before been seen by spacecraft and gathering essential data for planning the remainder of the mission .
�MESSENGER�s second Mercury flyby provided a number of new findings , � says MESSENGER Principal Investigator Sean Solomon at the Carnegie Institution of Washington .
� One of the biggest surprises was how strongly the planet�s magnetospheric dynamics changed from what we saw during the first Mercury flyby in January 2008 .
Another was the discovery of a large and unusually well preserved impact basin that was the focus for concentrated volcanic and deformational activity .
The first detection of magnesium in Mercury�s exosphere and neutral tail provides confirmation that magnesium is an important constituent of Mercury�s surface materials .
And our nearly global imaging coverage of the surface after this flyby has given us fresh insight into how the planet 's crust was formed . �
These findings are reported in four papers published in the May 1 issue of Science magazine .
An Abundance of Magnesium
The probe�s Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer , or MASCS , detected significant amounts of magnesium in the planet�s atmosphere , reports William McClintock of the University of Colorado at Boulder�s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics .
� Detecting magnesium was not too surprising , but seeing it in the amounts and distribution we recorded was unexpected , � said McClintock , a MESSENGER co-investigator and lead author of one of the four papers .
� This is an example of the kind of individual discoveries that the MESSENGER team will piece together to give us a new picture of how the planet formed and evolved . �
The instrument also measured other exospheric constituents during the October 6 flyby , including calcium and sodium , and he suspects that additional metallic elements from the surface including aluminum , iron , and silicon also contribute to the exosphere .
Radically Different Magnetosphere
MESSENGER observed a radically different magnetosphere at Mercury during its second flyby , compared with its earlier January 14 encounter , writes MESSENGER co-investigator James Slavin , of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center , lead author of another paper .
� During the first flyby , MESSENGER entered through the dusk side of the magnetic tail , measuring relatively calm dipole - like magnetic fields closer to the planet , and then exited the magnetosphere near dawn , � Slavin says .
� Important discoveries were made , but scientists didn�t detect any dynamic features , other than some Kelvin - Helmholtz waves along its outer boundary , the magnetopause . �
But the second flyby was a totally different situation , he says .
� MESSENGER measured large magnetic flux leakage through the dayside magnetopause , about a factor of 10 greater than even what is observed at the Earth during its most active intervals .
The high rate of solar wind energy input was evident in the great amplitude of the plasma waves and the large magnetic structures measured by the Magnetometer throughout the encounter . �
The magnetospheric variability observed thus far by MESSENGER supports the hypothesis that the great day - to - day changes in Mercury�s atmosphere may be due to changes in the shielding provided by the magnetosphere .
The Rembrandt Basin
One of the most exciting results of MESSENGER�s second flyby of Mercury is the discovery of a previously unknown large impact basin .
The Rembrandt basin is more than 700 kilometers ( 430 miles ) in diameter and if formed on the east coast of the United States would span the distance between Washington , D.C. , and Boston .
The Rembrandt basin formed about 3.9 billion years ago , near the end of the period of heavy bombardment of the inner Solar System , suggests MESSENGER Participating Scientist Thomas Watters , lead author of another of the papers .
Although ancient , the Rembrandt basin is younger than most other known impact basins on Mercury .
� This is the first time we�ve seen terrain exposed on the floor of an impact basin on Mercury that is preserved from when it formed � says Watters .
� Landforms such as those revealed on the floor of Rembrandt are usually completely buried by volcanic flows . �
Mercury�s Crustal Evolution
Just over a year ago , half of Mercury was unknown .
Globes of the planet were blank on one side .
With image data from MESSENGER , scientists have now seen 90 percent of the planet�s surface at high resolution and can start to assess what this global picture is telling us about the history of the planet 's crustal evolution , says Brett Denevi , a MESSENGER team member at Arizona State University and lead author of one of the papers .
� After mapping the surface , we see that approximately 40 percent is covered by smooth plains , � she says .
� Many of these smooth plains are interpreted to be of volcanic origin , and they are globally distributed ( in contrast with the Moon , which has a nearside / farside asymmetry in the abundance of volcanic plains ) .
But we haven�t yet seen evidence for a feldspar - rich crust , which makes up the majority of the lunar highlands and is thought to have formed by flotation during the cooling of an early lunar magma ocean .
Instead , much of Mercury 's crust may have formed through repeated volcanic eruptions in a manner more similar to the crust of Mars than to that of the Moon . �
Scientists continue to examine data from the first two flybys and are preparing to gather even more information from a third flyby of the planet on September 29 , 2009 .
� The third Mercury flyby is our final �dress rehearsal� for the main performance of our mission : insertion of our probe into orbit around Mercury in March 2011 and the continuous collection of information about the planet and its environment for one year , � adds Solomon .
� The orbital phase of our mission will be like staging two flybys per day .
We�ll be drinking from a fire hose of new data , but at least we�ll never be thirsty .
Mercury has been coy in revealing its secrets slowly so far , but in less than two years the innermost planet will become a close friend . �

The Safe Word
I ’m writing this with your best interests at heart :
Get a rope .
I ’m not a big fan of the furry handcuffs version of bondage .
Forget the wrists - to - the - headboard hogwash .
Okay , it was good enough for Vince Vaughn in Wedding Crashers .
It ’s a place to start , but do n’t stop there .
Why bother , you ask .
Bondage is just fancy - boy foreplay , right ?
No .
The thing is , sex has become obsessively egalitarian .
How was it for you , honey ?
Did you come ?
Yes , did you ?
How many times ?
Everybody wants to play “ share the cookies . ”
That ’s fine , but painting by numbers gets tiresome after a while when , after all , everybody just wants to be taken for a ride .
Here ’s the not - so - secret appeal of bondage :
When I ’m strapped down , it ’s all on my partner .
I mean , I ’m not going anywhere and someone ’s having a little fun making me go crazy .
Then it ’s my turn .
So here , in seven easy steps , is one Boy Scout ’s manual on fun with rope :
1 . Buy it by the yard and use it all .
Two or three lengths of 20 - 30 foot rope will be plenty .
Tie her arms behind her back .
Tie up your boy ’s junk and make him know the pleasures of an undersized thong .
Lash his forearms together , tie his ankles to that and see what you find hanging out .
You think your girl ’s nipples are sensitive now ?
Try putting rope tight across her breasts .
2 . Do n’t use some dirty old dog leash .
You can pick up soft nylon line at Home Depot for pennies per foot .
Try not to chortle as the high - school boy is cutting it for you .
Parachute cord , climbing rope , and jute rope work fine , too .
Experiment .
The thinner the rope , the sharper it feels and the more marks it leaves on the skin .
But marks , you may discover , are your favorite part .
The Japanese “ masters ” and their many acolytes prefer hemp rope .
It feels good , smells great , and leaves deep and lasting marks .
In my opinion , it gives the most bang .
It ’s also about a buck per foot .
3. Safety first .
Do n’t put rope around anyone ’s neck , ever , Jeffrey .
Do n’t cinch down hard on nerve centers like the elbows or knees .
A good rule of thumb on tightness :
If you can slide your finger under the rope , he ’ll be fine .
If his feet or hands get cold it ’s time for a break .
Just use your ears ; your partner will tell you if something goes awry .
4 . Keep it simple , sexy .
If you can tie your shoes , you know enough to wrap someone up like a gift box .
There are handy online tutorials ( NSFW ) around if you need them , but do n’t get intimidated by the fetish crowd ’s fancy poses and knot - work .
Learn a two - column tie and a rope cuff , and you can make any body the 3 - D canvas for your twisted imagination .
5 . Get around .
Austin is a rope - friendly town .
There ’s a local SIG and occasional bondage - themed parties in the BDSM scene .
There are well - attended conferences if you want to get wrapped up in it .
6. Hardcore is optional .
Bondage does n’t have to be Bettie Page tableaus or kidnapping scenes out of 24 ( not that there ’s anything wrong with that … ) .
You can use rope to tie someone up just because it looks hot .
Tie two people together – that ’s fun .
Craft a predicament for your friend , or friends , to escape from .
Tie someone down for S&M games .
If you want to go art house , there ’s always rope suspension and getting people airborne .
I recommend you get schooled at the cons or with local gurus for the advanced mojo .
7. Curb your inner geek .
Believe it or not , this can be hard to avoid for a certain type of person .
Bondage is about bodies – not the rope .
And as fun as it is to learn every knot under the sun , rope is just the hardware .
I like to think of rope as an extension of my arms .
Lots of things you can do with your arms , you can do with rope .
Hold your partner tight , or loose .
Grab a wrist and do n’t let go .
Put those legs right where you want them .
Lay the ropes just so and they ’ll do magic things you usually do with your fingers .
And hey , look !
Your fingers are still free .

The crowd apparently surged forward , and a wire fence collapsed At least 11 people have been killed in the Moroccan capital Rabat , following a stampede at a world music concert .
Some 40 were injured when a wire fence collapsed at the Mawazine festival .
The incident happened on Saturday night , when some 70,000 spectators were packed into the Hay Nahda stadium to see Moroccan singer Abdelaziz Stati .
The nine - day - long event has featured such international stars as Kylie Minogue , Algerian rai singer Khaled , Alicia Keys and Stevie Wonder .
Analysts say the nine - day - long Mawazine festival is one of several events aimed at promoting Morocco 's image as a modern , tolerant nation .
But some of the country 's Islamist politicians have denounced the concerts as encouraging immoral behaviour .
Hurry to leave
The festival was drawing to a close when the stampede occurred .
Shortly after midnight on Sunday morning , thousands of spectators hurried to leave and a wire fence toppled over .
According to police , five women , four men and two children died in the ensuing crush .
Several people were taken to hospital after the incident Governor of Rabat Hassan Lamrani blamed the stampede on an attempt by some concert goers to rush out of the stadium by jumping security fences .
" At the end of the concert and despite the existence of seven gates , a group of citizens decided to go over the metal barriers to have a quick exit , " Mr Lamrani said .
But one of the dozens of concert - goers injured in the crush told Reuters news agency police were partly responsible for the incident .
" The doors were closed by the police and we were forced to leave the stadium from some places not destined for this purpose .
The police did not intervene . "
Rescuers helped to pull out survivors and transport the injured to hospital , where seven people remain under observation , according to AFP news agency .
Deadly crowd stampedes in Africa are usually associated with sports events , according to BBC North Africa correspondent Rana Jawad .
But this is the second known incident of its kind in the region ; in 2007 a stampede at a concert in Tunisia killed seven people .

When it rains , it pours .
When you lie , it eventually comes out .
Here it comes .... from Daily Kos , via NPR .... GOP explain this one ...
NPR is reporting that Alberto Gonzales while the White House Atty , not the Atty Gen , was approving the Torture of Abu Zubaydah months before the Aug. Torture Memos were even written .
It appears the ACLU has the proof from a ongoing court case .
The source says nearly every day , Mitchell would sit at his computer and write a top secret cable to the CIA ’s counterterrorism center .
Each day , Mitchell would request permission to use enhanced interrogation techniques on Zubaydah .
The source says the CIA would then forward the request to the White House , where White House counsel Alberto Gonzales would sign off on the technique .
That would provide the Administration ’s legal blessing for Mitchell to increase the pressure on Zubaydah in the next interrogation .
Late May 19 , the CIA sent the ACLU a spreadsheet as part of a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act .
The log shows the number of top secret cables that went from Zubaydah ’s black site prison to CIA headquarters each day .
Through the spring and summer of 2002 , the log shows someone sent headquarters several cables a day .
I do n't care what the Obama White House , this torture crap and what the Bush Administration did will not go away .
More science and politics news , and this time it 's heartening : as promised last week , Obama has signed an Executive Order today reversing the ban on federal funding of stem cells .
You may recall he promised to do this during his campaign , and made a point of it in his answers for Science Debate 2008 .
He even went further , adding to the Order a section to protect scientific research against political influence :
Although officials would not go into details , the memorandum will order the Office of Science and Technology Policy to " assure a number of effective standards and practices that will help our society feel that we have the highest - quality individuals carrying out scientific jobs and that information is shared with the public , " said Harold Varmus , who co-chairs Obama 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology .
That is very , very good news .
I wrote extensively over the past few years on how the Bush Administration unduly influenced the progress and release of scientific research due to what was clearly partisan and ideological beliefs .
Again , Obama promised to do this in the Science Debate 2008 answers , and he has again followed through .
The hard work will begin soon , enforcing this policy and making sure narrow ideological beliefs do not impede our investigation of reality .
But that 's work I bet a lot of people will be eager to undertake .

So , no one is happy with Congress these days ( least of all Congressional GOP at 12 ) , though the Democratic party still has a major lead over the fading GOP nationally .
Nancy Pelosi takes this week 's biggest hit in the R2 K poll .
And for the first time , right and wrong track are tied in the Daily Kos Research 2000 poll at 48 .
But the interesting graphs are about the GOP disliking Obama , and the continuing regional nature of same .
It is especially interesting in light of National Journal 's cover story , from Ron Brownstein ( For GOP , A Southern Exposure ) , which reflects something we 've been saying since before the election - the South masks how weak the GOP is elsewhere .
This from National Journal :
Republican strength in the South has both compensated for and masked the extent of the GOP 's decline elsewhere .
By several key measures , the party is now weaker outside the South than at any time since the Depression ; in some ways , it is weaker than ever before .
Take a look at these non-South numbers , for example :
The National Journal story has some terrific graphs and good discussion about Congress , not just the Presidency ( we will take a closer look this weekend . )
Our regular readers are , of course , not surprised .
This is from Daily Kos ( 5/08 ) :
Know what else it means ?
The Republicans , under George W. Bush , have succeeded in remaking themselves from a national party into a regional party ( the South ) .
The chickens are coming home to roost .

I tweet , you tweet , but who knew a volcano could tweet ?
Mount Redoubt in Alaska has been belching out steam and ash for several weeks now .
Images and updates have been streaming out of the Alaska Volcano Observatory ( AVO ) at a steady pace because nothing seems to grab the attention of the public like a good volcano eruption .
AVO is using web technology - live - streaming pictures from the mountain using web cams -– to get more information out to a hungry public .
Their Web site has enough techno - speak to make any geologist dance with glee .
But what of the average person who just wants to know when Redoubt is about to burp ?
Enter Twitter .
AVO is using the microblogging site ( @alaska_avo ) to alert followers about steam emissions , ash plumes , and aviation advisories .
The tweets are relatively simple ( i.e. : There was a small explosion at Redoubt at 16:07 AKDT ) , but scientists use Twittermail to give more details .
Ken Woods , one of the IT gurus for AVO , said a mom ’s concern for her son gave them the idea of using Twitter .
“ There was a lady in the Midwest whose son lives in Alaska , and she wrote to us asking us to use Twitter so she could find out what the conditions were like for her son , ” Woods said .
She was just the beginning - now more than 6,000 people follow Redoubt 's status on Twitter .
Woods says about 25 percent of those people have relatives living near the volcano .
Even a 98 - year - old woman in Orlando , Florida , is following the Redoubt tweets on Twitter because her grandson lives in Anchorage .
Woods said having people follow the volcano on Twitter helps keep the load on his main Web site more manageable .
AVO is monitoring more than 130 volcanic areas – including 50 that have been active since 1760 .
The Redoubt tweets appear to come from the operations center ’s log entries .
A recent post indicated a change requested by some of the 6,000 people following Redoubt .
The tweet read , “ If ops center makes log entry 75 % equal to immedatly prior entry , will b sent to log , but not twitter .
Eliminates same tweet over and over . ”
Customer service from a volcano !
Now if we can just get earthquakes and hurricanes to follow suit .

Deng Yujiao , a waitress in Hubei Province stabbed an official to death and injured another in resisting their sexual advances .
Comments on the internet showed no sympathy with the dead official and generally support the 21 - year - old girl , acclaiming that she is another Yang Jia who acted in response to an injustice .
The dead man , Deng Guida , is the chief of county investment promotion office .
He came with his two colleagues to the entertainment venue Dream City for a massage , and met the waitress there .
They asked for ‘ special service ’ , meaning sex service in China , but were refused .
It is alleged that Deng Guida took from his pocket a wad of money and hit the waitress on the head with it .
Humiliated by the action , Deng tried to leave the room but the victim twice pushed her onto a sofa as she attempted to do so .
The waitress found a knife , stabbing at the victim 's throat , killing him and also injuring one of his colleagues .
The waitress later called police and surrendered .
The news immediately triggered a public discussion after it was revealed .
At first it was about whether the girl 's action should be regarded as self - defense .
Though legal experts agreed she is likely to be charged , some in Xing - Dao Daily , a Hong Kong newspaper , argued ,
邓贵大要求邓玉娇提 供 “ 特殊服务 ” ，邓玉娇不从，使用暴力手段，两次将邓玉娇按倒在沙发上，已构成强奸行为，且该不法侵害正在进行，并即将邓玉娇的人身造成严重损害。邓玉娇的防卫行为，是在情况紧急，精神高度紧张的情况下采取的自卫行为…不负刑事责任。
The official had requested Deng to offer ‘ special service ’ , but was refused !
He violently pushed Deng onto the sofa twice , an action that could well be seen as an attempted rape .
The infringement on Deng 's rights was an ongoing one and may well have severely injured Deng .
Therefore her stabbing was an act of self - defense and given the emergency ….
she should face no criminal charge !
Many netiznes spoke highly of Deng .
Yi Li in Tianya commented on the news , saying ,
邓玉娇，你是好样的。敬佩你，支持你，向你学习。望保重。
Deng Yujiao , you are good .
I admire and support you , and will learn from you .
Best regards
Moreover , her story was written into a short chronicle in traditional Chinese that was usually used by ancient historians to memorize a heroic example .
For those who knows Chinese , the text is here :
邓玉娇者，荆州巴东人也，美而烈，以修脚为业。
一夕，浣纱于室，野三关镇吏黄德智、邓贵大、邓某相携寻欢不遇，见玉娇，遂破门而入，欲强狎焉。玉娇严词斥之，邓贵大怒，鞭面以币，曰：吾辈多金，岂惧汝不从哉。玉娇不顾，贵大愈怒，乃按其于卧塌，强起，复按之，三者相视而笑。玉娇羞愤，遂操细刃刺之，三创而毙，德智复犯，玉娇又刺之，重创，邓者大惧，不敢前。玉娇乃投刃自首于官。
jy_xyp said :
娶女如此 , 此生足已 !!!!
I would be content if I could marry a girl like this .
Virginity is very important in China , and there are numerous stories on how women defended their honor .
The sentiment of admiring a girl for defending her virginity , is here combined with a hatred against corrupt officials in the case .
In People.com , a blogger Sun Xiaobo questioned :
一是这些官员哪里有那么钱？因为在争执中，被刺死的邓贵大曾从怀中拿出一沓钱抽打邓某的头部，一个靠工资过日子的公务员哪来的那么多钱，而且一点也不怜惜。到底是公款，还是腐败得来的。官员为何热衷于去娱乐场所？为何热衷于特殊服务？
How come that these officials have so much money ?
During the dispute the victim hit the girl on the head with a wad of money .
How could a public servant on a salary have so much to spare without any thought or scruple ?
Was it public funds or embezzled money perhaps ?
How could they visit entertainment venues so frequently and are obsessed with ‘ special service ’ so much ?
Bloggers , netizens and intellectuals are taking action to support Deng Yujiao .
A public letter calling for people to send their words of comfort to Deng , who is now imprisoned , appeared on the internet saying Deng is a heroine .
Many still worry though that the police may manipulate the evidence to help the court rule against Deng .
In a preliminary assessment , Deng was identified as having a mental condition .
Also , the police allege that the weapon Deng used was actually a fruit knife rather than the nail clipper that Deng used in her job of clipping nails for customers .
On this point , blogger Zhou Zhongming wrote an article :
首先 , 他们故意不提招商办官员用钱打修脚女的细节.
其次,他们将自卫工具修脚刀换为水果刀.这看似细微的差别,所能形成的造案效果却不可低估:用修脚刀自卫,说明是在工作被挑戏激愤慌张中自卫,用水果刀则不同,洗脚物包间通常不会有,这就为构陷修脚女”折出拿刀再返回刺杀”埋下伏笔.这样就使显而易见正当防卫往故意杀人上靠.
First , the police do n't mention the wad of money at all !
Second , they allege the weapon was a fruit knife , not a nail clipper !
This is no small difference because if it is a nail clipper , it shows that the girl was defending herself in a panic with a tool right at hand .
If it is a fruit knife however , it implies that the girl took the knife from somewhere else and killed the official on purpose rather than in simple self - defense
再次 , 他们声称在修脚女的包里查出治疗抑郁症的药.这一招最狠毒:可以维护官员的形象;又可以将修脚女投入精神病院折磨,谁都知道进政治精神病院是比死刑恐怖千百倍的事.
Further , they allege that medications for a mental condition were found in the girl 's bag .
How vicious a trick to protect the officials ’ reputation !
They can even put the girl into a mental asylum .
Everyone knows it is far worse to be in a State madhouse than being given a death sentence .
The blogger gave a possible scenario of the police conclusions : that the girl , because of her mental condition and persecution paranoia , stabbed the two officials with a purposely prepared knife .
Could such a speculation be true ?
Netizens are waiting for a final answer from the police .
GNOME to migrate to git

Subject : GNOME to migrate to git
Date : Thu , 19 Mar 2009 11:04:33 +0000
The GNOME Release Team would like to announce that git will be the new Version Control System ( VCS ) for GNOME .
In our opinion , the decision reflects the opinion of the majority of our active contributors .
In December 2008 , Behdad Esfahbod organized the GNOME DVCS ( Distributed Version Control System ) Survey on behalf of the GNOME Foundation board of directors , Release Team , and Sysadmin Team with the aim of better understanding familiarity and preferences of our active contributor base regarding the future VCS for GNOME .
The survey results [ 1 ] , released in January 2009 , show that git is by far the preferred DVCS for the majority of our active contributors - the main users of GNOME infrastructure .
Elijah Newren has made an in - depth analysis of the results [ 2 ] .
Since January 2009 , a group of brave contributors ( Owen Taylor , Kristian Høgsberg , Behdad Esfahbod , Federico Quintero , and others ) have been working on the migration of our Subversion repositories to git [ 3 ] .
The git migration team is documenting their progress at : http://live.gnome.org/GitMigration
The new git.gnome.org server is now in good shape and contains a functional preview of all GNOME git repositories .
The official migration of all our Subversion repositories to git will take place just after the 2.26.1 release , on April 16 .
The git migration team is now working on sorting out the last details of the migration and providing complete documentation on how to use git on daily GNOME contributions ( for documentors , translators , developers , etc ) .
By migrating in the very beginning of the 2.27.x development cycle , we 'll be able to work out any issues very early in the development cycle and give enough time for contributors to get used to the new VCS .
We realize that git is not perfect , and that the transition will require significant and important changes to many GNOME processes .
With that in mind , we hope that more community members will step forward to help making the process as efficient and painless as possible .
We 'd like to invite the community to : a ) help us to provide accurate documentation for documentors , translators and developers ; b ) test the preview repositories in git.gnome.org and help the git migration team on finding and fixing any issues in the repositories you work on .
For instance , modules using svn externals need decision from their respective maintainers [ 5 ] .
If you 'd like to help , subcribe to gnome - infrastructure [ 4 ] and report / discuss any issues you find there .
Cheers !

I ’ve had the rare privilege of telling one of the leaders of the British National Party precisely what I think of him and his creed on national television .
The occasion was several months ago , and it was on a BBC programme entitled “ The Big Questions ” ; I was in the studio audience .
I had to get up early on a Sunday morning to attend ; it was surreal to drive to Southampton with the orange and purple colours of early dawn painting the blank canvas of the empty motorway .
My mind protested the violation of the normal rhythms of the week .
Surely , it told me , the best thing to do was to turn around , go back to bed , then wake up late , drink coffee , and read the Sunday papers .
I did not expect that my presence would add much except an additional face to the crowd .
For those who are familiar with the programme , it may come as a surprise that the space in which it is held is quite small .
In this case , it was in the gymnasium of a large school .
However , the normally generous room was stuffed with seats , set decorations and the electronic accoutrements that live television demand .
I took my place in a row near the back , and was seated next to a prospective Labour Parliamentary candidate .
We chatted for a while ; we had been informed of the topics beforehand , and they included a debate about evolution , another about motherhood and lastly , one about whether or not members of the British National Party should be allowed to work in public services such as education and health .
For those who are n’t familiar with the British National Party , I need to digress into a bit of history .
In 1932 , the British Union of Fascists was founded and led by a former Labour minister and MP , Oswald Mosley , who wanted to create a political front which was modelled after those spawned by Mussolini and Hitler .
Mosley ’s “ Black Shirt ” group found most of its strength among the deprived of East London ; at its height , its membership reached 50,000 , and they were occasionally engaged in pitched battles with their Communist rivals .
War with Germany and Italy quickly led the Government to ban the BUF in May 1940 ; however , it was not entirely snuffed out .
Activists like A.K. Chesterton kept the embers burning in spite of fascism ’s eventual defeat in World War II : the refusal of the ideology to lay down and die later led to the foundation of the National Front , which then was succeeded by the British National Party .
The BNP was established in 1982 .
Let us be absolutely clear : beyond its pedigree , the BNP is connected in thought and spirit to some of the most loathsome ideological positions in Europe .
One of their “ founding fathers ” , John Tyndall , wrote a book in 1962 entitled “ The Authoritarian State ” which directly stated that liberal democracy was some sort of Jewish plot for world domination .
The BNP ’s present leader , Nick Griffin , wrote in 1996 in a book entitled “ The Rune ” , that “ I am well aware that orthodox opinion is that six million Jews were gassed and cremated or turned into soup and lampshades .
I have reached the conclusion that the ‘ extermination ’ tale is a mixture of Allied wartime propaganda , extremely profitable lie , and latter witch - hysteria . ”
He also is on record denying that the gas chambers existed , in spite of the fact that anyone can go visit Auschwitz and see that they did .
Griffin , however , is sufficiently clever to realise that the anti-semitism of the 1930 ’s does n’t resonate with modern British voters .
He has since changed focus to immigrants and in particular , made clear his dislike of Muslims .
In a BBC documentary aired in 2004 , Griffin stated that Islam was a “ wicked , vicious faith ” .
The BNP has made electoral progress , particularly among disaffected Labour voters ; for example , they have 9 local councillors in once solidly Labour Stoke on Trent .
Furthermore , they have a member of the London Assembly , Richard Barnbrook .
Barnbrook was the only prominent official of theirs who was brave enough to appear on “ The Big Questions ” .
Seated a few metres away , I thought he gave every indication of a man who was thoroughly in love with himself and having difficulty keeping that passion restrained in public .
He wore a buttoned up jacket that had been carefully pressed so as to eliminate any trace of wrinkles .
Every hair had been sprayed into a particular position .
He was sweating and a touch red-faced .
He may have been trying too hard to appear respectable , and perhaps because of the extremity of that effort , he came across as a phony from the get - go .
I did not recognise him at first , however ; based on his waxy , dogmatic visage , I thought he was likely to be one of the militant Christians who wanted to deny evolution .
The music then rose , the cameras went on , and the presenter Nicky Campbell began the show with the evolution debate .
It turned out that the evolution denier was an amiable middle aged man in a grey suit who spoke very gently .
While I disagreed with him , his faith was rather touching .
Following this , the motherhood debate ( i.e. , whether or not the demands of modern society were diminishing good parenting ) revealed the first of the BNP men : he was a grey haired man in the livery of an Anglican vicar .
He outed himself when he implied that women were better off “ barefoot and pregnant ” .
Finally , we came to the BNP debate .
It may not have come across on television , but Barnbrook had an almost falsetto edge to his voice when he was defending himself against accusations of racism .
The audience , to their credit , was n’t having it : he attracted fire from nearly all quarters .
The debate seemed to go around in circles for a time ; unfortunately , it lingered in the territory which the BNP wanted it to remain : namely , the implicit suggestion that freedom of political association and entitlement to work for the government were one and the same .
After holding up my hand for so long that it felt like my elbow had ossified , I was finally called to speak on the matter :
“ We are talking about two separate things , ” I said , “ one is the right to freedom of speech , the other is the right to participate in public service .
The public has the right to expect its services to be delivered without prejudice and we do n’t have that certainty with the BNP . ”
Barnbrook ’s voice squeaked again in reply , and he repeated his anti-racist credentials : why , his fiancee had a mixed race baby whom he loved very much and he had served as a teacher to students of all races .
His assault on common sense would likely have continued had not the music raised and the programme ended .
After , I noted that Barnbrook and his vicar colleague departed the scene as quickly as possible .
It ’s alarming how readily groups of maladjusted hysterics like the BNP exploit our present circumstances .
It is entirely possible that they will attract enough votes to have a representative in the European Parliament .
It is also possible that they will increase their share of the vote in local government .
People are bewildered and enraged by the financial crash and the corruption of Parliament : the position of the BNP far outside the normal political process helps them .
Gordon Brown also accidentally assisted them by providing their latest motto ; in one of his speeches , he stated one of his priorities was “ British jobs for British workers ” , this slogan is now plastered all over their propaganda .
Furthermore , because they are the bottom feeders of democracy , the BNP do n’t mind playing on the fears of the electorate in whatever way they see fit .
Meanwhile , they have the nerve to claim , like Christ , they have been persecuted , and that Jesus would vote their way too .
All this is rather rich coming from a party which deserves a moniker that is beyond fascist , beyond repugnant , beyond racist : traitor .
This is not a reference solely to their BUF pedigree , but also to the fact that their ideology exists in direct opposition to the values for which this country stands .
Britain has long been a nation of immigrants : in antiquity , it was a place that the Celts called home , then the Romans , then the Angles and the Saxons , then the Normans .
Huguenots came from France to practice their Protestant faith .
Oliver Cromwell gave sanctuary to the Jews .
While there have been fits of violence and persecution ( particularly of Jews and Catholics ) , the nation ’s history is one of new arrivals , the nation and the immigrants coming to an accord , and life carrying on , the country ’s cultural wealth having increased in the process .
To deny the continuing role of diversity in British society is to turn one ’s back on what precisely has made the United Kingdom ’s story largely one of the triumph of liberty ; furthermore , given how widespread the legacy of immigrants remains ingrained in the nation ’s heritage , BNP supporters are likely spitting on the generous spirit which enabled their existence as “ British ” in the first place .
I may be more aware of this than most : while I come from an English - speaking country and I am white , I too am an immigrant , and I have been privileged to integrate the thread of my life into the very broad and multicoloured tapestry of this country .
It ’s not clear what the BNP ’s destructive efforts are all for ; after all , BNP councillors have proven to be as corrupt and untrustworthy as any member of Parliament .
In 2007 , Barnbrook was forced to discipline them in a letter which was distributed nationwide .
It can be said that far from representing a break with the norm , they are just a more venal variant .
Fortunately , the danger the BNP represents is pronounced to the point that the normally apolitical and mild Church of England felt obliged to take a stand .
Every other “ contender ” party in the next election has also made their distaste for the BNP clear .
However , we should not be afraid to point out that the BNP ’s chosen label , in the final analysis , is a contradiction : far from being British , they are the heirs and practitioners of an alien ideology , far from being national , their appeal is limited to few constituencies , and far from being a party , they are a gaggle of thugs which hopefully the British public will be ready to dismiss on June 4 .
Take this thing off of me .
It burns .

" How will the Iranian president 's speech contribute to the Palestinian issue or the good of the occupied Arab lands ? " wondered Tariq Alhomayed , Editor - in - Chief of Al - sharq al - Awsat Arabic newspaper in an opinion article published on Tuesday .
" We have also promised in the past to dump Israel into the sea , but what does Ahmadinejad have to add ?
After all , all he did yesterday was push the international community to rally around Israel , to boycott the conference for it , and anyone who did n't boycott it walked out of the hall in protest . "
Nevertheless US calls Iranian speech vile , but open to dialogue Yitzhak Benhorin Washington denounces Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's speech as racist , shameful but says will still pursue avenues of negotiations on nuclear program US calls Iranian speech vile , but open to dialogue
Alhomayed , the editor of one of the most influential newspapers in the Arab world , that is considered to hold relatively liberal opinions , wrote the harsh editorial following Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's speech on Monday at the UN 's anti-racism conference in Geneva .
" When Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke yesterday , attacking Israel and calling it a racist country at the UN anti-racism conference known as Durban II , he spoke more to us than to the international community , " Alhomayed wrote .
" What Ahmadinejad said yesterday about Israel was nothing more than the refined version of things he used to say repeatedly in the past , and the Iranian president did promise to wipe Israel off the map in the past , described it as illegitimate , said it could not exist and said that the Holocaust was nothing more than a legend .
" If we remember all this today , we can see that his speech yesterday was a softer version of his words .
It is obvious that this speech was intended mainly for the Arab and Islamic street , " he wrote .
" The Arabs fought six wars with Israel , not to mention the other battles that cannot be described as anything short of wars .
We lost hundreds of thousands of dead and injured in them , our cities and our lands were occupied and we lost great treasures , " he continued .
" Is talk enough for us today ?
Did Iran lose even one tree for Palestine ?
Did Tehran sacrifice a single dead man on the front against Israel ?
Memory of the recent past teaches us that the Iranians refrained from participating in the last war on Gaza , under the orders of the highest authority in Iran . "
" Do we need speeches and threats ?
Of course not !
We need actions .
And the actions that we witnessed yesterday faded in the squeals of Ahmadinejad 's speech and the western countries ' boycotting of his speech .
The real actions that Iran committed yesterday was the Iranian court ruling that sent Iranian - American journalist Roxana Saberi to eight years in prison for spying .
" The second action was Ahmadinejad 's meeting with the Swiss president two days ago .
Switzerland has been in charge of following American interests in Iran from the time of the hostage crisis at the American Embassy .
These two points are far more deserving of attention than Ahmadinejad 's speech that was intended for the Arab and Islamic world , " he concluded
Yesterday , Roger Hedgecock and the Liberty Papers posted an unclassified DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis report titled :
Rightwing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment .
The “ report ” ( PDF file here ) was one of the most embarrassingly shoddy pieces of propaganda I ’d ever read out of DHS .
I could n’t believe it was real .
I spent the day chasing down DHS spokespeople , who have been tied up preparing for a very important homeland security event later today : The First Lady is coming to visit their Washington office .
Priorities , you know .
Well , the press office got back to me and verified that the document is indeed for real .
They were very defensive — preemptively so — in asserting that it was not a politicized document and that DHS had done reports on “ leftwing extremism ” in the past .
I have covered DHS for many years and am quite familiar with past assessments they and the FBI have done on animal rights terrorists and environmental terrorists .
But those past reports have always been very specific in identifying the exact groups , causes , and targets of domestic terrorism , i.e. , the ALF , ELF , and Stop Huntingdon wackos who have engaged in physical harassment , arson , vandalism , and worse against pharmaceutical companies , farms , labs , and university researchers .
By contrast , the piece of crap report issued on April 7 is a sweeping indictment of conservatives .
And the intent is clear .
As the two spokespeople I talked with on the phone today made clear :
They both pinpointed the recent “ economic downturn ” and the “ general state of the economy ” for stoking “ rightwing extremism . ”
One of the spokespeople said he was told that the report has been in the works for a year .
My b.s. detector went off the chart , and yours will , too , if you read through the entire report — which asserts with no evidence that an unquantified “ resurgence in rightwing extremist recruitment and radicalizations activity ” is due to home foreclosures , job losses , and …the historical presidential election .
In Obama land , there are no coincidences .
It is no coincidence that this report echoes Tea Party - bashing left - wing blogs ( check this one out comparing the Tea Party movement to the Weather Underground ! ) and demonizes the very Americans who will be protesting in the thousands on Wednesday for the nationwide Tax Day Tea Party .
From the report , p.2 :
Rightwing extremism in the United States can be broadly divided into those groups , movements , and adherents that are primarily hate - oriented ( based on hatred of particular religious , racial or ethnic groups ) , and those that are mainly antigovernment , rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority , or rejecting government authority entirely .
It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue , such as opposition to abortion or immigration .
From the report .
p. 3 :
(U//LES ) Rightwing extremists are harnessing this historical election as a recruitment tool .
Many rightwing extremists are antagonistic toward the new presidential administration and its perceived stance on a range of issues , including immigration and citizenship , the expansion of social programs to minorities , and restrictions on firearms ownership and use .
Rightwing extremists are increasingly galvanized by these concerns and leverage them as drivers for recruitment .
From the 2008 election timeframe to the present , rightwing extremists have capitalized on related racial and political prejudices in expanded propaganda campaigns , thereby reaching out to a wider audience of potential sympathizers .
(U) Exploiting Economic Downturn ( U// FOUO )
Rightwing extremist chatter on the Internet continues to focus on the economy , the perceived loss of U.S. jobs in the manufacturing and construction sectors , and home foreclosures .
Anti-Semitic extremists attribute these losses to a deliberate conspiracy conducted by a cabal of Jewish “ financial elites . ”
These “ accusatory ” tactics are employed to draw new recruits into rightwing extremist groups and further radicalize those already subscribing to extremist beliefs .
DHS / I&A assesses this trend is likely to accelerate if the economy is perceived to worsen .
From the report , p. 5 :
(U//FOUO )
Over the past five years , various rightwing extremists , including militias and white supremacists , have adopted the immigration issue as a call to action , rallying point , and recruiting tool .
Debates over appropriate immigration levels and enforcement policy generally fall within the realm of protected political speech under the First Amendment , but in some cases , anti-immigration or strident pro-enforcement fervor has been directed against specific groups and has the potential to turn violent .
And echoing the anti-military bigotry last seen in that disgusting Penn State University training video , there ’s this on p. 7 :
(U) Disgruntled Military Veterans ( U// FOUO ) DHS / I&A assesses that rightwing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize returning veterans in order to exploit their skills and knowledge derived from military training and combat .
These skills and knowledge have the potential to boost the capabilities of extremists — including lone wolves or small terrorist cells — to carry out violence .
The willingness of a small percentage of military personnel to join extremist groups during the 1990s because they were disgruntled , disillusioned , or suffering from the psychological effects of war is being replicated today .
There ’s no hackneyed left - wing stereotype of conservatives left behind in this DHS intelligence and analysis assessment .
I asked both DHS spokespeople to tell me who , specifically , the report was accusing of “ rightwing extremist chatter ” and which “ antigovernment ” groups are being monitored as “ extremists . ”
They say they ’ll get back to me .
In the meantime , be aware of this from the report , p. 8 :
(U//FOUO ) DHS / I&A will be working with its state and local partners over the next several months to ascertain with greater regional specificity the rise in rightwing extremist activity in the United States , with a particular emphasis on the political , economic , and social factors that drive rightwing extremist radicalization .
Better make a few last - minute signs for the Tea Party .
Obama ’s DHS is watching :
Honk if you ’re a radicalized rightwing extremist !
Guilty of rightwing extremist chatter
Anti-government , pro-freedom : Sue me

Oh , I ’m sure DHS will be issuing its report on self - proclaimed bank terrorists like Bruce Marks of NACA and criminal rackeeters harassing private citizens in their homes to “ exploit the economic downturn ” any day now .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - A pickup in U.S. home sales has kindled hopes for a housing recovery , but plunging prices , rising unemployment and a new wave of foreclosures are clouding prospects for a quick end to the American real estate debacle .
“ We ’re not at the bottom and anybody that ’s trying to call the bottom right now is crazy , ” said Jack McCabe , a real estate consultant based in Deerfield Beach , Florida .
“ There ’s a huge foreclosure wave still ahead in the next 12 - 18 months and still a lot of excess inventory , ” he added .
Housing is at the heart of the 17 - month - old U.S. recession and is key to a turnaround in the broader economy .
Optimistic observers have been talking about a real estate market strengthening as investors jump in to hunt for bargains .
But upbeat talk is undermined by data like the latest S&P Case - Shiller home price index , which recorded a 19.1 percent drop in the first - quarter compared to the same year ago period .
It was the biggest decline in the index ’s 21 - year history .
Nevertheless , the Realtor Association of Greater Miami and the Beaches said on Wednesday existing single - family home sales rose 98 percent in Miami in April from April 2008 .
But the surge was fueled by a 39 percent year - over - year drop in median sales prices and many people in Miami -- which ranks among the poorest U.S. cities -- are among homeowners struggling to make ends meet as the U.S. unemployment rate heads into what may soon be double digits .
“ I ’m getting to the point where I ’m ready to break down , ” said Martin Garcia , 48 .

The medical laboratory equipment engineer has a prime , 30 - year fixed rate mortgage with a 9.5 percent annual interest rate .
Homebuyers with secure finances and high credit scores could qualify for mortgages with “ prime ” financing terms .
But Garcia was laid off seven months ago .
He receives about $ 900 a month in unemployment benefits .
But he is down to just $ 400 in savings and he wo n’t be able to keep up much longer with the more than $ 800 a month in mortgage and maintenance costs he pays on the Miami Beach apartment he bought in 1989 .
“ Since I ’m unemployed the banks do n’t want to refinance or do anything , ” Garcia said .
JOB LOSSES DRIVE FORECLOSURES
One in eight households with a mortgage ended the first quarter late on loan payments or in the foreclosure process , the U.S. Mortgage Bankers Association said on Thursday .
Foreclosures on fixed - rate mortgages , given to solid borrowers with good credit , represented the largest share of new foreclosures for the first time since the rapid growth and ensuing collapse of the subprime “ toxic ” loan market .
The jobless rate in Florida is currently hovering at 9.6 percent , double what it was in December 2007 .
In Lee County on the state ’s southwest coast -- where the median cost of an existing single - family home has plunged more than two - thirds from a peak in December 2005 -- job losses have been a key driver behind a surge in foreclosure filings .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
From April 2008 through March 2009 , the county of less than 600,000 people saw the number of foreclosure filings jump from 20,544 to 45,150 , or nearly 124 a day , said Jim Humphrey , mayor of Fort Myers , which is the county seat .
President Barack Obama pitched his economic stimulus plan during a visit to Fort Myers in February , highlighting its place in a region hard hit by the current recession .
The Cape Coral - Fort Myers area had the highest foreclosure rate in the nation last year , with 12 percent of housing units receiving a foreclosure - related notice .
‘ VULTURE ’ BUYERS
Humphrey said “ vulture ” buyers were now swooping in to snap up bundles of homes at foreclosure auctions in Fort Myers .
But given mounting unemployment , they could be hard pressed to find anyone to sell or rent the properties to , he added .
“ We ’re seeing more sales , I ’m afraid so much of it , if you look behind it , is vultures .
And it ’s not really putting people in homes at this stage , ” Humphrey said .
Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody ’s Economy.com , saw the mounting foreclosure crisis as the most significant threat to the developing economic recovery .
He said that as foreclosures mounted , they undermined house prices , wealth and the viability of the country ’s financial system .
“ The driving forces behind these foreclosures are millions of homeowners under water and surging unemployment , and / or underemployment .
People wo n’t default on their loan unless they ’re under water , ” said Zandi , referring to borrowers who owe more on their homes than the properties are worth .
“ We ’re trapped in this very negative self - reinforcing cycle , ” he added .
Mike Larson , a real estate analyst with the Weiss Group in Jupiter , Florida , acknowledged that recent home sales gains in areas hit by the housing meltdown , including Nevada , Arizona and California , had come at the expense of pricing .
He said inventory was now clearing rather quickly in many areas , however , and predicted prices could bottom out sometime in mid to late 2010 as a recovery started to take hold .
“ The outlook is a little more sanguine at this point .
Not good ; just not this all - bad situation , ” he said .
In Maricopa , Arizona , realtors Aziz and Deborah Farhat said the once booming real estate market less than an hour ’s drive from Phoenix peaked in October 2005 .
Back then , a three - bedroom home went for $ 225,000 to $ 250,000 compared to a current average of $ 99,000 .
“ At the moment it ’s flattening , ” Deborah Farhat said , adding that the price slide had started to level off in March .
“ I ’m not going to say it ’s turned as we ’re not going up in price , we ’re just slowing down the bleeding , ” she said .
Meeting of America 's Richest About ' Need , ' Attendee Says
When the world 's richest people meet , what do they talk about ?
May 20 , 2009  --
Under a cloak of secrecy , some of the world 's wealthiest people gathered in an unprecedented meeting early this month in New York City " to see how they can join together to do more , " according to one attendee .
Invited by the world 's two richest men Bill Gates and Warren Buffett , along with David Rockefeller , a Who 's Who of American wealth and influence gathered around a long table in a window - lined private room overlooking the East River on May 5 .
" The overwhelming reason for the meeting was need -- that was the issue that galvanized everyone to participate , " Patricia Stonesifer , senior advisor to the Gates foundation 's trustees , Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett , told ABCNews.com .
" This was a group very committed to philanthropy coming together to see how they can join together to do more . "
Gates and Buffett were joined by billionaire moguls Oprah Winfrey , Ted Turner and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg along with heavyweight philanthropists George Soros and others .
Together the attendees have donated more than $ 70 billion to charity since 1996 , according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy .

A clandestine meeting of the country 's rich and powerful , left off their public calendars and hidden from the press , is enough to spark the imaginations of conspiracy theorists everywhere , but attendees told ABC News.com the meeting was " 100 percent about philanthropy " and it was not meant to be a secret .
" It was meant to be a private exchange but it was n't a secret really , just a private meeting , " Stonesifer said .
First reported by IrishCentral.com , ABCNews.com confirmed each of the attendees ' presence at the meeting held at the residence of the Rockefeller University president on the campus of the Manhattan medical school .
It lasted about five hours , beginning in mid-afternoon and continuing through dinner , Stonesifer said .
" This particular group had never come together as a group before but many of the attendees had met in the past either individually or in smaller groups -- but never all at once , " she said .
" This was a great discussion and they agreed to continue the dialogue and meet again in the future .
There were a lot of good ideas . "
She said that the discussion " ranged from emergency relief efforts to scholarship efforts , to U.S. education efforts to global health . "
Another attendee who asked to remain anonymous described the meeting as " a private gathering of friends and colleagues to share their history and excitement about their philanthropy .
[ It was ] a group together discussing a range of things they are working on . "
When again asked about the meeting following ABC News. com 's initial report Mayor Bloomberg said he sometimes holds private meetings that are " not going to be on the public schedulues .
There are meetings all over this city and there are some very powerful people in this city . "
Bloomberg who would not directly comment on the meeting or its outcome said : " You know I am very interested in private philanthropy , I think it has a unique place in our society in that with private dollars you can try new things , things that you can't do with public dollars . "
There remain as many questions about the meeting 's details as there are about the logistics behind its organization .
How did some of the world 's most public figures coordinate their schedules , travel , and security with no one in media knowing about it ?
Charities Suffer in Recession
The meeting was reminiscent of the 1907 salons of America 's foremost financiers held in the study of J.P. Morgan to discuss how private citizens could stop the economic panic .
IrishCentral reported that each of the participants was given 15 minutes to propose how to best direct their charity given the global economic climate .
Charities are suffering during the crisis , and America 's top philanthropists likely met to chart a new course for global charity , said Stacy Palmer , editor - in - chief of the Chronicle of Philanthropy .
A meeting of the country 's top philanthropists is " extraordinary " and " really unusual , " Palmer said .
" I can't think of another time they 've all been in the same room to talk about philanthropy , " she said .
" It 's unprecedented . "
Gates and Buffet have publicly committed their vast fortunes to the same philanthropic efforts , and Rockefeller , the chairman of Rockefeller Financial Services , comes from a long line of philanthropists .
Gates , the founder and former CEO of Microsoft , who topped the Forbes ' Richest People list this year , has dedicated his foundation to eradicating infectious disease worldwide .
According to Portfolio magazine , Gates , who is worth about $ 59 billion , donated $ 3.7 billion from 2002 to 2006 and $ 10 billion from 2007 to 2008 .
Warren Buffett , CEO of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway , was ranked the second - richest man by Forbes this year with a net worth is estimated at $ 52 billion .
Though his giving in the past year is not disclosed , he donated some $ 46.1 billion between 2002 and 2006 , according to Portfolio .
In 2006 , Buffet pledged $ 31 billion , the bulk of his fortune , to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , doubling the organization 's endowment virtually overnight .
Though the charitable interests of the participants differ , they have some things in common , said Bob Ottenhoff , CEO of Guidestar , a service that tracks nonprofit organizations .
For the most part , the attendees are all self - made .
Their donations come from money they made in their own lifetimes , rather than old family fortunes , and they have committed to giving away their fortunes while still alive rather than through bequests after their deaths .
One exception is Rockefeller , scion of the Rockefeller fortune .
In 2008 , Rockefeller gave $ 137 million to charity .
Philanthropic Groups Have Global Reach
Though the philanthropic focus of each of the participants differs , many of their foundations have a global dimension .
" Each has their specialty .
Gates focuses on world health , [ CNN founder Ted ]
Turner on the environment and the UN , Soros is involved in civic engagement , " Ottenhoff said .
Between 1997 and 2006 Turner has donated $ 1.6 billion , the bulk of which , $ 1 billion , went to the UN Foundation in 1997 .
Soros , a fund manager worth $ 9 billion , gave $ 1.1 billion from 2002 to 2006 and $ 475 million from 2007 to 2008 .
Much of Soros giving goes to his family 's Open Society Institute .
" These sorts of meetings do n't happen very often .
It is difficult for large philanthropic organizations to work together .
The fact that these are all very engaged living donors means very interesting things can happen , " Ottenhoff said .
Both Ottenhoff and Palmer agreed that it was likely the financial crisis that brought everyone together .
Charitable giving has taken a serious hit in recent months , and the power players likely discussed how to keep some nonprofits afloat .
" They are making a statement that donors should continue to give .
They are likely planning on a sending a message that philanthropy needs to continue worldwide , " she said .
Few of the participants , Palmer said , gave money quietly and she anticipated that the secret meeting was the first step in a plan that would eventually be made public .
A number of other people attended the meeting including : Winfrey , worth $ 2.7 billion , who donated some $ 50 million in 2007 ; Bloomberg , founder of Bloomberg LP and Mayor of New York City , who is worth $ 11.5 billion and donated $ 205 million from 2007 to 2008 ; financier Eli Broad who donated $ 100 million in 2008 ; and financier Peter Peterson , who committed $ 1 billion in 2008 .
The expenses scandal claimed further victims last night with the announcement that two Conservative MPs – Sir Peter Viggers and Anthony Steen – will resign their seats at the next election .
Sir Peter will step down as MP for Gosport in Hampshire " at the direct request " of David Cameron after spending tens of thousands of pounds on gardening , including a £ 1,645 bill for a floating " duck island " , while Mr Steen , the MP for Totnes in Devon who claimed £ 87,729 on his luxurious country house , will also leave the Commons .
The future of a third leading Conservative , Bill Wiggin , was also in doubt after The Daily Telegraph claimed that the Conservative whip – a contemporary of Mr Cameron 's at Eton – claimed £ 11,000 in interest payments for a property without a mortgage .
He insisted he had not profited and had made " an administrative error " , but he could join Labour 's " phantom mortage " MPs Elliot Morley and David Chaytor in facing possible criminal proceedings .
Mr Wiggin , the MP for Leominster in Herefordshire , filed for the expenses after declaring that his constituency property was his second home .
He stressed yesterday that he meant to claim for his London residence instead .

Public anger at the conduct of MPs is likely to be exacerbated by the news that any MP forced to quit over the expenses scandal will be in line for pay - offs of more than £ 100,000 and pensions of up to £ 30,000 a year .
Tory MP Douglas Hogg , who submitted a bill for cleaning his moat , has already announced his retirement , while three Labour MPs – Mr Morley , Mr Chaytor and Margaret Moran , who claimed £ 22,500 on expenses to treat dry rot at her " second home " over 100 miles from her Luton constituency , will be summoned next week to a disciplinary panel to defend their claims .
Gordon Brown has warned that no MP who has " defied the rules " on expenses will be allowed to stand at the next election .
MPs embroiled in the scandal remain entitled to two pay - offs so long as they serve until the general election , rather than resign immediately .
All MPs who step down , or are defeated , at an election are paid a " resettlement grant " designed to compensate for loss of salary .
It ranges between six months ' and one year 's pay depending on age and length of service in the Commons .
An MP aged between 55 and 64 who has been in Parliament for 15 years will be paid a year 's salary – £ 64,766 at current rates .
The first £ 30,000 is tax - free .
In addition , all MPs can claim a maximum of £ 40,799 for " winding - up costs " to pay off staff and end office leases .
Politicians also benefit from a generous final salary pension scheme heavily subsidised by the taxpayer .
* Two Labour peers , Lord Truscott and Lord Taylor of Blackburn , have been suspended from the Lords for six months after being found guilty of offering to amend laws for cash – the first time such a sanction has been used in more than 350 years .
Outside the window a machine scrapes the ground flat in preparation for the arrival of a crane .
An engineer is marking the ground with laser - guided accuracy and tomorrow the timber frame structure will be lifted into place then bolted to the cross -hairs of yellow paint marked on the 12 cubes of concrete we ’ve poured into the ground .
5 years on from the first decision to buy a plot of land and embark on a self - build project the house is now finally under way .
I ’ve been charting the journey elsewhere on a tumblr page , sharing a mixture of links , quotes and sketches to convey some of the stages that the project has moved through , but it ’s time I tried to summarise the decisions we ’ve taken along the way and start to share more details .
The house is an experiment .
An excuse to test out numerous materials and detailing ideas that I ’ve been thinking about for some time .
An experiment that I hope will result in an opportunity to take what I ’ve learnt and repeat the most successful elements of it again for others , helping them to make better houses for less money .
It ’s also going to be my family ’s home and if there ’s a tension to this story , a latent risk growing in this narrative , it ’s about whether some of those experiments will fail to deliver the home we decided to strive for 5 years ago .
This seems wholly appropriate though as if there was ever a time to embrace some risk and uncertainty in one ’s career as an architect , surely the self - build project is the time to do so .
I ’m going to share the project here and elsewhere using various tools , but first I ’ll share some of the back story .
Partly because it ’ll be cathartic for me and partly because the full story infuses every part of the final building I ’ll be constructing over the coming weeks .
Folding stars :
The full story actually includes two houses .
Before this house there was another house .
An entirely different design that was forged during a time when both my family and the national economy were feeling a little braver and more care free .
It was more ambitious in size , construction demands and most importantly funding expectations .
We were committed to a self - build mortgage route and expecting to employ a main contractor to oversee it all .
Whilst we worked out the funding route I spent months wallowing in the pleasure of being able to spend such a long period on early concepts , turning out alternatives week after week , folding and unfolding the volumes bound by the ground levels , neighbour ’s house and laws of physics over and over again until I was sure I ’d tried every permutation .
There were pages full of diagrams in the sketchbook and seminal texts on the coffee table and it was a delight .
It was also tortuous .
Endless variations on a theme with no external force able to come between the client and architect , the gap between them having closed entirely and the brief becoming as fluid as the pen strokes in every sketch .
Then comes the blessed relief of a constraint you can cling on to .
Mortgage paperwork , APR calculations related to energy performance and a cost estimate .
You buckle down and find a solution in 3 sides of A4 paper .
I worked hard to get a planning approval .
I suspect the local authority had never seen a design and access statement like it .
We progressed towards construction information .
I argued with the mortgage lender about what it costs to make a Passivhaus building and they sent a valuer round to ask questions such as whether there would be lead flashing on the chimney .
The form he was filling out looked 30 years old .
Meanwhile , the engineer and I spent months trying to work out how to stop an externally insulated basement slipping down a hill .
I included a shed on the sedum roof just because frankly , every sedum roof should have one .
I pushed on with lots of BIM and lay awake at night worrying about whether the chiaroscuro was sufficiently nuanced and if the sun on an autumn afternoon would crawl across the south facing concrete exactly as I hoped .
Hashtag : cliché .
All I had to do next was build it .
Then one winter evening we called a halt to it all .
Life had changed and none of it made sense any longer .
Sarah had been diagnosed with an illness that prevented her from continuing her career as a GP , our finances changed overnight and driving home from work listening to Radio 4 brought the sound of Cameron and Osborne driving our economy headlong over a cliff in the name of austerity .
We woke up and told the kids the dream was over .
The news brought unexpected responses from both of them .
My 8 year old daughter confessed she preferred small cottages anyway , just as long as it included a decent chimney .
My 10 year old son , pulling himself together and wiping the tears from his eyes , immediately grabbed a piece of paper and a pen and drew a picture .
It showed the house broken down into smaller pieces , each believably within our reach a section at a time , yet ultimately combining to become something that might still result in the home we wanted .
I ’ve never been prouder .
Finally I had a proper brief .
Irk The Purists :
Liberated from the shackles of complete freedom , it was easy to embrace the new constraints .
Slice the budget in half , respond to an illness that caused vertigo and made stairs a bad idea , work out how to procure it yourself – this was the new brief .
Standing on the shoulders of giants , I channelled Charles Moore ’s three orders and I called on Walter Segal and his legacy of timber frame construction principles and combined it with the products of a local manufacturer of pre-fab cassette systems that I ’d got to know over the last few years .
Frames between optimum span centres , posts on cheap foundations , an order of machines to organise the services , single storey living in an off - site manufactured villa .
The revised planning application became a timber ark that we ’d use to ride out the emotional flood .
I lost my nerve at the last moment .
In the face of growing doubt and learning how to deal with our new family life , I lost faith in the diagram and simplified it into a single structure with a single construction strategy .
It was a mistake and the planning department , to their credit , knew it .
I quote : “ We were disappointed by the new design , it looked like the work of a different architect and we wondered what had happened .
We really liked the last proposal . ”
It was good to know they liked the previous design at least .
Not enough street presence was the feedback , a single storey structure with such simple elevation treatment just could n’t cut it amongst the rest of the street .
Could I make some of it two storeys ?
I had to acknowledge they were right .
It looked like the author had been feeling downtrodden and sorry for himself and turned out a building to match .
Which of course , he had .
An opportunity presented itself .
This request for the addition of a two storey structure meant I could test the timber frame against something else .
Throughout this period I ’d been exploring ways to improve the performance of the affordable housing we make at Axis Design , specifically I ’d been researching Passivhaus methods and developing detailing using thin joint masonry and natural materials .
Two buildings , two materials and the option for two building phases should the finances demand it .
The final redesign then became a split between two uses – sleeping and living .
Two buildings connected by a service zone .
An air - lock of carefully controlled mechanical and electrical inlets and outlets .
The order of machines ultimately found its home nestled between the order of rooms and the order of dreams .
I could connect up and commission the building on an independent trajectory to the other parts of the house , neatly allowing me to control the trades and procurement for this aspect as well as understand fully where the challenges lay in achieving the holy grail of energy efficient design : air - tight construction .
I resubmitted the planning application .
All I had to do now was build it .
A further year of discussions and sketches about timber construction , thermal bridges , vapour barriers , clay blocks and triple glazed windows has ended in a building that would at times make Walter Segal proud and at others have him rolling in his grave .
Such multi-layered , competing constraints running through almost every aspect of the house makes this project much more than the formal gestures and diagrams that made up the early pages of my sketchbook .
It ’s a hard won series of compromises chiselled out of the coal face of contemporary housing in the 21st century and I ’ve learnt to love it for exactly that .
Alongside the seminal texts I ’ve often cited on tumblr and twitter over the years I would add another to compliment the deviations I ’ve made that will irk the purists so .
Jeremy
Till ’s wonderful book ‘ Architecture Depends ’ has become a reassuring companion these last few months .
In it he encourages the embracing of contingent dependencies as a mindful architectural praxis over the search for an independent ( mindless ) architectural form :
“ My hunch is that architecture is the contingent discipline par excellence , and if we can deal with rather than deny that contingency , architecture may be seen as an exemplary form of transformative practice and lessons as to how to cope with contingency may be learned from its practice .
But architects will deserve this attention only if they give up their delusions of autonomy and engage with others in their messy complex lives . ”
Over the coming months I ’ll be sharing what I can about the messy complex project that we ’ve embarked on .
There ’ll be text and pictures at all the usual outlets and hopefully a few more unusual ones too , such as Little Printer , where you can get an alternative version of the story in a format more suited to the papernet and thermal printing .
I did mention this was en experiment did n’t I ?

SRS Introduces Thin Film Solar Tile for Clay Tile Roofs
April 20th , 2009 by Derek Markham
SRS Energy , a developer of sustainable solar roofing systems , is launching Solé Power Tile this month , bringing the first building - integrated photovoltaic ( BIPV ) roofing product to curved roofing systems .
“ Sustainability and green living is high on the consumer agenda for 2009 , with so many homeowners looking to save money and also be eco-conscious .
With green building playing such a significant role in the Obama administration ’s economic stimulus efforts , it could not come at a better time . ” – Marty Low , CEO of SRS Energy
The Solé Power Tile can help to provide for some of the energy needs of a house without installing solar panels , which may detract from the visual appeal or not be allowed due to regulations in HOA covenants .
The tiles integrate seamlessly with clay tile roofs , making it easy to upgrade a curved tile roof to a power - generating platform .
[ social_buttons ]
According to SRS , the thin film solar technology generates more energy than comparable products in the harsh roofing environment , and the Solé Tile is backed by a full product warranty to ensure reliability for both designers and their clients .
The tiles can be installed just like traditional clay tiles , but need to be installed by an authorized Solé Tile contractor .
“ Choosing to upgrade to a sustainable roof from SRS Energy puts energy savings in homeowners ’ pockets immediately and delivers compelling long - term returns . ”
– Low
SRS Energy , in partnership with US Tile , is introducing the Solé Power Tile at the American Institute of Architects 2009 National Convention and Design Exposition , April 30 , 2009 through May 2 , 2009 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Poker is a card game , which requires a bit of knowledge .
Without it , playing might be extra hard , especially when your opponents know the rules very well .
Below you can find the most common mistakes committed while playing poker – mostly when you are beginning your journey with this game .
Do not babble
Even thought it ’s not strictly a poker advice , you should avoid talking too much at the table .
The most experienced poker players agree , that it ’s highly unrecommended to go into small talk with your opponents .
Firstly , it might be a distraction for you .
Secondly , you expose yourself .
If you are a beginner ( and you probably are , since you ’re reading this article ) , you can be sure , that your more experienced opponents will read you like an open book .
By talking too much , you show other players , how you react , talk and behave when you are nervous and while at ease .
Before you really learn how to play poker and do not show your emotions , it is highly recommended to avoid too much talking .
Also , beware that really experienced poker players might try to engage you into conversation .
It ’s a common technique , letting them read newcomers .
Never show your cards – unless you have to
Poker is more a psychological game than a card one .
You have to learn how to read your opponents and avoid giving too much information .
Do not get too excited when you could have won or if you get a really good hand .
The most important thing is to keep it cool .
Even though this advice should never be written , because this is a basic knowledge , newcomers still tend to accidentally inform other players , what cards may be in their hands .
Do n’t let your emotions play the cards
If you are losing or winning incredibly fast , you might play with your emotions , not your head .
So called tilt is a type of play , where you play inexpicably due to uscuccesful result .
Even though it ’s hard when you ’re loosing , try to stay calm and remember , that you need to keep your cool .
The fact , that someone just won does n’t mean he will be winning forever .
Unfortunately , that also applies to you .
If you think your emotions are overtaking you , leave the table and try to calm down .
Light a cigarette or take a walk – playing poker with emotions all over you is n’t a good idea and might lead to wrong decisions .
Wrong decisions determine your outcome
This advice is connected to previous point .
Unfortunately , new poker players tend to get nervous or overly confident , when they win or lose .
Remember , that placing a bet once you ’ve got a pair in pre-flop is n’t necessarily the best decision .
You do n’t know what ’s in other player ’s hands and thus – try to be rational .
It does n’t mean to play it safe : rather , learn how to sens your opponents and decide , whether their cards are good or not .
Also , when winning , do n’t raise the bid too high : the fact that you were triumphant last round does n’t necesarilly mean , that it will happen this time .
Every decision you make should be rational .
When you ’re starting your adventure with poker , stay calm .
Even if it sounds silly , do not make high bets : first , try to learn the rules , see how things are done and learn to control your emotions during the game .
All above advices might sound obvious for someone , who plays poker for a long time .
However , when you are new , emotions and excitement tend to exceed over your brain and logic .
Whenever you think that happens , try to breathe slowly and count to ten .
Then , remind yourself of what you ’ve learned in both articles and experience .
Good luck !
Groups including the American Restroom Association and the World Toilet Organization view quick access to clean public toilets as no laughing matter .
People with medical problems , including bladder or bowel dysfunction , may not be able to wait .
Long waits can exacerbate other issues , including urinary - tract infections .
For years , women have most dealt with the consequences , if not the indignity , of waiting in long lines .
New York City passed a law in 2005 requiring that all new or significantly renovated places of public assembly  concert halls , arenas , Broadway theaters , stadiums and the like  have two women ’s toilet fixtures for every one devoted to men .
About half of the states and many municipalities have similar laws , with varying ratios , designed to offset the extra time that women take in the restroom and slowly undo decades of male - dominated design and construction .
“ Until relatively recently , most architects , contractors , engineers , building - code officials and clients were not concerned about this issue , ” Dr. Anthony said .
“ These were very male - dominated professions , and still are .
They rarely contacted women about their restroom needs . ”
New York ’s law came as the city was overhauling its plumbing and building codes , much of which dated to 1968 .
The city based its plumbing code on the 2003 version of the International Plumbing Code , which has specific requirements for toilet fixtures for various types of buildings and occupancies .
Almost always , women are to be supplied with more .
But because most assembly halls in the city are decades old , they generally lack in women ’s restrooms .
New construction provides a rare chance to make right .
The new Yankee Stadium , with a capacity of 52,325 , needed a minimum of 358 women ’s toilets and 176 men ’s fixtures , of which no more than half could be urinals , according to the city Department of Buildings .
A Kenyan man bit a python that wrapped him in its coils and hauled him up a tree in a struggle that lasted hours .
Farm manager Ben Nyaumbe was working in Kenya 's Malindi area at the weekend when the snake struck , apparently hunting for livestock .
" I stepped on a spongy thing on the ground and suddenly my leg was entangled with the body of a huge python , " he told the newspaper .
When the snake coiled itself round his upper body , he resorted to desperate measures .
" I had to bite it , " he said .
Tens of Russian young men and women have gathered in Moscow to participate in strange action .
They have all got there to … throw their shoes in the photo of George Bush and some other people , that were drawn on the basketball stand .
The slogan of the action was “ I wo n’t miss ! ” .

Hey Glenn :
Why do you encourage such outright deception during interviews like this one ?

http://www.foxnews.com/ glennbeck/index.html
The U.S. Supreme Court correctly held in Commissioner v. Acker that a tax liability may not be created by administrative Regulations , absent an Act of Congress creating that specific liability :
http://www.supremelaw.org/sls/
2amjur2d.htm
TRY TO FIND THAT CASE ANYWHERE AT THE IRS WEBSITE , OR ANYWHERE IN THEIR INTERNAL REVENUE MANUAL !!
After serving the Secretary of the Treasury with a SUBPOENA IN A CIVIL CASE to reveal the missing liability STATUTE , the Hon . Paul H. O'Neill not only fell silent , but he was promptly fired by George W. Bush :
http://www.supremelaw.org/
letters/irs.estopped.htm
We gave the U.S. Department of the Treasury FOUR AND ONE - HALF YEARS to answer that SUBPOENA , and they never did .
Therefore , we were entirely within our legal and lawful rights to verify a NOTICE OF DEFAULT which activated legal estoppel after it was properly filed and served on all Proper Parties :
http://www.supremelaw.org/cc/ williamson2/appeal/nad06.htm
( see Item ( 7 ) )

British comedian Charlie Brooker is poised to tackle videogames in a new TV series called Gameswipe .
Telly companies Endemol and Zeppotron confirmed as much to IncGamers , but said that production is closed and offered no dates nor details on the project .
Gameswipe will follow in the footsteps of Charlie Brooker 's Screenwipe and Newswipe .
Each picks apart the relevant subject - television and news , obviously - to expose the obsessions and preposterous goings - on of the industries in a scabrous , comic way .
They 're quite funny .
Great news , patriots !
The Obama administration 's new drugs czar says he wants to banish the War on Drugs !
Pack your bong !
Hug a crackhead !
Tell Central America to come out of hiding !
Well , maybe not just yet .
The War on Drugs is still with us , but it 's probably going to have a fancy new name , sort of like how the War on Terror is now the Overseas Contingency Operation .
Maybe we can call it the Columbia Reconfiguration Hug Squad , or US - Central American Care Package .
Gil Kerlikowske wants to rebrand the idea that the United States is fighting a war on drugs because fighting a war against drugs would be idiotic and a total waste of time , money , and lives .
The US would probably lose a war against a irrepressible , intangible idea like terror , or freedom in the case of drugs -- freedom for individuals to escape their fucked - up existences .
In fact , the US has lost these wars , just as it will lose any war where its strategy is to swing wildly in the dark , while throwing handfuls of cash at nothing .
When Kerlikowske and brand Obama rename the War on Drugs , their goal should be to pick a new name that will take our minds off the fact that the government has spent $ 18 billion on the War on Drugs Columbia Reconfiguration Hug Squad this year alone , and counting .
And that does n't include money spent at the state and local levels .
No one seems to have a clear idea of how much the entire program has cost US taxpayers , except a lone conference of mayors that once estimated the price tag at around $ 40 billion a year .
Now , multiply that figure by about 30 years .
Yikes .
This year , arrests for drug violations are expected to well exceed the 1,841,182 arrests in 2007 , of which 872,720 individuals were arrested for possessing cannabis .
These kinds of minor drug offenses lead to overcrowded prisons and the creation of a prison state where now 1 in 31 adults are in the prison corrections system , and the number of those who are nonviolent offenders exceeds the populations of Wyoming and Alaska , combined .
Kerlikowske 's promises that the administration will focus more on treatment than incarceration , disband the unfair and racist distinctions between crack and cocaine , and cease raids on marijuana clinics would all be welcome changes , and help relieve dangerously crowded prisons particularly in California .
Kerlikowske stopped short of saying drugs should be legalized , but legalizing drugs would save the US billions in taxpayer money , not to mention spare the lives of innocent indigenous people .
" Regardless of how you try to explain to people it's a ' war on drugs ' or a ' war on a product , ' people see a war as a war on the ... We 're not at war with people in this country , " says Kerlikowske .
But it 's easy to see why both Americans and Central Americans assume just that .
The US government has incarcerated millions of of its own citizens for making a personal choice about consuming drugs , while funding paramilitary forces in Central America that have killed so many innocent civilians .
At a time when the government claims there just is n't enough money for every citizen to have healthcare , getting rid of the failed War on Drugs could fund numerous national programs , and spare the lives of innocent civilians .

101 Western painters you should know
by theartwolf.com
Although this list stems from a deep study of the painters , their contribution to Western painting , and their influence on later artists ; we are aware that objectivity does not exist in Art , so we understand that most readers will not agree 100 % with this list .
In any case , theartwolf.com assures that this list is only intended as a tribute to painting and the painters who have made it an unforgettable Art
1. PABLO PICASSO ( 1881 - 1973 ) – Picasso is to Art History a giant earthquake with eternal aftermaths .
With the possible exception of Michelangelo ( who focused his greatest efforts in sculpture and architecture ) , no other artist had such ambitions at the time of placing his oeuvre in the history of art .
Picasso created the avant - garde .
Picasso destroyed the avant - garde .
He looked back at the masters and surpassed them all .
He faced the whole history of art and single - handedly redefined the tortuous relationship between work and spectator
2. GIOTTO DI BONDONE ( c.1267-1337 ) –
It has been said that Giotto was the first real painter , like Adam was the first man .
We agree with the first part .
Giotto continued the Byzantine style of Cimabue and other predecessors , but he earned the right to be included in gold letters in the history of painting when he added a quality unknown to date : emotion
3. LEONARDO DA VINCI ( 1452 -1519 ) –
For better or for worse , Leonardo will be forever known as the author of the most famous painting of all time , the " Gioconda " or " Mona Lisa " .
But he is more , much more .
His humanist , almost scientific gaze , entered the art of the quattrocento and revoluted it with his sfumetto that nobody was ever able to imitate
4. PAUL CÉZANNE ( 1839 - 1906 ) – " Cezanne is the father of us all . "
This famous quote has been attributed to both Picasso and Matisse , and certainly it does not matter who actually said it , because in either case would be appropriate .
While he exhibited with the Impressionist painters , Cézanne left behind the whole group and developed a style of painting never seen so far , which opened the door for the arrival of Cubism and the rest of the vanguards of the twentieth century
5. REMBRANDT VAN RIJN ( 1606 - 1669 ) –
The fascinating use of the light and shadows in Rembrandt 's works seem to reflect his own life , moving from fame to oblivion .
Rembrandt is the great master of Dutch painting , and , along with Velázquez , the main figure of 17th century European Painting .
He is , in addition , the great master of the self - portrait of all time , an artist who had never show mercy at the time of depicting himself
6. DIEGO VELÁZQUEZ ( 1599 - 1660 ) – Along with Rembrandt , one of the summits of Baroque painting .
But unlike the Dutch artist , the Sevillan painter spent most of his life in the comfortable but rigid courtesan society .
Nevertheless , Velázquez was an innovator , a " painter of atmospheres " two centuries before Turner and the Impressionists , which it is shown in his colossal ' royal paintings ' ( " Meninas " , " The Forge of Vulcan " ) , but also in his small and memorable sketches of the Villa Medici .
7. WASSILY KANDINSKY ( 1866 -1944 ) – Although the title of " father of abstraction " has been assigned to several artists , from Picasso to Turner , few painters could claim it with as much justice as Kandinsky .
Many artists have succeeded in painting emotion , but very few have changed the way we understand art .
Wassily Kandinsky is one of them .
8. CLAUDE MONET ( 1840 - 1926 ) –
The importance of Monet in the history of art is sometimes " underrated " , as Art lovers tend to see only the overwhelming beauty that emanates from his canvases , ignoring the complex technique and composition of the work ( a " defect " somehow caused by Monet himself , when he declared that " I do not understand why everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand , as if it were necessary to understand , when it is simply necessary to love " ) .
However , Monet 's experiments , including studies on the changes in an object caused by daylight at different times of the day ; and the almost abstract quality of his " water lilies " , are clearly a prologue to the art of the twentieth century .
9. CARAVAGGIO ( 1571 - 1610 ) –
The tough and violent Caravaggio is considered the father of Baroque painting , with his spectacular use of lights and shadows .
Caravaggio ’s chiaroscuro became so famous that many painters started to copy his paintings , creating the ' Caravaggisti ' style .
10 . JOSEPH MALLORD WILLIAM TURNER ( 1775 - 1851 ) – Turner is the best landscape painter of Western painting .
Whereas he had been at his beginnings an academic painter , Turner was slowly but unstoppably evolving towards a free , atmospheric style , sometimes even outlining the abstraction , which was misunderstood and rejected by the same critics who had admired him for decades
11 . JAN VAN EYCK ( 1390 - 1441 ) – Van Eyck is the colossal pillar on which rests the whole Flemish paintings from later centuries , the genius of accuracy , thoroughness and perspective , well above any other artist of his time , either Flemish or Italian .
12 . ALBRECHT DÜRER ( 1471 - 1528 ) –
The real Leonardo da Vinci of Northern European Rennaisance was Albrecht Dürer , a restless and innovative genious , master of drawing and color .
He is one of the first artists to represent nature without artifice , either in his painted landscapes or in his drawings of plants and animals
13 . JACKSON POLLOCK ( 1912 - 1956 ) –
The major figure of American Abstract Expressionism , Pollock created his best works , his famous drips , between 1947 and 1950 .
After those fascinating years , comparable to Picasso ’s blue period or van Gogh ’s final months in Auvers , he abandoned the drip , and his latest works are often bold , unexciting works .
14 . MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI ( 1475 - 1564 ) –
Some readers will be quite surprised to see the man who is , along with Picasso , the greatest artistic genius of all time , out of the " top ten " of this list , but the fact is that even Michelangelo defined himself as " sculptor " , and even his painted masterpiece ( the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel ) are often defined as ' painted sculptures ' .
Nevertheless , that unforgettable masterpiece is enough to guarantee him a place of honor in the history of painting
15 . PAUL GAUGUIN ( 1848 -1903 ) –
One of the most fascinating figures in the history of painting , his works moved from Impressionism ( soon abandoned ) to a colorful and vigorous symbolism , as can be seen in his ' Polynesian paintings ' .
Matisse and Fauvism could not be understood without the works of Paul Gauguin
16 . FRANCISCO DE GOYA ( 1746 -1828 ) - Goya is an enigma .
In the whole History of Art few figures are as complex as the artist born in Fuendetodos , Spain .
Enterprising and indefinable , a painter with no rival in all his life , Goya was the painter of the Court and the painter of the people .
He was a religious painter and a mystical painter .
He was the author of the beauty and eroticism of the ' Maja desnuda ' and the creator of the explicit horror of ' The Third of May , 1808 ' .
He was an oil painter , a fresco painter , a sketcher and an engraver .
And he never stopped his metamorphosis
17 . VINCENT VAN GOGH ( 1853 - 1890 ) –
Few names in the history of painting are now as famous as Van Gogh , despite the complete neglect he suffered in life .
His works , strong and personal , are one of the greatest influences in the twentieth century painting , especially in German Expressionism
18 . ÉDOUARD MANET ( 1832 -1883 ) – Manet was the origin of Impressionism , a revolutionary in a time of great artistic revolutions .
His ( at the time ) quite polemical " Olympia " or " Déjeuner sur l'Herbe " opened the way for the great figures of Impressionism
19 . MARK ROTHKO ( 1903 - 1970 ) –
The influence of Rothko in the history of painting is yet to be quantified , because the truth is that almost 40 years after his death the influence of Rothko's large , dazzling and emotional masses of color continues to increase in many painters of the 21st century
20 . HENRI MATISSE ( 1869 - 1954 ) –
Art critics tend to regard Matisse as the greatest exponent of twentieth century painting , only surpassed by Picasso .
This is an exaggeration , although the almost pure use of color in some of his works strongly influenced many of the following avant - gardes
21 . RAPHAEL ( 1483 - 1520 ) – Equally loved and hated in different eras , no one can doubt that Raphael is one of the greatest geniuses of the Renaissance , with an excellent technique in terms of drawing and color
22 . JEAN - MICHEL BASQUIAT ( 1960 - 1988 ) - Basquiat is undoubtedly the most important and famous member of the " graffiti movement " that appeared in the New York scene in the early ' 80s , an artistic movement whose enormous influence on later painting is still to be measured
23 . EDVARD MUNCH ( 1863 -1944 ) – Modernist in his context , Munch could be also considered the first expressionist painter in history .
Works like " The Scream " are vital to understanding the twentieth century painting .
24 . TITIAN ( c.1476-1576 ) –
After the premature death of Giorgione , Titian became the leading figure of Venetian painting of his time .
His use of color and his taste for mythological themes defined the main features of 16th century Venetian Art .
His influence on later artists - Rubens , Velázquez ...- is extremely important
25 . PIET MONDRIAN ( 1872 - 1944 ) – Along with Kandinsky and Malevich , Mondrian is the leading figure of early abstract painting .
After emigrating to New York , Mondrian filled his abstract paintings with a fascinating emotional quality , as we can se in his series of " boogie - woogies " created in the mid-40s
26 . PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA ( 1416 - 1492 ) - Despite being one of the most important figures of the quattrocento , the Art of Piero della Francesca has been described as “ cold ” , “ hieratic ” or even “ impersonal ” .
But with the apparition of Berenson and the great historians of his era , like Michel Hérubel - who defended the “ metaphysical dimension ” of the paintings by Piero - , his precise and detailed Art finally occupied the place that it deserves in the Art history
27 . PETER PAUL RUBENS ( 1577 - 1640 ) – Rubens was one of the most prolific painters of all time , thanks in part to the collaboration of his study .
Very famous in life , he traveled around Europe to meet orders from very wealthy and important clients .
His female nudes are still amazing in our days
28 . ANDY WARHOL ( 1928 - 1987 ) – Brilliant and controversial , Warhol is the leading figure of pop-art and one of the icons of contemporary art .
His silkscreen series depicting icons of the mass - media ( as a reinterpretation of Monet 's series of Water lilies or the Rouen Cathedral ) are one of the milestones of contemporary Art , with a huge influence in the Art of our days
29 . JOAN MIRÓ ( 1893 - 1983 ) – Like most geniuses , Miro is an unclassificable artist .
His interest in the world of the unconscious , those hidden in the depths of the mind , link him with Surrealism , but with a personal style , sometimes closer to Fauvism and Expressionism .
His most important works are those from the series of " Constellations " , created in the early 40 s
30 . TOMMASO MASACCIO ( 1401 - 1428 ) – Masaccio was one of the first old masters to use the laws of scientific perspective in his works .
One of the greatest innovative painters of the Early Renaissance
31 . MARC CHAGALL ( 1887 - 1985 ) – Artist of dreams and fantasies , Chagall was for all his life an immigrant fascinated by the lights and colors of the places he visited .
Few names from the School of Paris of the early twentieth century have contributed so much - and with such variety of ideas - to change modern
Art as this man " impressed by the light , " as he defined himself
31 . GUSTAVE COURBET ( 1819 - 1877 ) – Leading figure of realism , and a clear precedent for the impressionists , Courbet was one of the greatest revolutionaries , both as an artist and as a social - activist , of the history of painting .
Like Rembrandt and other predecessors , Courbet did not seek to create beauty , but believed that beauty is achieved when and artist represents the purest reality without artifice
33 . NICOLAS POUSSIN ( 1594 - 1665 ) –
The greatest among the great French Baroque painters , Poussin had a vital influence on French painting for many centuries .
His use of color is unique among all the painters of his era
34 . WILLEM DE KOONING ( 1904 - 1997 ) – After Pollock , the leading figure of abstract expressionism , though one of his greatest contributions was not to feel limited by the abstraction , often resorting to a heartbreaking figurative painting ( his series of " Women " are the best example ) with a major influence on later artists such as Francis Bacon or Lucian Freud
35 . PAUL KLEE ( 1879 - 1940 ) –
In a period of artistic revolutions and innovations , few artists were as crucial as Paul Klee .
His studies of color , widely taught at the Bauhaus , are unique among all the artists of his time
36 . FRANCIS BACON ( 1909 - 1992 ) - Maximum exponent , along with Lucian Freud , of the so - called " School of London " , Bacon 's style was totally against all canons of painting , not only in those terms related to beauty , but also against the dominance of the Abstract Expressionism of his time
37 . GUSTAV KLIMT ( 1862-1918 ) –
Half way between modernism and symbolism appears the figure of Gustav Klimt , who was also devoted to the industrial arts .
His nearly abstract landscapes also make him a forerunner of geometric abstraction
38 . EUGÈNE DELACROIX ( 1798 - 1863 ) – Eugène Delacroix is the French romanticism painter " par excellence " and one of the most important names in the European painting of the first half of the 19th century .
His famous “ Liberty leading the People ” also demonstrates the capacity of Painting to become the symbol of an era .
39 . PAOLO UCCELLO ( 1397 - 1475 ) – “ Solitary , eccentric , melancholic and poor ” .
Giorgio Vasari described with these four words one of the most audacious geniuses of the early Florentine Renaissance , Paolo Uccello .
40 . WILLIAM BLAKE ( 1757 - 1827 ) – Revolutionary and mystic , painter and poet , Blake is one of the most fascinating artists of any era .
His watercolors , prints and temperas are filled with a wild imagination ( almost crazyness ) , unique among the artists of his era
41 . KAZIMIR MALEVICH ( 1878 -1935 ) – Creator of Suprematism , Malevich will forever be one of the most controversial figures of the history of art among the general public , divided between those who consider him an essential renewal and those who consider that his works based on polygons of pure colors do not deserve to be considered Art
42 . ANDREA MANTEGNA ( 1431 - 1506 ) –
One of the greatest exponents of the Quattrocento , interested in the human figure , which he often represented under extreme perspectives ( " The Dead Christ " )
43 . JAN VERMEER ( 1632 -1675 ) – Vermeer was the leading figure of the Delft School , and for sure one of the greatest landscape painters of all time .
Works such as " View of the Delft " are considered almost " impressionist " due to the liveliness of his brushwork .
He was also a skilled portraitist
44 . EL GRECO ( 1541 - 1614 ) –
One of the most original and fascinating artists of his era , with a very personal technique that was admired , three centuries later , by the impressionist painters
45 . CASPAR DAVID FRIEDRICH ( 1774 -1840 ) – Leading figure of German Romantic painting , Friedrich is still identified as the painter of landscapes of loneliness and distress , with human figures facing the terrible magnificence of nature .
46 . WINSLOW HOMER ( 1836 - 1910 ) –
The main figure of American painting of his era , Homer was a breath of fresh air for the American artistic scene , which was " stuck " in academic painting and the more romantic Hudson River School .
Homer 's loose and lively brushstroke is almost impressionistic .
47 . MARCEL DUCHAMP ( 1887 - 1968 ) –
One of the major figures of Dadaism and a prototype of " total artist " , Duchamp is one of the most important and controversial figures of his era .
His contribution to painting is just a small part of his huge contribution to the art world .
48 . GIORGIONE ( 1478 - 1510 ) -
Like so many other painters who died at young age , Giorgione ( 1477 - 1510 ) makes us wonder what place would his exquisite painting occupy in the history of Art if he had enjoyed a long existence , just like his direct artistic heir - Titian .
49 . FRIDA KAHLO ( 1907 - 1954 ) –
In recent years , Frida 's increasing fame seems to have obscured her importance in Latin American art .
On September 17th , 1925 , Kahlo was almost killed in a terrible bus accident .
She did not died , but the violent crash had terrible sequels , breaking her spinal column , pelvis , and right leg ..
After this accident , Kahlo 's self - portraits can be considered as quiet but terrible moans
50 . HANS HOLBEIN THE YOUNGER ( 1497 - 1543 ) – After Dürer , Holbein is the greatest of the German painters of his time .
The fascinating portrait of " The Ambassadors " is still considered one of the most enigmatic paintings of art history
51 . EDGAR DEGAS ( 1834 - 1917 ) – Though Degas was not a " pure " impressionist painter , his works shared the ideals of that artistic movement .
Degas paintings of young dancers or ballerinas are icons of late 19th century painting
52 . FRA ANGELICO ( 1387 - 1455 ) –
One of the great colorists from the early Renaissance .
Initially trained as an illuminator , he is the author of masterpieces such as " The Annunciation " in the Prado Museum .
53 . GEORGES SEURAT ( 1859 - 1891 ) - Georges Seurat is one of the most important post - impressionist painters , and he is considered the creator of the " pointillism " , a style of painting in which small distinct points of primary colors create the impression of a wide selection of secondary and intermediate colors .
54 . JEAN - ANTOINE WATTEAU ( 1684 -1721 ) – Watteau is today considered one of the pioneers of rococo .
Unfortunately , he died at the height of his powers , as it is evidenced in the great portrait of " Gilles " painted in the year of his death
55 . SALVADOR DALÍ ( 1904 - 1989 ) – " I am Surrealism ! " shouted Dalí when he was expelled from the surrealist movement by André Breton .
Although the quote sounds presumptuous ( which was not unusual in Dalí ) , the fact is that Dalí 's paintings are now the most famous images of all the surrealist movement .
56 . MAX ERNST ( 1891 - 1976 ) – Halfway between Surrealism and Dadaism appears Max Ernst , important in both movements .
Ernst was a brave artistic explorer thanks in part to the support of his wife and patron , Peggy Guggenheim
57 . TINTORETTO ( 1518 - 1594 ) - Tintoretto is the most flamboyant of all Venetian masters ( not the best , such honour can only be reclaimed by Titian or Giorgione ) and his remarkable oeuvre not only closed the Venetian splendour till the apparition of Canaletto and his contemporaries , but also makes him the last of the Cinquecento masters .
58 . JASPER JOHNS ( born 1930 ) –
The last living legend of the early Pop Art , although he has never considered himself a " pop artist " .
His most famous works are the series of " Flags " and " Targets " .
59 . SANDRO BOTTICELLI ( 1445-1510 ) – " If Botticelli were alive now he would be working for Vogue " , said actor Peter Ustinov .
As well as Raphael , Botticelli had been equally loved or hated in different eras , but his use of color is one of the most fascinating among all old masters .
60 . DAVID HOCKNEY ( born 1937 ) - David Hockney is one of the living myths of the Pop Art. Born in Great Britain , he moved to California , where he immediately felt identified with the light , the culture and the urban landscape of the ' Golden State '
61 . UMBERTO BOCCIONI ( 1882 -1916 ) –
The maximum figure of Italian Futurism , fascinated by the world of the machine , and the movement as a symbol of contemporary times .
62 . JOACHIM PATINIR ( 1480 - 1524 ) – Much less technically gifted than other Flemish painters like Memling or van der Weyden , his contribution to the history of art is vital for the incorporation of landscape as a major element in the painting .
63 . DUCCIO DA BUONINSEGNA ( c.1255/60 – 1318/19 ) – While in Florence Giotto di Bondone was changing the history of painting , Duccio of Buoninsegna provided a breath of fresh air to the important Sienese School .
64 . ROGER VAN DER WEYDEN ( 1399 - 1464 ) – After Van Eyck , the leading exponent of Flemish painting in the fifteenth century ; a master of perspective and composition .
65 . JOHN CONSTABLE ( 1776 - 1837 ) – John Constable ( 1776 - 1837 ) is , along with Turner , the great figure of English romanticism .
But unlike his contemporary , he never left England , and he devoted all his time to represent the life and landscapes of his beloved England .
66 . JACQUES - LOUIS DAVID ( 1748-1825 ) – David is the summit of neoclassicism , a grandiloquent artist whose compositions seem to reflect his own hectic and revolutionary life .
67 . ARSHILLE GORKY ( 1905 - 1948 ) – Armenian - born American painter , Gorky was a surrealist painter and also one of the leaders of abstract expressionism .
He was called " the Ingres of the unconscious " .
68 . HIERONYMUS BOSCH ( 1450 - 1516 ) –
An extremely religious man , all works by Bosch are basically moralizing , didactic .
The artist sees in the society of his time the triumph of sin , the depravation , and all the things that have caused the fall of the human being from its angelical character ; and he wants to warn his contemporaries about the terrible consequences of his impure acts .
69 . PIETER BRUEGEL THE ELDER ( 1528 -1569 ) -
Many scholars and art critics claim to have found important similarities between the works by Hyeronimus Bosch and those by Brueghel , but the truth is that the differences between both of them are abysmal .
Whereas Bosch 's fantasies are born of a deep deception and preoccupation for the human being , with a clearly moralizing message ; works by Bruegel are full of irony , and even filled with a love for the rural life , which seems to anticipate the Dutch landscape paintings from the next century .
70 . SIMONE MARTINI ( 1284-1344 ) –
One of the great painters of the Trecento , he was a step further and helped to expand its progress , which culminated in the " International Style " .
71 . Frederic Edwin Church ( 1826-1900 ) - Church represents the culmination of the Hudson River School : he had Cole 's love for the landscape , Asher Brown Durand 's romantic lyricism , and Albert Bierstadt 's grandiloquence , but he was braver and technically more gifted than anyone of them .
Church is without any doubt one of the greatest landscape painters of all time , perhaps only surpassed by Turner and some impressionists and postimpressionists like Monet or Cézanne .
72 . EDWARD HOPPER ( 1882 - 1967 ) – Hopper is widely known as the painter of urban loneliness .
His most famous work , the fabulous " Nighthawks " ( 1942 ) has become the symbol of the solitude of the contemporary metropolis , and it is one of the icons of the 20th century Art .
73 . LUCIO FONTANA ( 1899 - 1968 ) – Father of the " White Manifesto " , in which he stated that " Matter , colour and sound in motion are the phenomena whose simultaneous development makes up the new art " .
His “ Concepts Spatiales ” are already icons of the art of the second half of the twentieth century .
74 . FRANZ MARC ( 1880 - 1916 ) – After Kandinsky , the great figure of the Expressionist group " The Blue Rider " and one of the most important expressionist painters ever .
He died at the height of his artistic powers , when his use of color was even anticipating the later abstraction .
75 . PIERRE - AUGUSTE RENOIR ( 1841-1919 ) –
One of the key figures of Impressionism , he soon left the movement to pursue a more personal , academic painting .
76 . JAMES MCNEILL WHISTLER ( 1834-1903 ) – Along with Winslow Homer , the great figure of American painting of his time .
Whistler was an excellent portraitist , which is shown in the fabulous portrait of his mother , considered one of the great masterpieces of American painting of all time .
77 . THEODORE GÉRICAULT ( 1791 - 1824 ) – Key figure in romanticism , revolutionary in his life and works despite his bourgeois origins .
In his masterpiece , " The raft of the Medusa " , Gericault creates a painting that we can define as " politically incorrect " , as it depicts the miseries of a large group of castaways abandoned after the shipwreck of a French naval frigate .
78 . WILLIAM HOGARTH ( 1697 - 1764 ) –
A list of the great portrait painters of all time should never miss the name of William Hogarth , whose studies and sketches could even qualify as " pre-impressionist " .
79 . CAMILLE COROT ( 1796 - 1875 ) –
One of the great figures of French realism in the 19th century and certainly one of the major influences for the impressionist painters like Monet or Renoir , thanks to his love for " plen-air " painting , emphasizing the use of light .
80 . GEORGES BRAQUE ( 1882 - 1963 ) – Along with Picasso and Juan Gris , the main figure of Cubism , the most important of the avant - gardes of the 20th century Art .
81 . HANS MEMLING ( 1435 - 1494 ) – Perhaps the most complete and " well - balanced " of all fifteenth century Flemish painters , although he was not as innovative as Van Eyck or van der Weyden .
82 . GERHARD RICHTER ( born 1932 ) –
One of the most important artists of recent decades , Richter is known either for his fierce and colorful abstractions or his serene landscapes and scenes with candles .
83 . AMEDEO MODIGLIANI ( 1884-1920 ) –
One of the most original portraitists of the history of painting , considered as a " cursed " painter because of his wild life and early death .
84 . GEORGES DE LA TOUR ( 1593 - 1652 ) –
The influence of Caravaggio is evident in De la Tour , whose use of light and shadows is unique among the painters of the Baroque era .
85 . GENTILESCHI , ARTEMISIA ( 1597 -1654 ) –
One of the most gifted artists of the early baroque era , she was the first female painter to become a member of the Accademia di Arte del Disegno in Florence .
86 . JEAN FRANÇOIS MILLET ( 1814 - 1875 ) –
One of the main figures of the Barbizon School , author of one of the most emotive paintings of the 19th century :
The " Angelus " .
87 . FRANCISCO DE ZURBARÁN ( 1598 - 1664 ) –
The closest to Caravaggio of all Spanish Baroque painters , his latest works show a mastery of chiaroscuro without parallel among any other painter of his time .
88 . CIMABUE ( c.1240-1302 ) –
Although in some of his works Cimabue already represented a visible evolution of the rigid Byzantine art , his greatest contribution to painting was to discover a young talented artist named Giotto ( see number 2 ) , who changed forever the Western painting .
89 . JAMES ENSOR ( 1860 - 1949 ) – Violent painter whose strong , almost " unfinished " works make him a precursor of Expressionism
90 . RENÉ MAGRITTE ( 1898 - 1967 ) –
One of the leading figures of surrealism , his apparently simple works are the result of a complex reflection about reality and the world of dreams
91 . EL LISSITZKY ( 1890 - 1941 ) –
One of the main exponents of Russian avant - garde painting .
Influenced by Malevich , he also excelled in graphic design .
92 . EGON SCHIELE ( 1890 - 1918 ) – Another " died too young " artist , his strong and ruthless portraits influenced the works of later artists , like Lucian freud or Francis Bacon .
93 . DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI ( 1828 -1882 ) – Perhaps the key figure in the pre-Raphaelite movement , Rossetti left the poetry to focus on classic painting with a style that influenced the symbolism .
94 . FRANS HALS ( c.1580-1666 ) –
One of the most important portraitists ever , his lively brushwork influenced early impressionism .
95 . CLAUDE LORRAIN ( 1600 - 1682 ) –
His works were a vital influence on many landscape painters for many centuries , both in Europe ( Corot , Courbet ) and in America ( Hudson River School ) .
96 . ROY LICHTENSTEIN ( 1923 -1977 ) – Along with Andy Warhol , the most famous figure of the American Pop - Art .
His works are often related to the style of the comics , though Lichtenstein rejected that idea .
97 . GEORGIA O'KEEFE ( 1887 -1986 ) – A leading figure in the 20th century American Art , O'Keefe single - handedly redefined the Western American painting .
98 . GUSTAVE MOREAU ( 1826-1898 ) –
One of the key figures of symbolism , introverted and mysterious in life , but very free and colorful in his works .
99 . GIORGIO DE CHIRICO ( 1888 - 1978 ) – Considered the father of metaphysical painting and a major influence on the Surrealist movement .
100 . FERNAND LÉGER ( 1881 - 1955 ) –
At first a cubist , Leger was increasingly attracted to the world of machinery and movement , creating works such as " The Discs " ( 1918 ) .
101 . JEAN - AUGUSTE -DOMINIQUE
INGRES ( 1780 - 1867 ) – Ingres was the most prominent disciple of the most famous neoclassicist painter , Jacques Louis David , so he should not be considered an innovator .
He was , however , a master of classic portrait .
Wholesale copying of music on P2P networks is fair use .
Statutory damages can't be applied to P2P users .
File - swapping results in no provable harm to rightsholders .
These are just some of the assertions that Harvard Law professor Charles Nesson made last week in his defense of accused file - swapper Joel Tenenbaum .
In court filings , Nesson spelled out his defense strategy , which does n't appear to involve claims that his client " did n't do it . "
Instead , Nesson argues that it does n't matter if Tenenbaum copied music ; such noncommercial uses are presumptively " fair " and anyone seeking to squeeze file - swappers for statutory damages is entitled to precisely zero dollars .
The strategy certainly does n't lack for boldness .
In making the case that statutory damages only apply to commercial infringers , Nesson says that his reading of the law is " constitutionally compelled . "
His most interesting argument is that the law offers rightsholders the chance to seek either statutory or actual damages , but that the two are meant to be equivalent .
" It would be a bizarre statute indeed that offered two completely unrelated remedies , " he writes , " one which granted actual damages and lost profits , and the other of which granted plaintiffs the right to drive a flock of sheep across federal property on the third day of each month . "
If the two remedies are equivalent , and if " individual noncommercial copying results in no provable actual harm to the copyright harm holder , " then actual damages would be zero — and so would statutory damages .
" In this context , it would be unreasonable to consider the $ 150,000 per infringement authorized [ by the law ] as an appropriate substitute for the zero actual damages . "
( The recording industry has not sought $ 150,000 per infringement in any case , and the statute actually allows a spread that begins at $ 750 per infringement .
In the Jammie Thomas trial , a jury settled on an amount close to $ 10,000 per song . )
It 's all fair use
In any event , all of this statutory damages talk does n't matter , because Nesson claims that Tenenbaum 's use of the songs at issue here was " fair use " and thus not an infringement at all .
It 's a gutsy move to claim that wholesale downloads of complete copyrighted works for no purpose higher than mere enjoyment of music somehow satisfies the famous " four factor test " for fair use claims , but Nesson believes he can win over a jury .
" Defendant Tenenbaum expects and plans to offer the jury evidence relating to each one of these four factors , " Nesson wrote in his court filing , " just as they are articulated in the statute , with the jury to decide their meaning as they apply to the facts of his particular case . "
Nesson has been floating this idea to his supporters for some time , but the reception has been frosty .
Lawyers like Lawrence Lessig , a huge fan of " free culture , " remixing , mashups , and reduced copyright protections , wrote in an e-mail to Nesson that " of course [ Tenenbaum 's conduct ] was against the law , and you do the law too much kindness by trying to pretend ( or stretch ) ' fair use ' excuses what he did .
It does n't . "
And Terry Fisher , who heads Harvard 's Berkman Center for Internet & Society and is an expert on fair use , pointed out that P2P filesharing would likely fail the four factors test .
" This is not to suggest , of course , that it 's sensible for the legal system to be set up in such a way as to enable and encourage the RIAA to go after people like Joel , " he wrote .
" I devoted much of a book to arguing that it ’s not — and I 'm happy to testify to that effect .
But the fair use doctrine does not , in my view , provide a plausible vehicle for reform . "
But last week 's court filings indicate that this is precisely how Nesson intends to argue the case .
As for the " four factors , " he plans to address them ... but also to go far beyond them .
Nesson will introduce " other factors " that the jury should consider in the case , which include " the copyright holder 's knowledge of and assumption of risk when it published the copyrighted work that work would be ripped and shared on P2P networks . "
Should Nesson win , he will essentially legalize the sharing of all digital goods , copyrighted or not , by noncommercial users .
Given that he wants to make the case about big principles like fair use and the applicability of statutory damages — and not about whether Joel Tenenbaum did what he is accused of doing — the music industry is likely to fight even harder to ensure that Nesson 's preferred outcome is not realized .
The fireworks are scheduled to begin this summer in Massachusetts federal court .
A couple years ago I went through a technical due diligence ( TDD ) of several relatively small offshore vendors .
The vendors were providing product development services for one of my clients , the vendors also supported operations of the SaaS for all of the products .
The client had fully outsourced s/w product development and support to those vendors and retained practically no technology resources internally with exception of MIS / SaaS IT support .
The goal of the TDD process was to asses whether the vendors are efficient and can continue performing fairly complex projects involving working with sensitive information .
There are a couple important distinctions here :
The vendors were in large degree focused on the product development for my client and the rest of their business was relatively small .
The vendors have been performing services for a number of years with very light oversight from the client ’s side .
The quality of work to date has been on a low side yet deemed sufficient for the money .
As you can imagine results of the TDD was vitally important for the vendors as well as for the client .
I will cover some findings and specific areas that I would recommend to focus on in other post (s ) .
At this point I would like to concentrate on general framework / outline of the TDD process I employed on this specific engagement .
TDD included three distinct components – Technical Capability Analysis , Resources Assessment , and lightweight Information Security audit .
The budget for TDD process in terms of $ $ and time allocation was exceptionally small , so I had to stay just a few notches below high - level TDD , I would be hard pressed to call it a midlevel TDD .
The questionnaire I developed for the process is presented below ( I took out the parts which are completely proprietary or overly specific for to this engagement ) .
The questionnaire was used as the outline of the TDD process .
The vendors had to answer the questions prior to meeting me .
That allowed us to concentrate only on the areas where I found mismatch , drill in on specific areas of concern , or do the answer verification .
Some of the questions were fairly generic and I was prepared to see just brief pointers in the answer and discuss underlying details at the meeting .
For staff assessment of course the most important element was interviews .
InfoSec audit was exceptionally light with interviews and on - site survey being the major components .
To see the questionnaire just follow this link – Offshore TDD .
I think whether you are about to run technical due diligence on your offshore vendor (s ) or are about to be audited you will find it helpful .
At a lobbying dinner hosted by the MPAA , Vice President Joe Biden chastised piracy as " pure theft " and assured the MPAA that President Obama 's administration will find the right person for the intellectual property czar .

Showing favor towards the MPAA , President Obama also appointed Jon Leibowitz — former vice president of congressional affairs of the MPAA — as the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission earlier this year .
As you may recall , former president Bush signed a bill last October , creating the intellectual property czar position to lead the fight against piracy and intellectual property violations .

In 2006 , James Kirby , the man behind the V / Vm record label and The Caretaker , began a download project called The Death of Rave .
The tracks have a thin , almost translucent quality , as if they are figments or phantoms of the original , exhilarating sound of rave .
When I interviewed Kirby recently , he explained that the project had been initiated to commemorate a certain energy that he believes has disappeared from dance music .
( Energy Flash was , of course , the title the critic Simon Reynolds gave to his compendious study of rave music and its progeny . )
The question is : were rave and its offshoots jungle and garage just that – a sudden flash of energy that has since dissipated ?
More worryingly , is the death of rave only one symptom of an overall energy crisis in culture ?
Are cultural resources running out in the same way as natural resources are ?
Those of us who grew up in the decades between the 1960s and the 1990s became accustomed to rapid changes in popular culture .
Theorists of future shock such as Alvin Toffler and Marshall McLuhan plausibly claimed that our nervous systems were themselves sped up by these developments , which were driven by the development and proliferation of technologies .
Popular artefacts were marked with a technological signature that dated them quite precisely : new technology was clearly audible and visible , so that it would be practically impossible , say , to confuse a film or a record from the early 1960s with one from even half a decade later .
The current decade , however , has been characterised by an abrupt sense of deceleration .
A thought experiment makes the point .
Imagine going back 15 years in time to play records from the latest dance genres – dubstep , or funky , for example – to a fan of jungle .
One can only conclude that they would have been stunned – not by how much things had changed , but by how little things have moved on .
Something like jungle was scarcely imaginable in 1989 , but dubstep or funky , while by no means pastiches , sound like extrapolations from the matrix of sounds established a decade and a half ago .
Needless to say , it is not that technology has ceased developing .
What has happened , however , is that technology has been decalibrated from cultural form .
The present moment might in fact be best haracterised by a discrepancy between the onward march of technology and the stalling , stagnation and retardation of culture .
We ca n’t hear technology any more .
There has been a gradual disappearance of the sound of technological rupture – such as the irruption of Brian Eno ’s analogue synth in the middle of Roxy Music ’s “ Virginia Plain ” , or the cut - and - paste angular alienness of early rave – that pop music once taught us to expect .
We still see technology , perhaps , in cinema CGI , but CGI ’s role is somewhat paradoxical : its aim is precisely to make itself invisible , and it has been used to finesse an already established model of reality .
High - definition television is another example of the same syndrome : we see the same old things , but brighter and glossier .
The principal way in which technology now makes itself felt in culture is of course in the areas of distribution and consumption .
Downloading and Web 2.0 have famously led to new ways of accessing culture .
But these have tended to be parasitic on old media .
The law of Web 2.0 is that everything comes back , whether it be adverts , public information films or long - forgotten TV serials : history happens first as tragedy , then as YouTube .
The pop artists who supposedly became successful because of web clamour ( Sandi Thom , Arctic Monkeys ) turned out to be quaintly archaic in form ; in any case , they were pushed through the familiar promotional machinery of big record companies and PR firms .
There is peer - to - peer distribution of culture , but little sign of peer - to - peer production .
The best blogs are one exception ; they have bypassed the mainstream media , which , for the reasons described by Nick Davies in last year ’s Flat Earth News , has become increasingly conservative , dominated by press releases and PR .
In general , however , Web 2.0 encourages us to behave like spectators .
This is not only because of the endless temptations to look back offered by burgeoning online archives , it is also because , thanks to the ubiquity of recording devices , we find ourselves becoming archivists of our own lives : we never experience live events , because we are too busy recording them .
Yet instantaneous exposure deprives cultures of the time and space in which they can grow .
There is as yet no Web 2.0 equivalent of the circuit that sustained UK dance music in the 1990s : the assemblage of dubplates , pirate radio and the dance floor which acted as a laboratory for the development of new sounds .
This circuit was still punctuated by particular moments ( the club night , the radio broadcast ) , but , because anything in Web 2.0 can be replayed at any time , its temporality is more diffuse .
The tendency seems to be for a kind of networked solipsism , a global system of individuals consuming an increasingly homogeneous culture alone in front of the computer screen or plugged in to iPod headphones .
All of this makes Fredric Jameson ’s theories about postmodern culture ’s inability to image the present more compelling than ever .
As the gap between cultural breaks becomes ever longer and the breaks themselves become ever more modest and slight , it is beginning to look as if the situation might be terminal .
Alex Williams , who runs the Splintering Bone Ashes blog , goes so far as to claim that “ what we have experienced is merely a blip , perhaps never to be again repeated – 150 or so years of extreme resource bingeing , the equivalent of an epic amphetamine session .
What we are already experiencing is little more than the undoubtedly grim ‘ comedown ’ of the great deceleration . ”
This might be too bleak .
What is certainly clear , however , is that technology will not deliver new forms of culture all on its own .

Harry Reid really goes out on a limb here :
At this time , he opposes transferring detainees to American prisons .
If the administration proposes a plan that recommends the transfer of some detainees to American prisons , he will evaluate it carefully and make a judgment at that time .
He will always strongly oppose the release of any terrorists onto American streets .
Now if Senator Reid would be kind enough to let us know who 's talking about releasing terrorists into the streets ... besides Republicans , that is :
The headline of a just - released Senate Republican Policy Committee document on what to do with Guantanamo Bay detainees : Meet Your New Neighbor , Khalid Sheikh Mohammad ?
Who 's writing Reid 's material these days ?
Dick Cheney ?

This is the world we wanted .
All who would have seen us dead
are dead .
I hear the witch 's cry
break in the moonlight through a sheet
of sugar : God rewards .
Her tongue shrivels into gas . . .
Now , far from women 's arms
and memory of women , in our father 's hut
we sleep , are never hungry .
Why do I not forget ?
My father bars the door , bars harm
from this house , and it is years .
No one remembers .
Even you , my brother ,
summer afternoons you look at me as though
you meant to leave ,
as though it never happened .
But I killed for you .
I see armed firs ,
the spires of that gleaming kiln --
Nights I turn to you to hold me
but you are not there .
Am I alone ?
Spies
hiss in the stillness , Hansel ,
we are there still and it is real , real ,
that black forest and the fire in earnest .

The Telegraph reports on the pictures Obama is trying to keep from the public eye :
At least one picture shows an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee .
Further photographs are said to depict sexual assaults on prisoners with objects including a truncheon , wire and a phosphorescent tube .
Larisa Alexandrovna recalls that pictures of this sort have already been released and re-posts them .

Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said Monday the federal deficit will be " substantially more " than the government projected in January 's 2009 - 2010 budget .
The initial deficit forecast was $ 34 billion .
But Flaherty said that government revenues have been hit harder by the recession than expected .
" We will run a larger deficit in this year than anticipated in January , and I 'll report further on that when the government reports to the people of Canada and Parliament in June with our update , " he said .
The government has also forecast a $ 30 - billion deficit for 2010 - 2011 , and more deficits in the following three years .
Flaherty 's comments came after a meeting with his provincial counterparts in Chelsea , Que. , as the provinces push for more money from Ottawa to help them cope with the financial downturn .
The ministers decided to form a study group that will examine Canada 's private pension plan system .
Flaherty 's parliamentary secretary , Ted Menzies , will oversee the group .
Ontario Finance Minister Dwight Duncan and other provincial ministers had called on the federal government to focus on the lack of retirement savings among Canadians , as the recession erodes people 's bank accounts .
" We need to look at the question of pension adequacy , " Duncan told CTV's Power Play .
" In Ontario -- and I think the number is comparable across the country -- only about 30 per cent of people have a private pension . "
He also said many of those with pension plans are not maximizing their savings with the various tax incentives , and that increasing longevity is also having an impact .
" We 're living longer , " he said .
" The costs associated with getting older , like heavier medical needs and heavier long - term care needs , mean that our costs are going to be higher than I think many of us are anticipating . "
Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty said on Monday he personally asked Prime Minister Stephen Harper to host a national summit to develop polices that will maintain a decent retirement income for seniors .
McGuinty rejected a call from Ontario's New Democrats on Monday to establish a provincial pension plan for the two - thirds of people who do n't have a workplace pension .
But he told the legislature if the federal government fails to act , it 's something he would consider .
McGuinty said that most premiers agree the issue needs to be dealt with at the national level even though British Columbia and Alberta mulled over the possibility of setting up their own provincial plans .
Demands for Ottawa to act have been increasing as private pension schemes falter and stocks suffer from the recession .
TD Chief Economist Don Drummond said many Canadians have been left with inadequate amounts of savings in their Registered Retirement Savings Plans .
He said the Canadian Pension Plan only replaces about a quarter of one 's earnings after retirement and as the baby boomers begin to retire , the system will be put under considerable stress .
" There is an onus on the public policy authorities either to make other alternative plans available voluntarily or perhaps even make it compulsory , " he told CTV Newsnet .
Although the Conservatives have introduced incentives for Canadians to save money such as tax - free savings accounts , they have been reluctant to shore up pension savings on a broad scale .
Rather , the government has so far directed its efforts to study how to preserve the small amount of workplace pension plans regulated by Ottawa .
Flaherty said pensions will be a major part of the discussion and agreed with Duncan that the issue needs a national approach , even though only 10 per cent of private pensions are regulated by the federal government
" We 're all Canadians , we 're all in this together , " he said Monday .
Employment insurance
Earlier Monday , Duncan said that Canada should not enter into an election at this time over the contentious issue of reforming employment insurance .
Despite Ontario's criticism of the current EI system , which leaves Ontarians facing tougher eligibility requirements than other Canadians , Duncan said he does not favour an election .
" We prefer not to see an election right now , we prefer to see real change to provide fairness for the unemployed , " he said on his way into a meeting with the Jim Flaherty and other provincial finance ministers .
Hit with massive layoffs in the auto sector , Ontarians still need 420 hours of work to qualify for EI , which Duncan said is too many .
" The rules that are in place now were set a time when the economy was very different , " he added .
Drummond told CTV
Newsnet the EI system is " badly broken , " adding that regional differentiations for eligibility are at the heart of the problem .
He said it 's harder for workers to qualify for EI in areas with lower unemployment because they are required to have worked more hours to be eligible .
Still , it 's difficult to find jobs in these areas , he said , and that 's leaving many Canadians who have paid into the system for years without assistance just because of where they live .
Human Resources Minister Diane Finley said Monday that unemployed Canadians would be better served by job training than revamping the EI system .
" Going into this recession , unlike previous ones , we had significant skills shortages right across the country in a wide range of professions , " she told Power Play .
" We need to encourage people to get those skills for the jobs of the future . "
With files from The Canadian Press
It seems there 's no end to the Facebook spam and phishing attacks .
Today my Facebook inbox shows there 's another attack underway that 's suckering even some of the most tech savvy users : I 'm receiving Facebook mails with links to " .be " sites which are obviously nefarious .
The subject line of the mails is " Look at This " .
If you receive such a mail , DO NOT click links to the following sites :

Palm Pre Plays Nice With iTunes
According to Fortune Magazine the Palm Pre works seamlessly with iTunes .
So seamlessly , in fact , they claim iTunes treats the phone just like an iPod or even an iPhone , the only exception being older files downloaded when DRM was still involved .
I think I can actually hear the vein in Jobs ’ temple throbbing .
Of course , we ’ve already heard Apple COO Tim Cook say that anyone attempting to jack the intellectual property of the iPhone will be hunted down and hung from the high walls at Cupertino for the birds .
I ’m pretty sure that ’s how the quote went .
I ’m not sure , though , that this little detail will make much of a difference to the serious Pre enthusiasts .
Sure , it ’s nice , and could save a few headaches , but transferring music from a computer to a device is rarely difficult , especially when there ’s no DRM involved , and the Pre has its own ways of importing contacts and the like .
If iTunes functionality is a consumer ’s primary concern , I ’m gonna guess that person is going to stick with an iPhone .
The Obama administration said Friday that it would retain a wildlife rule issued in the last days of the Bush administration that says the government cannot invoke the Endangered Species
Act to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases threatening the polar bear and its habitat .
In essence , the decision means that two consecutive presidents have judged that the act is not an appropriate means of curbing the emissions that scientists have linked to global warming .
The bear was listed as a threatened species under the act last May .
But the special rule , adopted in December , said this designation did not give the Interior Department the authority to limit greenhouse gases outside the bears ’
Arctic range .
In announcing Friday that the rule would stand , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said , “ The single greatest threat to the polar bear is the melting of Arctic sea ice due to climate change . ”
But , Mr. Salazar said , the global risk from greenhouse gases , which are generated worldwide , requires comprehensive policies , not a patchwork of agency actions carried out for particular species .
Sean Hannity ’s hypocrisy in 3 , 2 , 1 …
As you ’ve seen everywhere , conservatives are all up in arms about Wanda Sykes and her roasting at the White House Correspondents Dinner .
While somethings are better left unsaid , and jokes are often based in fact , not to mention this was a roast , Sean Hannity had the following to say about the incident .
Calling him a terrorist , comparing him to bin Laden , et cetera , et cetera , and then wishing kidney failure .
Now for all the moral indignation and outrage over waterboarding , what would be worse , wishing an American citizen who has a different point of view that his kidneys fail and to waterboard a terrorist to get information ?
Now there is a double standard .
Now can you imagine if we go through this list here of — what if somebody called Barack Obama , compared him to a terrorist ?
What if somebody wished him ill ?
That he would n’t do well ?
Anyone else lose count how many times Sean Hannity has mentioned Barack Obama ’s association with so - called terrorist Bill Ayres ?
Or how about Fox News comparing Obama to Osama …
Does this ring a bell ?
You ’re right Sean , there does seem to be a double standard .
If Fox News does it , it ’s okay .
If a liberal comedian at a roast does it , it ’s bad .

Pastor : 10 Dumb Things Smart Christians Believe Pastor : 10 Dumb Things Smart Christians Believe
Email Print Img No-img Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin Comment
Many Christians , new and seasoned alike , tend to bank on promises that God never made , says one pastor .
So when God does n't come through on those " promises , " some are likely to become angry at God .
And " that to me as a pastor over all my years is always one of the saddest things , " says Larry Osborne , teaching pastor at North Coast Church in Vista , Calif .
Osborne , whose church draws over 7,000 people , is hoping to spare a lot of Jesus followers from that anger .
He 's also hoping Christians will peruse Scripture more and align themselves with what God really says rather than the " word on the street . "
So he spelled out some of the " dumb things smart Christians believe " – ten , to be specific – in a new book .
He calls those " dumb things " spiritual urban legends – a belief , story , assumption , or truism that gets passed around as fact even in Sunday - school class or a Bible study .
" What happens ... is somebody passes out a truism that sounds good and we 've just heard it so many times [ that ] we do n't bother to check it out , " Osborne explained to The Christian Post .
" And that 's the source of most of these urban legends .
They 're true partially , but they 're not true completely . "
One of the partial truths many Christians fall victim to is the belief that living God 's way will bring good fortune .

" The Bible makes no such promise , " Osborne writes in 10 Dumb Things Smart Christians Believe .
The 57 - year - old pastor recalls one moment when a church attendee named Tim waited in line to talk to him after a weekend worship service .
" [ A ]s soon as I said , ' Hey , what 's up ? ' he let loose , " Osborne writes .
" ' Bleep your bleeping God ! ' he exclaimed .
' I 'm done .
Your Jesus has n't done me a bit of good .
I 've tried to clean up my act .
I even tried your damn tithing thing .
It does n't work .
I just lost my job .
My wife needs surgery , and now I do n't have any insurance .
Where 's your bleeping God when we need him ? ' "
" After a few more expletives , he finally turned and stormed out .
I never saw him again . "
Osborne notes that it was n't a series of " tough breaks " or " unfortunate events " that caused Tim 's tirade .
Rather , it was " a set of unfounded and unrealistic expectations about what it means to follow God and what should happen when we venture to do so " that set him off .
Tim 's case is n't unique .
Many Christians expect things to work out when living God 's way , Osborne says .
" They all figure that a little bit of God might bring a little bit of luck .
So why not rub the bottle and see if a genie pops out ? " he writes .
Holding such a belief , however , could prove to be spiritually dangerous .
Moreover , it results in a lot of " pretenders or dabblers " who try to play by the rules of Christianity but not really believe in what they 're abiding .
" When we assume , imply , or promise that God is supposed to bring us good luck and lots of success , we 're set up for deep disappointment and spiritual cynicism , " he writes .
" Even worse , we risk turning the King of kings into little more than a good - luck charm . "
Osborne also warns that those who introduce Christ to others and testify of only the " abundant Christian life " while downplaying the " harder teachings of Jesus " set the stage for disillusionment when things go awry .
Following Christ can be tough and having faith is n't always going to fix everything .
It 's another spiritual urban legend – that faith can fix anything – and another one that can lead to an angry outburst or a spiritual meltdown .
As a pastor , this is one of the most common urban legends Osborne has encountered .
Many Christians believe ridding themselves of doubts and having clear positive thinking – which is how many define " faith " – will lead to their desired outcome such as physical healing .
But having faith does n't always lead to victory , at least not in the earthly sense .
While the Bible famously " tells of kingdoms won , lions muzzled , flames quenched , weaknesses turned to strength , enemies routed , [ and ] the dead raised , " it also speaks of people of faith who were " tortured , jeered , flogged , imprisoned , stoned , sawed in two , and put to death by the sword . "
They all lived by faith " yet their faith did n't fix anything , " Osborne points out .
What faith does promise , however , is forgiveness and the gift of eternal life .
" Faith is ... not an impenetrable shield that protects us from life 's hardships and trials .
It 's not a magic potion that removes every mess , " Osborne writes in his book .
" It 's designed to guide us on a path called righteousness . "
Faith , Osborne says , is trusting enough to obey .
The other eight spiritual urban legends he lists are : forgiving means forgetting , a godly home guarantees godly kids , God has a blueprint for my life , Christians should n't judge , everything happens for a reason , let your conscience be your guide , a valley means a wrong turn , and dead people go to a better place .
The common thread through all of them , Osborne said , is the " disillusionment that comes when we bank of promises that God actually never made . "
They 're " partial truths that we should n't be building the whole house on , " said Osborne , who has been teaching a four - week series on urban legends – which include more than ten – over the past summers .
While Christians are not likely to buy into all of them , most may have one or two that they fall victim to , the North Coast pastor believes .
" Sometimes we treat the Bible as if it 's a series of sound bites and little sayings that we can put on t- shirts , coffee cups and posters , " Osborne pointed out .
" But it 's a big book . "
" We need to look at what the Bible says about any subject in all of its passages .
And when we do that we 'll avoid these urban legends . "
The U.S. banking industry is strong enough to weather a deteriorating economy — that 's the headline expected from the government when it reveals the results of its bank stress tests in the first week of May .
" We expect the stress test to demonstrate that the 19 banks are all well capitalized even under the stress test 's worst - case scenario , " says Scott Talbott , senior vice president at the Financial Services Roundtable , which represents the largest financial institutions .
However , a chorus of bank analysts and economists are questioning the rigor of the stress tests if the results are really so positive .
After all , just six months ago , the entire financial system was brought to its knees from the stress of capital market losses and rising mortgage defaults .
WHO GOT TARP MONEY : Sortable list of loans " If they come out and say all the banks are fine , no one 's going to believe the test , " says Christopher Whalen , managing director at analysis firm Institutional Risk Analytics .
In February , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced the Financial Stability Plan and said it would conduct a battery of tests to gauge the soundness of the nation 's 19 largest banks , including Citigroup and Wells Fargo .
The tests would determine if the banks have sufficient capital and could withstand a worsening recession over the next two years .
The Treasury and the Federal Reserve mapped out the worst - case scenario as an unemployment rate of over 10 % and housing prices falling 22 % in 2009 .
But they left some questions unanswered , especially if the scenario worsened .
The problem is , the stress test is based on " best guesses " of how bad the economy will get , says Michael Heller , president of Veribanc , a bank - rating firm .
That means that the worst - case scenario may not be pessimistic enough .
" The Treasury in May will release the amount of cushion that each bank needs in a more severe economic scenario , " says Andrew Williams , a Treasury spokesman .
He says the goal of the test was to " increase lending by instilling confidence in banks even if the economy worsens . "
It 's not like the government does n't have a plan .
Fed chief Ben Bernanke , in a testimony before the Financial Services Committee , said if any bank needed capital after the stress test , it will have six months to raise money from the private sector .
Otherwise , it can request funds from the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program .

' Virtually identical ' to previous arguments , legal team says ;
Also seeking order directing Gov & SoS to certify Franken 's electoral victory
Oral argument set for June 1 ...
Ernest A. Canning Byon 5/12/2009 , 3:51 pm PT
Guest Blogged by Ernest A. Canning
During a news conference yesterday ( video here courtesy of TheUptake.org ) Marc Elias , representing Sen.- elect Al Franken in the election contest brought by former Sen.
Norm Coleman , announced the filing of Franken 's brief [ PDF ] responding to Coleman 's appeal [ PDF ] of the decision by the tri-partisan , three - judge election contest panel 's ruling which found : " Franken received the highest number of lawfully cast ballots in the November 4 , 2008 general election for United States Senator and is entitled to receive the certificate of election . "
Noting that , because of its ability to make credibility determinations , a trial court 's factual findings are entitled to " great deference " in an appeal , Elias observed that Coleman had a " heavy burden " in showing that the three - judge panel erred on the facts and the law .
He says it 's a burden the Coleman team has not met in their appellate arguments .
Elias noted that the legal contentions made in Coleman 's opening brief were " virtually identical " to those that were made and rejected by the three - judge panel .
We discussed Coleman 's arguments , and the three - judge panel 's rejection of them , last month in ' For Coleman , the End is Near ...'.
As our legal analysis detailed , we agree with Elias ' May 11 , 2009 assertion that the Coleman legal challenge is " without merit . "
For example , per Elias , Coleman attorney Ben Ginsberg continues to tell the media that 4,400 uncounted absentee ballots were improperly rejected , but as we observed ...
Ginsberg is referring to the three - judge panel 's February 13 , 2009 ruling which found that Minnesota 's strict standards for the opening and counting of absentee - ballots must be applied on a ballot - by - ballot basis .
Ginsberg will be appealing this ruling to a MN Supreme Court which , in Coleman v Ritchie ( March 6 , 2009 ) , already ruled [ PDF ] that those strict standards must be applied .
Good luck with that , Mr. Ginsberg .
Elias noted that during the contest trial , Coleman 's legal team conceded , and the three - judge panel found , that all but 700 of those ballots were cast by individuals who were not even registered to vote at the time of the November 2008 election .
So how can any court order those ballots opened and counted ?
Coleman attempted to put a new spin on the argument by urging that application of Minnesota 's strict statutory standards for determining which ballots shall be counted , resulted in a denial of due process .
Elias argues that Coleman waived the due process argument by failing to raise it until closing arguments before the three - judge panel and that the case cited by Coleman in his appellate brief actually says the reverse is true --- that due process would have been denied if the three - judge panel had replaced the statutory standards that required a ballot - by - ballot examination with Coleman 's lax standards that would have allowed in votes without an individualized showing that each absentee ballot had been lawfully cast .
Oral arguments before the Minnesota Supreme Court are set to commence , finally , on June 1 , 2009 at 9:00 am Central time .
They will be available to watch live via video stream right here .
Elias announced that Franken has asked the MN Supremes to affirm the district court decision , declare that Franken is entitled to a certificate of election ; that judgment be entered immediately and that the Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty and Democratic Secretary of State Mark Ritchie be ordered to perform their " ministerial duty " to prepare , countersign and deliver the certificate of election promptly to the secretary of the U.S. Senate .
In order to expedite that decision , Franken waived appellate costs , a move that would avoid a ten day delay following the MN Supreme Court 's decision .
Franken has not waived the award of costs from the contest trial .

The struggle against centrism and the founding of the Fourth International
By Bill Van Auken
15 April 2009
Below is the text of a lecture delivered at a summer school of the Socialist Equality Party held in Ann Arbor , Michigan in August 2007 .
Comrades , next year will mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Fourth International , the world party of socialist revolution , which is today led by and embodied in our world movement , the International Committee of the Fourth International ( ICFI ) .
No one would deny that there have been immense changes over the course of the past seven decades , which have seen a world war , as well as innumerable regional wars , the extension of the Stalinist bureaucracy into Eastern Europe , followed by its self - liquidation , the rise and subsequent degeneration of the anti-colonial movements and the decimation of the official labor movement in country after country .
Yet , the essential questions confronted in the founding of the Fourth International and posed so intransigently by Leon Trotsky in the years and months preceding his assassination stay evergreen .
That is , the historic epoch in which we live remains that of the world socialist revolution , which has its source in the irreconcilable social and economic contradictions of world capitalism .
The essential political problem posed to humanity by this epoch — that of resolving the crisis of leadership within the working class through the development of a world party armed with an international strategy of socialist revolution — has never been posed more acutely .
In 1992 , in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the International Committee drew up a political balance sheet of this and previous experiences and arrived at the conclusion that , in the face of the decades of betrayals by the old bureaucratic leaderships and their impact upon the political consciousness of the working class , it was necessary to overcome not only a crisis of leadership in the working class , but also a crisis of perspective .
Our task consisted of fighting for a revival of a socialist culture in the working class , a task to which the World Socialist Web Site and this school itself are dedicated .
Under conditions in which a growing radicalization of the working class is becoming evident all over the world , a serious study of the history of the Fourth International is a decisive preparation for the coming struggles .
It is only this party that consciously assimilated the strategic experiences of the working class through the course of the momentous and often tragic struggles of the twentieth century .
As we reviewed in earlier lectures , the decision to found the Fourth International was taken in 1933 in response to the catastrophe in Germany .
The coming to power of Hitler , without any organized resistance from the working class , and the absence of any subsequent discussion in the Communist International over the implications and causes of this unprecedented defeat , proved conclusively that the Third International was dead for purposes of revolution , having been transformed into an agency of the Kremlin bureaucracy and an organizer of defeats for the working class .
Trotsky ’s decision to call for the building of a new international was obviously not taken lightly .
Over the previous decade , he had insisted that , despite the crimes of the Stalinist leadership , the struggle to reform the Communist International and win its parties back to the revolutionary program of its first four congresses could not be prematurely abandoned .
Hitler ’s victory , however , was for the Third International what the voting of war credits had been for the Second — proof positive that it was finished as a revolutionary organization .
A new world revolutionary party was required .
For Trotsky , the call for a new international was not — as many of his centrist opponents saw it — merely a tactical or organizational question , but rather an unpostponable historical necessity .
This conception was substantiated further by his analysis of the Soviet regime in the wake of the German catastrophe , which was reviewed in the previous lecture on The Revolution Betrayed .
The material interests of the bureaucracy that had usurped both political power in the Soviet Union and the leadership of the Third International were irreconcilably opposed to those of the working class itself .
This counterrevolutionary bureaucratic apparatus could not be reformed , but had to be overthrown by means of a political revolution .
The founding of this new international party was prepared through the decade of struggle waged by Trotsky and the Left Opposition between 1923 and 1933 , in which Trotsky and his followers fought the development of the Stalinist bureaucracy and carried out a merciless critique of is programmatic zigzags .
In the course of this struggle , the fundamental questions of Marxist strategy and tactics were defended and positively developed , most important among them the perspective and program of revolutionary internationalism against the Moscow bureaucracy ’s national reformist orientation .
Forces were assembled around the International Left Opposition on the basis of agreement on the fundamental strategic experiences of the working class , including the betrayals of the British General Strike and the Chinese revolution , and defense of the perspective of permanent revolution against the Stalinist theory of socialism in one country .
Trotsky was more conscious than anyone else of the impact of the defeats suffered by the working class as a result of the betrayals of Stalinism and social democracy , and he was very aware of the relatively modest size of the forces adhering to the program of the International Left Opposition .
Yet , his historical prognosis was based on a scientifically grounded optimism that the crisis of capitalism was insoluble and that a correct political program would cut a path to the working class , which , despite these betrayals , remained a revolutionary class and in many countries was entering into mass struggles of an objectively revolutionary character .
The London Bureau
The five years between Trotsky ’s call for the Fourth International in 1933 and the holding of a founding conference in 1938 were marked by a continuous struggle against a wide range of centrist political organizations active during this period , particularly in Europe , many of which professed sympathy with Trotsky ’s perspective and some of which declared themselves for the Fourth International .
The struggle against centrism and the necessity for the Trotskyist movement to intervene in this milieu was posed sharply in the summer of 1933 , when the British ILP ( Independent Labour Party ) called a conference open to all organizations outside the Second and Third Internationals to assess the crisis confronting the international workers movement in face of the Nazi victory .
The Trotskyist movement decided to participate in the conference to fight for its positions and try to win over the best elements there to the struggle for the Fourth International .
This intervention was formalized in the “ Declaration of the Four , ” a document signed by the International Left Opposition , the German SAP ( Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei — Socialist Workers Party ) and two Dutch organizations that would subsequently merge under the leadership of Henricus Sneevliet .
The pivotal aim enunciated in this statement was the formation of the Fourth International in the shortest possible time :
“ While ready to cooperate with all the organizations , groups and factions that are actually developing from reformism or bureaucratic centrism ( Stalinism ) towards revolutionary Marxist policy , the undersigned , at the same time , declare that the new International cannot tolerate any conciliation towards reformism or centrism .
The necessary unity of the working class movement can be attained not by the blurring of reformist and revolutionary conceptions , nor by adaptation to the Stalinist policy , but only by combating the policies of both bankrupt Internationals .
To remain equal to its task , the new International must not permit any deviation from revolutionary principles in the questions of insurrection , proletarian dictatorship , soviet form of the state , etc . ” [ 1 ]
This declaration set out the principled attitude that the nascent Fourth International took towards these centrist parties , which at that moment were turning sharply to the left .
The Trotskyist movement was obliged to conduct this intervention both to clarify the political questions that separated it from centrism and to win over the best elements that otherwise could become trapped in this milieu .
In two of the previous lectures , we have already reviewed the political trajectory of two of the more significant of these parties — the Spanish POUM and the German SAP .
It is worth making a brief survey of some of the other organizations in the camp of centrism during that period .
Among the best known was the British ILP , an organization that predated the Labour Party , with which it was long affiliated .
Imbued with pacifism and even Christian beliefs , it had opposed the First World War , resulting in the jailing of its principal leaders , including Fenner Brockway .
In 1920 , it disaffiliated from the Second International and voiced sympathy for the Soviet Union .
Its centrist wavering between reformism and revolution found peculiar expression in its request to be admitted to the Third International with a special waiver allowing it to disavow support for armed insurrection .
Needless to say , its application was denied .
In the early 1920s , it joined with other European left socialist groups in a body that became known as the Two - and - a - half International .
Its call for the 1933 international conference came less than a year after it disaffiliated from the Labour Party and began to turn leftward .
The French PSOP ( Socialist Party of Workers and Peasants ) was led by Marceau Pivert , who joined the French Socialist Party ( SFIO ) in 1919 and consistently remained on the party ’s left wing .
He was a member of the “ Bataille Socialiste ” ( Socialist Battle ) tendency , which refused to support a bourgeois government and in 1935 founded the “ Gauche Revolutionnaire ” ( Revolutionary Left ) faction .
In addition to his strictly political role , he was also involved in the production of a number of political films , and under the Popular Front was given responsibility for the French media , including press , radio and cinema .
Pivert welcomed the mass strikes and factory occupations , publishing the 1936 article “ Everything Is Possible , ” in which he appealed for revolutionary action .
( The Stalinist French Communist Party published a reply , “ Non !
Tout n’est pas possible ! ” — ” No ! Not Everything Is Possible ! ” defending the pro-capitalist policies of the Popular Front government ) .
Pivert was forced out of the SFIO as a result of his left - wing views and founded the PSOP .
In Pivert , however , these left politics coexisted with membership in the Freemasons , an organization dominated by petty - bourgeois morality and hypocrisy that deliberately covered over class divisions .
In the end , Pivert proved incapable of breaking with the right - wing reformists .
His PSOP dissolved with the outbreak of the war , and , after the war , he returned to France to rejoin the SFIO .
Then there was the Dutch group led by Henricus Sneevliet .
As a young railroad worker , Sneevliet had led a number of militant strikes , including one national walkout in defense of striking seamen .
Disillusioned with the failure of the conservative union and social democratic bureaucracies to support these actions , he left the Netherlands for the Dutch East Indies , the former colony that corresponds roughly to present - day Indonesia .
There he organized both a rail union and a socialist society that brought together Dutch and Indonesian workers in a common organization .
With the war and the Russian Revolution , his political work achieved growing success , including among the Dutch troops , leading to his expulsion by the colonial authorities .
He was given major responsibilities by the Communist International , including as its representative in China , where he became one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party .
He soon came into clashes with the Stalinist leadership of the Dutch party , breaking with it in 1927 .
In 1933 , he was jailed for publicly supporting a mutiny by sailors on a warship off the Dutch Indies , calling it the opening shot of the colonial revolution .
He was released only as a result of his election to parliament .
While he affiliated to the International Communist League ( the name adopted by the Trotskyist International Left Opposition following 1933 ) , he broke with it five years later .
He was unwilling to subordinate national tactical considerations involving his trade union work in Holland to the strategic task of building a new revolutionary international party and opposed Trotsky ’s critique of the role of the Spanish POUM .
Sneevliet disbanded his party after the German occupation , founding a resistance group known as the Marx - Lenin - Luxemburg Front .
Captured by the Nazis , he was executed by a firing squad in 1942 .
Loosely organized in the so - called London Bureau , formally known as the International Bureau of Revolutionary Socialist Unity , most of these parties consisted of organizations that had split from either the Second International or the Third , but adopted a centrist position between them and Trotsky ’s struggle to build the Fourth .
The London Bureau was a body with no clear political banner , some of its affiliates moving to the left , others to the right , some orienting towards social democracy , others to Stalinism .
The Norwegian NAP and the Swedish Socialist Party , among the original mainstays of the organization , ended up back in the fold of Social Democracy as participants in capitalist governments .
In the end , all of these groups , some of which were considerably larger than the parties adhering to the Fourth International , ended up confirming Trotsky ’s prediction in the “ Transitional Program ” that “ The great events which rush upon mankind will not leave of these outlived organizations one stone upon another . ”
Barely a trace was to emerge of any of them in the aftermath of the Second World War .
The leaderships of these disparate groups were united only by their insistence on the need for a “ broad ” “ non-sectarian ” international organization , by which they meant one that would leave each of them free to pursue its own interests by orienting to different sections of the existing bureaucratic leaderships in their own national political environments .
The growth of centrism in this period had deep - going objective political roots .
On the one hand , the catastrophic and systemic crisis of capitalism that characterized the 1930s had rendered the programs of those parties affiliated to the Second International , which proposed the gradual amelioration of the conditions of the working class by means of incremental reforms rather than social revolution , manifestly unviable .
On the other hand , the Communist International , which still attracted the support of millions of workers around the globe based on its false identification with the October 1917 revolution , was incapable of and opposed to the organization of the working class for revolutionary purposes .
Ultimately , centrism represented — and still represents — a secondary agency of imperialism , whose specific tasks are to block the path of the revolutionary party to the working class and throw up ideological obstacles to the working class ’ theoretical and political clarification .
Many of these groups were prepared to swear formally to internationalism and accept that the Stalinist bureaucracy had betrayed the working class and suppressed the genuine Bolshevik Leninists in the Soviet Union .
On principle , they were even prepared to accept the necessity for a new international .
But in practice they maintained that the time was not right , that Trotsky ’s call was premature or that a new international could not be created in a period of defeats .
Trotsky insisted on the necessity of distinguishing between the centrism of the workers , who inevitably pass through centrist phases and even centrist organizations on the road to revolution , and the professional centrism of the leaders of these organizations , whose task is to contain the movement of the workers and divert it back into the safe channels of reformism and subordination to the bourgeoisie .
Trotsky sought patiently to win those layers of workers passing through these organizations to the Fourth International , while waging an implacable struggle against the opportunism , skepticism and pessimism that prevailed within the leaderships of these groups .
The characteristics of centrism
Centrism by its very nature is vague and ill defined , oscillating now to the left , now to the right .
It is characterized as much by what it lacks in terms of clear ideological groundings and political principles as by what it espouses .
Nonetheless , in 1934 , Trotsky spelled out in his article “ Centrism and the Fourth International ” [ 2 ] some of the fundamental traits of these organizations .
Reading it today calls to mind the saying — the more things change , the more they stay the same .
“ Theoretically , ” Trotsky wrote , “ centrism is amorphous and eclectic ; so far as possible it evades theoretical obligations and inclines ( in words ) to give preference to ‘ revolutionary practice ’ over theory , without understanding that only Marxist theory can impart revolutionary direction to practice .... ”
He continued , “ In the sphere of ideology , centrism leads a parasitic existence .
It repeats against revolutionary Marxists the old Menshevik arguments ... usually without suspecting this .
On the other hand , the main arguments against the right it borrows from the Marxists , that is , first of all from the Bolshevik Leninists , dulling , however , the sharp edge of criticism and avoiding practical conclusions , thereby rendering their criticism meaningless .... ”
Because of their inability to clearly define their political positions , Trotsky said , the centrist “ views with hatred the revolutionary principle : state what is .
He is inclined to substitute for a principled policy personal maneuvering and petty organizational diplomacy . ”
And , in an observation that anyone with any experience in our movement will find quite familiar and contemporary , he stated , “ The centrist frequently covers up his dawdling by referring to the danger of ‘ sectarianism ’ by which he understands not abstract propagandist passivity , but an active concern for purity of principles , clarity of position , political consistency and organizational completeness . ”
Also of immense significance was Trotsky ’s assessment of centrism ’s role on the international arena .
The centrist , he wrote , “ does not understand that in the present epoch , a national revolutionary party can be built only as part of an international party .
In the choice of his international allies , the centrist is even less discriminating than in his own country . ”
Indeed , this aspect , or rather this essential characteristic , of centrism would emerge again and again in the context of the struggle between the nascent Fourth International and the parties orbiting around the London Bureau .
For example , in 1933 , just a year after the British Independent Labour Party ( ILP ) had disaffiliated from the Labour Party and made a sharp shift to the left and towards the Fourth International , the party published an English edition of Trotsky ’s powerful speech delivered in Copenhagen , “ In Defense of the October Revolution . ”
The edition included an introduction by party leader James Maxton , recommending it to socialists , but insisting that the issues in the struggle between the Left Opposition and the Stalinist bureaucracy were ones about which “ only Russian socialists are competent to decide . ”
While Trotsky saw the ILP as standing on the left wing of the London Bureau and at that point was publicly seeking a discussion of the program and principles of the Fourth International with this group , he responded with characteristic intransigence to this hands - off approach to the struggle against Stalinism .
“ By these few words the international character of socialism as a scientific doctrine and as a revolutionary movement is completely refuted , ” he wrote .
“ If socialists ( communists ) of one country are incapable , incompetent , and consequently have no right to decide the vital questions of the struggle of socialists ( communists ) in other countries , the proletarian International loses all rights and possibilities of existence .... [ Maxton ] expressed himself in hidden form on the essence of the dispute and , in effect , in favor of the Stalinist faction , since our struggle with it concerns precisely the question as to whether socialism is a national or international matter . ” [ 3 ]
Trotsky ’s prescience in this matter was soon born out .
The ILP ended up opposing the demand for an international commission of inquiry on the Moscow Trials , with its leader Brockway instead proposing a commission of social democratic scoundrels to investigate the political activity of Leon Trotsky .
By 1938 the national reformist perspective that Trotsky had detected in Maxton ’s introduction 5 years earlier found completed expression in the ILP leader ’s delivering a public speech in which he thanked Tory Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain for saving the “ peace of Europe ” by reaching an accommodation with Hitler at Munich .
While not every one of the centrist parties around the London Bureau sunk so deeply into political reaction , all of them ended up opposing the Fourth International on similar nationalist grounds .
Andres Nin Andres Nin
The tragic consequences of the attempt to steer a middle course between revolutionary Marxism on the one hand and Stalinism and Social Democracy on the other found full expression in the equivocal policy of Andres Nin and the POUM ( Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista , Workers ’ Party of Marxist Unification ) in Spain , which contributed decisively to strangling the Spanish revolution and led to the POUM ’s destruction and Nin ’s murder .
The POUM ’s role , in the final analysis , was to provide a left cover to the popular front , while actively isolating the revolutionary Marxists from the masses .
In this sense , it functioned — despite Nin ’s intentions — as the principal obstacle to the building of a party capable of leading the Spanish revolution to victory .
The politics of the POUM — its electoral maneuvers with the Spanish People ’s Front and the ultimate entry of Nin into a bourgeois government — were supported by the London Bureau , and the illusions that it promoted about the POUM ’s revolutionary potential found a certain resonance within the ranks of the Trotskyists as well as sections of revolutionary workers .
Despite his denunciations of the Stalinist repression in Spain and his immense sympathy for the personal fate of Nin , Trotsky insisted on telling the truth about Nin ’s policies — that he had carried out the greatest conceivable political crime of joining a bourgeois government under conditions of socialist revolution .
This became the basis for a split with various left centrists both in and around the Fourth International who either openly or shamefacedly defended Nin ’s record .
Among the former was to be found Pivert , of the French PSOP .
In response to Trotsky ’s statement that the POUM ’s bowing before the popular front was one of the main causes of the defeat in Spain , Pivert proclaimed that the cause of defeat was not any capitulation by the POUM , but rather “ the efforts of British - French imperialism , of Italian German imperialism and also those of the Stalinists . ”
In response , Trotsky wrote , “ One can neither expect nor ask for a movement of greater scope , greater endurance , greater heroism on the part of the workers than we were able to observe in Spain .
The imperialist ‘ democrats ’ and the mercenary rabble of the Second and the Third Internationals will always behave as they did towards the Spanish revolution .
What then can be hoped for ?
He is criminal who instead of analyzing the policy of bankruptcy of the revolutionary or quasi- revolutionary organizations invokes the ignominy of the bourgeoisie and its lackeys .
It is precisely against them that a correct policy is needed ! ” [ 4 ]
This is an exchange that has found persistent echoes to this day .
Similar things were said at the recent congress in Madrid on the 70th Anniversary of the Spanish Civil War , with an entire school of bourgeois historians insisting that the cause of fascism in Spain lay not in the absence of revolutionary leadership , but the perfidy of London and Paris .
In every defeated revolution since — one could cite the cases of Bolivia in 1971 and Chile in 1973 — centrists have always sought to curtail any examination of the role played by quasi- revolutionary organizations — that is , centrist parties — in preparing the defeats , laying the blame instead on imperialism and the CIA .
Pivert also leveled the accusation that the “ sectarian methods ” of the Trotskyists were responsible for the weakening of the revolutionary vanguard .
He accused them of “ brutalizing the intelligence of the militants ” and “ interpreting with no indulgence whatever the inevitable fumblings in the search for revolutionary truth . ”
The combination of opportunism , wounded subjectivism and slander evinced by Pivert are the hallmark of countless individuals and tendencies that have broken from the Fourth International while trying to disguise their own right - centrist politics . [ 5 ]
As Trotsky pointed out , similar charges were leveled against Marx , Engels , Lenin , Rosa Luxemburg : that they were too sharp or lacked sensitivity and diplomacy in dealing with their political opponents .
This was to be explained , he said , by the fact that centrists , who had failed to break with bourgeois public opinion and felt the duplicity of their own position , did not like criticism .
On the other hand , revolutionaries , acting on the basis of an objectively determined revolutionary perspective , are prone towards confronting centrists who try to evade the implications of the political situation and their own positions .
Within the Trotskyist movement itself , the leader of the Belgian section , George Vereeken , took the position that the Fourth International was as much to blame as POUM because its sharp criticism of the Spanish party ’s entry into the government had pushed Nin away .
Here was a classic hallmark of centrism : attributing political differences to issues of personal friction or problems of regime , rather than questions of fundamental principle .

Ultimately , the dispute over Spain led to a break with Vereeken as well as with Henk Sneevliet , whose RSAP ( Revolutionair Socialistische Arbeiderspartij [ Dutch ] , Revolutionary Socialist Workers ’ Party ) was among the largest parties signing the 1935 call for the Fourth International .
While taking the form of a split and an apparent organizational crisis , this battle against centrism constituted the essential political preparation for the founding of the new world party .
The founding of the FI
The Fourth International was founded in September 1938 under conditions in which Trotsky and his followers were subjected to the most intense persecution , assassinations and even mass murder on the part of both the Soviet Stalinist bureaucracy and fascism .
It came just six months after the third of the Moscow Trials , whose defendants included Nikolai Bukharin , former editor of Pravda and head of the Communist International ; Alexei Rykov , official head of the Soviet government for five years after the death of Lenin ; Christian Rakovsky , former head of the Ukrainian government ; and N.N. Krestinsky , former secretary of the Central Committee and Politburo member .
The trial was accompanied by what can only be described as an exercise in political genocide , in which all those Communists who continued to defend the principles and program of the October 1917 revolution , that is the Trotskyists , were systematically exterminated .
After a decade of repression , Stalin feared Trotsky and his followers more than ever , recognizing that the threat of war carried with it the threat of renewed revolution .
The killings were not restricted to the Soviet Union .
The months leading up to the founding conference of the Fourth International were marked by the assassinations of Trotsky ’s son Leon Sedov , murdered in a medical clinic in Paris , the brutal slaying and dismemberment of Trotsky ’s German secretary Rudolph Klement , who was to chair the conference , and the abduction and murder in Spain of Trotsky ’s other international secretary Erwin Wolff .
This repression and the defeats suffered by the working class led some in the Trotskyist movement to oppose the founding of the Fourth International up to and including at the founding conference itself .
One of those was Trotsky ’s biographer Isaac Deutscher , who subsequently was to provide a revisionist theory of Stalin ’s role as a kind of Soviet Napoleon , a theory that provided a key ideological inspiration for the Pabloite liquidationism that attacked the Fourth International in the aftermath of the Second World War .
Deutscher in the third part of his trilogy on Trotsky , The Prophet Outcast , cites the objections to the founding of the Fourth International made by the delegates of the Polish Trotskyist group , whose arguments he had helped formulate .
“ They pointed out that it was hopeless to try to create a new International while the workers ’ movement as a whole was on the ebb , during ‘ a period of immense reaction and political depression , ’ and that all previous internationals had to some extent owed their success to the fact that they had been formed in times of revolutionary upsurge . ”
He goes on to quote the Polish delegates as saying , “ No significant section of the working class will respond to our manifesto , it is necessary to wait . ”
While proclaiming that they agreed with Trotsky that the Second and Third Internationals were “ morally dead , ” they “ warned the conference that it was frivolous to understate the hold these Internationals had on the allegiance of the working class in many countries .... ” [ 6 ]
These arguments were typical of those centrists who had drawn closest to the Trotskyist movement .
They insisted that they agreed with Trotsky on many questions , but not the practical conclusion that a new international party had to be built to assemble the Marxist cadres that were indispensable for a successful socialist revolution .
Their objections that the time was not ripe only served as a cover for their own orientation towards and awe before the existing social democratic and Stalinist bureaucracies .
Trotsky ’s starting point in the struggle to found the Fourth International and in the method that permeates its founding document , the Transitional Program , is that of a principled and scientific estimation of the objective crisis , class relations and political forces on an international scale .
He grasped the founding of the Fourth International as an objective historical necessity based on the crisis of capitalism and the betrayals of the existing bureaucratic leaderships in the workers movement .
The centrist critics who opposed the founding of the Fourth International , however , based their own arguments on wholly subjective considerations .
While they insisted on their agreement with Trotsky over the nature of Stalinism and Social Democracy , they nonetheless began from their own assessment of the grip of these bureaucracies over the masses — abstracted entirely from the struggle of the revolutionary party to break that grip — and concluded that the launching of the Fourth International was merely a futile gesture .
The parties adhering to Trotskyism were too small and isolated , they insisted , to “ proclaim ” a new international .
Only a new “ great event ” like the October Revolution could create the conditions for launching a new world party .
Against centrists like Deutscher , Trotsky insisted that the new international was founded on great events — the greatest defeats in the history of the international workers movement — in Spain , Austria , Germany , China , Italy and elsewhere — together with the extermination of socialists in the Soviet Union — events that had established the bankruptcy and counterrevolutionary character of the old bureaucracies dominating the workers movement .
If humanity was not to suffer a worldwide catastrophe , the working class had to build a new revolutionary international party .
The centrists who opposed the founding of the Fourth International on the grounds that the Stalinists were still too strong or that the masses would not understand were in fact only contributing to the stranglehold exercised by the old bureaucracies , condemning the working class to a political blind alley .
Trotsky dismissed with scorn this fixation with the supposed “ subjective causes ” for not building a new international .
He wrote : “ And what else is the task of Marxists if not to raise the subjective factor to the level of the objective and to bring the consciousness of the masses closer to the understanding of the historical necessity — in simpler terms , to explain to the masses their own interests , which they do not yet understand ?
The ‘ profound problem ’ of the centrists is profound cowardice in the face of an undeferrable task .
The leaders ... do not understand the importance of class conscious revolutionary activity in history . ” [ 7 ]
The centrists also conveniently ignored the fact that Lenin issued his call for the Third International in the wake of the great betrayal carried out by the Second , in which the social democratic parties of Europe all went over to the support of their own bourgeoisies in the First World War .
At the time , Lenin had admitted that those socialists adhering to the perspective of revolutionary defeatism that he championed constituted a minority within a minority that could have fit into a single railway car .
And they remained a small minority of the socialist movement up until the victory of the October Revolution .
Writing half a year before that revolution , in his “ April Thesis , ” Lenin insisted on the immediate founding of a new International .
This was not only because of the betrayal carried out by the social chauvinist leadership of the Second International , which , as he said , constituted the class enemy , but also to draw a sharp dividing line between revolutionary Marxists and what he termed the “ centrists ” of the Zimmerwald International , those who vacillated between social chauvinism and genuine socialist internationalism , who supported internationalism in words , but not in deeds .
“ It is we who must found , and right now , without delay , a new , revolutionary , proletarian International , or rather , we must not fear to acknowledge publicly that this new International is already established and operating .
“ This is the International of those ‘ internationalists in deed ’....
They and they alone are representatives of the revolutionary , internationalist mass , and not their corrupters .
“ And if socialists of that type are few , let every Russian worker ask himself whether there were many really class - conscious revolutionaries in Russia on the eve of the February - March revolution of 1917 .
“ It is not a question of numbers , but of giving correct expression to the ideas and policies of the truly revolutionary proletariat .
The thing is not to ‘ proclaim ’ internationalism , but to be able to be an internationalist in deed , even when times are most trying . ”
Concluding his thesis with a withering critique of those who resisted a definitive break with social democracy , summed up in the proposal that the Russian party rename itself as the Communist Party , Lenin concluded , “ It is time to cast off the soiled shirt and to put on clean linen . ” [ 8 ]
The Transitional Program
Such was the case with the founding of the Fourth International in September 1938 .
In evaluating the decision to hold this conference and reject the objections of all manner of centrists that the time was not ripe , the question should be posed :
What would have been the consequences for the revolutionary Marxist movement if the Fourth International had not been founded before the outbreak of World War II less than a year later and Trotsky ’s assassination barely one year after that ?
Obviously , the Trotskyist movement would have been deprived of the political and programmatic clarity that proved decisive in allowing it to survive the immense pressures and tragic losses of the war years , under conditions in which all of the centrist organizations that opposed the founding were wiped off the political map .
The founding conference approved a series of resolutions and adopted the Transitional Program , whose full title was “ The Death Agony of Capitalism and the Tasks of the Fourth International . ”
Taking as its starting point the objective crisis of world capitalism and the class struggle , this document drew upon the strategic experiences of the working class in order to advance a program of transitional demands aimed at uniting the masses in every country in the revolutionary struggle for power .
“ It is necessary to help the masses in the process of the daily struggle to find the bridge between present demands and the socialist program of the revolution , ” Trotsky wrote .
“ This bridge should include a system of transitional demands , stemming from today 's conditions and from today 's consciousness of wide layers of the working class and unalterably leading to one final conclusion : the conquest of power by the proletariat . ” [ 9 ]
There is perhaps no part of the political and theoretical heritage left by Trotsky that has been the object of more sustained and diverse attacks and revisions on the part of the centrists than the conception of transitional demands .
While Trotsky viewed this system of demands as an instrument for overcoming the contradiction between the advanced state of the objective crisis of capitalism and the immaturity and confusion prevailing within the consciousness of the working class , these latter - day centrists and revisionists have invariably sought to transform it into a means of adapting to spontaneous consciousness , and thereby subordinating the working class to the existing bureaucracies .
As we explained in our 1988 perspectives resolution : “ Not least among the betrayals of the Pabloites has been their persistent effort to transform the Transitional Program into a recipe book for opportunist adaptation and centrist evasion ; that is , by tearing isolated demands out of their genuine revolutionary context and suggesting that they be presented to the working class as a substitute for a genuinely revolutionary program .
According to the proponents of this revisionist method , transitional demands are a means of adapting to , rather than combating , the backward consciousness of the masses .
In essence , the proponents of this position deny the necessity of any open struggle for socialist consciousness in the working class .
It is not necessary , they claim , to patiently nourish the workers movement with the rich fruit of Marxist culture .
Rather , it is enough to dish out a few simple demands which will supposedly entice the masses and lead them to socialist revolution without even being conscious of their ultimate destination . ” [ 10 ]
From a bridge between the objective crisis and the undeveloped political consciousness of the masses , various revisionist movements have sought to transform the Transitional Program into a bridge between themselves and all manner of petty - bourgeois and bourgeois nationalist movements .
Notorious in this regard was the American Socialist Workers Party .
Its degeneration three decades after it had played the principal role together with Trotsky in formulating and fighting for this program for proletarian revolution was seen in its efforts to craft new “ transitional ” programs and demands for the black nationalist , student power and feminist movements that were thrown up by the middle - class radicalization of the 1960s .
Elements of the program that were addressed to the working class upsurge of the 1930s — the sliding scale of wages and hours , in particular — became a bridge to the anti-communist trade union bureaucracy of the AFL - CIO .
In an article drafted in 1971 , the late George Novack described the program as a “ tool kit ” in which one could rummage around for the right implement to suit any given occasion .
He noted proudly that the sliding scale of wages had broken out of its “ propaganda form ” when the United Auto Workers won an escalator clause in its contract with General Motors . [ 11 ]
A particularly grotesque form of this tendency can be found in the positions put forward by Alex Callinicos of the British Socialist Workers Party .
This self - styled Marxist intellectual advanced a supposedly modernized “ Transitional Program ” in his book , An Anti-Capitalist Manifesto .
Of course , this modernization consisted of turning the program inside out .
The document drafted by Trotsky and the nascent Fourth International began from the insoluble world crisis of capitalism and the overcoming of the obstacle posed by opportunist leaderships seeking to subordinate the working class to the bourgeoisie .
Callinicos , on the contrary , begins from the standpoint of ameliorating the conditions created by capitalism and providing “ left ” advice to the modern - day versions of the tendencies upon which Trotsky had declared unending war .
Thus , his “ Transitional Program ” is advanced not as the weapon of a revolutionary party seeking to resolve the crisis of revolutionary leadership and bridge the gap between the advanced state of the objective crisis and the relative immaturity of the consciousness of the working class .
Rather , it is put forward as a set of suggestions for “ diverse anti-capitalist tendencies , ” by which he means primarily the reformists , centrists and professional non-governmentalists who inhabit the World Social Forum .
He readily acknowledges that his laundry list of demands represents “ responses to contemporary realities , and have all been raised by existing movements . ”
This reformist hodge - podge includes such demands as the introduction of the Tobin tax , the premier goal of the ATTAC movement , which proposes the implementation of a small tax on international currency transactions in order to discourage speculation .
The anti-globalization advocates of this measure claim that its proceeds could be used to ameliorate global poverty while strengthening national economies .
Its principal aim , however , is to stabilize world capitalism by warding off crises caused by speculative attacks on national currencies .
For that reason , governments , not only in Latin America , but in such “ respectable ” countries as Canada and Belgium , have had no difficulty embracing it . [ 12 ]
Other organizations claiming to be Trotskyist , of a seemingly more orthodox cast , have developed the retrograde position that the transitional demands , particularly the sliding scale of wages and hours , can somehow magically and automatically lead the working class to carry out a socialist revolution without it ever being conscious that they are doing so .
Generally , emphasis is placed on these demands , which are compatible with an adaptation to the existing trade union consciousness of the working class , while the key demand advanced in the Transitional Program , the political independence of the working class and the struggle for a workers ’— or , as it was formulated in the 1938 program , a workers ’ and farmers ’— government , is relegated to the sidelines .
This is generally combined with the contention that somehow the 1938 document not only represents the program of the Fourth International — essentially subsuming all other fundamental programmatic documents from Permanent Revolution to Revolution Betrayed — but is also essentially the last word on the subject , unchanged by the subsequent seven decades of historical development and all of the rich and consciously assimilated experiences through which the Fourth International has passed .
Such schemes are entirely opposed to the perspective elaborated by Trotsky and go to the heart of the centrist attack on Marxism .
For Trotsky , the most important question was that of class - conscious revolutionary activity in history — that is , the role of the revolutionary leadership .
He fought intransigently against all those who sought to present the historical process and revolution itself as something that developed independent of human consciousness , some kind of mechanically predetermined result of objective conditions .
The role of Pabloism
A comprehensive review of the role played by centrism in the period following the Second World War and in the present situation would require far more time than is allotted for this lecture .
Suffice it to say that throughout this period , centrist movements , to a large degree the product of the Pabloite revisionist attack on the Fourth International , have played critical roles in organizing defeats and betrayals of revolutionary struggles .
The Pabloite organizations fully repudiated the essential conceptions advanced by Trotsky in the concluding section of the Transitional Program .
Outside of the cadres of the Fourth International , Trotsky wrote “ there does not exist a single revolutionary current on this planet really meriting the name .
If our international be still weak in numbers , it is strong in doctrine , program , tradition , in the incomparable tempering of its cadres .
Who does not perceive this today , let him in the meantime stand aside .
Tomorrow it will become more evident ....
“ The present crisis in human culture is the crisis in the proletarian leadership .
The advanced workers , united in the Fourth International , show their class the way out of the crisis .
They offer a program based on international experience in the struggle of the proletariat and of all the oppressed of the world for liberation .
They offer a spotless banner . ” [ 13 ]
As Trotsky affirmed in 1938 that , outside of the Fourth International , there existed not a single revolutionary tendency on the face of the earth , so today we can state clearly that outside of the cadres assembled under the banner of the International Committee there exists no tendency that has defended and upheld this conception of the decisive role of a conscious revolutionary leadership organized in a world party .
All the revisionist and centrist organizations that claim or once claimed to be Trotskyist have long ago renounced this heritage , either explicitly or in practice , adapting themselves to reformist , Stalinist or bourgeois nationalist leaderships and seeing their role — at best — as groups exerting left pressure on these organizations .
In this sense , one can say that while many of these tendencies exhibit the same traits described by Trotsky 70 years ago , there has been a serious degeneration of centrism , which , in the form of Pabloite revisionism , is based on the explicit and longstanding renunciation of revolutionary Marxism .
Thus , when one looks today at the LCR ( Ligue CommunisteRévolutionnaire ) , the Lutte Ouvriere or the Lambert group in France , one sees organizations that are far to the right of Pivert ’s PSOP of the 1930s and which have far less to do with the working class .
One of the latest and most revealing examples of this tendency has come in the form of an utterly degraded public discussion that the Pabloite international grouping — which , it should be noted , now refers to itself as the IC , in an attempt to obscure and deny the historical struggle of Trotskyism against revisionism — and its erstwhile Brazilian section , the Democracia Socialista .
The Brazilian group has maintained itself as a prominent tendency in the ruling Workers Party , even as many other leftists — including some of its own prominent members — have been expelled for daring to question the right - wing IMF - inspired policies of the Lula government .
Indeed , its members have taken prominent posts within the government — most notably Miguel Rosseto , who became minister of agrarian reform , where his defense of the capitalist program of the Lula government and his attacks on land occupations resulted in landless peasants burning him in effigy .
Another leading member took the post of general secretary of the PT , even as this ruling party sunk into ever more filthy corruption scandals .
For over four years , the Pabloite international gave this operation its political sanction , declaring that while it had concerns about the “ controversial ” policy of a supposedly revolutionary party entering a bourgeois government , it did n’t want to pose this question in “ dogmatic terms , ” and instead wanted to accompany the Brazilian group in this experience .
As compensation for this servile opportunism , Democracia Socialista has broken with the Pabloites in all but name only , issuing a public statement at the end of 2005 accusing them of practicing “ bad internationalism , infested with the vices of the 20th century . ”
Now , as you all are no doubt aware , we have entered the 21st century and all those 20th century vices — the struggle for program and principles , assimilating and taking seriously the historical lessons of the struggles of the international working class ( none of which , it should be pointed out , are indulged in by the Pabloites ) — are to be jettisoned .
It is no accident that Hugo Chavez has proclaimed his aim to be that of “ 21st Century Socialism , ” and that this slogan has been embraced by all manner of revisionists and centrists .
The Democracia Socialista document claims that the Brazilian group had affiliated with the Pabloites on the basis of their 1979 congress document .
In this document , the Brazilian revisionists asserted , “ The FI ceased to consider itself the world party of socialist revolution or to try to have an international leadership that centralized its national sections . ”
Democracia Socialista cites the document ’s insistence that “ it was no longer possible to work with the idea that a mass revolutionary party would form ‘ around ’ or ‘ under the leadership ’ of the FI , but that the FI would be one of its components , with the perspective of a shared vanguard .... ”
This “ shared vanguard ” was supposedly to include such movements as the Nicaraguan Sandinistas and the Salvadoran Farabundo Marti front , groups that have long since transformed themselves into thoroughly bourgeois parties . [ 14 ]
The Pabloite leadership has now at last responded to this challenge , publishing its own statements last May .
It explained its delay by referring to the 2006 national election in Brazil , declaring that it “ did not constitute a favorable moment for a relaxed discussion on internationalism ... since other more important tasks took up our forces . ”
These “ more important tasks , ” it should be pointed out , consisted of the electoral work of two rival factions of the DS , one of which campaigned for the reelection of Lula , the other supporting a challenge by their expelled member and legislator , Heloisa Helena , who joined in forming the PSOL on the dubious program of upholding the original values of Lula ’s PT .
During this campaign , the Pabloite international limited itself to urging dialogue between the rival election campaign teams .
The Pabloite response is revealing .
It begins by affirming that “ most of what is written in the DS document are reflections that would be shared by most of the militants of the Fourth International in their respective countries . ”
It raises concerns only about which bourgeois governments in Latin America should be adapted to and promoted — Chavez in Venezuela and Morales in Bolivia are fine , but there are reservations about Lula in Brazil and Kirchner in Argentina or Tabaré Vásquez in Uruguay .
The dividing line is drawn not according to the class nature of these governments — they are all bourgeois — or their attitude towards the working class movement , but rather largely over their respective positions on free trade agreements .
This criterion speaks volumes about the class nature and orientation of modern - day Pabloism .
The Pabloite international leadership goes on to defend itself against the accusations of the DS by citing the liquidation of its forces in Italy into Communist Refoundation , its Colombian group into a bourgeois electoral front , and so on .
Finally comes the plaintive appeal : “ It is necessary to know that the very existence of the Fourth International ... has not now become , for the [ Brazilian ] comrades , another one of the ‘ errors of the past . ’ ” [ 15 ]
Well , of course , it has , and this is merely the logical conclusion of the entire Pabloite perspective .
If Democracia Socialista ’s erstwhile international co-thinkers still misappropriate the name Fourth International , and even that of the International Committee , it is only in an attempt to better serve their essential function as a secondary prop of capitalist rule and a barrier to the penetration of Marxism into the working class .
Marxism is materialist .
It accepts these objective conditions — the conflict between the productive forces and social relations , between the nation - state system and global economy — as primary .
But this has nothing to do with fatalism .
It recognizes the constant dialectical interaction between the objective and the subjective in the development of the class struggle .
Above all , it recognizes that the explosion of class struggle generated by these objective conflicts can be transformed into the socialist revolution only by means of a conscious intervention by a revolutionary party based on a socialist and internationalist perspective .
There is no linear relationship between the development of the objective crisis and the emergence of this conscious revolutionary leadership capable of organizing the struggle for power .
On the contrary , the deepening of capitalist crisis is inevitably accompanied by the growing ideological pressure of the bourgeoisie on the workers ’ movement , which gives rise to centrist tendencies that seek to isolate revolutionary socialism from the working class .
The revolutionary party must be prepared in advance and must seek to educate the most advanced sections of workers and youth , while winning authority within the working class as a whole .
That was the task set by the founding of the Fourth International and prosecuted in the struggle against centrism .
And that is the task that the International Committee of the Fourth International and its sections carry forward today .

- Theodore Roosevelt
Are you a digital neophyte , too scared to turn off the Auto mode on your fancy new digital camera ?
Think of me as your online support group .
I want you to start exploring what your camera can really do .
And for success , what you know is a whole lot more important than which specific camera you 're gripping .
Let 's start by thinking about digital SLRs ( D - SLRs ) , an increasingly popular type of digital camera .
These tips originally appeared on Gearlog.com .
Check out Control Your D - SLR for more .
Lenses
If you 've had your D - SLR for any length of time , you 've probably pondered buying a new lens and been floored by the choices available .
A friend of mine who worked his way through college selling men's suits says he used to bring the suits out one at a time because with too many choices people would buy nothing at all .
It 's that way with lenses .
It would be easier if there were fewer to choose from .
So , what 's it going to be ?
I 'm not going to steer you toward a specific brand or size , but I do have some advice to help you narrow your choices .
Let 's start with prime lenses versus zoom lenses .
A prime lens has a single focal length ; a 50 mm lens is a prime lens , for example , while a 17 - to - 55 mm lens is a zoom lens .
Why would anyone ever buy a prime 50 mm when that 17 - to - 55 mm or 18 - to - 125 mm zoom covers its function and a lot more ?
It 's simple .
Prime lenses are less complex , make fewer compromises , and are more often than not faster and sharper .
Faster means that the lens aperture can open wider ( indicated by a lower - numbered f - stop I 'll get to that in a bit ) , allowing more light to hit the sensor .
Simply put , fast lenses are better when the light is low or the action is fast .
Faster lenses also have a shallower depth of field , as it's called , meaning that the portion of your shot that appears sharp in the image will be smaller .
If you 're new at this , that might sound bad .
Trust me here , shallow depth of field is mostly considered a good thing it draws attention to what you want the viewer to see .
You 'll also appreciate that prime lenses weigh lessespecially if you 'll be carrying one all day .
Zoom lenses are more versatile .
A lens that can cover 18 - to - 125 mm scratches a lot of itches .
In most cases , the greater the range between longest and shortest focal length , the slower the lens ( and the higher the lowest usable f - stop ) will be .
You 're almost always giving up lens speed with a zoom .
You need a long lens ( telephoto ) to shoot photos of birds or sports events under varying light conditions .
In short , lens speed is often the difference between a good or great shot and no shot at all .
Then again , in some brightly lit situations you might not care .
Bright sunlight was the only way I could get this football photo with my cheap and slow zoom .
All the professional photographers at that UConn / Army game were carrying much faster glass .
They do n't wait for perfect weather to shoot as I did .
I had a terrible case of lens envy .
Size matters .
Nowadays many lenses and some camera bodies come with built - in optical stabilization , which buys back some of what a slow lens costs you .
Stabilization keeps unsteady hands from ruining shots , but it wo n't stop the action you 're shooting !
It would n't have saved my football shot on an overcast day .
When a slow lens forces a slow shutter speed , the action will be blurry period .
Your decision about which type of lens to get depends on your needs .
The good news is when you figure out what you need , there is undoubtedly already a lens that can do it .
Three Fundamentals
I suspect most people are frozen with the photographic equivalent of training wheels because they do n't know what a few camera adjustments can yield .
Let me help .
There are really only three adjustments to think about ( I 'm assuming your shots are already in focus and you do n't want to change that ) : shutter speed , aperture , and ISO .
Each of them acts to control the light or the effect of the light that reaches your camera 's sensor .
Shutter Speed
Shutter speed refers to how long your camera 's sensor is exposed to light .
When your camera 's shutter speed reads " 100 , " the shutter is open for 1/100th of a second .
At " 50 , " it 's open twice as long , 1/50th second .
With shutter speed , lower is slower .
When your shutter is slower , or open longer , more light will reach the sensor .
Slow the shutter speed and your shots will be brighter .
Of course there 's also a downside .
If you 're shooting in Auto mode , you 've probably already seen this and cursed at your camera :
Say you 're indoors , somewhere without a lot of light .
Your camera wants you to see the shot , so it slows the shutter to brighten things up and your shot gets blurry .
Most blurry shots are n't out of focus ; they 're the product of a slow shutter speed showing motion like small lens movements as you hold the camera .
A very fast shutter speed captures a very brief moment :
It can stop motion .
A slower shutter speed allows that motion to be seen .
Faster shutter speeds almost always bring sharper pictures .
Unfortunately your camera 's shutter can be set so fast that there wo n't be enough light to take the shot .
Getting confused ?
Stick with me .
I know I 've put you between a rock and a hard place .
Too fast , dark .
Too slow , blurry .
Luckily there 's a simple rule of thumb .
Under most circumstances you can slow the shutter to 1 / lens focal length .
So , if you have a 300 mm lens , that means you must shoot at least 1/300th of a second .
For a 50 mm lens it's at least 1/50th .
If your camera has a multiplier for focal length ( most D - SLRs do ) , you need to factor that in , too .
My camera has a 1.6 multiplier ( you 'll find yours in your camera manual ) ; 300 mm times 1.6 means I need approximately 1/500th second .
Take your camera and put it in shutter priority mode ( so you can adjust the shutter speed while the camera controls everything else ) , point at anything and take a bunch of shots while adjusting the shutter speed .
Do n't look for artistry , just look to see how you 've changed the shot .
I promise , once it sinks in , you 'll be doing shutter speed by instinct .
Aperture
The aperture controls the volume of light that hits your D - SLR 's sensor by reducing the area through which light flows .
It works a lot like your eye 's pupil .
Unfortunately some mathematical show - off decided to measure it with f-stops .
The f - stop may be the most confusing concept in photography .
It 's a real number , and it does make sense mathematically , but it could have been presented in a way that was clearer and easier to understand .
Sit down for this .
F/2.8 is the f - stop between f/2 and f / 4 .
It gets worse : f/11 is the midpoint between f/8 and f/16 .
Here 's a progression of f- stops available on most lenses : 2.8 , 4 , 5.6 , 8 , 11 , 16 .
Every time you move up by an f - stop , you halve the light going to the lens .
The lower the lowest f- stop your lens can use , the " faster " your camera is .
Photographers are constantly lusting after faster lenses .
The 30 mm f/1.4 lens is my absolute favorite .
Luckily , you can be a great photographer without remembering exactly which f - stop fits where .
But you do need to remember that each lens has a limit over how wide or narrow the aperture can be set .
The higher the number , the less light you 'll get .
Lenses vary .
Fast lenses are always more expensive , and are usually worth it !
In most cases those guys on the sidelines at the football game are using lenses that can operate nicely on 25 percent of the light the lens that came with your camera needs .
If all the aperture did was control the light to the sensor , it would be a big deal .
But the aperture does something more and once you understand it your photos will be changed forever .
The higher the f-stop , the larger the in - focus area of your shot .
If you need a large area in focus , choose a higher f- stop number .
For shallower depth of field , choose a lower f-stop .
Large apertures ( represented as lower - numbered f- stops ) are often used for portrait work , leaving the subject sharp and the background pleasingly blurry .
These two photos were taken at f /1.4 and f/16 , respectively .
But try the experiment yourself :
Put your camera in its aperture priority mode ( it 's Av on my Canon ) and shoot the same object with different apertures .
In aperture priority the camera will attempt to compensate by automatically adjusting shutter speed to match your chosen aperture .
ISO
Setting your camera correctly for a shot begins with making sure sufficient light passes through the lens to the sensor .
Within reason , you can control how much or how little light gets there with your aperture and shutter controls .
Those are physical controls :
The aperture is the opening through which light passes into the camera , and the shutter speed controls how long light can pass .
ISO is a little more ethereal , because it 's a totally electronic parameter .
When I was a kid , film sensitivity ( more commonly called film speed ) was measured by an ASA number .
When the International Organization for Standardization got involved , the name was changed .
Name aside , the scale itself remained the same .
I mention this in case you find an ancient but working light meter .
ASA equals ISO .
Have no fear , the meter is still good .
Of course , increasing the ISO does n't come free there 's always a price to pay .
With ISO on a D - SLR , the price is noise , or distortion .
Turning up the ISO brightens your photo and amplifies noise from your camera 's sensor .
This noise fades into the background when amplification is n't necessary .
My opinion is that if higher ISO buys you a faster shutter speed or the narrower aperture you 're looking for , the extra noise is worth it .
I 'm not shy about shooting at ISO 1600 .
Sharpness is more important than noise , and I 'm willing to make that trade .
I understand my shot will be different in a way that 's not always good .
Price does matter here .
Cameras with larger sensors usually have lower noise figures .
To know how ISO will affect shots with your camera , shoot the same object under the same light so you can compare .
I 've done this with the water bottle sitting on my desk under a halogen light , and uncorrected in any way .
( This is not artistry . )
The first was shot at ISO 200 , the second at ISO 1600 .
Because these pictures are full size , they 're the proverbial worst - case scenario .
Seen on a screen or printed in a smaller size , the noise will be less noticeable .
Quality Control
Now that you 've got the fundamentals downor at least on their way there are a few more basic issues to consider .
For starters , if you 're using the default file format to save your photos , you 're starting off with less photo than your camera took in .
Then we need to have a little talk about your camera 's cruddy built - in flash .
Finally , you 'll fix many an Auto mode problem by learning about white balance .
Raw
By default most cameras save photos as JPEG files , because RAW - format files are n't always handled natively by PCs .
Imagine shooting photos and not being able to view them !
I 'm here to convince you that RAW is the way to go .
Let me make my case .
When a PC used to come with kilobytes of RAM , megabytes of hard drive storage , and a CPU clocked in the dozens of megahertz , large files were daunting .
Today ?
Not so much .
Still , saving JPEG files can typically cut an image file 's size by 90 percent not an insignificant number .
That 's because JPEG is a lossy compression method .
A JPEG image is different from the original .
You might not see that difference in a 4 - by - 6 - inch snapshot , but you will if you enlarge your photo or splash it across a widescreen monitor .
( Attention , purists : I 'm about to simplify .
Give me a little slack . )
At its core , a JPEG file takes advantage of your eye 's reliance on brightness , sacrificing color detail you should n't notice .
It also cheats in areas of sharp contrast , corners , and straight edges .
The bottom line is that it does what it 's supposed to do : save space .
It just does it at a cost .
A RAW file contains the image that goes into the JPEG before processing .
Lines are clean .
Contrast is maintained .
It 's as close to what the sensor saw as possible .
It is virtually lossless .
That sounds too good to be true and it is .
RAW 's simplicity makes it more complex for you .
Every manufacturer has its own idea of what a RAW file should look like .
Wikipedia notes that " several major camera manufacturers , including Nikon , Canon and Sony , encrypt portions of the file in an attempt to prevent third - party tools from accessing them . "
To play with RAW files you might be forced to install a codec that lets your software make sense of the RAW files if your software can deal with RAW files at all !
So why would I recommend it ?
Easy : RAW gives you more creative latitude .
Because you can adjust color temperature , tweak levels , and crop before doing anything else , your adjustments will produce a cleaner output that 's truer to your original .
Photographers can even compensate for shooting conditions by manipulating a RAW file , with little bad effect .
If you need to " push " an exposure , doing it with the RAW file will leave you happiest .
Yes , you will have massively larger files that will tax your computer 's CPU , strain your camera 's ability to write data to your memory card , and fill your hard drive .
Yes , you will have to check carefully whether your photo manipulation programs will handle it .
But as you learn to love your photos more , you 'll want only the best for them and you .
And RAW is best when quality counts .
Built - In Flash
Is the built - in flash on your D - SLR ( or any camera , really ) awful ?
If you do n't think so , I have two words for you : red - eye !
It 's the bane of amateur photographers worldwide .
The pros do n't have the problem , because they move the flash away from the lens so that a bolt of light does n't illuminate the very red back of your eyeball .
But red - eye is only one of the many bad features built into every on - camera flash .
The light from on - camera flash units falls off very quickly .
So if your subjects are far from a wall , the photo 's background is poorly lit and looks awful .
If they 're close to the wall , the single source of light produces harsh shadows and looks awful .
Awful is built in with an on -camera flash !
If you 're shooting in Auto , there is one situation where you should be using the on - camera flash and of course , it 's where you 're not using it .
A camera 's flash can be a life - saver outside in bright sunlight .
That 's my dad in the photo above .
Without the daytime flash , he'd be a mere silhouette against the brightly lit Connecticut River .
If you 're within a few feet of your subject , pop the flash .
It will help fill in harsh shadows in other words , it will undo what it normally does .
In my case , the camera did n't want to fire the flash .
All its sensors said there was plenty of light .
There was just not where I wanted it .
Auto modes are dumb in this way , so I overrode my camera 's suggestion and said " flash away , " even though it was a bright and sunny day .
A little improvisation can buy you better photos .
On nearly every camera I 've seen ( from D - SLR to point - and - shooter ) , the flash can be discretely told to fire or not , regardless of whether it 's needed .
Look for a lightning - bolt icon and work your way from there .
White Balance
One typical problem with Auto mode is bad white balance also referred to as color cast in which your shot looks reasonable , but the colors are n't what you remember .
Maybe you 've seen an indoor shot with a reddish tint ; that 's a common example of bad white balance .
The camera has improperly guessed at the color temperature of your shot 's light source .
Color temperature there 's something you 've probably never thought about before .
Who knew color could be measured that way ?
It 's tough to explain the concept without getting into the physics and I wo n't .
You 're welcome .
Simply put , different light sources have different color temperatures , measured in degrees Kelvin .
To our eyes , higher color temperatures look cooler , and lower color temperatures look warmer .
This is all good to know should you ever make it to Final Jeopardy , but unimportant to us right now .
Just remember that color temperatures vary with the light source .
Back in the 35 mm days , you could buy film suited to particular light daylight film , say , or tungsten film .
Your digital camera is more adaptable .
It looks at your shot and guesses the color temperature based on some common assumptions that are usually ( but not always ) right .
Here 's a shot of an AA battery atop a piece of paper on my desk , lit with a halogen bulb .
The paper is white in real life .
In this shot , the paper looks dingy and reddish , like the " before " picture in a Tide commercial .
That 's easily fixed !
Most photo - editing programs , even the simple and free ones , have a control to correct improper color balance .
In , you click a black , white , or gray eyedropper on a corresponding black , white , or gray area to fix things .
In , you click the Neutral Color Picker and then a neutral spot in your photo .
Here 's the result :
I 've taken advantage of the fact that black , white , and gray have equal amounts of the three primary colors : red , green , and blue .
These white - balance fixer controls just equalize those numbers at the point you 've clicked and let everything else fall into place proportionally .
This is n't a perfect fix , because color temperature can vary even within a single shot , but it 's a darn good start .
Play with Your Shots
Most of us remember when it was verboten to waste film and processing costs !by playing around with panoramic shots , long - exposure experiments , and the like .
Now that we have reusable memory cards and , at the very least , the ability to get our photos off the card and into printable form , there 's simply no reason not to try .
Panoramas
Want to impress your friends and family ?
Try shooting panoramas composites from multiple photos showing a wider field of view than a normal lens would provide .
Because you 're using multiple shots , they often have astounding detail .
A panoramic shot of 100 megapixels or more is n't that hard to achieve , and you ( yeah , you ) can do it with virtually any camera and free software .
Panoramas are much easier if you 're not shooting in Auto .
Admittedly the purpose of this story is to get you to explore the other modes in your camera , but not using Auto is a necessity in this case .
You want your snaps to match shot to shot in depth of field and exposure , and Auto wo n't let you do that .
You need to be in Manual or an aperture - priority mode , where your f- stop setting wo n't change between clicks .
Decide what you 're going to capture , brace your elbows , and then methodically snap away , overlapping your shots by 20 to 30 percent .
If you 're wondering whether you 've overlapped enough , overlap more !
There 's no such thing as too much overlap , but you 're sunk if there 's too little .
Do n't be scared to shoot multiple levels so that you capture all the action up and down as well as left and right .
Because panoramas are usually wider than tall , maximize the height of your composition by holding the camera vertically .
This is n't critical , just helpful .
Once you 've got your shots , software like Hugin , Microsoft 's Image Composite Editor ( ICE ) , or Autostitch will do the rest !
Photographers have always taken wide panoramas , but it 's so much easier now .
This is a great place to let your creativity run wild .
Try it next time you 've got your camera out .
Long -Exposure Photography
With a little creativity you can use your D - SLR to capture or create something impossible to catch in a short exposure or in Auto mode such as the movement of stars across the night skyby using a long - duration exposure .
A wide - angle lens and small aperture gives you a huge depth of field , which makes focusing ( often difficult in the dark ) a lot less critical .
The picture above was shot with an 8 - second exposure at ISO 200 , using a 70 mm lens at f /22 .
To take long - duration exposures , you 're going to need a steady brace such as a tripod .
Setting your camera on a steady surface works just as well .
One of my favorite nighttime shots used a trash can instead of a tripod with my wallet under the lens to tilt it up a little !
You 'll also need a device to hold your shutter open .
Most D - SLRs allow for long exposures timed by the camera , but only up to a point .
Longer exposures may require a shutter release cable designed for your camera .
Because long exposures often have such immense dynamic range and provide many unreal views , there 's no one correct exposure .
It 's only your interpretation of the scene that counts .
Experimentation is cheap and easy when all you 're doing is filling a memory card .
By now there are few people who do not acknowledge that the major American financial institutions and the markets they dominate turn out to have served the country badly in recent years .
The surface evidence of this failure is the enormous losses — more than $ 4 trillion on the latest estimate from the International Monetary Fund — that banks and other lenders have suffered on their mortgage - related investments , together with the consequent need for the taxpayers to put up still larger sums in direct subsidies and guarantees to keep these firms from failing .
With nearly 9 percent of the labor force now unemployed and still more joining their ranks , industrial production off by 13 percent compared to a year ago , and most companies ’ profits either falling rapidly or morphing into losses , it is also evident that the financial failure has imposed huge economic costs .
The government has moved aggressively , and on several fronts , to stanch the immediate damage .
The Federal Reserve has not only eased monetary policy to the point of near - zero short - term interest rates but created a profusion of new programs to extend credit to banks as well as other lenders .
Congress , at the Obama administration ’s behest , has enacted nearly $ 800 billion of new spending and tax cuts aimed at stimulating business and consumer spending .
First the Bush administration and now Mr. Obama ’s have experimented with one new plan after another to rescue lenders and reliquify collapsed credit markets .
But despite the universal agreement that no one wants any more such failures once this one has passed , there is a troubling lack of attention to reforms that might prevent such a crisis from recurring .
By now everyone realizes that excessive risk - taking , systematic mispricing of assets , and , often , plain reckless behavior ( not to mention some instances of criminality , although to date surprisingly few of these have come to light ) helped cause the current mess .
At the same time , most people recognize both that parts of the American economy have been capable of dynamic growth and that the US financial markets have had a part in promoting that growth .
The result is a reluctance to consider changes to the current system .
Substantial interference with financial markets , it is said , amounts in the end to centrally planned allocation of an economy ’s investment process , and will result in technological stagnation and wasted resources .
Milder attempts at regulation will either prove ineffective — the private sector can afford better lawyers than the government can — or at best merely lead financial institutions to relocate to more lightly regulated jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands .
As in past financial declines , what is sorely missing in this discussion is attention to what function the financial system is supposed to perform in the economy and how well it has been doing it .
Today attention is mostly focused on banks ’ and other investors ’ losses from buying mortgage - backed securities at inflated prices .

ME : Hello , is that God ?
GOD : Yup .
You called , I answered .
ME : My neighbor ’s dog keeps pooping on my front lawn when I ’m not looking .
My neighbor refuses to remove the poop saying it was n’t his dog .
Could you make the dog die from natural causes , say from a heart attack ?
GOD : Nope .
ME : Whaddya mean , “ Nope ” ??
What ’s the problem ?
Scared of the dog ?
GOD : It ’s like this … next week I ’ve got a burglar scheduled to burgle your house at 11 PM .
The burglar ’s going to steal your stereo , and on the way out he ’s going to sneak through that neighbor ’s garden .
As he does so , said dog is going to give him chase , causing him to drop the stereo on your neighbor ’s lawn and run .
ME : So now I ’ve got poop on my lawn and my stereo on my neighbor ’s lawn , I love it .
GOD : Wait .
Your neighbor will like to stop intruders running across his lawn in the middle of the night , so he ’ll fence his property ( that ’ll also stop his dog from accessing your lawn ) and hand your stereo back to you .
The next morning you ’ll turn it on and find it does n’t work .
You ’ll take it to Charlie ’s Electronic Repair down at the corner of 5th and Main .
Charlie ’ll say it ’ll cost $ 17 to fix it .
You ’ll bargain him down to $ 15 and he ’ll tell you to pick it up the next day .
ME : Thanks a lot God , you just cost me $ 15 .
I appreciate it …
GOD : Hang with me here .
Charlie will need that $ 15 to buy his son Jake a new baseball shirt for the Little League game the next Wednesday .
I ’ve scheduled Jake to be the Yankees ’ star pitcher after 12 years , so I have to make sure he sails through the Little League .
I ’m responsible for Jake ’s welfare , you see …
ME : Glad you ’re looking out for him , God .
And thanks for neglecting me , you ’re terrific …
GOD : Hold it , buddy .
You ’re going to place a $ 500 bet on Jake after 12 years and it ’s going to win you $ 5,500 in cold cash .
ME : So everyone comes out winning in the end … except for one thing .
GOD : What ’s that ?
ME : I still have that last installment of poop on my lawn .
GOD : Inanimate as your lawn may be , I am nevertheless responsible for it .
That spot needs manure badly , so that the poop needs to be there .
ME : But that ’s unacceptable !
GOD : Thank you for your call , please do n’t hesitate to call again , I ’m available 24/7 .
A University of Chicago dean ordered a student to change the title of his Facebook.com photo album and remove pictures of his ex-girlfriend after she complained to the dean .
Dean of Students Susan
Art invoked the university ’s policy of “ dignity and respect ” and claimed the authority to police allegedly disrespectful off - campus speech , even when it appears on a personal Facebook page .
Indeed , the university violates its own promises of free speech by maintaining a policy subjecting disrespectful speech to disciplinary action and a “ bias incident ” policy that encourages members of the university to report on the so - called biases of their neighbors .
The University of Chicago has chilled speech across the campus and has refused to respond in any meaningful way to FIRE ’s letter in defense of freedom of speech .
On January 19 , 2009 , University of Chicago student Andrew Thompson posted a photograph “ album ” on his personal Facebook page .
The title of the album was “ [ Name of ex- girlfriend ] cheated on me , and you ’re next ! ”
Some of the photographs in the album were of Thompson ’s ex-girlfriend , and dozens of the photographs were not .
On January 19 and 20 , a number of people other than Thompson posted comments about the allegation of cheating .
One person wrote , “ Seriously though , what a f*** ing whore ” ( language redacted ) .
On January 20 at about 9:00 a.m. , Thompson ’s ex-girlfriend sent Susan Art , Dean of Students in the College , an e-mail claiming that the album ’s title and the third - party comments on the title constituted “ libel . ”
The woman stated that Thompson had refused to change the title of the album upon her request and asked Art “ if this could be removed quietly and quickly from the internet . ”
At 2:00 p.m. , Art e-mailed Thompson , revealing the entire content of the ex-girlfriend ’s e-mail , and demanded the censorship of Thompson ’s album :
[ Name of ex- girlfriend ] has brought to my attention that you have posted her name on [ F ] acebook and that this has drawn some critical comments from others .
I am writing to ask you to remove her name and remove the pictures you have posted of her .
We have an expectation that members of the University community treat each other “ with dignity and respect . ”
This kind of post is disrespectful .
I know you think it is a joke , but it is very upsetting to her .
Can you let me know when her name and her pictures are removed from your [ F ] acebook page ?
I expect this to happen right away .
Very shortly afterward , Thompson complied with Art ’s censorship demands , but he resisted the idea that a University of Chicago dean could censor his protected speech .
On January 21 , he asked her by e-mail , “ Can the university really regulate internet speech ?
I did not say anything subjective or false , so I do n’t see how I can be forced to do this … ”
In a very troubling response e-mailed to Thompson later that day , Art essentially declared that the university ’s Student Manual [ of ]
University Policies and Regulations permits censorship of “ disrespectful ” speech :
Every member of the University – student , faculty , and staff – makes a commitment to strive for personal and academic integrity ; to treat others with dignity and respect ; to honor the rights and property of others ; to take responsibility for individual and group behavior ; and to act as a responsible citizen in a free academic community and in the larger society .
Any student conduct , on or off campus , of individuals or groups , that threatens or violates this commitment may become a matter for action within the University ’s system of student discipline .
If the University of Chicago really intends to start policing the “ personal … integrity ” of students as interpreted by its deans , one might wonder how far the university is going to go .
How are students to know which aspects of “ personal … integrity ” might be adjudicated by the university ?
What about alleged sexual infidelity , which got this case started in the first place ?
This censorship is a shameful betrayal and repudiation of the University of Chicago ’s ( my alma mater ’s ) vaunted tradition of freedom of expression .
The university ’s renowned Kalven Report ( 1967 ; PDF ) has almost constitutional status at the university .
For the sake of protecting the freedom of conscience of all its members , the university refrains from taking positions on controversial issues :
A university faithful to its mission will provide enduring challenges to social values , policies , practices , and institutions .
By design and effect , it is the institution which creates discontent with the existing social arrangements and proposes new ones .
In brief , a good university , like Socrates , will be upsetting ….
[ Yet , ] [ t ] here is no mechanism by which [ the university ] can reach a collective position without inhibiting that full freedom of dissent on which it thrives … .
The neutrality of the university as an institution arises then … out of respect for free inquiry and the obligation to cherish a diversity of viewpoints .
And this neutrality as an institution has its complement in the fullest freedom for its faculty and students as individuals to participate in political action and social protest … .
[ T ] here emerges , as we see it , a heavy presumption against the university taking collective action or expressing opinions on the political and social issues of the day , or modifying its corporate activities to foster social or political values , however compelling and appealing they may be .
In addition , the university promises freedom of expression in its Student Manual : “ At the University of Chicago , freedom of expression is vital to our shared goal of the pursuit of knowledge .
Such freedom comes with a responsibility to welcome and promote this freedom for all , even in disagreement or opposition . ”
The Student Manual also states : “ The ideas of different members of the University community will frequently conflict and we do not attempt to shield people from ideas that they may find unwelcome , disagreeable , or even offensive .
Nor , as a general rule , does the University intervene to enforce social standards of civility . ”
( Emphasis added . )
It is impossible to see how the university ’s commitment to freedom of expression can coexist , without contradiction , with policies that restrict that freedom .
For example , the House System Rules and Regulations , as stated in the Student Manual , state that “ if a posting is deemed to be offensive to a particular group or individual , the posting may be removed . ”
Likewise , the Office of the Vice President for Campus Life and Dean of Students in the University ’s website unilaterally pronounces that “ The University of Chicago is committed to fostering an environment free from racism , sexism , ageism , heterosexism , homophobia , ableism , [ and ] xenophobia . ”
As noble as it may seem to institutionally oppose these aspects of discrimination , the university goes too far when it employs such policies to restrict and censor clearly protected speech on or off campus .
Even worse , as FIRE ’s Samantha Harris reported last week , the University of Chicago ’s office of Diversity , Civility , and Equity maintains a policy on responding to so - called “ bias incidents . ”
Such incidents are defined as follows :
Bias is a pre-formed negative opinion or attitude toward a group of persons who possess common characteristics , such as skin color , or cultural experiences , such as religion or national origin .
Bias incidents involve actions committed against a person or property that are motivated , in whole or in part , by the bias against race , religion , sexual orientation , ethnicity , national origin , ancestry , gender , gender identity , age , or disability .
A related page about reporting bias incidents provides specific examples of bias incidents , including “ Remarks perceived as derogatory , made about you by a classmate ” and “ a message on your whiteboard perceived as derogatory . ”
These examples clearly demonstrate that the university includes in its definition of “ bias incidents ” expression that would be fully protected at every community college and public university in the nation .
As Sam pointed out , unlike genuine harassment — which must be severe , pervasive , and objectively offensive — any expression “ perceived as derogatory ” and based on certain personal characteristics constitutes a “ bias incident ” at Chicago .
The university is developing a 1984 or Soviet Russia - style community in which members are encouraged to report one another ’s biases to the authorities .
FIRE wrote President Zimmer on February 23 of this year , requesting that all students be assured that their right to free speech and free inquiry remains entirely intact .
Unlike almost every university that FIRE writes , however , the University failed to respond .
Although FIRE did not threaten litigation , the letter was taken as such a threat , and the university ’s Office of Legal Counsel was given responsibility to respond .
But that office refused to respond to e-mails and phone calls .
Finally we contacted Associate News Director William Harms , who procured this exceedingly bland response on April 9 , continuing in the line of policing speech that would be protected anywhere in the public sphere and at most private colleges , too :
Freedom of expression is a core value of the University of Chicago .
In order to make the free exchange of ideas possible , students , faculty , and other members of our community must help create a safe , respectful climate in which inquiry and debate can flourish .
The University ’s policies and practices are designed to safeguard that culture of robust and respectful discussion , and the legitimate rights of all involved .
Then , on April 23 , the Office of Legal Counsel finally returned our call and stated that since it now realizes that we did not threaten litigation , the university does not want to engage in discussion with FIRE around this issue .
This only adds to the university ’s shame .
The better thing would have been to kick our letter back to President Zimmer so that , like almost every other school we contact about a case , the university might offer the minimum respect of a genuine response .
This is nothing at all like the University of Chicago I used to know .
HONG KONG  Leaders in both Washington and Beijing have been fretting openly about the mutual dependence  some would say codependence  created by China ’s vast holdings of United States bonds .
But beyond the talk , the relationship is already changing with surprising speed .
China is growing more picky about which American debt it is willing to finance , and is changing laws to make it easier for Chinese companies to invest abroad the billions of dollars they take in each year by exporting to America .
For its part , the United States is becoming relatively less dependent on Chinese financing .
China has actually bought Treasury bonds at an accelerating pace over the last year  notwithstanding Chinese officials ’ complaints about American profligacy .
But the borrowing needs of the United States government have grown even faster .
So China represents a rapidly shrinking share of overall purchases of Treasury securities .
“ China ’s demand for Treasuries has increased over the past year , but it has n’t increased at anything like the pace of the Treasury ’s sale of new Treasury bonds , ” said Brad W. Setser , a specialist in Chinese financial flows at the Council on Foreign Relations .
Americans and investors elsewhere are buying Treasuries instead .
They are saving more and have been shifting out of other investments  including equities until the past two months  and into Treasuries .
The two men also met briefly at the start of the Pope 's visit Israel 's right - wing new Prime Minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , says he has asked Pope Benedict to condemn Iranian threats to destroy his country .
He said he had asked the Pope in Nazareth to speak out against Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has called for Israel 's destruction .
Mr Netanyahu gave details of their conversation to Israeli TV .
He was also quoted by press as saying Israel did not want a Palestinian state which might jeopardise its security .
Pope Benedict has repeatedly called for a separate Palestinian state during his tour of the Holy Land , most vocally when he met Palestinian refugees on Wednesday in Bethlehem .
Mr Netanyahu has not committed himself to the principle of two states , which past Israeli leaders have accepted .
The Vatican spokesman , the Rev Federico Lombardi , said only that Thursday 's talks had " centred on how the peace process can be advanced " .
The Pope said the last and largest open - air Mass of his visit in Nazareth , recorded in the Bible as the childhood home of Jesus Christ .
He later said a more intimate Mass at the Church of the Annunciation .
' Make your voice loud ' " I asked him , as a moral figure , to make his voice heard loud and continuously against the declarations coming from Iran of their intention to destroy Israel , " Mr Netanyahu said on TV .

Pope brings Nazareth to a standstill
In pictures : Pope in Nazareth Guide : Jerusalem 's holy sites " I told him it cannot be that at the beginning of the 21st Century there is a state which says it is going to destroy the Jewish state , there is no aggressive voice being heard condemning this . "
Israel 's prime minister said he was pleased with the Pope 's response : " He said that he condemns all instances of anti-Semitism and hate against the state of Israel - against humanity as a whole , but in this case against Israel . "
Mr Netanyahu reportedly added that Israel wanted peace with the Palestinians but " only the kind of peace that brings security " .
" We do n't want to dominate another people , but we also do n't want a terror state backed by Iran to rise alongside us and jeopardize Israel 's safety , " he was quoted as saying by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz .
Mr Netanyahu 's election this year was ill - received in the Arab world because of his hard - line views , including his opposition to returning land captured in wars .
Mr Netanyahu is due in Washington on 18 May for what are being seen as crucial talks with President Barack Obama .
' Legitimate aspirations '
In Bethlehem on Wednesday , the Pope delivered what correspondents say was one of his strongest expressions of support for the Palestinians , offering his backing for Palestinians ' right to a " homeland " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He told Palestinian refugees his heart went out to families divided by detention and restrictions on freedom of movement , a reference to Israeli military control of the West Bank .
" It is understandable that you often feel frustrated , " the pontiff said .
" Your legitimate aspirations for permanent homes , for an independent Palestinian state , remain unfulfilled . "
In his homily at the open - air Mass , the Pope preached against prejudice and hatred " which kills men 's souls before it kills their bodies " .
At least 40,000 Christians , among them many Arabs , attended the service in the northern Israeli town .
Neither the oppressive morning heat nor heavy - handed security measures could stifle the enthusiasm of the faithful , the BBC's Katya Adler reports .
The Pope focussed on conservative family values , saying : " [ Through ] the example of Mary , Joseph and Jesus we come to appreciate even more fully the sacredness of the family which in God 's plan is based on the lifelong fidelity of a man and a woman . "
The traditional tone came in stark contrast to some of the Pope 's speeches this week where he openly mixed prayer with politics , our correspondent says .
His attempts to smooth his strained relations with the Muslim and the Jewish communities may not have been entirely successfully but it leaves behind an impression of a player on the world stage , she adds .

Helping you , the reported business or individual
My company has been reported !
How do I respond ?
If you are a business with one or more reports filed against you , you can make it right .
If handled correctly , Ripoff Report (s ) filed against you can actually help improve your credibility and reputation .
We offer you , for FREE , the opportunity to file a REBUTTAL to any report .
( See the “ REBUTTAL BOX ™ | Respond to this Report ! ” at the top of the specific Report you wish to comment on or the “ Respond to this report ! ” button at theend of the specific Report you wish to comment on ) .
Every company receives complaints , but how they handle those complaints separates good business from the rest ..
If you want to do more than file a rebuttal , you might consider using Ripoff Report ’s VIP Arbitration Program .
The arbitration program gives you the opportunity to prove , through a neutral third - party arbitrator , that the report about you is false .
Ripoff Report developed the program in response to phone calls and emails from businesses like you -- those who have worked hard to create a good reputation and are having that reputation unjustly tarnished because of a false posting on Ripoff Report .
Because Ripoff Report has never had the internal resources to investigate reports that a business claims is false , it has always permitted the subject of the report to file its own , free , Rebuttal .
But some of you feel that is not enough .
You have asked for more .
You want the ability to prove it is false .
You want an independent investigation .
Perhaps most importantly , you want the false statements of fact removed .
We listened to your concerns and launched VIP Arbitration in response .
Here ’s how it works .
We have contracted with private arbitrators who have extensive experience , including experience as judges in court .
You submit a written arbitration statement identifying the specific false statements in the Report , and / or explaining that the report was posted by a competitor pretending to be a customer .
You are also given the opportunity to support your position with documentary evidence and / or sworn declarations .
There is a filing fee of $ 2,000 to pay for the arbitrator ’s time and for administration of the program .
The author of the Report is then given the opportunity to respond and you are given the opportunity to reply .
The arbitrator then reviews all of the submissions and renders a written decision .
In the event that the arbitrator determines that the challenged statements of fact in the Report are true , there will be no updates or changes to the website .
If the Arbitrator finds that statements in the Report are false , the title of the Report will be updated , posting this phrase BEFORE the original title : " Notice of Arbitrator Decision : A neutral and independent arbitrator has determined that the following Report contained one or more false statements of fact .
The false statements have been redacted . "
A summary of the arbitrator ’s decision will be posted after the title and before the original content of the report .
Any statements of fact that the arbitrator determines to be false will be removed ( (( REDACTED ) ) ) from the original report .

As deaths spike , motorcycle training pushed for troops LOS ALAMITOS , Calif .  Pentagon brass got an eye - opener when they examined 2008 casualty figures : More Marines died stateside on motorcycles than were killed in Iraq or Afghanistan .
" That was a wake - up call , " says Rear Adm .
Arthur Johnson , commander of the Naval Safety Center .
" It focuses your attention on what your real issues are . "
The military has become alarmed by a sharp rise in off - duty motorcycle deaths over the past five years , including last year 's statistics , even as servicemember deaths in automobile accidents have declined .
Rather than try to curtail motorcycle riding , the military is pushing training courses on troops who ride .
The Pentagon directives require servicemembers who ride motorcycles to undergo training that goes far beyond the basics , including a course on advanced sportbike techniques adapted from racetrack riding .
The training includes psychological self - assessments aimed at identifying and stopping high - risk practices .
Master Sgt. Brad Warner , 47 , piloting his Harley - Davidson Electra Glide , a heavy touring bike , through the sportbike course , said the adrenaline that sustains soldiers through combat can get them into trouble when they climb on a motorcycle .
Warner returned from a tour in Iraq last year without a single death in his unit .
Within the first 90 days home , though , a soldier in his unit died shortly after buying his first motorcycle .
" Really , you need to come to something like this , " he said of the training .
At the Joint Forces Training Base here outside Los Angeles , soldiers began instruction last week in a classroom and on a course set up at one end of the air base 's busy flightline .
Officers whose day job is piloting Black Hawk helicopters were getting instruction on how to improve their cornering , braking and smoothness .
First Lt. Algernon Clay , 27 , a pilot and Suzuki GSX - R 600 rider , says some find the training humbling .
" It 's a huge problem that we have — that Superman complex , " Clay said .
" You know , ' I survived IEDs ( improvised explosive devices ) , bazookas , whatever . ' " Marines can't register their motorcycles on base and are subject to discipline if they ride without training .
So far , 700 of the estimated 18,000 motorcycle - riding Marines have taken the course , said Peter Hill , the Marine Corps ' senior safety engineer .
" We work very closely with the military in delivering the training program , " says Charlie Fernandez , operations director for the Motorcycle Safety Foundation , a group funded by the motorcycle industry that helped Army and Navy officials design the curriculum .
" It 's been very well received . "
The Army is now offering its version , Fernandez said .
Instructor Brett Sholtis , a civilian who spent six years as a soldier at this base , demonstrated racing techniques as he flogged his American - made Buell Thunderbolt motorcycle around cones .
Sholtis said the course is aimed at instilling the skills , control and self - discipline on which racers depend .
" This is a way to , hopefully , keep them alive , " Sholtis said .
" We try to be a countervailing influence . "
Johnson said troops without families to support typically return from combat with a wad of unspent money in their pockets and an eye on a fast motorcycle — and , for less than $ 10,000 , manufacturers offer sportbikes packed with racing technology easily capable of 150 mph or more .
In 2008 , 25 Marines died on motorcycles — more than the 22 killed in hostile action in Iraq and 21 who died in Afghanistan , according to the Pentagon .
It was a continuation of a trend that has seen a rise from 2004 , when seven Marines died on bikes .
The Army has seen increased deaths , too , from 22 in 2004 to 51 in 2008 .
Johnson said nearly 300 military men and women died on motorcycles from 2006 through 2008 , and an additional 75 or so had to quit the service because of motorcycle - related injuries .
The training may be starting to have an effect .
" We have n't seen many accidents among people who have taken " the course , Hill said .
Marine spokesman Lt. Josh Diddams said that in the seven months since Oct. 1 , eight Marines and six sailors have died on motorcycles .

â And the bad news is this hammer , â  I was telling the interns , when somebody suddenly kicked open the door to my office .
â WHERE IS HE?â 
The intruder screamed .
Normally , I would assume DOB was just making another dramatic entrance , but the distinct lack of puns about my name being yelled suggested otherwise .
â TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF !â 
I replied , noticing that my intruder was both female and shirt - clad .
Thanks , sponsors !

â I SAID WHERE IS HE ?!â 
She yelled again .
â I SAID TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF !â 
I replied once more , because I am not a quitter .
â Listen , Brockway .
Iâll give you one chance at this and one chance only :
You will tell me what you did with Ross Wolinsky , or I will be forced to take drastic action .â â TAKE YOUR SH - â  I began , but was interrupted by her interruption .

Tell me the goddamn truth !â 
She was waving a pistol around erratically , the insanity - sweat sexily beading on her crazy - brow .
Nothing like a hot , sweaty , yellow - pajama clad woman , right fellas ?
â You have a point , â  I said , slowly realizing that Wolinskyâs updates had indeed stopped the second I came on board , â maybe itâs a company policy ?

Now , lady , I didnât do anything to Ross , but whatever beef you think you have with me , donât drag the interns into this , okay ?
Just let them goâ¦â 
I said selflessly , knowing that tales of my heroic , self - sacrificing nature would significantly increase the moisture levels in the secretary pool â which is already pretty moist , considering that it 's literally a pool full of secretaries .
Four separate times over the space of eight densely typewritten pages , the letter from the Federal Communications Commission to me mentions the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 .
Allow me to fully explain the irony .
Six months ago I filed a complaint online with the FCC about mistreatment suffered by my family at the hands of a run-amok Verizon robo - call system .
Last week I received a response from the agency via snail - mail ... which given that a half year had elapsed since my complaint , could have been delivered by an actual snail .
Yet tardiness is n't the crux of this " your tax dollars at work " tale .
Background first via a post here Sept. 15 , 2008 :
Nine robo-calls in 24 hours , all from Verizon : Nothing could make them stop ; not my wife 's increasingly urgent pleas ( I was away ) ; not the hapless customer service reps who promised relief ; not the " in-charge supervisor " who was n't in charge ; and , not even the ever - so - helpful individual who said the barrage was " a national problem " before adding , " We 're suggesting that people just unplug their phones . "
Unplug our phones ?
How about you unplug your bloody robo - caller first ?
While we had previously encountered difficulties with Verizon -- examples here , here , and here -- this one was particularly egregious both because it was particularly egregious , and because it occurred while my wife was home and I was nestled in a quiet hotel room a full continent away .
As any business traveler knows , nothing conducts heat like a telephone line , so upon my arrival home I decided to do something that I cannot recall ever having done before : file a formal , written complaint .
The FCC has a handy - dandy Web form expressly for such venting .
I never expected anything to come of my complaint , of course .
Like most people , I just figured that it would be added to the pile -- presuming there was a pile -- and , if the pile got big enough and / or stinky enough , then perhaps I could allow myself to believe that my little poke back at the telecommunications behemoth would have somehow contributed to someone doing something or other of the constructive variety .
In other words , I was not standing astride the mailbox every afternoon for six months waiting for the postal carrier to bring word of an FCC reaction to my complaint .
Yet just the other day that reaction is exactly what arrived ... sort of .
The first paragraph of the missive reads :
This letter is in response to your complaint filed with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) .
We are reviewing your complaint and will contact you if any further information is needed .
Thank you for filing .
That 's it .
Oh , that was just the start of eight densely typewritten pages with the four separate mentions of the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1995 , but those three sentences represent the sum total of what one might call pertinent information contained in the correspondence ... and , of course , the first sentence tells me something that I already knew and the third sentence is a mere cordiality .
In other words , the FCC took eight densely typewritten pages to tell me it had received my complaint six months ago and would be in touch if there was any other way in which I could be of assistance to the government .
I 'll briefly summarize the rest of the letter , which , in an apparently genuine bow to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 , covered both sides of four sheets of paper :
On Page 2 they tell me my name , address , telephone number and e-mail .
Page 3 tells me where the FCC is located and brings us the first mention of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 .
Page 4 is so densely typewritten that only lawyers are allowed to read it .
Page 5 babbles a bit about privacy in addition to providing the second citation of the Paperwork Reduction Act of ... what year , people ?
Are you paying attention ?
Page 6 reminds me where I live and how I might get in touch with myself before providing a verbatim account of the complaint that I typed six months ago into the FCC 's handy - dandy Web form .
Page 7 makes sure I got that FCC address , all right , before reiterating the primacy of the You Know What Reduction Act of You Know When .
Page 8 features more of that for - lawyerly - eyes - only stuff before concluding with one last helping of The Paperwork Reduction and Irony Enablement Act of 1995 .
Trust me , I never would have filed the complaint -- never , never , never -- had I known that trees would die so needlessly .
One last point :
The return address on the letter reveals that it was sent not from Washington , D.C. , but rather from an FCC facility in Gettysburg , Pa. ... Abraham Lincoln , whose historic address there required fewer than 300 words , would be mortified .

The infamous lists of " Things I 'll do if I ever become an Evil Overlord " .
Read them , and you 'll be Genre Savvy , able to avoid dooms of many villains .
Fail to read them , and your Genre Blindness will condemn you to pick up any Villain Ball you see , perhaps even demoting you to the rank of Harmless Villain , and failure will be your only option .
The original Evil Overlord List was compiled in 1990 by several members of the FidoNet Science Fiction and Fandom email echo .
The FidoNet list originated with a 1988 Saturday Night Live skit featuring Bond Villains touting a book " What Not To Do When You Capture James Bond " .
The FidoNet list arose out of discussions regarding what sort of advice might be in that book , and was compiled and published by Jack Butler .

The original version of the list can be found here while the list Peter Anspach later compiled can be found here .
The version reproduced for TV Tropes is the more well - known list that sprang out of discussions on the Star Trek mailing list around 1994 , discussing common cliches that appeared on Star Trek : Deep Space Nine .
It started with 25 items and growing into eventually 100 items with several appendices grouped into " Cellblock A " and " Cellblock B " .
It is no longer updated , though it can still be found at this site .
Both Peter Anspach and Jack Butler acknowledge the existence of each other 's lists , that both lists originated independently of each other , and state that their two lists have been so cross-pollinated over the years as to become effectively identical .
Since the version below and the appendices are reproduced directly from Anspach 's site , the copyright notice has been maintained out of courtesy .

What happened
Federal regulators conducting “ stress tests ” of 19 U.S. banks have reportedly determined that Bank of America needs $ 34 billion in new capital , the largest shortfall among the tested banks .
In all , 10 of the 19 banks are expected to require more capital .
The Federal Reserve will officially unveil the results of the stress tests Thursday evening .
( Bloomberg )
What the commentators said
Bank of America needs $ 34 billion ?
said Felix Salmon in Reuters .
Yikes !
If BofA needs that much , the collective needs of all the banks must be a “ shockingly enormous sum . ”
Let ’s hope the Obama team knows what it ’s doing with these stress tests , despite the “ ham - fisted ” leaking of the results .
The stress tests are already “ yielding benefits , ” said Binyamin Appelbaum in The Washington Post .
BofA ’s shares have climbed 129 percent since the tests were launched , and even Citigroup is up 27 percent .
But the point is n’t to rescue the banks , it ’s to “ rescue the economy , ” and the 12 - week testing period has let the markets “ breathe deeply ” and the banks race to get stronger .
If the tests show BofA or other banks as weak , that could spark debilitating selloffs , said The Salt Lake Tribune in an editorial .
But the Obama team should still “ disclose as much as possible ” about the health of the banks .
The weak ones wo n’t be allowed to fail , and the strong ones will get stronger with investor confidence , allowing them to lend again — “ the goal of federal banking policy . ”
Decisions shape our lives .
“ Should I change careers ? ” “ Where should I live ? ” “ How should I invest my savings ? ”
Making decisions is a fundamental life skill , and we can all learn to become much better at it .
In this post , I present a simple , systematic approach you can use to make smarter choices starting today .
The PrOACT Approach to Decision Making
The PrOACT approach ( outlined in the book Smart Choices ) is by far the best model for decision making that I have seen .
It helps you see both the tangible and intangible aspects of your situation more clearly and to translate all pertinent facts , feelings , opinions , beliefs and advice into the best possible decision .
‘ PrOACT ’ is a mnemonic that stands for five key elements in the model :
Pr oblem statement
oblem statement O bjectives
bjectives A lternatives
lternatives C onsequences
onsequences Tradeoffs
The method consists of examining each of these core elements separately , using them to clarify and organize your thoughts as you go .
Let ’s take a look at each of its components .
1. Problem Statement
Behind every decision you make there ’s a problem you ’re trying to solve .
The way you state your problem frames your decision .
It determines the alternatives you consider and how you will evaluate them .
Effectively posing the problem is paramount , as it influences all your subsequent thinking in the decision making process .
In spite of its importance , many of us just skip this step altogether : it ’s too easy to state problems as they come to our minds .
The better - defined your problem is , the easier it will be to solve it — to the point of the solution becoming self - evident .
Want an example ?
A friend of mine loved to work for his company , but hated his boss .
His dilemma was to resign or to stay in the company .
Instead of choosing between these two options , he redefined the problem as how to keep his job , but getting rid of this boss .
What did he do ?
He sent his boss ’ CV out and got him interviews for higher - paying jobs .
His boss ended up moving to another job — and my friend ended up staying in the same company — promoted to his boss ’ previous position .
Smart problem redefinition trumps hard thinking .
For a primer on problem definition and many techniques you can use to tweak your problem statement , the article Einstein ’s Secret to Amazing Problem Solving is a good starting point .
2. Objectives
After you have a better definition of your problem , now it ’s time to get crystal - clear about what you ’re trying to accomplish with your decision .
This is another step most of us get wrong : we regard our objectives as obvious and skip explicitly defining them — allowing them to fuzzily float in our minds .
Objectives are the elements that will guide our decision .
Clarifying them improves our understanding of the problem , and sets expectations for the possible solutions .
It also helps you better communicate what you want as you explain the problem to others .
So , sit down and make a bullet point list of objectives , as explicit and clear as possible .
Why exactly do you want to change jobs ?
Is it your boss ?
Maybe you want a shorter commute time ?
Make these reasons clear in writing .
If you find that your objectives do n’t come naturally to you , journaling is a tool that can really help .
Asking why repeatedly is also a great way to look at your objectives from different viewpoints .
3. Alternatives
Now that you have a well - defined problem and clear objectives , it ’s time to finally assess your alternatives and decide , right ?
Not so fast !
First , we should generate alternatives — expand and explore possibilities .
The payoff for looking for new , fresh alternatives can be extremely high , so there ’s no excuse to skip this step .
There ’s a simple aphorism in decision making that says your final choice can never be better than the best alternative you considered .
Yes , it ’s obvious , I know , but it serves as a reminder of how important it is to take our time and generate as many alternatives as possible before spending time choosing between unsatisfactory choices .
Indeed , it ’s much easier ( and fun ! ) to generate better alternatives than to find yourself stuck choosing between two poor ones .
Never take the first alternative that comes to your mind .
Do n’t settle for two , either — shoot for more , way more .
The way to generate new alternatives is to take each of your objectives and ask “ How ? ” or “ In what ways can I fulfill this objective ? ” .
Remember , go for quantity , and do n’t evaluate the ideas you gathered just yet .
Idea - generation techniques such as lists of 100 or idea quotas are your friends here .
4. Consequences
Now comes the time to finally start assessing the merits of each of the alternatives you considered .
And the primary way of doing this is by evaluating the consequences of each choice .
After you discard the clearly inferior alternatives you generated , take each of the remaining ones and describe , in writing if possible , what are the consequences of choosing them .
That is , imagine how the future will look like for each of them .
If you foresee each alternative ’s consequences well enough , your decision will become obvious .
Unfortunately , this is much easier said than done .
Anticipating consequences in complete and precise terms is hard .
Predicting the future is something we humans are notoriously bad at — and that ’s particularly true when it comes to predict our own future .
So , do n’t take the process of foreseeing consequences sloppily — be as realistic as you can and use every tool in your reach to paint as precise a picture of your future as possible .
Talk to experienced people who have already ‘ been there , done that ’ and get as much information as you can from them .
Also , do n’t just imagine you might choose an alternative : imagine yourself in a future where you already chose it .
How do you feel about each of the objectives you set ?
Is it what you first anticipated ?
5. Tradeoffs
If you got this far without a solution , it ’s probably because your decision is really tricky .
It also means that it has conflicting objectives — and that you ’ll need to consider some hard tradeoffs between them .
As you might have expected , this is seldom something easy to do .
Choosing between unrelated objectives feels like comparing apples with oranges — except that , depending on the number of objectives you have , it may feel more like comparing apples with oranges with elephants with washing powder .
So , before anything else , now is a great time to revisit your objectives , looking for ways to simplify them , based on the extra information you gathered so far .
If that ’s still not enough , and the decision is not obvious just by mentally evaluating the tradeoffs , you ’ll need a systematic approach to make your tradeoffs .
I ’ve seen a couple of these approaches , but the best one I found is the Even Swaps method ( which is also described in detail in the same book ) .
I ’ve used the method twice already , and I found it fascinating !
It ’s beyond the scope of this article to go into detail about it , but the basic idea is to take consequences and isolate them in pairs — making a series of small , easy tradeoffs instead of trying to compare each alternative as a big blob of conflicting consequences .
If you think that a complete , detailed explanation about the Even Swaps method would be valuable to you , let me know in the comments .
If enough people are interested , I ’ll write an article about it .
Final Words
This process may seem like a lot of work to go through .
However , after you use it a couple of times , you ’ll realize that , if you walk through the steps in order , you ’ll seldom need to go through them all .
An interesting characteristic of this method is that each of the five components helps clarify each other .
When outlining consequences , you might find out about a new objective .
By looking at tradeoffs , you may decide to redefine your problem .
That means you should frequently go back and forth between the steps in the model .
The book Smart Choices explores even more elements that are required when analyzing the hardest of decisions , such as uncertainty and linked choices .
So , I end this article recommending it : Smart Choices : A Practical Guide to Making Better Life Decisions is an easy read full of practical examples , and definitely worth reading by everybody interested in taking their life decisions to the next level .

It also reports the shadow cabinet 's David Willetts claimed more than £ 100 for workmen to replace 25 light bulbs at his home after electrical problems .
Tory leader David Cameron said it was time to admit the system was " wrong " .
Plans to set up an independent auditing body for claims are expected to be outlined on Monday .
Leaking pipe
The Telegraph has been running leaks , hitherto largely of Labour ministers ' and MPs ' claims for their second homes .
Its reports of Tory expenses claims include : More than £ 2,000 received by Conservative policy chief Oliver Letwin to replace a leaking pipe under a tennis court .
He responded : " I was served a statutory notice by the water company to repair the leaking pipe , which runs underneath the tennis court and garden .
No improvements were made to the tennis court or garden . "
Shadow universities secretary David Willetts ' claim of more than £ 100 for workmen to replace 25 light bulbs at his home .
" We had problems with our lighting system which had caused many lights to fuse and needed the attention of an electrician , " he said .
Thousands of pounds for renovations claimed by shadow home secretary Chris Grayling at a London flat 17 miles from his family home .
He said : " In addition to serving my constituents , I have spent several years serving in the shadow cabinet , currently as the shadow home secretary .
A second home enables me to meet those commitments . "
In response to an allegation that he delayed claims to maximise what he received , he said all claims had been submitted " at the point which I received the invoices " .
Reimbursement of £ 4.47 for dog food to shadow Welsh secretary Cheryl Gillan , who said the claim had been made in mistake and would be repaid .
Following the newspaper articles , Mr Cameron said it was " another bad day for Parliament and , frankly , a bad day for the Conservative Party " .
" We have to acknowledge just how bad this is .
The public are really angry and we have to start by saying , look , this system that we had , that we used , that we operated , that we took part in - it was wrong and we 're sorry about it . "
Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : " The last few days have been deeply damaging for politicians of all parties and the public have every right to be angry about the issue . "
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the public 's idea of MPs being " honourable members " was now " dead " .
Rules ' ' spirit ' According to the Telegraph , a £ 3,194 bill for gardening submitted by Mr Duncan in March 2007 was not paid after officials said it might not be " within the spirit " of the rules .
In a letter , the fees office said gardening costs were intended " to cover only basic essentials such as grass cutting " .
But the paper said Mr Duncan , who oversees party policy on MPs ' expenses , recouped £ 4,000 in expenses for gardening costs over three years .
If the reports are in all cases correct , then there clearly are instances where MPs have lost contact with the difference between right and wrong

MPs ' moral authority ' at low ebb ' MPs ' expense claims - key details
In March 2007 , he claimed £ 598 to overhaul a ride - on lawnmower , the Telegraph added .
Mr Duncan challenged the report , saying he had consulted officials about what could and could not be claimed for .
He also said he had been the first MP to publish his expenses on his website .
Shadow cabinet office minister Francis Maude claimed almost £ 35,000 in mortgage interest payments on a London flat that he bought , close to a house he already owned and then rented out , the Telegraph reports .
Mr Maude said : " The London house I rented out had been bought , renovated and furnished with our own money , with the exception of a modestly priced replacement bed .
" The new flat purchased was therefore properly designated as our second home and enabled me to carry out my parliamentary duties .
It was also renovated and furnished entirely with our own money . "
' Flipping '
The Telegraph alleges that shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley changed his designated second home in order to claim more expenses - a tactic known as " flipping " , which Mr Lansley denies .
The paper reported that he spent thousands of pounds renovating a country cottage before selling it , then designated a London flat as his second home and claimed for thousands of pounds in furnishings .
HAVE YOUR SAY So David Cameron has said that ' MPs should say sorry ' well , where is his apology ?
Daniel , Bolton
In a statement , Mr Lansley said : " Until late 2005 , my main family home was in London as that is where I spent the majority of my time .
" In late 2005 my daughter started at nursery school in Cambridgeshire and from that point onwards my constituency home became my main residence .
" In my view it would have been contrary to the requirements of the ACA ( additional costs allowance ) if I had not switched the definition of my main residence at that point .
All subsequent claims reflect this legitimate change in my arrangements . "
Shadow schools secretary Michael Gove strongly denied " flipping " , after the Telegraph reported he had spent more than £ 7,000 on a London property over five months in 2006 , before claiming more than £ 13,000 on a Surrey property .
Mr Gove responded that his principal home had been in Surrey since before his election in May 2005 .
A London property that had previously been rented out was designated as his second home from later that year , he said .
' Arm 's length ' Plans for an independent auditing body to oversee MPs ' expenses claims are expected to be approved on Monday , following weeks of damaging stories .
Senior Labour MP
Sir Stuart Bell said the Commons would be asked to approve the body , made up entirely of independent people .
EXPENSES REACTION David Cameron Alan Duncan Liam Fox Michael Gove
Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said : " I think that most of the people who go into politics ... are in it for the right reasons and are not on the take .
" But the problem is that the last few days has suggested otherwise .
That 's why the test of us now is do we show , reaching across parties , an ability to reform this system and get it changed as soon as possible . "
Sir Stuart said an independent audit body - separate from the Commons fees office which agrees the claims - would be set up to analyse " every claim that is made " .
The fees office is overseen by a committee made up of MPs and independent people - who in turn are overseen by the National Audit Office .
The new body would be entirely independent and cost about £ 600,000 a year to run .
Millions of receipts backing up all MPs ' expenses claims under the second homes allowance were due to be published in July after a long Freedom of Information campaign .
But details have been leaked to the Telegraph - which has been publishing selected excerpts over the last few days .
Elsewhere , it has been reported that Conservative MP James Gray claimed £ 60 for wreaths to be laid at Remembrance Day services .
In a statement , Mr Gray said the story was " simply not true " , adding : " It is in fact a rehash of a very old newspaper story from 2003 , when I put down a parliamentary question to ask the then Leader of the House of Commons , Peter Hain , whether or not wreaths laid by MPs in their official capacity were regarded as an official expense .
" He replied that they were not , as a result of which I have not , and would not , claim for them . "

It 's kind of irresistible that McDonald 's has a training facility called Hamburger University that , according to this old MarketWatch article , actually seems to offer a degree in " Hamburgerology . "
Ha ha ha .
But according to the Financial Times McDonald 's is getting slightly serious about this education stuff and now has hopes to offer a full - blown phD .
The FT reports :
McDonald 's hopes to offer its own PhD , throwing down the ultimate challenge to the popular wisdom that the high - street fast - food chain creates nothing but low - paid , low - quality " McJobs " to replace high - skilled work in old manufacturing industries .
David Fairhurst , the group 's " chief people officer " , told the Financial Times : " One day I 'd love to see us doing a PhD , I definitely think we should go as far as we can . "
[... The chief people officer ] said McDonald 's had become an attractive employer both to graduates and other workers , in large part because of its training , with its status as an awarding body adding to the prestige of its qualifications .
And really , why not ?
My first thought on reading this was , " McDonald 's is not a prestigious university and that bit about the ' chief people officer ' must be a joke . "
But a lot of higher education is about correlation and not causation : Earning a fancy degree does n't necessarily cause anyone to become smart or talented , but a fancy degree is a strong signalling mechanism .
( This signalling mechanism is why it might be perfectly rational to go to Harvard instead of a less expensive school , even if the difference in " practical skills " obtained would be slight relative to the difference in cost : Harvard is the stronger signal . )
So if it is in fact true that employers are starting to take McDonald 's seriously " as an awarding body " -- adding to the " prestige of its qualifications " that it sounds like it 's already built up -- then perhaps it would be fine to head there for a phD .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Hubble trouble : Space Shuttle suffers heat shield damage during mission to upgrade telescope
Nasa has despatched seven astronauts on its most dangerous ever shuttle mission as it attempts to rescue the $ 7 billion Hubble Space Telescope from meltdown .
The Atlantis shuttle has already run into problems suffering heat shield damage during launch .
Led by former US Navy fighter pilot Scott Altman , 49 , a one - time stunt flier for actor Tom Cruise in the film , Top Gun , the crew of Atlantis will repair and upgrade the orbiting observatory , risking a potentially deadly space - junk collision that could leave them stranded 350 miles above Earth .
A camera aboard space shuttle Atlantis captured this image as the shuttle soared over the Earth .
Saudi Arabia is in the foreground and Israel and Jordan can be seen near the top edge of the frame .
The crew have already begun the standard survey of the space shuttle 's heat shield using the robotic arm .
This procedure was introduced after the Columbia shuttle disintegrated on its return to Earth in 2003 because of heat shield damage .
NASA said Atlantis shuttle was hit by a piece of debris that nicked part of its heat shield during launch but said the damage appeared very minor .
The mission , which is costing Nasa $ 1.4 billion and was launched from Florida on Monday , is considered so perilous that it was once cancelled by space agency chiefs who feared that it could cost the astronauts their lives .
Debris from Atlantis ' launch is seen hitting the shuttle 's right wing edge ( l ) .
It caused minor damage ( r )
It was resurrected only after they agreed to place a second shuttle and crew on emergency standby , ready to blast into space to save their colleagues should a catastrophe occur .
The move is unprecedented in the 28 - year history of the shuttle fleet .
' It ’s a belt - and - suspenders kind of approach - but when your suspenders fail , you ’re glad to have the belt , ' said Cdr Altman , who launched with his crew from Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral , due to return in 11 days .
' I do n’t know if I ’ll be breathing comfortably until our wheels stop back at KSC , ' he added .
Should a rescue become necessary , it would provide the greatest space drama since the abortive Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970 , say Nasa insiders , when three astronauts limped their crippled spacecraft home just hours from death , following an on - board explosion .

The Hubble crew : ( l - r ) Michael J Massimino , Michael T Good , Gregory C Johnson , pilot ; Scott D Altman , commander ; K. Megan McArthur , John M. Grunsfeld and Andrew J. Feustel
Among the greatest hazards facing Atlantis is the intense amount of space junk - such as broken satellites and dead rockets - that is cluttering the area where the shuttle will rendezvous with Hubble .
Shuttle flights usually only go to the International Space Station no more than 250 miles up - but at 350 miles , where Hubble flies , the hazards are far greater .
If Atlantis suffers damage , the crew would be marooned .
Hubble is considered the most valuable astronomical tool since Galileo first designed a telescope in the 17th century .
Since 1990 , its high - precision lenses have peered deeper into space than any previous instrument , glimpsing back more than 13 billion years in time to provide scientists with breathtaking images of the cosmos under development , showing galaxies not long after they merged from the Big Bang .
Orbiting Earth 97,000 times and travelling around three billion miles , it has sent back nearly 600,000 photographs that have forced the rewriting of astronomy textbooks and unlocked some of the greatest mysteries of the universe .
On Wednesday Atlantis will catch up with the Hubble , where the astronauts will use the shuttle ’s robotic arm to grapple with it while both craft orbit Earth at 17,500mph .
During five highly risky spacewalks , they will clamber aboard Hubble to repair and replace instruments contained inside , upgrading its capabilities and prolonging its life for another five years .
Without new cameras , gyroscopes and batteries , Hubble will otherwise burn out .
But with the space shuttle fleet due to retire next year and its successor not due for completion until at least 2015 , this is the last chance to fix its problems .
' The adrenalin is certainly pumping , ' said Dr David Leckrone , Nasa ’s senior Hubble scientist .
This Hubble image from 2003 shows a storm of turbulent gases in the Omega - Swan nebula
Astronaut John Grunsfeld likens the intricacy of the tasks he and his colleagues will perform to ' performing brain surgery in space . '
They will face major hurdles , such as unscrewing dozens of minute screws while wearing gloves five layers thick and removing razor - sharp circuit boards capable of piercing the $ 10 million spacesuits that keep them alive in the vacuum of space .
' I would consider this the climbing Mount Everest of spacewalking missions , ' said Mr Grunsfeld , 51 .
' The big unknowns are where we ’re pushing the envelope further than its been done before in spaceflight … we ’re trying some techniques that have n’t been done before .
' In training it ’s been going very well … the only hesitation I have is that Hubble has a way of surprising us . '
There have been previous servicing missions to the Hubble , but this will be the last – and the most risky .
' You could say " Oh it ’s going to be a piece of cake , we ’ve done this five times " - except on this mission we are going to be repairing instruments that were never designed to be repaired in orbit , ' explained Ed Weiler , Nasa ’s associate administrator for science missions .
He added : ' This is really going to be tough , the toughest servicing mission we have ever attempted . '
Nasa promises that , if successful , Atlantis ’s mission will allow Hubble to once more ' push the boundaries of how deep in space and how far back in time humanity can see . '

Correction to this article
Monday
AS THE Economist 's education correspondent , I 've been invited by Economist Conferences , one of the businesses in the Economist group , to chair a conference in New York entitled “ Global Education 2020 ” .
It 's just one day , but if I 'm going to make the trip from London , I may as well stay longer and visit some schools .
Those in the city 's poor neighbourhoods have long been known for having serious problems — violence , astronomical drop - out rates and abysmal standards of achievement — but in the last few years exciting things have been happening under Joel Klein , the chancellor of the city 's department of education , and I want to see some of the success stories with my own eyes .
Monday morning , and I 'm off to Starbucks on 93rd and Broadway to meet Wendy Kopp , the Princeton graduate who in 1990 founded Teach for America ( TFA ) , a non-profit organisation that recruits top - notch graduates from elite institutions and gets them to teach for two years in struggling state schools in poor areas .
I know the basics already — TFA been widely copied , including in England .
But I quickly realise that I 've misunderstood TFA 's true purpose .
AP
The right kind of cult
I had thought the programme was about getting more high - quality teachers — but that , it appears , is a secondary benefit .
“ This is about enlisting the energy of our country 's future leaders in its long - term educational needs , and eliminating inequity , ” Wendy explains .
It 's great if “ corps members ” , as TFA calls its active teachers , stay in the classroom — and many do , and rise quickly through the ranks .
But the “ alums ” , as she calls those who have finished their two - year stint , who do n't stay in schools often go on to lead in other fields , meaning that increasing numbers of influential people in all walks of life learn that it is possible to teach successfully in low - income communities , and just what it takes .
“ It means you realise that we can solve this problem . ”
As she continues to talk I realise that TFA is — in the best possible sense — a cult .
It has its own language ( “ corps members ” , “ alums ” ) , recruits are indoctrinated ( “ We tell them that it can be done , that we know of hundreds , thousands , of teachers attaining tremendous success ” ) , go through an ordeal ( “ Everyone hits the wall in week three in the classroom ” ) , emerge transformed by privileged knowledge ( “ Once you know what we know — that kids in poor urban areas can excel — you can accomplish different things ” ) and can never leave ( alumni form a growing , and influential , network ) .
I have not seen the same zeal when talking to those on the equivalent programme in England , Teach First .
In fact , one Teach Firster told me that in the early days the missionary - style language imported from America had to be toned down , because it just did n't suit the restrained English style .
But could that fervour be necessary for its success ?
Chester , an alum , takes me to visit three TFA corps members in their second year of teaching at a middle school in the Bronx .
They are impressive young people , and their zeal is evident .
Two intend to stay in teaching ; both want to open charter schools .
One , a Hispanic woman , is working out with a friend how to educate migrant Hispanic labourers in Texas ; the other would like to open a “ green ” charter , but in the meantime he has accepted a job with KIPP ( “ Knowledge is Power Program ” ; the largest group of charter schools in the nation ) in Newark , New Jersey .
All three are tired .
Their classrooms are not much like the rest of the school where they work , and their heroic efforts are only supported by Chester and each other , not by their co-workers .
“ The first year was unbelievably bad , ” one tells me .
“ So many years with low expectations meant a lot of resistance from the kids .
Eventually they saw the power and the growth they were capable of — but during the first few months we were just butting heads every day . ”
Next I 'm off to Bronx Lab , also a public school , but one that has been given a great deal of freedom as its results are so stellar .
It 's as near to a charter school as it's possible to be without actually being one , says its head teacher , Marc Sternberg .
He , like nearly every one of the school 's teachers , is a TFA alum .
The cab drops me off at one of the most horrifying school buildings I 've ever seen .
It 's massive , nearly an entire block , and entirely swathed in scaffolding and black netting .
I 'm a little early , so I circle it , imagining arriving here on my first day of high school , how scared I 'd be , how miserable .
Then I realise that underneath the covering , it 's a lovely , grand old building .
Presumably it 's finally getting a bit of attention after decades without proper maintenance .
But the bad impression continues in the hallway — police , an X - ray machine for bags and a metal detector through which all arrivals must step .
This building used to house a single high school , Evander Childs , with over 3,000 students .
As a behemoth it was a byword for public - school failure and violence , but it has now been divided into six smaller schools .
Bronx Lab is on the fourth floor .
Police still patrol the corridors , but they 're friendly and relaxed , and I quickly let go of my first impressions .
I 'm struck by the informality — first - name terms , teachers in jeans , no uniform — and the air of purpose and calmness .
As we walk around Marc grabs individual students and gets them to tell me about “ the letter you 've just received ” — an extraordinary number of his graduating class , only the school 's second , have won scholarships to elite universities .
Tuesday
TODAY is the conference for which I 've travelled to New York .
It 's at the Rubin Museum , a small , new venue devoted to Himalayan art , which certainly beats the usual hotel .
We see the galleries at each coffee break , and at the end of the day there is a guided tour for those inspired to learn more about the art .
The conference features a stellar cast of speakers : educators , researchers and some hard - headed business types too .
Lou Gerstner , an ex-CEO of IBM , enthusiastically pitches his plan for school reform : he wants the 15,000 local school districts abolished and replaced by around 70 ( the states plus a couple of dozen big cities ) , national standards in core subjects introduced , with all children tested against them , and teachers paid much , much more .
AP
Geoffrey Canada interacts with programme participants
Jim Rohr of PNC Financial Services talks about “ Grow Up Great ” , the bank 's $ 100 m , 10 - year investment in early - childhood education , which gives grants to non-profit school - readiness programmes , and sponsors employees to volunteer their time and services .
One delegate asks about the lessons learned ; Mr Rohr gets a laugh of recognition when he says that the main one is that volunteers face a hideous maze of bureaucratic regulations and permissions — and all because they wanted to help .
I 'm moved and inspired by the testimony of Geoffrey Canada , the founder of Harlem Children 's Zone , which serves around 11,000 children in Harlem , making sure that everything from their mother 's antenatal care right through to their college entry forms is as good as anything the rich can buy .
He tells us that Barack Obama is thinking of creating 20 “ Promise Neighbourhoods ” around the country modelled on his programme .
Less cheerfully , he also says that the funding for this extremely expensive project , much of which came from individual philanthropists who made fortunes in high finance , is drying up and he has had to cut projects and sack staff .
For me the highlight of the day is Neil Turok , a physicist who recently left the University of Cambridge to become executive director of the Perimeter Institute in Ontario .
The move caused a minor fuss in Britain , because he was outspoken about his reasons : British academia was , he said , being strangled by red tape and starved of cash .
But he 's here to talk about something far more optimistic : the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences ( AIMS ) , a postgraduate centre in Cape Town he founded in 2003 .
Around 50 students from all over Africa come to AIMS each year for an intensive 9 - month residential course , covering many of the most exciting and fast - moving areas in mathematical sciences , most taught in three - week blocks by distinguished visiting professors .
For far too long , says Mr Turok , Africa has been regarded as chronically incompetent , a fitting recipient only of food and other basic necessities .
He speaks passionately about Africa 's desperate need for educational development , so that the abilities of its people are not lost .
He is working to set up another 14 institutes in other parts of Africa under the “ Next Einstein Initiative ” , which hopes to see an “ African Einstein ” in our lifetimes .
The day finishes with Joel Klein speaking with Caroline Kennedy about New York 's public schools .
He is the reforming Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education and chairman of the Fund for Public Schools , a non-profit that works to attract private investment into school reform in New York City ; she is vice - chairman of the fund — and , of course , an A - list celebrity .
Savvy move by the organisers saving her for last : I have never previously attended a conference where absolutely nobody sneaks out early to catch a train or plane .
Mr Klein stays for dinner after the conference — at least for the first course , of which he eats nothing ( I suppose he 's going on to another meal ) .
I tell him about my visit yesterday to Bronx Lab ; he knows it and its principal well and has lots to say about schools in general and how much you can tell from a visit in particular .
“ You only need to look into the children 's eyes to tell whether a school is good or not , ” he says ; I concur and add that in my experience you can tell good head teachers because they 're the ones who always have time for visitors — not because they are n't busy , but because they 're not constantly dealing with crises .
A major reason schools in so many parts of the world are a mess is because the hard - headed business types who care about structural reform and education funding do n't understand or care about teaching , and the teachers and educationalists are equally ignorant about money and organisational structures .
So I 'm impressed by Mr Klein , who 's clearly a rare , and valuable , type : a hard - headed ex-lawyer who understands the figures , certainly , but also really likes schools and is still fascinated by education after seven years in the job .

QUITE a few Economist journalists have children in private schools , and whenever I write about the astronomical fees they read my articles with keen interest .
More than one has asked me , hopefully and with a certain Schadenfreude , whether the global recession means that schools finally have to start cutting their fees ?
In London , that 's doubtful ; I want to find out whether Manhattan is any different .
One reason fees in both places have been so high is limited supply : opening a new school in either of these crowded , pricey cities is difficult .
So my first stop is Claremont Prep , one of the rare ones that has managed it .
It opened just five years ago , in an old Bank of America building just off Wall Street .
P.D. Cagliastro , the school 's flack , shows me around .
Mandarin lessons at Claremont Prep
It cost $ 28 m just to open the doors , Ms Cagliastro tells me , and another $ 7 m has been spent since — and I can easily believe it .
The former banking hall , its murals carefully restored , is now a grand auditorium ; in the student cafeteria the old vault door is still visible , protected behind glass .
There is an indoor swimming pool , and a basketball court on the 9th floor .
The rooftop garden is surreal — an adventure playground on Astroturf , surrounded by skyscrapers and overlooked by the New York Stock Exchange .
Requests for financial aid are up , but only slightly : so many people got so rich over the last few years , Ms Cagliastro explains , that they could live more than comfortably for the rest of their lives off their savings .
She says the mother of one child told her that if things got “ really bad ” she would simply sell a few holiday homes ; they have five , three of which they “ hardly use ” .
People who are willing to pay north of $ 30,000 a year to educate a child tend to want proof upfront that it will be worth it , and in America that means they want to see a solid record of graduates accepted at Ivy League universities .
Last year was the first anyone can remember that Dalton , probably the city 's toniest school , got not a single one of its graduates into Harvard , and its acceptance rates were down at others too .
Although this was surely the result of elite colleges ' increasing efforts to diversify their intake , together with a population bulge at school - leaving age , it caused an almighty fuss , with parents telling journalists the school was n't “ focused ” on what it was meant to be about and that parents had “ got screwed ” .
Does Claremont suffer from its lack of history ?
Ms Cagliastro says yes ( earlier , an educational consultant — one of a breed that charges five figures to help parents get their children into private schools — told me she only recommends schools that have had a graduating class for at least ten years ) .
What has helped , though , is that many families have moved into lower Manhattan since September 11th , 2001 , when businesses started to move out , and also that Manhattan as a whole has experienced a recent mini-baby boom .
The two local public schools , she tells me , are great — but bursting at the seams — and competition for private - school places is stiffer every year too .
I spend the afternoon at Fieldston , a 130 - year - old private school split between a site at Central Park West , and one in the Riverdale area of the Bronx .
The latter , in particular , is stunningly beautiful , as lovely as some of England 's famous old schools .
The classes I sit in on are great too .
Confident and articulate young people in a history lesson make connections between the run-up to the recent election and the passions raised by the battle between the “ silverites ” and “ gold bugs ” in 1896 .
In a modern - American architecture class the students have prepared a lesson themselves , and discourse fluently on the positioning of entrances , the structure of columns and the shape and number of windows on various iconic buildings .
I certainly learn more than I usually do during a school visit .
The last time I wrote about private - school fees , back in England , I asked an education economist whether the colossal cost was financially worthwhile .
Apparently yes — at least historically .
All the data we have are from when fees were lower and the earnings differential granted by a degree from a good university greater ; it 's harder to tell now that fees have in real terms doubled and far more people go to university .
But , he cautioned , thinking of spending on a private education as pure investment is a mistake : it also is a rather enjoyable form of consumption .
His words come back to me , as I am beguiled by interesting lessons in these lovely surroundings .

Thursday
I AM in Newark , New Jersey 's largest town and long a byword for urban decay .
I 've been invited by KIPP ( the “ Knowledge is Power Programme ” ) , the biggest and best known of America 's charter - school chains , which has three schools in Newark , with a fourth to open this autumn .
Founded by two Teach for America alumni ( how familiar that story is getting ) in 1994 , there are now 66 KIPP schools nationwide , mostly middle schools ( ie , with students between 10 and 14 years old ) .
Oddly , none of Newark 's KIPP schools are called that : under the state 's charter law “ brand ” names are banned , which reflects early fears that big chains would come in and take over .
Those fears have dissipated , and Cory Booker , Newark 's mayor since 2006 , is a good friend of charters , and wants to see more of them .
Nicholas Alan Cope
I 'm actually a bit nervous .
KIPP has a fearsome and to my mind not entirely attractive reputation in England for a zero - tolerance approach to discipline — insisting that children keep their gaze on teachers who are speaking , and nod and say “ yes ” in response to teachers ' requests ; giving detentions for minor transgressions ; and “ benching ” — that is , seating naughty children separately in class and forbidding other pupils to speak to them during breaks .
A certain type of English politician practically drools when talking about KIPP — the ones who , like many of their compatriots , dislike and fear children , and love all talk of treating them harshly .
I 'm half - expecting to find dead - eyed Marine - sergeant types with crewcuts barking orders at children one - third their size .
If it turns out that the only way to maintain order and calm in a tough urban school is to run it like a boot camp , it will make me very sad .
I cannot remember when my expectations and reality last clashed so much : the day turns out to be the most fun I 've ever had visiting schools .
I 'm shown around RISE , one of KIPP 's two middle schools in Newark , by Drew Martin , its principal , and Ryan Hill , the executive director of KIPP in Newark .
Both had become head teachers by the age of 25 and both are TFA alumni — and although their desire to create great schools is real and serious , they have fun while doing it .
Teachers certainly control their classes , but they also crack jokes , and over coffee I 'm told about the running mock feud between the English and maths departments , with offices dismantled and reinstalled on roofs and other undergraduate - style pranks .
The pupils take part in the friendly rivalry too — which may be one reason that they have an unusually positive attitude towards maths , a subject that is generally badly taught and widely disliked , in both America and Britain .
As I walk around the school I realise the consistency of the school 's approach to discipline frees the teachers to have fun with their classes .
This is a happy school , but I hear some very sad stories , of makeshift fostering arrangements with indifferent relatives , of siblings in the care system who are no longer in touch , of absent , drug - addicted parents , of children who routinely witness gang - related violence .
One that sticks in my mind starts “ She 's not being abused , but … ” and does n't get better as it goes along .
Quite a few of the pupils prefer to stay on after lessons — and this is at a school with 10 - hour days , Saturday classes and short vacations .
One girl tells me a teacher drives her home each week - day evening , at 9 or 9.30 pm , after which she goes straight to bed .
What does she do at weekends ?
A shrug : “ I stay in my room . ”
In the afternoon Joanna Belcher , principal of SPARK , the KIPP elementary school that will open this autumn , takes me to meet one of her future pupils .
Ms Belcher is visiting every family , both to meet the parents and children individually , but also to sign , with them , the KIPP commitment to excellence : in summary , work hard and be nice and we will do everything in our power to ensure you go to college .
Mother and father and Joanna sign in pen , the four - year - old future college graduate in purple crayon ( her favourite colour ) .
It 's a solemn moment .
The day finishes with a chat with middle - school pupils .
I ask each to give me one thought to take back to London .
One tells me “ Math is life ” , a slogan I 've heard repeatedly through the day ; another speaks eloquently about the many meanings of “ yet ” , a word that for these teachers and pupils connotes effort and success — if not now , then surely one day , if only you keep trying .
A third tells me with considerable force and passion that no one should ever call a child “ disabled ” .
I am taken aback until I hear about the foster parents who thought she was incapable of coping with a normal education , the social workers who read the forms and then never looked her in the eye — and finally , the adoptive mother who believed in her and let her apply to this school , her first mainstream one , where she is still behind her classmates , but catching up fast .
It is just one of many moments in the day that brings a lump to my throat .

Friday
THE DAY starts in a small office in downtown Manhattan with Zeke Vanderhoek , the principal of The Equity Project , a charter school set to open in Washington Heights this autumn .
Already the school has attracted national attention — not for its pedagogy , but for its teachers ' salaries : $ 125,000 annually , plus a performance - related bonus .
This pay , easily double or triple what most teachers make , will come out of the school 's grant from the city 's education department — which , as is standard for charter schools , is a good deal less than it spends on its own public schools .
How will he find the money ?
By hiring great teachers , says Zeke , which will allow him to cut back on everything else : the school will have hardly any non-teaching staff and no assistant principals , just a principal ( himself ) who earns less than classroom teachers .
It will pay for no educational consultants or outside courses : these super - teachers will support each other 's professional development .
They will work long , hard days : 8 am to 6 pm , and each will fill one of the roles normally assigned to support staff , such as chasing up truants .
When one is absent , colleagues will cover , rather than the school paying for peripatetic substitutes .
The Excellence Charter School
We talk about money and waste in public schools : the programmes started and abandoned ; the consultants and other hangers - on , both public - sector and private ; the expensive remediation of mistakes made earlier in a child 's education ; the even more expensive failure to remediate so that many children leave school having had a small fortune spent on them — and barely able to read .
Mr Vandenhoek offers me two vignettes from his years as a Teach for America corps member ( yes , another one ) to illustrate .
The first is the time he broke his leg and was forbidden by the city 's education department from returning to the classroom , even though he wanted to and offered to sign a waiver ; they preferred to waste money on an inferior substitute and time on argument .
The second is the lengthy fuss that ensued when his school found out he was teaching his pupils an advanced mathematics syllabus ; they said it was “ too hard ” and told him he had to stop .
“ Why were n't they going after the teachers who were reading newspapers in class ? ” he asks .
My last visit of the week is to the Excellence Charter School in Brooklyn , an all - boys school for five - to 11 - year - olds that will eventually teach right up to age 14 .
Before the city let the building to Uncommon Schools , a charter - management organisation , for paltry rent in return for renovating it , it was a derelict shell housing only prostitutes , crack addicts and abandoned dogs .
Just a few years ( and $ 28 m in fund - raising ) later , it 's the loveliest public school I 've seen .
I 'm shown around by Tim Saintsing , the “ Director of Operations ” — essentially a non-teaching joint principal .
The classes I visit are engaging and physical ; in one , one teacher keeps the class on its toes with quick - fire questions , indicating which boy is to answer by chucking a soft ball at him .
I do n't see one boy drop the ball , and the answers are good , too .
When the school first opened in 2004 each class had two sessions of physical education a week ; it quickly it became clear that was nowhere near enough and now physical education is daily and the school has three full - time fitness instructors .
As a mother of two small sons , this sounds about right to me .
Why just boys ?
Because they need it more , says Mr. Saintsing : “ If you look at the characters sitting at the back of any classroom , or in detention , it is mostly boys . ”
But in many ways teaching boys alone is harder .
“ In mixed - sex schools girls act as diffusers .
If a boy bumps into a girl , it stops there ; if he bumps into another boy it escalates .
And boys who go off - task do n't do so quietly .
Generally , in good schools teachers plan in five - minute chunks ; here we have to plan minute by minute .
There must be no chance to boys to get off task . ”
These small boys are dressed in blazers and ties .
“ We tell them that people who do important stuff wear ties , ” says Mr Saintsing .
It strikes an off note with me — the natural corollary is that people who do n't wear ties do n't matter .
But although I 'm a natural slob , I do know when it is appropriate to dress smartly , and maybe these kids never will unless their school teaches them .
But the real function of the uniform , it seems to me , is to provide an easy , visible chance for the teachers to show who 's boss right away .
“ If they turn up without a tie , or a belt , or in the wrong shoes , there 's a phone call home , ” says Tim .
And it 's part of the determination never to let anything slide , no matter how minor .
“ You have to sweat the small stuff , or you 'll never get up that mountain . ”
On the way to JFK for my flight back to London , I think about the high - octane , perfectionist approach that seems to be necessary if poor children are to have any chance of doing as well in school as well - off ones .
Will KIPP schools be able to retain the young men and women I saw working 60 or 70 hours a week transforming lives , when they are a little older and have their own children demanding their time ?
Will TEP 's skeleton staff , however well - paid , be able to cope with its intensely needy pupils ?
Will Excellence succeed in its stated mission : to “ redefine what it means to be a man from Bedford - Stuyvesant ” ?
Perhaps — if they are ruthless about teacher quality ( these children may never recover from one year 's poor teaching ) , if they continue to be led by talented all - rounders who understand how to play local politics , who love children , who expect and accept only the highest academic standards — and if every teacher , every time , insists on the best behaviour , in the little things as well as the big ones ( in so many schools one lazy or weak teacher undermines all the others ) .
Lots of ifs , and another question , too : can the extraordinary success I 've seen this week possibly be replicated for all the millions of poor children in rich cities — both in America and Britain — who need it just as much ?

Correction : Thursday 's entry mistakenly identified the school that KIPP is due to open this fall in Newark as SHINE .
Its name is SPARK .
Apologies .

IN RECENT weeks , both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have pledged that , if elected , they will seek funding to put more police on the streets .
Echoing a promise her husband made in 1992 , Clinton told an audience in Philadelphia last month that she would add 100,000 cops to police forces around the country and cut the murder rate in major cities in half .
Obama also wants to hire more police .
He told the Chicago Sun-Times , " Additional police improves public safety .
New York has seen a huge drop in crime over the last decade , more than even other cities , and part of it is they 've got more cops than anybody else per capita . "
But almost every one of Obama 's claims is false .
First , there is no correlation between the number of police in a city and its crime rate .
Second , the crime rate has indeed fallen significantly in New York City over the past 17 years ( although it has recently started to creep up again ) , but it has not dropped faster than many other cities .
Third , New York does n't have the highest number of police per capita .
And , fourth , the number of police does n't explain the drop in crime .
The NYPD is using federal funds to form heavily armed police units to patrol subways ( Zuma )
Washington , D.C. , has more police per square foot than any other city in the world ( including New York ) , but it still has one of the highest murder rates in the country .
Dallas and San Diego have about the same number of people , but the Dallas crime rate is more than twice as high , despite the fact that it has almost 50 percent more police .
According to the sociologist Richard Moran , the police detect only 2.5 percent of crimes in progress .
If a patrol car followed the same route every day , it would encounter a crime in progress once every 14 years .
In fact , more police on the street often means more crime .
In New York , in the early 1990s , over 30 cops were arrested for theft , drug distribution , brutality and related charges , and an inquiry concluded that police corruption is " pervasive " and " from the top down . "
In New Orleans , dozens of officers have been charged with armed robbery , kidnapping , battery , bribery , extortion , rape and even murder .
Corruption in Philadelphia is so bad that the Justice Department actually filed charges against the city police .
According to Amnesty International , " [ I ] ndependent inquiries have uncovered systematic abuses in some of the country 's largest city police departments , revealing a serious nationwide problem .
In each case , the authorities had ignored longstanding and routine police brutality in high - crime districts .
Many of these cities have had histories of police brutality and corruption . "
In New York City , the number of police increased from 25,000 to 40,000 between 1990 and 1995 , and by the end of the decade , violent crime rates had fallen to a 30 - year low .
Then - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the NYPD , of course , claimed that the drop was due to the additional police , and in particular , to their policy of " zero tolerance " -- dealing harshly with minor public offenses , such as panhandling .
But a 2004 report from the National Academy of Sciences concluded that there was little evidence for such claims .
As one criminologist points out , " most [ U.S. ] cities have enjoyed comparable reductions in major crimes without any of the changes that the NYPD made .
San Diego , for example , also experienced a return to the levels of crime of the 1960s , with ... only one - third the police / population ratio , and no aggressive zero - tolerance policy . "
In New York and elsewhere , zero - tolerance policing has become an excuse to harass minority youth , the poor , the homeless and others , resulting in widespread violations in civil rights .
What really accounts for the drop in violent crime is a decline in the use of crack cocaine in the early 1990s , with a consequent reduction in deadly turf wars , coupled with economic growth in the second half of the decade , which reduced rates of youth unemployment .
Conversely , the recent increase in violence in cities such as New York , Philadelphia and Chicago has everything to do with the deteriorating state of the economy , state and local budget cuts , and the growing number of people living in poverty .
POLITICIANS LIKE Clinton and Obama like to portray themselves as defenders of the victims of crime .
But if they took this role seriously , they would be targeting the corporate and white - collar criminals whose actions are far more harmful than those committed by so - called street criminals .
Many more people are killed and injured by the negligent and reckless behavior of employers than are murdered or assaulted .
Up to 100,000 U.S. workers die each year as a result of hazardous working conditions , and another 30,000 are killed by defective or unsafe merchandise , compared to about 16,000 people who are murdered .
Similarly , the costs of white - collar crimes ( such as fraud , anti-trust violations and serious tax evasion ) are over $ 400 billion a year -- much more than the total of all street crimes .
None of this is to say that street crime is not also a serious problem , but the best way of tackling it would be massive spending on programs to reduce poverty and inequality -- and ending the war on drugs and the U.S. 's massive imprisonment binge , both of which increase the level of violent crime .
Forty years ago , in response to a militant civil rights movement and ghetto rebellions around the country , the Democratic presidential candidate , Hubert Humphrey , responded to the law - and - order rhetoric of Richard Nixon , by saying , " For every jail Mr. Nixon wants to build , I 'd like to build a house for a family .
And for every policeman he wants to hire , I 'd like to hire another good teacher . "
Today , by contrast , the Democratic candidates have borrowed the Republicans ' clothes .

So who gets to take Twitter to the buy - out prom ?
It looks like ever since Twitter gave a no to Google , Apple has been trying to catch that rebound .
TechCrunch reports , “ Apple is in late stage negotiations to buy Twitter and is hoping to announce it at WWDC in June , ” said a normally reliable source this evening , adding that the purchase price would be $ 700 million in cash .
Twitter , being the bad - asses they are , suggests that they are n’t even interested in selling .
And in all honesty , that probably makes the big shot companies want that sweet tweet all that much more .
Keep playing hard to get , Twitter , – you sly fox , you .

For some reason , msnbot / 2.0b is visiting the wrong IP addresses to retrieve robots .
txt .
In other words , it THINKS it is getting robots .
txt for www.yoursite.com, but it is really reading the robots .
txt file that is served for the default host at the IP address for www.mysite.com ( not necessarily www.mysite.com's robots .
txt ) .
Clearly , msnbot / 2.0b is using the wrong DNS lookup for its requests .
What does this mean ?
This means that msnbot / 2.0b may not obey your robots .
txt because it 's reading MINE instead .
Oh , my !
Is this serious ?
Yes .
Your search results can now be influenced by another site , either accidentally or intentionally .
Do you want msnbot to index your site ?
It will not index your site if MY robots .
txt disallows it .
Have you disallowed indexing ?
It will still index your site if MY robots .
txt allows it .
Have you asked msnbot to ignore specific directories ?
They will be indexed if msnbot is using MY robots .
txt .
I already block msnbot because it has behaved badly in the past , so why should I care ?
You should care because msnbot / 2.0b is now beginning to index site content , moving beyond simply retrieving robots .
txt .
This means that malicious sites can be set up to return intentionally misleading , obscene or spammy content for ANY msnbot request .
This could cause many undesirable consequences , including Live Search results that make it appear that your site hosts such content when it actually does n't .
It may also increase the number of page not found errors on your site , since the links may not exist there .
If you rely solely on robots .
txt to exclude msnbot , this may no longer work , because it is using someone else 's robots .
txt file instead .
How do I confirm this ?
Search your web log for requests from msnbot / 2.0b .
Do you see requests for links that do n't exist on your site ?
That 's because they exist on a different site , the one msnbot / 2.0 b THINKS it 's crawling .
If you log the requested server name , do you see unfamilar hosts ?
Those are the ones msnbot / 2.0 b THINKS it 's visiting .
This beta bot is annoying and potentially damaging in a way that is outside of the webmaster 's control .
Microsoft , please shut it down immediately and do not deploy it again until this issue is fixed .
And next time , pay attention to what it 's actually doing .
A few simple tests or packet inspections would have exposed this flaw immediately .
OUR websites are not YOUR testbeds .
If you ’ve ever thought about freelancing part - time but never done it , this post may help you .
Most people never follow through on those thoughts because they are overwhelmed and confused by the process of starting a freelance business .
The aim of this post is to provide a step - by - step guide to launching a part - time freelance business in 30 days , going from zero to taking on your first client .
The format for this challenge was inspired by the excellent 31 Days to Build a Better Blog program , which concluded recently .
I really like this approach because it offers concrete , practical steps with a measurable result .
Sometimes ‘ do this , do that ’ advice is more useful than theory .
My hope is that you can follow the steps here , putting one foot ahead of the other , and find yourself with a little freelance business at the end of the process !
The program is designed to be completed while you are working full - time , either by dedicating a couple of hours in the evening or mornings , or working on the program over the weekend .
It should be combined with daily hands - on practice in the skill you want to freelance in , particularly if you are a novice in that skill .
If you are a novice , do n’t delay the program until you feel you are ‘ good ’ enough .
The emphasis is on selling a very specific skill that you can become good at in a short period of time .
30 days practicing one hour a day is more than enough time to develop a specific service that you are good enough at to sell .
The main aim of this program is to help you learn how to monetize a skill that puts you into flow .
This will make you a happier and wealthier person !
If you ’re going to create your freelance business in 30 days , you ca n’t afford to waste any time – so let ’s get started .
Day 1
Decide on the one service you will offer .
I emphasize picking only one specific service because without freelance experience , you are probably not already highly skilled in the area you want to freelance in .
Even if you have been practicing it as a hobby for a long time , providing that skill as a service is a different challenge .
If you are wanting to freelance in web design , do n’t offer everything and the kitchen sink to begin with ( complete design + front - end code ) .
Provide PSD mockups only .
If you ’re more on the dev side of things , start with some code slicing jobs .
If you want to write , start with one specific kind of writing .
This approach will help you become skilled in the service you provide very quickly .
Since you want to be taking on your first client in 30 days , it ’s crucial that you develop your skills to an adequate level .
Once you become comfortable with providing that one service , you will naturally expand what you offer .
Day 2
Gather learning materials to help you practice your service before taking on a client .
As I mentioned in the introduction to this list , you should spend at least 1 hour per day just developing your skill .
While this should be mainly direct practice ( doing rather than reading about ) , you will need to gather materials to guide you here .
This includes articles , interviews and tutorials .
Focus mainly on developing techniques you could actually see yourself using in client work .
Day 3
Decide on a business name – are you a studio or individual ?
Then , buy the domain name and hosting .
You can freelance under your real name , a pseudonym , or a business name .
Here are some example business names I generated with this cool little thing :
Flying Dog Design
Green Ant Productions
Scarlet Zebra Interactive
Blue Cat Labs
Chestnut Rabbit Solutions
Golden Lemur Studios
Friendly Kangaroo Ltd
Evil Pencil Media
Of course , some of these are really absurd , but they do give you an idea of some common naming conventions .
Once you ’ve picked a name , it ’s time to buy the domain for that name .
If there ’s no domain available for that name , pick another one .
Your domain branding is really important .
Buy a domain name that comes with web hosting , as the next branding step is to create your portfolio .

Day 4
Design your products .
This is different from the service you are going to offer – here you decide how it is going to be packaged .
Are you going to sell blocks of time ?
Completed projects ?
What will your rates be ?
Your goals should be modest as you are only starting out , both in terms of how much you will work and how much you will charge .
For your first job , I would suggest an hourly rate between $ 20 – $ 30 .
Keep in mind that you do n’t publish these rates online and can therefore change them from client to client .
Just because you do one job at $ 20 an hour as you ’re starting out does n’t mean you ca n’t be charging $ 50 an hour a few months later .
Per -project rates are a great option down the track as they decouple the direct exchange of time for money .
I do n’t recommend them to a beginning freelancer , though .
It will be extremely difficult to come up with an accurate price estimate before you have the experience you ’d need to look at a project and quickly have a reasonable idea of how long it is going to take .
That ’s something that will only come with time and experience .
( Note that this advice does n’t necessarily apply to smaller jobs like article writing . )
Day 5
Set up a business email address and PayPal account .
While your friends and family might not mind receiving email from ronny69@hotmail.com , prospective clients might !
Create an email address linked to your new domain name .
Forward it to a free Gmail account , then under your Gmail settings , put your domain email address as your default ‘ Send Email As ’ address .
This will allow you to manage your domain email through Gmail , rather than the dubious email UIs provided by most webhosts .
A good format is @yourdomain.com .
This will make it easy to give new people email addresses at your domain if your freelance business expands in the future .
Next up you should create a PayPal account if PayPal is available in your country .
If not , try Moneybookers .
Most online freelancing is paid via PayPal and I consider it a must - have .
If you dislike the fees , you can build them into your rates .
If you already have a PayPal account , it might be a good idea to think about changing your address to something linked to your business , i.e. ‘ accounts@yourdomain.com ’ or ‘ paypal@yourdomain.com ’.
Day 6
Set up WordPress under your freelance business domain .
Every freelancer should have an online portfolio , even if it ’s very simple .
If you ’re a designer with time to spare you can probably take control of this step .
If you want a quick solution that is quite effective , download WordPress and install it under your domain name .
Day 7
Select and install a portfolio WordPress theme .
This platform will give prospective clients the means to learn more about you and your services , view your work , and contact you .
You can browse some great Premium options under $ 30 at ThemeForest .
Day 8
Write your portfolio ‘ About ’ page .
Include your current location , any relevant qualifications you have , previous work you have done in the industry and previous clients you have worked for ( do n’t worry if there are none ) .
This is particularly relevant if you ’ve been working in your field before going freelance .
Keep in mind that this should be mainly professional rather than personal , but you can include some personal info at the end if you want .
If you ’d like to include a picture , a specially taken portrait is a good option .
Day 9
Sign up at Formspring and create your ‘ Contact ’ form .
I use Formspring often in my job and I think it ’s an excellent way to create intelligent contact forms .
You can use this form to find out what kind of work the client is looking for and even what their budget is .
All this information will help you when it comes time to write your response and close the sale .
Day 10
Design your invoice template .
If you fancy yourself a designer , create an attractive template for your invoices .
As someone who spends time receiving and paying invoices , they do affect my perception of how professional the freelancer is .
If you are n’t confident in your design skills then I would create an account at Freshbooks .
They ’re my favorite free invoice management service and I ’ve used them often .
Day 11
Set up your home office space .
You ’re a freelancer now , so you need space to work .
A room dedicated just to your work is ideal , but if you do n’t have that luxury ( I know I do n’t ! ) set up a desk or table in one of the quieter rooms in your house .
A bedroom is a good option , but keep in mind that you probably wo n’t be able to get away with late nights – or possibly early mornings – if sharing with someone else !
In my experience , the cornerstones of an effective home office are a computer that works quickly , a good chair and a large monitor , or multiple monitors , for better productivity .
Day 12
Create a logo OR commission a logo OR work more on your skills .
While not every freelancer has their own logo , it ’s a fantastic addition to your branding .
You can use it in emails , watermarks , business cards , invoices , your portfolio and when presenting work to your clients .
If you do n’t want a logo or do n’t have the budget yet , work more on your skills today .
Day 13
Start work on a portfolio item – you will have 5 days to complete this .
More important than having items in your portfolio is the practice you will gain from completing this exercise .
By the end of the 30 day challenge you will have three items in your portfolio , and this is the first .
These items should involve the exact skills you will be selling to clients .
Here are some ideas for portfolio items in various industries :
Copywriting – write an original sales page for an existing product or service .
PSD to code slicing – purchase a cheap PSD template and convert it into a functioning demo site .
Writing – write an article suited to appear in the kind of publication you want to work for .
Web design – create a one - page design .
Day 14
Add a page to your portfolio describing your one service .
You should call this page ‘ Services ’ – for example , ‘ SEO Services ’ .
On this page you will describe the service you provide to the client .
Make sure to focus on benefits , not just features .
For example , your SEO services “ will funnel highly targeted traffic primed and ready to buy ” .
Day 15
Read Freelance Switch ’s guide to Getting Started as a Freelancer .
There are some great articles here that cover all aspects of getting started with freelancing in more detail .
If you have questions , you ’ll find answers here .
Day 16
Familiarize yourself with tax laws for freelancers in your country .
In my job I often receive invoices from Australian freelancers without an Australian Business Number listed .
Unknown to them , it is actually illegal for me to pay them without that 11 digit number .
Luckily it only takes a few minutes for them to apply for and receive their ABN once notified about this , but your country may have stumbling blocks of its own – and they might be a bit trickier to deal with !
Make sure you ’re aware of the tax and government requirements freelancers must comply with in your country .
A good place to start is the website of your national or state tax office .
Day 17
Announce that you are going to be taking on freelance work soon .
If you already have an audience online , whether it be blog readers , your social media network or forum buddies , let them know that you ’ll be available for freelancing soon .
This will build a little bit of buzz and anticipation .
If you ’re really lucky , you might even be able to line up your first client before you ’ve officially opened for business !
Day 18
Start work on portfolio item # 2 , add item # 1 to your portfolio .
Now that contains some work , you have a genuine portfolio .
Now we ’re going to work on beefing it up by adding a couple more items .
Item # 2 should again illustrate your one service , though approached from a different angle .
If your first sales letter was for skin cream , the second might be for a membership site , and demonstrate a different selling style .
If your first PSD to code conversion was for a WordPress blog , the next one might be for a business site .
Day 19
Perform some simple SEO on your portfolio .
Sprinkling a little SEO - dust on your portfolio can eventually help to bring a trickle of prospects to your portfolio on autopilot .
To begin with , use likely keywords in your portfolio title ( i.e. ‘ Jane Smith : Flash game designer – Melbourne , Australia ’ ) .
Try to work keyword phrases into your copy and page titles if they seem natural .
Install a WordPress SEO plug - in like the All - in - One SEO Pack .
If you want to learn more , read SEOmoz ’s Beginner ’s Guide to Search Engine Optimization .
Day 20
Make your portfolio public ( link it up everywhere ) .
It ’s time to debut yourself to the world ( very quietly ) .
Google ca n’t know about your portfolio if it can’t find it , so you need to leave a trail .
You give Google that trail by linking to your portfolio wherever you can .
Start by linking to it on every online property you have ownership over – blogs , Facebook pages , forum signatures , email signatures , Twitter profiles , Flickr profiles , etc .
Day 21
Create free portfolios and profiles wherever you can .
Yes , you already have a portfolio , but you want to get your work out to as many people as possible .
Some prospective clients may never know the right keywords to find your site , but they might browse Carbonmade or Linked In instead .
Day 22
Sign up to job boards relevant to your industry and subscribe to their RSS feeds .
The Monster List of Freelancing Job Sites is your roadmap here .
You do n’t need to apply for any jobs today – your only task is to gather a ‘ watch list ’ of job boards and sites .
Browse through some of the jobs available to get an idea of what ’s out there , but do n’t apply for anything yet .
Day 23
Start working on portfolio item # 3 , add item # 2 to your portfolio .
Another portfolio item done and dusted – well done !
It ’s now time to move on to item # 3 , your final item in the 30 day challenge .
Once again , show your ‘ one service ’ in a different shade .
This time , create the item as if you were working for the type of client you most want to work for .
If you ’d love to write sales pages for high - end internet marketing products , make that item # 3 .
If you ’d love to get work as a live show photographer , go out and photograph a gig in your area .
The type of items in your portfolio will affect the kind of work you get .
I think this quote from freelance designer Barton Damer illustrates this well :
“ A couple years ago , I began only posting projects I love .
I pulled down logos , brochures , etc. off my portfolio and only posted digital art .
The result , people started contacting me for digital art ! ” ( Source )
Day 24
Announce that you are now available for freelance work .
Most people prefer to hire someone they know .
They could spend 30 minutes searching online and probably find somebody more talented than you are ( there ’s always someone more talented ! ) , but people place a lot of value in feeling they can trust the person they ’re working with .
That ’s why your existing network and audience is an excellent place to find work .
Post about it on your blog , tweet about it , update your Facebook status .
Let the world know that you ’re ready to work !
Day 25
Apply to 10 jobs on various job boards .
Over the last few days you ’ve hopefully been keeping tabs on your jobs ‘ watch list ’ .
You may have earmarked a few jobs that looked good to you .
Now is the time to really take the plunge and start applying for work .
I have advertised for freelancers before and I speak from experience when I say that by following the instructions in the job ad very carefully you will launch yourself into the top 5 % of applicants .
Seriously !
A friend of mine recently applied for ( and won ) a job in web development .
The instructions in the job ad stated that the subject line of the application email had to contain the word ‘ Elephants ’ .
Though a little confused by this request , he complied .
Later on after winning the job he learned that although the company had received close to 100 applications , only 7 of them contained the word ‘ Elephants ’ in the subject line .
The company did not even open the other 93 emails .
For them , the ‘ Elephant ’ instruction was a way to test the applicant ’s attention to detail .
As a final note , make sure to only apply to jobs that match your ‘ one service ’ .
If you ca n’t find 10 , do n’t broaden your scope just to make up the number .
If you end up applying for and winning a job that requires skills you do n’t have , you may also end up delivering a sub- standard end product to the client .
Remember : you want this job to be something you can add to your portfolio !
Day 26
Email 10 prospective clients .
Erm … did n’t you just do that ?
Yes , but this kind of emailing is different .
Here you are offering your services to people who do n’t know they need them yet .
If you ’re a PSD to code slicer , look for the portfolio of a web developer who states that they are not taking on new work at the moment .
This means they ’re really busy .
Send them an email presenting yourself as someone trustworthy to outsource to and help them get through more clients .
( Note : this works in just about any industry , not just design . )
Next , look for people who might need your skills for other reasons .
If you ’re a freelancer blogger and you know a good blog that pays for content , email the owner and offer your services .
If you ’re a copywriter and find a lackluster sales page , offer to create something better .
If you find a website that ’s poorly coded , offer to shore it up with impeccably valid and clever code .
Keep in mind , though , that when presenting your services as a ‘ better ’ option you are often talking to creator of the original .
If something looks DIY , it probably is .
Rather than criticizing the original , point out the virtues of a professional service .
Day 27
Exchange your skills for promotion .
Money is not the only currency a freelancer earns .
They also earn promotion , referrals and reputation .
Today your goal is to trade your skill for promotion and exposure .
Pitch a guest - post to one of your favorite blogs .
Offer to create a logo for a popular website that does n’t have one yet .
If there are errors in their web design , offer to fix them .
The key here is not to do something for free and hope that you get something in return .
Negotiate this exchange like you would if you were being paid in cash .
Outline specifically what you want in return .
Do you want to be mentioned in a site update ?
Do you want a testimonial ?
Do you want a post written about you ?
Do you want a banner on the site for a set period of time ?
You ’re providing the client with something of value , so you should expect to receive something of equal value in return .
It ’s essential that this arrangement is made before you do any work at all .
This guarantees you wo n’t waste your time and that you wo n’t spring any surprises on a client who thought they were getting free work without any strings attached !
Day 28
Create a Twitter account for your business .
If you already have a Twitter account , consider whether it is consistent with your business branding .
If not , you might want to consider creating a separate business Twitter account .
The point of this is to get your clients to follow you .
This is , in my opinion , the best possible way to stay in the minds of previous clients and encourage repeat work .
Some freelancers are so good at generating repeat work that they do n’t even need to look for new clients !
If you begin working towards this goal from the beginning you will give yourself a useful head - start .
If you create a Twitter account for your freelance business , make sure the visual branding is consistent with your portfolio .
You need consistency to create a ‘ sticky ’ brand that clients remember .
Here is a quick introduction to Twitter for freelancers .
Day 29
Ask 5 people for a testimonial .
Testimonials are solid gold to a freelancer , yet most of us do n’t know it .
Consider that more than talent , more than cheap rates , more than a slick portfolio design , prospects are looking for someone they can trust .
Your portfolio items help them trust that you do good work .
Your client list helps them trust that you are professional .
Your testimonials help them trust that you are good to work with and deliver what you ’re paid for .
Even though you do n’t have clients yet , you can still have testimonials .
A testimonial is , at heart , a statement vouching for you .
Clients are not the only people who can provide these .
If you ’re a designer , get a testimonial from someone who thinks your work is great .
If you ’re a blogger , get a testimonial from a reader who thinks you ’re talented .
And finally , something anyone should be able to do : get a testimonial from a friend who thinks you ’re a good , kind , trustworthy person .
If you feel uneasy asking for a testimonial , look through comments , tweets and emails about you .
When people say nice things , that ’s an instant testimonial you can use .
Day 30
Add portfolio item # 3 to your portfolio , then buy yourself a home office gift for completing 30 days to become a freelancer !
Your portfolio now contains 3 items – not bad at all !
You ’ve been working hard these last 30 days .
Whether you have found a client yet or not , you ’ve set up your own freelance business , and that ’s an achievement .
To celebrate , buy yourself an upgrade to your home office – something you will use to improve your business .
Whether it ’s a 30 ″ screen or a nice packet of ballpoint pens will depend on your budget , of course …
If you have n’t won a job yet , do n’t worry .
Your first job is always the hardest to land , and the process will get easier over time .
Keep applying to any job that looks good , building your skills and your portfolio .
Eventually your tenacity will be rewarded .
From Moonlighting to Daylighting
While you ’ll begin doing 5 – 10 hours of freelance work a week , plugging away at it on evenings and weekends , you may eventually decide that you ’d like to make freelancing your primary source of income .
While much has been said on transitioning from part - time to full - time work , I ca n’t stress enough the importance of a financial safety net .
Ideally you should use the extra income gained from part - time freelancing to build the cushion you ’ll need when you go 100 % solo .
Having said that , most freelancers wo n’t make the jump until they are consistently turning down good quality job offers that they do n’t have the time to complete while moonlighting .
Chances are you wo n’t need to rely on your safety net , but it ’s still an essential .
Taking it to the Next Level
What I ’ve outlined here is really the most basic kind of freelance business .
It ’s effective and can be very lucrative , but there is still more you can do .
I ’ve not had the space to touch on more advanced SEO strategies , creating a launch process for your services , using a blog to funnel clients into your business , building a referral program , becoming an industry leader to charge premium rates , and other advanced business strategies .
I know many Skelliewag readers are just getting started , so I do n’t think it ’s appropriate to post these high - level strategies on the blog .
Instead , I ’ll put them in the newsletter I mentioned in the ‘ flow ’ post .
Do n’t worry – it ’s getting closer to being ready every day !
Whenever I tell a new person I ’ve met that I ’ve recently had a memoir published , the response is , invariably , “ You would n’t believe my story .
I should write a book , too . ”
And my response to them is , invariably , “ Then , why do n’t you ? ”
The gap between having the desire to write a book and actually sitting down to write one is quite large , but with some effort , it can be bridged .
Start Writing
The first thing you need to ask yourself is what is actually stopping you from sitting down at the computer .
Most people procrastinate because of fear of failure .
If you never do anything then no one can say that you did it poorly .
Most procrastinators are their own worst critics .
Putting off doing something that they have always wanted to do is their way of avoiding their own perfectionism and convincing themselves that they could have excelled if only they had the ( fill in the blank ) to write .
When it comes to writing , the first thing you have to do to stop procrastinating is to challenge the assumption that what you write needs to be perfect .
Even bestselling and award - winning authors are never satisfied with the first drafts of their manuscripts .
A professional author can write multiple versions of his or her book before ever letting anyone read it .
The best way to approach this is to just sit down and spit out whatever comes into your mind .
There ’s time for analyzing and revising later , and you can do it as much as you want before ever sending your baby out to be critiqued .
The important thing is to just get your ideas down on paper or on the screen .
If you ’ve decided to write fiction , chances are you ’ll need to do some research , and you can motivate yourself to begin the project by going to the library to do some investigation .
There ’s nothing like learning about a new world for stimulating the imagination .
Make the project fun by going to the library with a friend or family member who is also doing research for their own undertaking .
And share what you have learned with others who can give you ideas and suggestions for making your work stronger and more appealing .
Another helpful approach is to break your manuscript down into manageable chunks , rather than putting yourself under pressure to write an entire book .
Divide your manuscript into chapters and set yourself short term goals for completing them .
Writing a book becomes much less daunting when you approach it incrementally .
Perhaps you can start by writing an outline or basic synopsis of your plot .
That way , you ’ll have a road map to guide you as you write .
Finding the Time To Write
Many people say they ca n’t write their manuscript because they have other obligations and just ca n’t find the time .
I remember reading once that when John Grisham wrote his first novel , A Time to Kill , he was still working as a lawyer and wrote one page a night for a year until he had finished his book .
The point is , if you really want to write , you can find the time .
If you ’ve got a family , you can talk to them about giving you a certain period each day when you can not be disturbed .
A supportive family will understand .
Many people also believe that they need the optimal conditions in which to work , and that absent these conditions , they just ca n’t produce .
This is another faulty assumption .
No less an author than the late Pulitzer - Prize winning John Kennedy Toole wrote his book , A Confederacy of Dunces , in his bedroom in longhand on a legal pad .
You do not have to be in the perfect surroundings to write a book .
And if you do have a favorite place to write , there ’s no reason you ca n’t make yourself as comfortable as possible by arranging your workspace to please yourself .
Final Thoughts on Writing a Book
Do n’t get me wrong ; writing a book is no easy proposition .
In fact , I once read on a publishing Web site that for every thousand people who aspire to write a book , one of them actually does it .
But just think how great you ’ll feel about yourself once you have a completed manuscript .
You can be that one person , so start writing now !
Is writing a book one of your goals ?
Have you started writing it ?
If no , why not ?

( CNN ) --
Five people were killed Thursday after a man tried to attack the Dutch royal family during a Queen 's Day celebration by crashing his car near the royal family 's bus , Dutch police said .
A car is pictured after crashing into the crowd waiting for the visit of the royal family in Apeldoorn .

Authorities are not releasing the name of the man , but said they have charged him with with trying to attack the royal family .
Twelve people were injured in the incident in the Dutch town of Apeldoorn , about 45 miles east of Amsterdam , police spokeswoman Esther Naber told CNN .
Crowds had lined the streets to see Queen Beatrix and her family ride by in an open - top bus during the Netherlands ' annual holiday .
As the bus moved along , a black hatchback zoomed past it .
The crowds were behind barriers off the road , but security officials and journalists , including many cameramen , were in the road as the car went by .
The car crashed into the low metal railing around a column on the side of the road .
The vehicle appeared heavily damaged even before the crash , but the reason for that was unclear .
There was no one other than the driver in the car at the time , Naber said .
Members of the royal family saw the crash and gasped , then quickly sat down as the bus continued driving .
The driver is in the hospital , badly injured , Naber said .
He is among the five seriously hurt -- three men and two women .
Queen 's Day is a national holiday in the Netherlands , the Netherlands Antilles , and Aruba .
The tradition started in 1885 and celebrates the birthday of the queen .
Although Queen Beatrix 's birthday is January 31 , she officially celebrates her birthday April 30 , according to the Dutch government .
Queen 's
Day is known for its free market all over the country , where anybody is allowed to sell things in the streets .
Other activities include children 's games and musical performances .

The day is marked with the color orange all over the country as a reference to the colors of the royal family , who come from the House of Orange - Nassau .
Sugar And Spice , Why Are Boys Not Nice ?
According to a 19th century nursery rhyme , the biological distinctions between males and females are thus :
What are little boys made of ?
What are little boys made of ?
Frogs and snails
And puppy - dogs ' tails ,
That 's what little boys are made of .
What are little girls made of ?
What are little girls made of ?
Sugar and spice
And all things nice ,
That 's what little girls are made of .
This was pre-Mendel but we bet he agreed .
Boys seem to really get cheated on cute rhymes about gender differences .
But what came first , the rhyme or the differences ?
A new longitudinal study by researchers at The Pennsylvania State University , the University of Hawaii at Manoa , and Purdue University published in the March / April 2009 issue of Child Development says that sex - typed characteristics develop differently in girls and boys .
The researchers looked at first - and second - born siblings from nearly 200 mostly White , middle - class American families .
They collected information through home interviews conducted over seven years , activity diaries provided by the children , and saliva samples that measured the children 's testosterone levels .
Not surprisingly , girls and boys differed in their sex - typed personality qualities and their sex - typed activity interests in early adolescence , with girls showing higher levels of expressive traits ( such as kindness and sensitivity ) and interest in " feminine " activities ( such as the arts and reading ) , and boys showing higher levels of instrumental traits ( such as independence and adventurousness ) and interest in " masculine " activities ( such as sports and math ) .
Girls ' stereotypically feminine , expressive traits did n't change over time .
In contrast , boys ' sensitivity and warmth declined substantially across middle childhood but increased in later adolescence so that by about age 19 , boys reported about the same levels of sensitivity and warmth as girls .
For stereotypically masculine traits such as independence and adventurousness , girls showed increases only in middle childhood , but in boys , these traits rose across adolescence .
This pattern meant that by the end of high school , boys had many more of these characteristics than girls .
The study also found that changes in girls ' and boys ' personality traits and interests were related to how they spent their time .
In general , girls who spent time with other females developed female personality characteristics , and boys who pursued activities with other males developed male characteristics .
Time with female peers was the exception : Boys and girls who spent time with friends who were girls increased in independence and adventurousness .
The research also found that interests and traits developed differently in first - born children than in children born second .
For example , second - born children showed increases in traits like adventurousness and independence across adolescence , whereas in firstborns , these traits did not change much over time .
These findings are consistent with the idea that first - borns conform more , while second - borns are more likely to rebel .
Finally , children who showed faster rates of increase in the hormone testosterone in early adolescence were n't as affected by social influences on their personality development .
The study was funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
We invited Get Ahead readers to share tips on How not to be attacked in Australia .
Here we present responses from readers who studied in Australia .

I have been living in Melbourne for the last six years and I cannot recollect an instance where I had a problem in general .
Basic things would help you out in this situation :
Gaurav
Melbourne has seen a major jump in the street violence in past couple of years especially at night .
I came here as a student and have been living in Melbourne from past six years now .
Most culprits are very young ( teenagers ) as they know they can get away with the relaxed laws against minors and these attacks usually involve alcohol and / or drugs .
Here are some tips according to my experience could help one in avoiding these type of attacks :
1. After 7 pm , always travel in the first compartment of the train .
2 . When walking to work or home , make sure you turn off your ipod as you can easily get distracted .
3 . Stay alert and keep an eye if someone is walking behind you .
4 . If you see a group of guys walking towards you , change the side of the road or direction .
5 . Never react to any racial comment you hear .
6 . Never walk and talk on the phone at the same time on a lonely road .
7 . Make sure you have Emergency number ' 000 ' on speed dial .
8 . Never feel shy to seek help and shout incase you feel any kind of danger .
9 . Try not to work on night shifts as many students work late night especially in Indian restaurants .
10 .
Always take a road that is well lit and have some traffic even if it 's not shortest way home .
11 . If you see or experience any attack , make sure you lodge a police complaint as most of these incidents never get reported .

These are just personal views and not aimed at hurting anyone 's sentiments .
Hope this info helps .
I have lived in Melbourne for the past 8 years .
Initially as a student and currently employed fulltime with a reputed insurance company .
I have found this to be a good country , with decent friendly people .
However , when you live outside of India you have to make an effort to understand their way of living and culture .
This will go a long way in finding common grounds and acceptance amongst locals .
Here are some pointers for students :
Try to make acquientance / friendships with people outside of Indian community .
Create a good , healthy social network including other nationalities .
This will help you improve your language / communication skills , which will go a long way living in an English - speaking Country .
Also , having other people around you will minimise chances of you being targeted .
Try not to be loud in public places particularly using our native languages .
This is seen as being rude .
Avoid very loud , lengthy conversations over mobile phones when you are using public transport .
Prior to settling down here for studies , set aside a budget for a second hand car .
Your own vehicle will help you in a big way to not only avoid travelling alone but will also help you secure a part time job very easily .
You could pick up a second hand car for Australian $ 2500 .
Whilst using public transport , listening to hindi/ tamil / telugu songs on your ipod is fantastic , but be mindful of the volume .
Do your research on the ' troubled ' suburbs prior to settling - in for your accommodation .
The cheapest suburb may not be the safest suburb .
You will be able to access ( on web ) the crime rates in different suburbs across the main capitals .
In Melbourne , avoid suburbs like Hoppers Crossing , Werribee , Frankston , Broad Meadows and Springvale .
There are suburbs with increased violence on public transport users .
Do not travel alone in trains after 9 pm .
Arrange for some form of alternate transportation or travel in groups .
Where possible take trams ( in Melbourne ) instead of trains .
Try to walk away from an ' argument ' with a group of people especially at nights .
Try not to be a hero every time .
No point in trying to make sense to people who have no intentions to listen .
If you do feel compelled to say something then respond , do not react .
Try not to walk alone or travel alone on a Friday or Saturday night .
Try to find jobs outside our norms .
Indians are generally seen as cab drivers .
Try to secure jobs outside this sector for your own experience and will help you gain valuable networks with other nationals .
Most of the time if you are caught in situations wrong place , wrong time it is just unfortunate .
But there are situations where you could avoid being in trouble if you just apply common sense .
Most Australians are good , friendly people who enjoy a bit of banter and fun .
There is racism in this country but I would n't say it is as bad as the US or UK .
No matter where you go , you will find hardcore immature , red heads !
The good thing about Australia is that most people are immigrants themselves or even second generation Aussies , so you will be able to find common grounds very easily .

I would like to share a few tips .
I am a student in New Zealand presently would like to share a few things with you .
Please bear in mind the anything can happen to anyone of us anytime , hence we have to be on guard when we are outside our comfort zone .
1. Staying away from crime suburbs or places , which you are not sure of .
These places are mostly used by drug users and majority of attackers are highly doped , sometimes they can't judge what they are doing .
Most of the times , it is intentional though .
2 . It is even possible that when you are waiting at road intersections people including girls may shout , gesture or thrown beer bottles or foodstuff at you from there cars .
My advice is to be relaxed while walking alone .
3 . Police will not do nothing unless you can identify the attackers , which is rarely possible because most of them look the same .
Noting down car numbers is a good habit as it can lead to arrest of culprits .
Since , we can not take matters in our own hand , as we are foreigners here , its better to be vigilant & report anything that may affect me or someone else .
Rajeev
I have been in Sydney for the past 3 years .
I came to Australia as a student so I do know the dangers persisting here as far as students are considered .
First and foremost my prayers are with Shravan and his family .
Hope he gets well asap .
In my past couple of years in this country , I have found the Australians quite friendly and happy natured people ; at least till they are sober .
Though Australia has just recently opened up its gates for immigrants , within a couple of years the number of immigrants almost match with the locals and in some areas they even outnumber the locals something which the Australians are not much amused about .
Things to be careful about :
1 ) The heavy inflow of Indian students has often bothered the people here .
As far as we can speak proper English they are fine .
I have seen Indian students with mostly horrible English trying to converse with the Aussies , something that absolutely irks the locals .
2 ) Conversing very loudly in native languages upsets and angers the locals .
They consider themselves to be extremely suave people .
Loud conversations on the cell phones , overly boisterous behaviour in public in native language often invite trouble .
3 ) Indian students often look for the cheapest means of accommodation , travel and food joints .
Unfortunately the cheapest places are also the most dangerous places .
So the students must always look for places , which are either average or above average areas .
We can not compromise safety for money .
4 ) Avoid living in areas , which has high number of pubs and bars in the locality .
If noticed properly all the incidents happen when the locals are high with booze or drugs .
5 ) If you want to hang out in a pub , try to leave the place before 11 pm .
Most of the brawls in pubs happen after 11 when people are high and they run out of cash for further drinks .
6 ) Avoid going out alone after 10 pm in areas known for drunken crime rates .
Especially in poor localities or areas filled with pubs and bars .
7 ) While travelling in trains always travel near the guard 's compartment .
Many people overlook the significance but trust me it has saved quite a few mishaps to my knowledge .
8 ) It 's good to speak and mingle with white guys .
It 's always helpful to have some white friends around as that nullifies the racism effect .
9 ) Most of the brawls in pubs happen either due to excessive drinks or do to matter relating women .
So kindly avoid both .
10 ) Store the emergency number in speed dial mode .
Always helps .
11 ) If you suspect someone try and run away from them as fast as possible .
12 ) Late night fights happen due to money and need for cigarettes .
Have $ 5 in your pocket .
If you sense trouble , drop the money before them and run away from them .
Most likely they would pick up the money and go away .
13 ) Do n't open doors for strangers especially if you feel they are drunk .
Always look through the peephole .
14 ) Avoid removing your phones or ipods out when walking alone in dark and dangerous areas .
15 ) If danger is imminent run and pull the door handles of all the cars nearby .
All the cars in Australia have security alarm .
The pulling of the car handles triggers the alarm and its alerts the neighbourhood thus dissuading the attacker .
I hope the Australian police take adequate measures to reduce such attacks .
The Indian government must put more pressure on the Australian counterpart for the same .

It comes to me as a real surprise that the attacks on Indian / Asian students are on the rise in Australia .
Australia is believed to be one of the world 's best and peaceful destinations for students .
I really would not be able to comment on the recent attacks without actually hearing the real story from the eyewitnesses or from the ones who were attacked .
Well , out of my / our experience from Australia for the two years that we studied there , not once did we even hear about such an event or even for that matter did any local make any racial comments .
But , to add to rediff 's initiative to avoid racial attacks here are is my advice to students and residents of any foreign country .
1. Always remain friendly and converse with them in English .
Even if you are with your friends / peers who share a different / common language , please converse in English when in public places
2. Avoid noisy / alarming / public nuisances .
I mean try and avoid partying / making noises / racing / over speeding / unnecessary public nuisances
3. Respect the public property there .
Please respect the cleanliness / neatness there .
Do not try and break their generally accepted rules like throwing your wastes on the road , spilling .
4 . Also respect the rules while travelling in trains / pulic vehicles .
Do not step on the seats .
Please accommodate only two if there are only two seats ; do not accommodate 3 or 4 on a two - seater facility .
Buy your tickets on time .
Respect the ' Q ' there .
5. Respect their privacy .
All Australians love their bit of privacy ; please do not invade their freedom .
6 . Also at home , do not live the way you have lived here in India .
Things are different there .
Speak softly , do not play loud music , do not run around your house ( particularly if you live on upper floors ) , please stick to the timings for entry and exit from your residential complexes
7. Fridays and Saturdays are your party days .
Please make full use of them and enjoy as much as you can .
Respect the remaining 5 working days .
8 . Please do not get drunk and create public nuisance or inconvenience .
Hope the above would help .
Thank you rediff for the above initiative .
I am regular reader of rediff.com .
I 'm working as an engineer at Brisbane , Australia as a Permanent Resident .
I 'd like to give few tips for the newcomers or existing students in Australia :
Australia is bit different than what people think about western countries .
Here the population is less and people are a bit more centric and individualistic .
Normal Australians are really good , helpful and jolly by nature but can get offended easily by words
Students should avoid late night train journey or always find populated coaches because at night all rowdies ( drunken and drug addicts ) travel by trains
Should avoid staring at them ( this is common problem with Indian students when they stare at girls )
Inform Indian Consulate about your whereabouts .
Except Melbourne , other areas are quite safe
If you really feel unsafe , try to relocate your university specially to Queensland ( one of the safest states in Australia )
More on coming here .
Dr Sayanta Jana , Perth , Australia
Dear Editor ,
I am an Indian doctor currently working in Perth , Australia for the last four years .
It is sad to note the unfortunate events involving Indian students in Melbourne .
I have learnt from the news and from my acquaintances , that these attacks were largely unprovoked and racially instigated .
Though these claims cannot be proven probably in a court of law , yet the frequency with which Indian students have fallen victims is very worrying .
My own experience in Australia has been more or less good , with only one single incidence of a racial comment in these four years , where I retaliated back ( in words ) .
Instead of going into that detail , I tried to think with my list of things that Indian students should do or should not do in Australia .
This is a very noble endeavour by rediff.com and I hope my advice helps .
1 ) Always have a mobile in your pocket , with 000 on fast dialing .
This is the number for emergencies ( police / ambulance / fire ) and police is usually very good at reaching the spot very quickly .
2 ) Study the city where you are studying or working .
Every city , be it Melbourne , Perth or Adelaide , have suburbs which are good and suburbs which are bad and known for anti-social behaviour .
For example , in Perth , Northbridge and Mirrabooka areas are known for nighttime criminal activities .
You have to be cautious going into such suburbs , more so at night .
Avoid going there at that time if you can .
3 ) Always be a bit confident when you walk or roam about at night .
From my experience , Aussie street urchins , usually take upper hand if they realise you are frightened .
If you stay confident , they will usually make a comment , but will run off or stay away after that .
4 ) If you have to run an errand at night , at a shop , say a petrol pump , make sure you know the rules , in times of emergency such as when you are under attack from a local group .
It is always better to listen to their request when you are cornered at nighttime in a shop you are running .
They are usually only after a few bottles of drink or just $ 50 , to buy their next batch of drugs .
This is better any day than taking a cut from a knife or a punch on your nose .
5 ) Try to stay away from pubs in bad suburbs , as it sometimes gets nasty , and they may target you in a crowd , just due to your skin colour .
Though racism is subtle in workplace , it is more pronounced in an area with lots alcohol and girls such as pubs and discs .
I am not telling you , not to go to pubs or discs , if you want to go , fine , just take a few friends with you .
Better not to venture alone .
6 ) If you are cornered at night in a dark alley , just give $ 50 to them from your wallet and get away while you can .
One more thing , do not carry too much cash on yourself .
In Australia , you do n't need to carry loads of cash because the whole country runs on EFTPOS .
7 ) Keep in good touch with local Indian Associations , Community Societies such as Bengali Association , Gujarati Association , Punjabi Association and so on .
They will help you if you are in trouble , big time .
8 ) Keep a decent friends circle .
And when you are a newcomer , make sure you keep right group of friends and not necessarily individuals who are anti-socials or drug addicts .
Keep a close circle of good friends , on whom you can rely upon .
9 ) Be careful when and how you retaliate .
It is alright if you are protecting yourself and inflict somebody a blow in self defense .
But make sure , you do n't make the first move .
In Australia , even a thief or anti-social criminal can take you to court .
Anyone can afford a public lawyer and sue you and get you prosecuted .
So you have to be careful in your actions and make sure you do n't give the first blow .
Always be confident .
Australia is a nice , beautiful place , but you have to be a bit tactful in you daily life , if you would like to survive and not face a racial slur .
Navin Chandra Nigam
Below is my experience .
It is very sad to see the attacks on Indian students .
I lived in Melbourne for a short stay and realised that avoidance is the best medicine .
The local young generation works on weekly wages and the amount they get on Friday spend on booze and clubs .
I have seen them go berserk on Friday and Saturday night and damaging even the national property leave alone attacking Indians .
The best way to avoid is to stay away during these timings and stay put in hotel or your room .
In groups they are mighty and do n't think twice to hit anyone since they are not in control due to alcohol influence .
We have seen this many times happening and learnt a lesson to not to go out during that time or if necessary go along with a local which is safest .
Hope this is helpful to our country people staying abroad .
Happy living and take care .
I studied in Melbourne at the Victoria University of Technology in the year 2000 - 2001 .
Some tips :
1. Avoid eye contact with people who are hanging out in a group .
2 . Do n't get curious about things and start asking questions to strangers
3 . Do n't stare at women .
4 . Do n't retort back if some one is pulling your leg just smile and shrug it off .
5 . Avoid noisy parties in your house
6. Avoid staying in cheap rental neighbourhoods .
If possible , opt for a smaller flat in a higher paying rental accommodation .
7 . Do n't get argumentative with strangers about which cricket team or player is better .
Note : I had to literally beg to get a decent rental accommodation as the landlord said that he felt Indians were dirty and they would spoil his house .
A stranger who felt I was looking at him in a sexual manner bullied me .

I am both puzzled and anguished at the increasing number of attacks on Indian students in Australia .
As an alumni I can't recollect any violent incidents during my time in Australia .
I believe the below are a few tips that may help Indian international students from being targetted .
1 . Try to blend in well with local culture : dressing , language , mannerisms etc .
Do not invite attention in public such as talking loudly in Indian languages .
When in Rome , do as the Romans do !
2 . Mingle in multicultural groups so that it does n't come across as an ethnic Indian group , Chinese group and so on .
3 . Avoid going out late at night , visiting poorly lit shady areas , empty roads or boarding empty train coaches at odd hours .
This is common sense , almost a grandmother advice applicable anywhere .
Some Indian students do tend to work late shifts as part of their work ( part time jobs etc ) .
One has to make a call on what is more important : a few extra dollars or personal safety .
4. Refrain from renting out accommodations in places or suburbs far from campus that are not safe .
One may save on rent but it is safer to stay in a college accommodation , a hostel or a home stay nearby campus .
5 . Finally , this works for me : learn self - defense .
Apart from the self - confidence part , it makes one more aware of the surroundings .
I spent six years in Australia and studied at Melbourne University .
Please find my gyaan below .
Indian students have this habit of loudly speaking in vernacular languages in public places which turns off a lot of people -- you will always find an Indian guy talking loudly in Hindi on the train .
When in public places speak the local language .
Try to make friends with the local community so Indians are not perceived as people who stick to their own group .
Avoid late night clubs unless in the company of a group of friends and have transportation arranged .
Avoid living / visiting dodgy suburbs -- Indians have this habit of living in poorer suburbs which is infested with drug addicts / anti-socials .
Other suburbs may be a little expensive to live , but are much safer and people are more friendly .
Avoid late night trains usually frequented by alcoholics / homeless / beggars / drug addicts .

I am here in Melbourne and have heard / seen these things .
The best way for students is to focus on your study and avoid the followings :
Do n't talk loudly on phones / to your colleagues in native languages as here loud mean aggression ... people do n't like it
Don 's show off your valuable stuff .
Do n't carry valuables if you really do n't need it .
Avoid going alone in nights
If you think you are in middle of hooligans , then calmly move off .
Do n't argue with them .
In worst condition do n't show that you are scared , try and talk to them , talk with their names if you get to know .
At nights , if you are travelling in train , sit right behind the train driver 's cabin .
In this recession time , things are going to happen , may become worse .
Just make yourself as safe as possible .
Rahul S ( Name changed on request )
I have been in various parts of Australia for around two years .
Three simple things that can prevent / safeguard one from fights & attacks could be :
No visiting pubs late nights or even if you are visiting , it is always good to travel in groups of six ( that 's a rough size that would scare your attackers a bit ) .
Always watch out the atmosphere three feet in front of you and behind you .
This might sound silly , but has helped me quite a bit .
Never do anything weird / serious that might attract people from other communities or make them feel awful .
This might trigger some reactions from them , verbally or physically .
Last , but not the least , THINK SMART on how to escape !

Imagine inviting all of your friends over for your birthday party .
And by friends , I mean just about everyone you knew in high school , your college friends , people from your ward (s ) , people from work , relatives , ex-boyfriends / girlfriends .
In other words , this is a BIG party .
Imagine , furthermore , that everyone is interested in what you say and what you do .
It ’s your party after all .
You ca n’t simply have a hundred private conversations .
This is a dilemma .
You likely have very different ways of interacting with your very different friends .
You ’d say some things to certain friends that you would n’t be caught dead saying to others .
Around some friends , you ’re more expressive ; around others , more reserved .
With some you ’ll chat about politics or religion ( in fact that seems to be all you do ) , but with others this is out of bounds .
And imagine all of the people that you hope do n’t talk to each other .
This , of course , is a hypothetical situation , but it probably rings true to most people on a smaller scale .
We might think we know someone , but then we see them around a different crowd of people and we ’re surprised .
Sometimes disappointed .
Enter Facebook .
And now the situation is not so hypothetical .
Well , what do you say ?
You might think you ’re awful clever with that last status update , but some of your friends are certainly thinking , “ Wow , Sue ’s a little different than I thought . ”
You might think , “ Well , this is the way I am , and if somebody does n’t like it , then that ’s their problem . ”
But this is an awfully anti-relational way to be .
Surely even the most individualist people among us act differently with different people .
So , what does all of this mean in terms of being Mormon on Facebook ?
Certainly , we can do things like say what our religion is , and we can also say we ’re a fan of this or that .
But in terms of things like status updates , shared links , etc. , it is difficult sometimes .
I ’d like to post links to posts from this blog , for example , but the reality is that many of my friends are not LDS and this site would be weird for them .
There ’s a world that I share here that , frankly , I do n’t wish to share with everyone .
So I keep it quiet and I do n’t even include my blog at all on Facebook .
Another issue : Many of my friends are “ fans ” with Thomas S. Monson , the Church , even Jesus Christ .
But this strikes me as odd .
It seems to equate my religious beliefs with my media preferences .
I would wonder what my LDS and non-LDS friends would think .
Anyway , what are your thoughts ?
How do you “ be Mormon ” on Facebook and yet also respect the differences of all of your many “ friends ” ?
I really hope this can turn into a good discussion and perhaps help to revive this ( sorry ) somewhat dead blog .
UPDATE May 19 : Be sure to look at my comment , about ten comments down , for a clarification of what I ’m trying to explore with this post .

Prompt Corrective Action Directive zerohedge
The biggest financialin Florida , $ 14 billionof Coral Gables , was told by its regulator , the Office of Thrift Supervision , to find a buyer who would raise its depleted capital to acceptable levels or risk a government .
In an ominously sounding " " , thehas essentially given the bank a 20 day ultimatum .
If Florida 's biggest bank is on the hook , at a potential maximum taxpayer cost of $ 14 billion , maybe the stress test will not be just the fluff everyone is now expecting it to be .
Then again , , with its $ 3 trillion in assets , being told to find a buyer in under three weeks , may not be the most amusing notion forand SheilaPS .
Now that Goldman is a " retail " bank , do n't they need a dpositor base ?
Anyone know the Stardust odds are on GS acquiring BankUnited in the next 2 - 3 weeks ( with a loss sharing contract with the FDIC in place of course ) ?
All ( known ) Bodies in the Solar System Larger than 200 Miles in Diameter
Update 04.02.07
31 Comments +
It 's just one of those things I 've been itching to make for a long while , frankly because I wanted to see it - a visual listing of objects in the Solar System , ordered by size .
A couple weeks ago , I started tinkering with it , today , I have something to show finally : A ( large ) image showing the 88 known objects in our Solar System that are larger than 200 miles in diameter .
When making it , the first questions were about limits - there are hundreds of thousands of asteroids , do I really want to make an image that big - would it even be useful ?
No , likely not , so where does one draw the line ?
I chose the Earth as the visual axis , placing it full - disc at 1000 pixels .
The larger planets and Sun just bleed off the page , but still give a sense of scale by the visible curve of their limbs .
And where to cut it off on the small end ?
Why 200 miles ?
Well , that 's entirely arbitrary .
It so happens that I have a fondness for Saturn 's moon Mimas ( 247 miles across ) , and 200 was the next round number down .
That simple .
Also , it captures a fair percentage of known Trans - Neptunian Objects ( 51 ) , enough to give a good idea of their place in the larger scheme of things .
After the parameters were chosen , it was a matter of digging up images where possible ( photographic or artistic ) , laying it all out and labeling it .
This was the largest photoshop image I 've ever made - around 170 layers total .
It feels good to build info visualizations like this again , I hope to do more in the near future .
Many thanks to the Wikipedia contributors who made this page :
List of solar system objects by radius , it was an excellent resource . :
Added two other versions of the same image , Metric Only - All ( known ) Bodies in the Solar System Larger than 320 Kilometers in Diameter , and No Text Labels - For those who just want to see these objects in a line .
I 'm very happy that this image has been so well - received .
( And , enough with the Uranus jokes , sheesh . )

Spinning Backfist May Be MMA KO Of The Year
Total Pro Sports – Spinning backfists do n’t always work out for the best , but when they do , they can be dangerous .
Just ask Estevan Payan , who ate a clean one from Yahir Reyes in during their fight at Bellator VI .
The shot left Payan out and earned Reyes the victory and strong consideration for the MMA knockout of the year .
The fight is rather non-eventful , as the highlights prior to the KO show , but at around the 35 second mark of the clip , as the two combatants are standing , Reyes throws the wild shot and the sound says it all .
Even the commentator is sure this will be a You Tube hit , and he was right .
Just see for yourself .

FBI Agent Crashes $ 500,000 Ferrari F50
An FBI agent in charge of safely transporting a $ 500,000 Ferrari to a warehouse has instead crashed it .
The wreck took place today in Lexington , Kentucky .
Police are blaming the accident on possible bald tires ( sure , we believe that ) .
The Ferrari was seized during a drug raid .
( Note to drug dealers :
It 's probably not a good idea to be driving around in a $ 500,000 Ferrari ) .
The FBI agent was driving around 40 mph when the wreck took place .
The Ferrari ended up crashing into several trees .
Luckily , he was not seriously injured .
The good news ?
At least the FBI agent did n't drive the Ferrari into fresh concrete :

Patria Jiménez .
Photo by Rachel Evans .
By Rachel Evans
May 21 , 2009 -- Coyacan , Mexico --
I interviewed Patria Jiménez in Coyacan ’s normally bustling markets .
The onset of the swine flu crisis had emptied the streets and enforced a stiffness into Mexico ’s normally effusive greetings tradition .
No kissing hello or shaking hands was encouraged .
Jiménez ignored swine - flu protocol and greeted me warmly .
In 1997 , Jiménez made history by being elected the first openly lesbian member of Mexico's Chamber of Deputies .
Representing an alliance that included the the Workers Revolutionary Party ( PRT ) and the Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) , Jiménez was also the first openly lesbian candidate to be elected in Latin America .
She is standing again within a coalition , Salvemos a México ( We Will Save Mexico ) , for the July 2009 federal elections .
In 1997 the PRD had won control of Mexico City , opening up significant space for left - leaning projects .
Jiménez 's election was based on decades of campaigning around lesbian , gay , feminist and Indigenous people ’s rights , and her work gathered her international recognition .
She was nominated in 2005 , along with another 11 Mexicans , for the Nobel Peace Prize , inside the Project 1000 Women for Peace .
Born in San Luis Potosí in 1957 , Jiménez ’s political activism began at high school , around the issues of lack of resources in secondary schools .
Politics and coming out
`` When I discovered I was a lesbian , I went to night events but they contained drugs and alcohol with risks and dangers .
You see , I was never in the closet ’’ , she recounted .
Jiménez left home so her parents would n’t try to take her to a psychologist or psychiatrist .
When she did leave she was campaigning in the streets , marching and proclaiming who she was .
`` The first demonstration I went to I unfurled a poster at the Iranian embassy , because they were killing women who took off their veils .
It was a big sign saying : ` Mexican Lesbians Against the Assassination of Iranian Women ’ . ’’
``I always liked to go out to lesbian and gay social events but they were ghettos , we just did n’t have other possibilities to meet .
Then in 1979 , I was invited to a meeting in Cuernavaca in Nancy Cardenas ’s house .
Nancy was an open lesbian , one of the first open lesbians in Mexico .
She was a director of theatre and she fermented the social movement , and helped us not forget how to organise . ’’
Continuing , Jiménez noted , ``I was very interested because they talked about feminist politics , about the lesbian movement .
So it was from this meeting that I began my activism , within the feminist movement and , at the same time , the gay and lesbian movement .
`` In Mexico at that time , we were organising the first gay and lesbian march , and simultaneously , actions were organised in the feminist movement .
We were organising both movements in a parallel fashion .
Then , in 1994 , at the time of the conflict with the Ejercicio Liberation National Zapatista ( ELZN ) movement , I also began to work , with them , for the human rights of Indigenous people . ’’
In 1992 Jiménez co-founded a lesbian rights organisation , El closet de Sor Juana ( The Closet of Sor Juana ) .
`` We always took the opportunity to forthrightly declare that we were lesbians protesting this or that .
Because I believe it is very important to get involved within social movements as lesbians , homosexuals and bisexuals , and to work within them , like the Indigenous movement in Mexico , for example .
That gave us presence , and made us , and them , realise that one is not alone . ''
A student of psychology at Mexico Autonomous National University ( UNAM ) , Jiménez recalled that ``the first women I spoke to at university was Jan Mariela Castro , a very well - known comrade painter who has always had a radical line and is a Marxist - Leninist .
With her , I hurled myself into , and understood , Karl Marx 's Capital .
These were my years of study , and that which I did not learn in school , I learnt in my first years of activism .
Those studies of Marx ’s theory were more interesting because they were more in accordance with reality ; they were understood in the field of action , hence more easily grasped . ’’
At this time , Jiménez reflects , `` The movement was so intense , so interesting ; every day there were things to do .
So much so , I did not finish my schooling at UNAM .
In 1982 , the Workers Revolutionary Party ( PRT ) , a Trotskyist group , was very supportive of the gay , lesbian and feminist movements and achieved electoral registration , so a committee was formed to assist the campaign for the first female presidential candidate , Daniela Rosario Piedra Ibarra .
In my opinion , the PRT was the party that helped the gay and lesbian movement the most .
Daniela the mother of a disappeared political activist , Jesús Piedra Ibarra .
Jesús was kidnapped in Monterrey in April 1975 , during the `dirty wars ’ of the 1970s ’’ , explained Jiménez .
Battles of the 1980s
`` Therefore , in 1982 , we had a committee to help Daniela stand for president .
The PRT also gave us some space for candidates taken from the gay movement -- it helped us with electoral registrations for candidates .
`` We assessed we would not necessarily win , but that we would be able to spread the ideas of the movement .
And so we had a platform from the movement to popularise .
At that time , the press was very much against us .
According to it , we were not gay candidates -- we were maricones [ butterflies – derogatory term used against homosexual men ] or things like that .
However , when we entered the political arena for the purpose of spreading these ideas , we began to change these terms within the press .
Indeed , we protested against the press in order have these terms banned ’’ , recalled Jiménez .
`` We were able to plant the idea that we are homosexual men and lesbians , not weak or inferior .
After some time , the press was less aggressive , less derogatory . ’’
`` In the beginning of the movement ’’ , emphasised Jiménez , ``there was lots of repression .
Now , as a result of the campaigns we have fought , that repression has diminished .
To march was not a crime .
There was only one gay and lesbian , transgender , bi-sexual ( LGBT ) march where there was fighting .
The police sent a battalion against us , at the march in 1983 . ’’
Historically in Mexico , there is a formal separation of church and state , but there is frequent political intervention by the Catholic Church .
Benito Juárez , the Indigenous Mexican president who served from 1858 to 1872 , strengthened the separation between church and state .
The Mexican people have been very clear about the separation of church and state .
Early battles of the LGBT movement
``Before the movement rose in the late 1970s ’’ , Jiménez remembered , ``it was difficult to leave the closet , but after the movement many more people began to be open about their sexuality .
In the middle of the 1980s in Mexico it was easier .
In general , it is easier to leave the closet , and be open about sexual identity in the Federal District – Mexico City – than in the outer provinces , but it is still difficult . ’’
`` The sexual revolutions that took place in the USA and European countries also had a positive impact in Mexico .
Within the PRT there were all the experimental books from New York , San Francisco and Europe .
Juan Hernández , a comrade in the PRT , went travelling and came back talking of the ideas and the movement in New York and other parts of the USA ’’ , recalled Jiménez .
``A big issue was segregation -- there used to be very little possibility of development of your profession , academic or otherwise , when you were out of the closet in this early period of the movement .
If you were a doctor or teacher you were not able to be out of the closet ’’ , said Jiménez .
`` There also used to be a lot of hate crimes against LGBT people -- assassinations , bodies just left in the streets and lots of violence .
The police were terrible , with lots of corruption .
There were cases where young gay and lesbian people were raped , and the police knew who was the rapist was , but would say they knew nothing .
In some cases , police would defend the perpetrator .
They would also extort gays and lesbians .
There are still cases like this today . ’’
Early demands of the gay and lesbian movement
`` The early demands of the gay and lesbian movement were the right to work , to education and to housing .
Under the labour laws , health and public housing for working couples and married couples are provided .
Of course , within this , there was no inclusion of homosexual couples .
Now there is a private contract , a privatisation of this contract .
We believe not in more or less rights for homosexuals and transgendered people , but campaign for the same rights that heterosexual couples have ’’ , Jiménez stressed .
`` In the 1980s , particularly in 1985 , there were lynchings of gay men because of AIDS .
Gay men had a strategy in fighting AIDS from 1985 - 1989 , and women and lesbians worked with gay men on this strategy .
It was very necessary .
AIDS had a grave impact on the gay and lesbian movement .
Many , many male activists and gay men died .
Many of the first wave of activists died . ’’
Party of Democratic Revolution
Explaining the role of other political parties in Mexico , Jiménez told Links , ``the Mexican Communist Party was a Stalinist party and joined the now current Party of Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) .
They were radicals during their time .
But at the time of the PRD ’s birth , which was in May 1989 , these activists were already older .
`` The PRD ’s birth was a combination of the social movements and those expelled from the capitalist Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) .
Many current PRD leaders were expelled from the PRI at this time .
So a large part of the PRD membership comes from the PRI , which also explains their conservatism ’’ , Jiménez said .
`` The PRD broke with the PRI , but conformed to power politics .
Others saw the PRD as a democratic front .
This period of the PRD 's formation and reach into Mexican politics was from 1988 to 1998 -- slightly before , and during , the rise of the Zapatistas .
In 1994 the Zapatista movement arose , and they too , were composed of Marxist - Leninists .
``Within and around the PRD was the peasant movement , workers movement , gay , lesbian and feminist movement , and the movement of petrol workers .
Within the PRD too , there was and remains a Marxist current .
As well , a LGBT and women ’s current .
However , there are limitations with the PRD
Manuel López Obrador is commonly known as Mexico 's legitimate president .
It is popularly held that Obrador was robbed of the presidency in 2006 by Mexico ’s current president , Felipe Calderón and his National Action Party ( PAN ) .
Mexico ’s people rose up against this fraud in 2006 , and organised the biggest mobilisations in the country ’s history .
`` Frankly ’’ , continued Jiménez , ``there is no PRD without Obrador .
He is crucial to the politics of Mexico .
Unfortunately , within the PRD there is no democratic participation .
However , now there is the Salvemos a México ( We will save Mexico ) coalition , which contains Obrador , the Convergencia party and the Workers Party .
This coalition is designed to support Obrador .
Obrador is not a strong feminist or Marxist but he has respect for women and homosexuals . ’’
``Marcelo Ebrard is the current PRD mayor of Mexico City / District Federal and is the PRD leader who most uses feminism within his political discussion .
He is very much in favour of women ’s rights , the rights of single women .
Under Ebrard , in November 2006 , there was an advance for homosexual couples .
In much of the press there was an explanation that the changes were about marriage and that the Federal District now permits homosexual marriage .
Which is not true ; the `social convenience ’ law is a registration program and it has limitations and problems ’’ , Jiménez explained
Success in struggle
``Before this social convenience law , within the 1st article of the constitution , there were the right of `preference ’ but no mention of `sexuality ’ .
This constitutional change was in 2001 - 2002 and is very new , but very significant ; there was also a civil code against discrimination of gay people .
But we still need to change and clean up the laws ’’ , stressed Jiménez .
``We have had success with a campaign to delete references to homosexuality within the Article 201 of the Federal Penal Code .
This was in relation to crimes of sexual practices that corrupted minors .
The campaign against Article 201 included the presentation of an ‘ Initiative of Law ’ that also dealt with pornography and prostitution involving children ; and initiated reforms at different juridical levels to stop family violence .
Another battle was to change radio , television and printing laws in order to protect the identity of the victims of sexual crimes .
``Another campaign that was very strong when I was a deputy was the ‘ Justice for Nadie ’ campaign .
A young woman , Nadia Ernestina Zepeda Molina , was condemned to jail in May 2004 .
She was charged because she resisted rape by the Public Security police .
In September 2005 , Nadia Zepeda won her liberation .
``Another issue taken up was the brutal assassination of 25 transvestite men between 1991 and 1993 .
They were executed , one by one , in the state of Chiapas .
The murders were carried out with high - powered weapons , those reserved for the exclusive use of the armed forces and the judicial police ’’ , reported Jiménez .
Running in elections , victory in 1997
``So I ran with the Workers Revolutionary Party ( PRT ) in the 1989 elections , and it was thanks to the PRT that I eventually won the position in Congress in 1997 .
I was put forward on the LGBT and feminist list for the PRT to then decide upon .
I was high up in the list because of the work I had done for the gay and lesbian movement .
I was a very public lesbian . ’’
Jiménez was part of an alliance in 1997 that included the PRT and the Party of Democratic Revolution , Convergencia and the Workers Party ( PT ) .
She ran for the PRD - PRT alliance in the 1997 elections , and won .
`` In the 1997 election , I was not discreet about my sexuality -- we campaigned with the slogan ` Safe Sex , Save Vote -- Make the Future Yours !’.
We had public meetings in a dozen different cities and I went through Mexico 's gay bars , and halls , presenting my candidacy and encouraging discussion ’’ , Jiménez explained .
To understand this victory , it is important to explain Mexico ’s electoral system .
Andrew A. Reding , in ``Election of Gay Legislator Marks Major Shift in Land of Machismo ’’ , notes that ``Before the election , the party puts out a list showing which individual members will fill the seats .
The PRD placed Jimenez twelfth on the list , making it a virtual certainty that she would hold office .
With this move , the party effectively identified itself with the struggle to win acceptance of homosexual lifestyles -- a big risk in what is an overwhelmingly Catholic , conservative society .
Yet the PRD ­­won about 36 percent of the vote in central Mexico , more than twice what it won in the last election ’’ ( http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/3.17/970819-mexico-gay.html).
In 1997 Jiménez became one of 200 ``plurinominal '' legislators in the 500 - member Chamber of Deputies .
Each party appoints certain number of such candidates to represent a several - state region , based on the percentage of the vote the party receives in the region .
To win , in Jiménez ’s case , according to Rex Wockner in ``Interview With Latin America 's First Openly Gay Congressmember ’’ , taken just after she was elected , ``the PRD needed 16 percent of the vote in the states around Mexico City to put her in office -- as she was listed at number 12 on the PRD 's proportional - representation candidate list .
To everyone 's surprise , the PRD captured about 36 percent of the vote in those states and won the mayor 's seat in Mexico City -- stunning the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , which had clung to power for 68 years amid routine allegations of electoral fraud ’’ ( see http://www.qrd.org/qrd/world/americas/mexico/interview.with.1st.openly.gay.congressmember-08.05.98).
From 1997 , Jiménez served her term in Congress , then in 2006 spent time in the Senate , substituting for senator Demetrio Sodi of Tijera .
For the coming July 2009 elections , Jiménez has been selected by Convergencia to stand on its plurinominal list for a Mexico City ( Federal District ) position .
Zapatistas
Jiménez eagerly reflected on her time in the Zapatistas .
`` From 1994 , I lived for seven years with the Zapatistas , and was involved in the campaign with Subcomandante Marcos .
There was great participation of gays , lesbians and feminists within the Zapatista movement .
My name was very connected with the Zapatista process , through the daily Mexican newspaper La Jornada .
There was a great amount of internal discussion within the Zapatistas about gay , lesbian and feminist issues .
They very publicly included bi-sexuals and homosexuals , and Subcomandante Marcos was one of the first organisers of the Zapatistas to openly include and support gays , lesbians and feminists .
Inside the Zapatistas we were n’t simply incorporated into the process in a paternalistic way .
For three years , the LGBT community participated in the great debate about elections within the Zapatistas ’’ , recalled Jiménez .
`` Then in 2006 there was massive electoral fraud .
There were millions protesting in the streets , but even still , I would consider the Zapatistas the biggest movement in Mexico since the 1990s .
In elections here in Mexico , if you have money , pesos , you can buy votes and win .
Unfortunately , in the 2006 fraudulent elections , the Zapatistas did not call for a vote for Obrador .
` Wait ’ , said Marcos .
However now , thanks to the Zapatistas , Chiapas has more health care and there have been beneficial transformations .
Regrettably , much of the time they have been silent about the fate of Mexican politics .
Therefore , by omission , they have agreed with the current trajectory ’’ , commented Jiménez .
LGBT movement today
``Currently , the gay and lesbians rights movement is building for a march on June 20 , 2009 .
A committee led by gay men organises one every year .
There are up to 50,000 people at these processions each year .
I hope soon there will be a general march and then , within that , a march for women . ’’ , Jiménez told Links .
Jiménez added , ``I am helping organise marches that take place in other states , where it is harder for LGBT people to be out of the closet .
We still need to fight for equality , for all sectors to be equal .
The LGBT activists are the ones that work very hard , in all sectors .
``Internationally , there are many advances .
Young LGBT people are not in the closet .
For maximum strength we need to have the cities full of LGBT people out of the closet .
And throughout the entire South American continent there are LGBT social movements . ’’
`` In the upcoming July 5 , 2009 , elections , I am standing as a candidate with Convergencia .
I am also involved in the Salvamos a México coalition , which includes the Workers Party ( PT ) , Convergencia and Mexico ’s legitimate president Manuel López Obrador ’’ , Jiménez reported .
`` In the future in Mexico we will win more positions electorally and be stronger in Congress .
And we will match that with sufficient strength in the streets .
Abortion is a big issue as other states are taking away this right , but in the District Federal , we have won advances .’’.
Asking Jiménez for final comments , she smiled and in a considered fashion said ``the only fight we lose is the one we abandon .
We have to force the government to provide equal treatment , stop discriminating , respect the right to health care and provide jobs for gays .
In order to exercise these rights , we have to demand them . ’’
It appears Sony is making good on the reports of three new home spaces a month .
Tomorrow , gamers and Home trolls alike will get a back stage pass to Activision ’s music juggernaut Guitar Hero .
“ Backstage with Guitar Hero ” features a center stage located in a large “ rock ” hall .
Within this space you will be able to watch trailers for upcoming Guitar Hero games as well as watch behind the scenes footage .
There will also be a VIP section blocked off with velvet rope .
As of right now it will be empty , but Activision is taking votes as to what should be in there .

ACLU tells next pres : Stop torture on day 1 RAW STORY
Published : Monday October 27 , 2008

The last eight years have not been kind to civil libertarians , and one prominent group has issued a guide book of sorts for the next president to get the country back onto the proper constitutional path .
The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday unveiled a nearly 100 page plan to dial back what it sees as the myriad abuses of the Bush administration , including torture , extraordinary rendition , warrantless wiretapping and surveillance of peaceful activists .
 This past administration has left us with a disastrous legacy of bad policy , abuse of power , and civil liberties violations ,  said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the Washington Legislative Office of the ACLU .
 The next president , whoever he is , must immediately begin the process of undoing this far - reaching assault on our nations freedoms and core values , and the ACLUs to do list provides a detailed roadmap for achieving that . 
The ACLU action plan breaks down its proposals into actions the next president should take in his first 24 hours , 100 days and year in office .
On his first day , the next president should issue an executive order unequivocally banning torture and extraordinary rendition and he should order the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison .
The ACLU outlines 10 proposals it would like to see in the first 100 days , including an end to the warrantless wiretapping President Bush authorized , a federal moratorium on the death penalty , a review of terror watch lists , an overhaul of the Department of Justice 's Civil Rights Division and a stop to the REAL ID program .
Longer term goals outlined by the group include action on network neutrality rules and eliminating discrimination against same - sex couples in adoption and Medicaid programs .
 The actions we are calling for are steps that the next president can take easily  in many cases with the stroke of a pen  but which will carry great weight in restoring our nations true place as a beacon of liberty , rights and justice in the eyes of others and ourselves ,  said Fredrickson .
 Many things the next president will need to do will be hard .
But these will be easy .
 Presidents have enormous power not only to set the legislative agenda , but also to establish policy by executive order , federal regulation , or simply by refocusing the efforts and emphases of the executive agencies ,  she continued .
 The new president must use all of these tools to restore our freedoms and move the country forward . 
THE MONTY HALL PROBLEM
Throughout the many years of Let 's Make A Deal 's popularity , mathematicians have been fascinated with the possibilities presented by the " Three Doors " ... and a mathematical urban legend has developed surrounding " The Monty Hall Problem . "
The CBS drama series NUMB3RS featured the Monty Hall Problem in the final episode of its 2004 - 2005 season .
The show 's mathematician offered his own , very definite solution to the problem involving hidden cars and goats .
The 2008 movie 21 opens with an M.I.T. math professor ( played by Kevin Spacey ) using the Monty Hall Problem to explain mathematical theories to his students .
His lecture also includes the popular " goats and cars behind three doors " example favored by many versions of the Problem .
The London FINANCIAL TIMES published a column about the Monty Hall Problem on August 16 , 2005 , declaring positively that " the answer is , indeed , yes : you should change . "
However , the columnist , John Kay , notes that " Paul Erdos , the great mathematician , reputedly died still musing on the Monty Hall problem . "
The column resulted in several letters published on the " Leaders and Letters " page of the FINANCIAL TIMES on August 18 and 22 - and two follow - up columns by Mr. Kay on August 23 ( So you think you know the odds ) and August 31 ( The Monty Hall problem - a summing up ) in which he acknowledges that he received " a large correspondence on Monty Hall . "
The controversial " problem " began when Marilyn vos Savant published a puzzle in her Parade Magazine column .
One of her readers posed the following question : “ Suppose you ’re on a game show , and you ’re given a choice of three doors : Behind one door is a car ; behind the others , goats .
You pick a door , say number 1 , and the host , who knows what ’s behind the doors , opens another door , say number .
3 , which has a goat .
He says to you , ‘ Do you want to pick door number 2 ? ’
Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors ? ” Ms. Savant , who ’s listed in the Guinness Book of World Records Hall of Fame for “ Highest IQ ” ( 228 ) , answered “ Yes . ”
Because of the estimated 10,000 letters she received in response , she published a second article on the subject .
A scholarly analysis of the letters she received was compiled by Donald Granberg , Ph.D. , in a paper entitled " The Monty Hall Dilemma : To Switch or Not to Switch . "
Ms. Savant 's book The Power of Logical Thinking is devoted to the dilemma , providing a detailed account of the history of the Monty Hall problem .
In addition to the rigorous account of the mathematical assumptions that lead to Marilyn 's solution as the correct one , the book includes Granberg 's paper as an appendix .
Due to the fervor created by Ms. Savant ’s two columns , the New York Times published a large front page article in a 1991 Sunday issue which declared : “ Her answer ... has been debated in the halls of the C.I.A. and the barracks of fighter pilots in the Persian Gulf .
It has been analyzed by mathematicians at M.I.T. and computer programmers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico .
It has been tested in classes ranging from second grade to graduate level at more than 1,000 schools across the country . ”
Mark Haddon 's 2003 best - selling novel the curious incident of the dog in the night - time includes a section in which the main character , a mathematically gifted and socially challenged teenager , discusses the Monty Hall Problem at length and presents the following equation to illustrate his conclusions :
Let the doors be called X , Y and Z . Let C x be the event that the car is behind door X and so on .
Let H x be the event that the host opens door X and so on .
Supposing that you choose door X , the possibility that you win a car if you then switch your choice is given by the following formula P ( H z ^ C y ) + P( H y ^ C z ) = P( C y ) P( H z C y ) + P( C z ) P( H y C z ) = ( 1/3 1 ) + ( 1/3 1 ) = 2/3
In 2004 , Cornelsen , a German textbook company , published a mathematics text entitled Mathematik Stochastik : Grund - und Leistungskurs / Orientierungswissen
Analytische Geometrie in which the first chapter is devoted to a discussion of the Monty Hall Problem - complete with diagrams of the goats and cars - and photos of Marilyn vos Savant and the Three Doors .
In November , 2004 , Ivan Moscovich published a book of mathematical puzzles entitled The Monty Hall Problem & Other Puzzles .
The Monty Hall Problem is addressed in several scholarly books on probability and problem solving -- including David Sirzaker 's Elementary Probability ( 2003 ) - Decisions , Decisions : The Art of Effective Decision Making ( 2002 ) by David A. Welch - Steven Krantz 's Techniques of Problem Solving ( 1996 ) - and ... Struck by Lightning : The Curious World of Probabilities ( 2006 ) by Jeffrey Rosenthal .
Rosenthal concludes that the answer to the problem is counter - intuitive :
You improve your chances of winning by twofold if you change your choice after one door has been revealed .
There 's a discussion of the Monty Hall Problem in the math textbook The Nature of Mathematics written by Karl J. Smith and published by Thomson Learning ( 2006 ) .
In The Drunkard ’s Walk ( 2008 ) Leonard Mlodinow provides readers with a guide to how the mathematical laws of randomness affect our lives .
He uses the Monty Hall Problem as an example of the " law of sample space . "
Mlodinow notes that The Monty Hall problem " has immortalized both Marilyn ( vos Savant ) and Let's Make a Deal ...
It had to come as a surprise to the show 's creators that after airing 4,500 episodes in nearly twenty - seven years , it was this question of mathematical probability that would be their principal legacy . " .

Here 's a response from Monty to a query about the " Monty Hall Problem " : May 12 , 1975 Mr. Steve Selvin
Asst. Professor of Biostatistics
University of California , Berkeley Dear Steve :
Thank you for sending me the problem from " The American Statistician . "
Although I am not a student of a statistics problems , I do know that these figures can always be used to one 's advantage , if I wished to manipulate same .
The big hole in your argument of problems is that once the first box is seen to be empty , the contestant cannot exchange his box .
So the problems still remain the same , do n't they .
. . one out of three .
Oh , and incidentally , after one is seen to be empty , his chances are no longer 50 /50 but remain what they were in the first place , one out of three .
It just seems to the contestant that one box having been eliminated , he stands a better chance .
Not so .
It was always two to one against him .
And if you ever get on my show , the rules hold fast for you -- no trading boxes after the selection .
Next time let 's play on my home grounds .
I graduated in chemistry and zoology .
You want to know your chances of surviving with our polluted air and water ?
Sincerely ,
Monty In The American Statistician , August 1975 , Vol. 29 , No. 3 , Steve Selvin quoted Monty 's letter and responded : " I could not have said it better myself . "
As promised , I ’m posting my semi- working sql parser below .
You should keep in mind that the code is still very immature and full of bugs .
One of my reasons for posting it here is that people will start playing around with it and break it in numerous ways helping me to discover the way I can improve the code .
I think I covered most of the architecture in the previous post .
One bit of code I wanted to share here is my metaprogramming function generator .
This bit of code takes in a list of conditions , and will generate a jaascript function that will test for these conditions and return a boolean value .
When my SQL parser evaluates the WHERE condition it constructs an array that looks a little bit like this :
Each member object is composed of five elements .
The first one is the name of the column , the second one is the value that is used in comparison , and the third one is the comparison symbol .
The fourth value is just a flag which indicates whether or not the parser was able to successfully generate this object .
It is needed there since malformed SQL could produce only partially generated object to be added into this array .
All new objects are generated with this flag set to false , and it is changed only after they are populated without errors .
This let ’s us spot and ignore malformed and incomplete entries .
The fifth field is the logical operator which is used to join the comparison described in the current object to the previous one .
The first element of the array will always have it ’s logic field un-initialized .
The following elements will have it set to a legal logical operator – this is enforced by the parser .
Once I have this array I pass it into this function :
function generateCondFunction ( conditions ) { var tmp = " cond = function ( row ) { if ( " ; for ( i in conditions ) { current = conditions [ i ] ; if(!current.full ) throw " Incomplete WHERE statement " ; if ( current.action == " < > " ) action = " != " ; else if ( current.action == " = " ) action = " == " ; else action = current.action ; if( current.logic != null ) { if ( current.logic == " and " ) tmp += " && " ; else tmp += " || " ; } tmp += " row [ \ " " + current.first + " \ " ] " + action + " " + current.second ; } tmp += " ) return true ; else return false ; } ; " ; eval ( tmp ) ; return cond ; }
The beauty of Javascript is that you can build a string , and then execute it as code .
This is precisely what I ’m doing here .
I use the elements from my array to build a comparison function , then evaluate it and return a function pointer .
For example , the array from the picture above will yield the following function :
function ( row ) { if ( row [ " foo " ] > 2 and row [ " bar " ] != " poo " ) return true ; else return false ; }
I take this function pointer and pass it into the table rendering function .
Then as I iterate over the elements stored in my mock db - obects I pass them through this function fitst to see if they ought to be displayed or not .
This is of course not the most efficient way of doing things , but it works .
Anyway , go check out the working demo here and let me know of weird bugs that you encounter .
Please keep in mind that a lot of stuff still does n’t work the way you would expect it .
Here is the stuff that I know is still broken :
The canonical SELECT * FROM FOO does n’t work – I have not implemented the wildcard selectors yet
If you do n’t put spaces between listed columns , the thing will break
If you do n’t put spaces in the WHERE condition , things will break .
Typing in “ foo < 2 ” works fine but “ foo < 2 ” does not
No common procedures ( like NOW ( ) and etc.. ) are implemented
Do n’t report these things .
Anything else though , will help me debugging the code .
If you want to read through the whole thing , and nitpick or criticize my questionable coding practices you can find all the code here .
Also , Chris already told me that someone already created an SQL parser in Javascript .
As far as I can tell TrimQuery is far superior to my hackish code here , so if you would want to use something like this in your project , you are probably much better off stealing code from there rather than from here .

Is it possible , as some have said , that the Taliban have mellowed since being toppled in 2001 ?
Muhammad Ibrahim Hanafi , a top Taliban commander , answered that question in an interview in March with CNN : “ Our law is still the same old law which was in place during our rule in Afghanistan . ”

The more President Karzai and his Western allies talk about reconciliation , the farther their public support will plummet .
I returned to Afghanistan in 2001 after more than two decades in America and founded a manufacturing company with the intention of using part of its profits to help young women get an education .
In the early days , the discussions at our organization ’s meetings were dominated by talk of building schools and other big plans .
Lately , however , the main topic has been the future of us women in Afghanistan under another Taliban regime .
We know that there is not , and will never be , any “ moderate Taliban . ”
Extremists and ideologues do not compromise .
The atmosphere has been made worse by the president ’s signing of a family law affecting Shiite Muslims that places restrictions on when a woman can leave her house and states the circumstances in which she is obliged to have sex with her husband .
I was part of a group of civil - society representatives who recently met with President Karzai to express our concerns about the law ; he replied that he had n’t known the full details when he signed it and promised to “ fight for us ” to have it amended .
We ’ll see .
But his later statement that “ there are no reconciliation processes ” going on with the Taliban , which seems at odds with the facts , did not inspire much hope .
The family law and other governmental efforts to appease religious extremists are having one effect that reminds me of the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of 1979 : Afghanistan is being drained of the people who would be most effective at putting it back together .
It seems as if every group of Afghans that attends training programs in the West now returns just a bit smaller .

Doctors in Mexico are beginning to get a sense of how the new H1N1 influenza behaves , and one disturbing trend there is that it can cause severe illness in a small number of healthy young people , unlike regular seasonal flu , which is mainly dangerous to the very young , the very old and those already ill .
Whether that trend is the same in the United States is n't yet known because there have been only 57 people hospitalized here with severe illness so far and health officials only have detailed information on 26 of those , says Richard Besser , acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Of those , 58 % had underlying conditions , including seven people with asthma .
The World Health Organization and other health officials held a conference call Thursday with doctors and medical workers in Mexico in which they reviewed every patient who has become severely ill there from H1N1 .
This painstaking case - by - case analysis yielded interesting results .
" We were able to differentiate two types of people at risk for severe illness , " says Sylvie Briand , acting director of WHO 's global influenza program .
One was previously healthy young people , the second was people — as is the case with seasonal flu — with underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes , tuberculosis , heart disease , cancer , Briand says .
In the healthy young people , " one important factor was that these people arrived very late to health care facilities " and therefore treatment came very late in the course of the disease , Briand says .
That could explain the severity .
Also , those cases were early ones , before the disease was fully understood .
Most deaths resulted from severe viral pneumonia .
The good news , says Briand , is that pneumonia responds to even simple , widely - available therapies such as oxygen .
In the USA , the CDC is seeing that this new flu strain seems to have a higher rates of vomiting and diarrhea associated with it than seasonal flu does .
CDC 's
Besser cautioned those who were ill " do n't think that just because you have the symptoms of a stomach flu that you don " have influenza . "
Another clue to knowing if an illness is the flu is whether it begins with a sudden onset fever of over 100.4 , which almost all H1N1 flu sufferers have had as their first symptom , according to the Pan American Health Organization .
As of Friday morning , the WHO had confirmed reports of close to 2,500 people in 25 countries ill with the H1N1 virus and 44 deaths .
In the USA , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday had confirmed a total of 1,639 cases in 43 states , with two deaths .
There continues to be no evidence that the influenza has become established outside of North America , Briand says .
Most cases outside of North America " are in returning travelers or those who have had close contact with them . "

You 've all seen by now the clip of Norah O'Donnel 's MSNBC interview with Liz Cheney featured in kat68 's recommended diary , and if by some chance you have n't , go now .
We could spend a lifetime talking about the blindness and circular logic -- if it 's even fair to call it logic -- that Liz offered up on behalf of her dad 's promotion of torture , but I have a different question .
On what planet does it make any sense for Liz Cheney to be on national television telling everyone that torture is n't torture because her daddy told her so ?
I understand that Liz Cheney worked in the Bush " administration , " but was her father really discussing what he claims today are the still - classified details of how well this program was supposedly working with the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs ?
And if not , what in the world is she doing on television talking about it as though he had ?
Really .
She came armed with all the talking points , but essentially she was there to say that it was all OK because her dad said so .
Are we going to be treated to an appearance next week regarding her views of Santa Claus and the stork story ?
Three Sins of Authors in Computer Science and Math
Most of us learn how to write technical articles by osmosis .
After reading a hundred or so papers , we unconsciously pick up the common patterns of the field and begin to imitate them .
This phenomenon is largely beneficial , but there are several truly odious habits that are almost universally and inadvertently adopted without critical evaluation .
Hence , I 've distilled below a few of my opinions on what I see in the math and computing literature , and on how you can avoid annoying me in the future .
I realize that the first priority of computer scientists and mathematicians is not literary artistry .
I am not complaining about mere bad writing ; any scientific field will have its fair share , and I 'm quite willing to accept the occasional incoherent paragraph and unlabeled axis as the price I have to pay for being more employable than a Literature major .
Rather , my complaints here are about bad writing that 's considered good .
The crimes I enumerate below are practices that are accepted or encouraged and occasionally even enforced .
Some are sins that even good authors feel obliged to commit .
All of the specific examples I give are taken from papers published in refereed conferences or journals ; most of these papers have , in my opinion , high technical merit .
Grandmothering
Massively parallel computers ( MPCs ) , characterized by their scalable architectures , are a viable platform on which to solve the so - called grand - challenge problems .
These distributed - memory systems are expandable and can achieve a proportional performance increase without changing the basic architecture .
In order to take full advantage of scalable hardware , the application software must also be scalable to exploit the increased computing capacity .
I 'm not going to give you the usual advice that you fuss and fret over your introduction until it 's perfectly attuned to the psychological motivations of every potential reader .
If everybody had time to do that , bad writing would n't be a problem .
Instead , I 'm going to offer advice that will save you time : get to the point !
The authors of the excerpt above should recognize that the primary objective of the first paragraph is to explain the purpose of their paper and thereby interest you in reading the second paragraph .
But they do n't .
They understand that an introduction is obligatory , but they do n't really know what to do with one , and they 're too timid to jump directly to the central idea of their paper - perhaps they 've never seen anyone else do that .
But , hey , all the other supercomputing papers they 've ever read start with the same paragraph , so it can't be too bad , right ?
A more subtle form of grandmothering appears in this excerpt from a linear algebra conference .
In recent years , the study of preconditioners for iterative methods for solving large linear systems of equations , arising from discretizations of stationary boundary value problems of mathematical physics , has become a major focus of numerical analysts and engineers .
...
Rather than telling the reader what the paper is about , this author begins by explaining how important and interesting his field of study is .
This is an awful ( and awfully common ) habit .
To justify your work by pointing out that it 's ``a major focus of numerical analysts and engineers '' betrays a little insecurity , and is n't a good justification anyway .
In conclusion , every column inch devoted to convincing parallel computing experts of the importance of scalability , or introducing preconditioners to multigrid gurus , is fifteen seconds brutally stolen from their lifespans .
A table of contents in a paragraph
This paper is organized as follows .
In Section 2 , we describe local transformations in k dimensions .
In Section 3 , we describe an incremental approach for constructing k- D Delaunay triangulations using local transformations .
In Section 4 , we prove that this approach always constructs a Delaunay triangulation .
In Section 5 , we describe three algorithms and a data structure based on this approach .
In Section 6 , we discuss the time complexities of the algorithms and present experimental results from our implementation of these algorithms .
Some readers , having had no better medium from which to form a sense of aesthetics , might not see why I find these shotgun summaries so atrocious .
Allow me to put forth a better alternative .
The odd thing about the paragraph quoted above is that it appears at the end of an otherwise well - written two - page introduction .
I submit that the references to each section of the paper should have been folded into the introduction , each appearing in its logical place .
The sections of the paper follow a clear logical progression ; the introduction should echo that progression , and include references to sections of the paper as appropriate .
If it is clumsy to have the introduction echo the paper precisely , it 's okay to refer to a few sections out of order .
Furthermore , each section number should be listed after its description , and not before .
The formula is ``Get them interested , then tell them where the information is . ''
Nobody on the face of the earth gives a damn what Section 5 is about .
But once you 've got them interested in the cool results , they 'll wanna know where to find them .
A sentence beginning , ``In Section 5 , we ...'' is off - putting because there 's no compelling reason to discuss Section 5 before its contents .
You should write every sentence as if they 'll toss your paper if the first half of the sentence is n't interesting .
Do n't mention your ``Conclusions '' section at all unless you want to point out something specific about it .
Your readers can find it without your help , thank you .
I shan't torture you by rewriting the author 's entire introduction , but here 's a sample paragraph , lifted from the middle of the introduction , which I 've modified ( by adding three words ) to give some idea of what I have in mind .
It still does n't sound as good as it would had the introduction been written from scratch with my suggestions in mind , but it 'll do .
We are interested in algorithms that can construct k- D Delaunay triangulations ...[ five and a half sentences omitted ] .
In this paper , we prove that local transformations can be used to construct k- D Delaunay triangulations using an incremental approach , and present algorithms in Section 5 that are k- D versions of those in [ 13 ] .
Conclusions that don't
We have proven tight bounds on the cardinality of a triangulation in terms of local feature size and the smallest angle , up to constant factors .
We have also shown that two triangulations with similar local feature size must have similar cardinality , up to a 1/α factor .
I once read a paper in which the conclusions were an almost exact copy of the introduction , changing only the tense of the verbs .
That 's unforgivable .
A lot of people have picked up the misconception that they should conclude their paper with a summary .
The dictum is , ``Tell them what you 're going to tell them , then tell them , then tell them what you told them . ''
Well , yes , yes , and no .
Conclusions should synthesize the results of your paper and separate what is significant from what is not .
Ideally , they should add new information and observations that put your results in perspective .
Here 's a simple test : if somebody reads your conclusions before reading the rest of your paper , will they fully understand them ?
If the answer is ``yes , '' there 's probably something wrong .
A good conclusion says things that become significant after the paper has been read .
A good conclusion gives perspective to sights that have n't yet been seen at the introduction .
A conclusion is about the implications of what the reader has learned .
Of course , a conclusion is also an excellent place for conjectures , wish lists , and open problems .
If you do n't have any conclusions , be honest with yourself and do n't write a ``Conclusions '' section .
You 've probably been indoctrinated with the notion that it 's bad to end a paper without conclusions .
I absolutely disagree .
But whether it's bad or not , it 's surely worse to end a paper without conclusions and yet include a section entitled ``Conclusions '' anyway .

Consultants are recommending that Scottsdale Airport allow bigger jets to preserve its status as the Valley 's premier business airport .
Wilbur Smith Associates , hired last year to prepare the airport 's first - ever Strategic Business Plan , says the airport should raise its restrictions on aircraft weight to allow newer and bigger corporate aircraft .
But the restrictions should still be set at a level , they said , to prevent large commercial - size aircraft from landing and taking off in Scottsdale .
The recommendations are part of a business plan designed to help the Scottsdale facility fight off competition from other Valley airports that want a piece of its prestigious , lucrative market of corporate aircraft .
The consultants are due to present the final part of the business plan to the Airport Advisory Commission at its meeting Wednesday night .
Wilbur Smith , a transportation consulting firm in Columbia , S.C. , previously presented three options for the airport 's future :
� Status quo , remaining focused on small to mid-size corporate aircraft .
� Allow the airport to support mid-size to large business jets , including the relatively new craft known as very light jets .
� Add niche commercial service to destinations such as Las Vegas , Los Angeles or Colorado ski resorts , or on - demand , air - taxi service .
The latest version of the plan added the fourth , recommended option , that the airport raise its weight restriction while still serving small to mid-size aircraft .
Scottsdale Airport 's runway can accommodate jets with takeoff weights of up to 100,000 pounds , but the city has restricted it to aircraft weighing no more than 75,000 pounds at takeoff .
Raising the limit would bring the airport more revenue from fuel sales and services , while helping it stay competitive , the study said .
The airport likely could accommodate the bigger jets without extra expense , it said .
The new option " appears to offer the most efficient and effective opportunities for long - term growth at Scottsdale Airport , " the consultants said .
Airport director Scott Gray said he was n't surprised by the consultants ' conclusions .
But the city must consider residents ' and business owners ' questions and comments on the airport 's future , he said .
Scottsdale Airport , which opened in 1942 as a training field for Army Air Corps pilots , has been the target of noise complaints since at least the early 1980s .
The latest noise study , a federally - funded project that took 15 months to complete , recommended in 2005 that the airport reduce flight paths over neighborhoods and step up disclosures to prospective home buyers .
Gray predicted the issue of aircraft noise will come up this time , too .
" I 'm sure citizens will be concerned about larger and noisier aircraft , " he said .
" But larger does n't mean noisier anymore . "
The aviation businesses that surround the airport have been interested for some time in serving larger aircraft , he said .
Not only would it mean more fuel sales and services to them , he said , but the larger craft could mean more tourism and corporate headquarters for Scottsdale .
The latest part of the business plan puts price tags on the various options .
Keeping the status quo would cost little but could mean long - term revenue declines , it said .
The option for large jets could require the airport to relocate taxiways , which the study called " a major undertaking " that could easily cost more than $ 80 million in property acquisition and construction costs .
The option to add commercial service would be even more expensive .
Relocating the taxiways plus upgrading the terminal building to current passenger and baggage screening standards could cost $ 100 million , the study said .
Area residents and business owners will have multiple chances to comment on the recommendations , Gray said .
The Airport Advisory Commission will discuss them again in June , and the City Council is expected to discuss them in June and again in August , he said .
The city also plans a survey on its Web site and other outreach efforts .
High - ranking Foreign Office diplomat arrested over anti-Semitic gym tirade
On bail : Diplomat Rowan Laxton is alleged to have launched an anti-Semitic tirade while on an exercise bike in a gym
A high - ranking diplomat at the Foreign Office has been arrested after allegations that he launched a foul - mouthed anti-Semitic tirade .
Middle East expert Rowan Laxton , 47 , was watching TV reports of the Israeli attack on Gaza as he used an exercise bike in a gym .
Stunned staff and gym members allegedly heard him shout : ' F ** king Israelis , f**king Jews ' .
It is alleged he also said Israeli soldiers should be ' wiped off the face of the earth ' .
His rant reportedly continued even after he was approached by other gym users .
After a complaint was made to police , Mr Laxton was arrested for inciting religious hatred through threatening words and behaviour and bailed until late next month .
The maximum penalty for inciting religious hatred is a seven - year prison term or a fine or both .
Mr Laxton , who is still working normally , is head of the South Asia Group at the Foreign Office , on a salary of around £ 70,000 .
He is responsible for all the UK 's diplomacy in that area and for briefing Foreign Secretary David Miliband , who is Jewish .
Mr Laxton has worked extensively in the Middle East - he married a Muslim woman in 2000 - and has been deputy ambassador to Afghanistan .
The case could not have come at a worse time for the Foreign Office .
Next week , Britain is hosting an international summit on combating anti-Semitism , with politicians from 35 countries .
Mr Laxton had gone to the London Business School 's gym in Regent 's Park after work on January 27 .
An onlooker said : ' I was in the gym around 9 pm and I heard this guy shouting something about " f** king Israelis " .
' This bald guy was cycling away on his machine in the middle of the exercise room .
When another guy approached him he shouted " f** king Jews , f**king Israelis " .
' The gym was pretty full and everyone looked totally shocked .
' That sort of racist language is totally unacceptable .
The gym staff called security and I think the guy was asked to leave . '
Laxton was alleged to have been watching TV reports of the Israeli attack on Gaza as he used an exercise bike in a gym when he began the tirade
Mark Gardner , deputy director of the Community Security Trust which monitors anti-Semitism , said : ' There were an unprecedented number of anti-Semitic incidents during the Gaza conflict .
' This alleged case is particularly shocking , given the position held by the civil servant in question .
' We must not allow an overseas conflict to cause racism here in Britain and especially not among civil servants .
' The Jewish community will be rightly appalled to hear of these allegations against such a senior figure .
' We hope that the appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken forthwith , as they would be if these comments had been made against any other section of society . '
A Foreign Office spokesman said : ' It is too early to comment in detail on a matter that is currently the subject of police enquiries .
But we take extremely seriously any allegation of inappropriate conduct on the part of our staff and continue to follow developments closely . '
When contacted by the Daily Mail , Mr Laxton denied his comments were anti-Jewish but refused to answer when asked if they were anti-Israeli .
The Oxford graduate joined the diplomatic service in 1993 and rose rapidly through the ranks .
He ran the British High Commission in Pakistan for three years before moving to Afghanistan in 2001 .
He stayed in Kabul for two years , then returned to London .
He was appointed head of his section last year .
Mr Laxton is believed to be separated from his wife , a banker who is working in the United Arab Emirates .
The Israel page of the Foreign Office website says : ' The Government has a shared responsibility to tackle anti-Semitism and all other forms of racism and prejudice ' .
Jose Couso was working for the Spanish TV network Telecinco
A Spanish judge has reinstated charges against three US soldiers over the death of a Spanish journalist in Iraq .
Judge Santiago Pedraz said there was new evidence to suggest that the three soldiers were responsible for the 2003 death of cameraman Jose Couso .
Mr Couso and Ukrainian cameraman Taras Protsyuk were killed after a tank shell was fired at Baghdad 's Palestine Hotel , a known base for journalists .
A US inquiry in 2004 concluded that three soldiers had done nothing wrong .
Sgt Thomas Gibson , Capt Philip Wolford and Lt Col Philip de Camp said they thought they were being shot at when they opened fire .
The National Court in Madrid dropped the murder charges against the soldiers last year , ruling there was " insufficient evidence " to continue with the trial .
But Judge Pedraz , who brought the original charges against the soldiers in 2007 , said on Thursday that there was new evidence , including reports by experts and from a former US soldier .
There were " reasonable indications to believe " that the three soldiers were responsible , he said in his ruling .
Danish director Lars von Trier ’s new film Antichrist “ has left audiences at Cannes shaken , stirred — and sharply divided , ” said Jill Lawless in the Associated Press .
Starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as a married couple who retreat to their cabin in the woods after the death of their toddler , the movie ’s “ relentless tension and almost unbearably explicit scenes of violence , including genital mutilation , ” evoked “ gasps ” and “ boos ” from some viewers , and “ titters ” and “ applause ” from others .
( watch the trailer for Antichrist )
“ There ’s always one film in the Cannes competition selection that seems calculated to outrage in the most cynical and manipulative way imaginable , ” said Wendy Ide in the London Times .
“ This year , that film is Antichrist . ”
Lars von Trier is an “ arch - provocateur . ”
It 's not the work he “ finds so cathartic , but the attention that results from the shockingly graphic mutilations in the movie ’s overwrought final act . ”
Antichrist does suggest that “ bad - boy director Lars von Trier ” may have “ finally become unhinged , ” said Peter Brunette in The Hollywood Reporter .
But the movie works well on a “ purely visual level , ” and it ’s “ teeming with grandiose if often fascinating ideas , ” such as nature being “ cruel and vicious and completely antithetical to human welfare . ”
Von Trier ’s “ most ardent fans will want to see ” Antichrist — “ and they should . ”

It ’s time we put this myth to rest — violence and mental illness share about as much in common as violence and people who happen to be men .
The key factor that determines whether someone with mental illness is at greater risk for serious violence in society is substance abuse .
Although we seek to find answers as to why people commit random acts of horrible violence , we should not focus on extraneous variables in a person , just because they ’re convenient .
Mental illness — by itself — is not the cause of violence in an individual .
And here ’s the research to prove it .
Swanson and colleagues ’ ( 1990 ) research over twenty years ago opened the door to this myth , finding that there was a link between mental illness and violence .
However , I showed back in 2007 that a followup study led by the same researcher ( Swanson et al. , 2006 ) was n’t as robust as researchers claimed .
One of the researchers on that study — Van Dorn — more recently claimed , “ most researchers have concurred that a modest but statistically significant relationship exists between violence and SMI . ”
However , this is quickly followed by a footnote , noting : “ Data from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment study showed that patients without alcohol or drug symptoms , as assessed by the MAST and DAST , were not significantly more violent than comparison group subjects without alcohol or drug symptoms . ”
In fact , I ’d argue “ most ” researchers do not believe such a relationship exists without the presence of a co-occurring substance abuse disorder , as Lurigio & Harris ( 2009 ) note in their evidence - based review on this issue .
Back in 2009 , another important study on mental illness and violence was conducted by Elbogen & Johnson ( 2009 ) .
This work found that serious mental illness was statistically unrelated to community violence unless comorbid substance abuse or dependence was involved based upon a very large community dataset called NESARC .
NESARC is a robust , two - wave survey that was conducted face - to - face with adults in the U.S. Wave 1 interviewed 43,093 people in 2001 , and Wave 2 interviewed 34,653 people as a followup from the first wave .
This is generally considered a gold - standard dataset that is representative of the U.S. population at the time .
Some researchers believe the relationship between mental illness , substance abuse , and violent behavior is more complicated than what Elbogen & Johnson found — but that “ serious mental illness ” is definitely a risk factor .
So what do you do when someone ’s research findings conflict with your existing beliefs ?
You reanalyze the data .
Three of those researchers are Van Dorn , Volavka & Johnson ( 2012 ) .
They reanalyzed the same dataset using a different set of research assumptions and analysis procedures .
Some might call this a fishing expedition .
Can you guess what this research found ?
Unsurprisingly , it again dredged up a link between serious mental illness — even without substance abuse — and violence .
But here ’s what the researchers also found as a predictive risk factor for serious violence :
Growing up in a unstable , antisocial household
Parental history of physical abuse
Parental history of neglect
Parental history of both physical abuse and neglect
Binge drinking
Stressful life events
Being male
Huh .
How come none of these factors get much media attention ?
In fact , Figure 2 , entitled “ Predicted probability of any violence between Waves 1 and 2 as a function of mental disorder , substance use disorder , and history of childhood events ” is probably the most telling and relevant to this discussion :
SMI = serious mental illness , SU = substance use , MI = mental illness
See an interesting pattern there ?
It ’s not mental illness that ’s a good predictor of violence — it ’s childhood abuse .
Childhood abuse more than doubles your risk of violence alone .
And while it shows that mental illness and substance abuse both increase this risk substantially on their own , the real multiplier is when you combine these two .
Look at the blue bars for “ SMI only ” and “ Other MI only . ”
They are equivalent to a person who has no mental illness but has suffered from child abuse or neglect .
Whether intended or not , what the researchers have clearly shown — once again — is that it ’s not mental illness alone that contributes to a greater risk of violence .
It is when mental illness is combined with substance abuse that matters .
And as their data also show , it ’s one more factor too : childhood abuse or neglect .
When you put those three factors together , you have a clinically significant risk for violence .
When you look at just one factor alone , it ’s unlikely that risk of violence is of much clinical validity ( although the data may show some statistical significance , as it does for being a man or binge drinking ) .
Conclusions
The upshot from this most recent research confirms what I ’ve been harping on now for the past decade — the relationship between mental illness and violence is not a direct one .
It is a complex one that is primarily mediated by substance use and abuse .
Take away the substance abuse and you have a weak relationship that is likely no more predictive than the person ’s age .
The latest research also demonstrates a number of risk factors we do n’t look at often enough — a turbulent childhood household , and childhood abuse and / or neglect .
Stressful life events and binge drinking also contribute to risk .
It is this profile — not a single characteristic — that suggests an increased risk factor for violence .
And unless we are careful to consider the whole picture , policy makers risk scapegoating a significant group of people .
As we will continue to reaffirm , people with mental illness are more likely to be the victims of violence , not the perpetrators of it .

They do n't know what the website does for the organization
They do n't know the terminology
They can't see the end results
There are budget and time concerns
So you 've decided it 's time for your website to be overhauled and you want to take it to the board to present it .
How do you do this in a way that ensures success ?
Board members come in various shapes and sizes and it's important to address what potential issues they would have before your presentation .
But pitching a web redesign can be tricky for a variety of reasons .
So how do you get your board on board so to speak ?
1. Understand learning styles
I always see the big picture first , before the details fall into place .
If you want to sell me something , sell me on the vision .
For others , it 's the complete opposite .
They need to understand the mechanics of it ; the nuts and bolts about how things would work .
And hard statistics to back it up .
When addressing the board , it 's important to cover as many bases as possible .
2. Explain the need for a website
Although many nonprofits have websites , not everyone understands what it does and the potential it has .
Explain succiently what your website can do in terms of retaining donors , gaining prospects and increasing awareness of your organization .
3. Avoid specific terminology
Once you do n't understand something , it 's very easy to shut down and avoid listening to the rest .
Try to make your presentation as simple as possible , for all to understand .
Even if you think everyone will know something , it 's quite likely they may not .
4. Avoid design talk
When people think of web redesign , they instantly think of the design portion .
Do n't encourage design talk or you will get members arguing about colours and layout before you are even at that stage .
5 . Be prepared
This of course is a given .
Arm yourself with statistics , not only about websites in general , but your own website and how it 's doing .
Prepare arguments for as many possible scenarios as you can think of .
6 . Lay out a plan
Make sure you have all the important questions answered .
Is the redesign happening in house or are you using a consultant ?
How much time and money will it cost to perform these changes ?
What is the rough timeline for a project like this ?
Make sure you have a solid plan to present so they can't object .
Pitching to a board can be tricky , especially on an issue like web redesign , which everyone is not familar with .
Try to be as clear and concise as possible and sell them on the benefits .
Has anyone else had successes or failures pitching web - related things to the board ?

All African Pygmies , inhabiting a large territory extending west - to - east along Central Africa , descend from a unique population who lived around 20,000 years ago , according to an international study led by researchers at the Institut Pasteur in Paris .
The research concludes that the ancestors of present - day African Pygmies and farmers separated ~ 60,000 years ago .
Pygmies are characterized by a forest - dwelling hunter - gathering lifestyle and distinctive cultural practices and physical traits ( e.g. , low stature ) .
Two groups of Pygmy populations live in the African rainforests : the " Western Pygmies " and the " Eastern Pygmies " .
The common origins of the two groups of Pygmies , separated by thousands of kilometers , have been long debated , and their relationships with neighboring farmers remained obscure .
The researchers , led by Lluis Quintana - Murci , studied the genetic profile of twelve populations of Pygmies and neighboring farmers dispersed over the African continent , using sequence data from non-coding regions of their genomes .
Using simulation - based procedures , they determined that the ancestors of Pygmy hunter - gatherers and farming populations started to diverge ~ 60,000 years ago , coinciding with a period of important human migration both within and outside Africa .
Much later , ~20,000 years ago , Western and Eastern Pygmies separated , concurrently with a period of climate change leading to large retreats of the equatorial rainforest into refugia .
The common origin of all Pygmies unmasked in this study led Etienne Patin , one of the leading authors , to conclude that " they have probably inherited their distinctive shared physical traits , such as low height , from a common ancestor , rather than by convergent adaptation to the rainforest " .
However , complete genome - wide profiles of these populations are now needed , both to characterize more precisely their demographic history and to identify genes involved in the adaptation of these populations with different lifestyles to their specific ecological habitats .
" China 's carrier has gone to sea " was the headline of one Asian newspaper .
The event -- the story implied -- marked the long - awaited operational debut of the former Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag .
In reality , the ship got underway with harbor tugs providing the power , moving the ship from a pier in the port of Dalian to a nearby dry dock , a " voyage " of about two miles .
As of this writing , no major work on the ship has been observed since she arrived at Dalian in northeastern China on 3 March 2002 .
The ship was painted a few years ago , but little other effort has gone into the unfinished giant despite periodic press claims that the carrier was being " clandestinely " completed .
While the ship was being towed to the dry dock on 27 April the Varyag was extensively photographed .
Those photos reveal much about the ship :
She rode high in the water and , with the lack of " patches " on her flight deck , it is obvious that engines had not been installed in the ship .
Her flight deck lacks arresting cables and operational markings , and her island structure is void of the aerials , electronic domes , and radar antennas that inundate aircraft carriers .
The question is : Why has the Varyag moved into a dry dock .
A number of reasons are possible for her brief voyage and dry docking .
These include :
(1) Completing the carrier -- which was laid down at the Nikolayev South shipyard as the Soviet Riga in the Ukraine in 1985 .
This would involve the complex task of installing engines and other machinery ( assuming that they are now available ) , auxiliary equipment , messing and berthing facilities , radars and other electronic equipment , etc .
(2) Carrying out general maintenance on the hulk , including cleaning her underwater hull , and taking other measures to simply preserve the Varyag until a definite decision is made concerning her eventual fate .
(3) Permitting naval architects and others to examine the ship 's underwater hull , possibly to assist in efforts to design and construct an indigenous Chinese aircraft carrier .
There can be no question but the Chinese Navy 's leadership wants to acquire aircraft carriers , primarily to provide air cover for naval operations in the South China Sea , an area of great interest to China because of offshore oil activities .
In long - range planning , the Chinese may also be considering their increasing political and economic interests in Africa and South America .
However , despite periodic press reports -- some saying that the first Chinese carrier will be completed this year -- there is still no publicly available evidence that construction of such ships has begun in China .
Indeed , even commercial satellites would have detected such efforts .
Chinese shipyards , which are producing advanced missile destroyers and nuclear - propelled submarines as well as large merchant ships , can certainly build a large aircraft carrier .
Completion of the ship -- which would take probably four years or more from the start of construction -- would have to be followed by a lengthy working up period , with extensive ship and then aircraft trials and qualifications .
Thus , with at least a year from the decision to build such a ship until actual construction would start because of the need to order components and materials , if that decision were made today the first Chinese carrier could be ready in about six or seven years .

Ireland 's most romantic man has been stripped of his crown following protests that he'd been convicted of " committing two acts which were offensive to public morals and decency " , viz ; " following women around Galway City in his car while masturbating " .
Aidan Clifford and partner Ellen Spence , who met on a skiing trip in 2007 , " beat off stiff opposition " * to secure the Irish Wedding Journal 's " Ireland ’s Most Romantic Couple " title .
According to The Clare People , the pair won a € 46,000 prize , which included " a wedding reception in the renowned Parknasilla Resort in Kerry , a designer wedding dress from either Kathy de Stafford in Dublin or Blush Bridal in Belfast and a luxury Sandals honeymoon from Tropical Places " .
However , the Irish Wedding Journal was unaware that Clifford appeared last year in Galway District Court where he admitted driving to Galway on his days off from work " specifically to follow women around in his car while fondling himself " .
According to the Evening Herald , his solicitor claimed Clifford 's lifestyle was to blame and that he was " working himself to the bone " .**
The couple currently live in Kinvara , County Galway , but Clifford works in nearby Ballyvaughan , where unimpressed residents queued up to express their outrage .
One declared the whole thing a " total disgrace " , adding : " My own grandchildren play down in Ballyvaughan all the time .
It ’s bad enough to think that this man is around , never mind putting him up on a pedestal like this . "
Another insisted there was “ a lot of animosity here about it .
Everybody is disgusted . "
The Irish Wedding Journal duly responded by withdrawing the couple 's € 46 k booty .
The magazine told the Evening Herald : " The nature of his conviction is entirely incompatible with the ethos of Ireland 's Wedding Journal and the competition and we regard his entering this competition in the first place as a breach of good faith on his part .
" With regret we have come to the decision that no prize will be awarded this year . " ®

* Yup , good work there by The Clare People .
Pints all round .

Listen to programme Click here to have your say " Something like 80 % of women in prostitution are controlled by their drug dealer , or their pimp or their trafficker , " according to former Home Office minister Fiona MacTaggart MP .
The idea that women who work in prostitution are largely in forced labour situations is one of the justifications behind a government proposal to introduce a strict liability offence of paying for sex with a woman who has been trafficked or is under the control of a pimp or her drug dealer .
It will be no defence for an accused man to say that he did n't realise that the woman had been trafficked or was " controlled for another person 's gain " .
Men accused of this crime will be charged with rape on the basis that the woman can't be deemed to have consented .
Given the underground nature of prostitution , how do researchers know the proportion of women who are controlled by others ?
Presenter Tim Harford finds out how the research is done and the reliability of the statistics .
Interviewees include Professor Julia O'Connell - Davidson of Nottingham University , Hilary Kinnell of the UK Network of Sex Work Projects and Fiona MacTaggart MP .

Maths of the Credit Crunch Catch up on all our stories about the financial crisis .
This week we continue the series .
Where was the media when we most needed it ?
Gillian
Tett of the Financial Times explains the moment she realised that nine tenths of financial activity was being largely ignored by journalists , politicians and regulators .
Until recently , media coverage of the financial markets was mainly limited to equities and mergers and acquisitions .
But the credit markets , derivative markets and the market in loans repackaged into bonds were worth far more .
The maths of bankers ' bonuses Last week , financial mathematician explained how the maths of the bankers ' bonus system might have encouraged traders to make the same mistakes rather than diversify .
Many of you have questioned the validity of his claim - but he is right and here is why .
He gave a theoretical example .
A trader enters a bank where everyone else is doing exactly the same trade and that trade has a 50 % chance of making a profit .
The trader knows of a trade that has a 75 % chance of making a profit .
But in order for the individual trader to get his bonus , two things have to happen : the bank has to make a profit and the individual trader has to make a profit .
If the trader does his good trade , the probability of him getting his bonus is the chance of his trade making a profit - ie 75 % - multiplied by the chance of the bank making a profit - ie 50 % .
His chance of getting a bonus is therefore 37.5 % .
However if he does the same as everyone else , his chance of getting a bonus is 50 % .
Some listeners asked why the trader 's chance of making a profit if he did the same trade as everyone else was not 25 % ( ie 50 % x 50 % ) .
The answer is that the 50 per cent strategy is perfectly correlated with the bank 's profitability , while the 75 per cent strategy is perfectly uncorrelated .
When the probabilities are perfectly uncorrelated , 75 % x 50 % is the right calculation to work out if the trader gets his bonus .
When the strategies are perfectly correlated , either both the trader and the bank make money , or neither the trader nor the bank make money .

CENEI , ROMANIA —
For centuries — from the Hapsburg Empire through Communist dictatorship — peasant farmers here have eked a living from hogs , driving horses along ancient pocked roads and whispering ritual prayers on butchering day .
Old customs and jobs are dying and the air itself is changing , however , transformed by an American newcomer , Smithfield Foods .
Almost unnoticed by the rest of the Continent , the agribusiness giant has moved into Eastern Europe with the force of a factory engine , assembling networks of farms , breeding pigs on the fast track , and slaughtering them for every bit of meat and muscle that can be squeezed into a sausage .
The upheaval in the hog farm belts of Poland and Romania , the two largest E.U. members in Eastern Europe , ranks among the Continent ’s biggest agricultural transformations .
It also offers a window on how a Fortune 500 company based in Virginia operates in far - flung outposts .
Smithfield has a joint venture in a Mexican hog farm located near where United Nations scientists are investigating a potential link between pigs and the new strain of influenza in humans .
With the exact origins of the virus still in doubt , Smithfield emphasizes that the disease has struck none of its hogs or employees .
Israel pressed its offensive against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip today amid sharp Red Cross criticism that it was delaying access to casualties .
A rocket salvo from Lebanon slightly wounded two people in northern Israel and briefly raised fears that Hezbollah fighters were opening a second front to relieve pressure on Gaza .
But an Israeli cabinet minister blamed Palestinian groups in Lebanon .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
US backing for an Egyptian truce proposal has increased pressure on Israel to end its Gaza war as casualties mount .
The Hamas - run health ministry in Gaza put the Palestinian death toll at 707 since the Israeli assault began on 27 December .
It said at least 3,000 people had been wounded .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she agreed with French President Nicolas Sarkozy on conditions for a ceasefire , but neither Israel nor Hamas has agreed on the details .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the government 's goal that " quiet will reign supreme " in southern Israel had not been achieved .
A decision on further military action " is still ahead of us " , his office quoted him as saying in the south .
Eleven Israelis have died in the past 13 days , eight of them soldiers , including four killed by " friendly " fire .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) said its officials and Palestinian ambulance workers had found four starving children huddled with at least 12 corpses in Gaza in a house 80 metres from an Israeli military position .
Among the dead in the house , found lying on mattresses , were the children 's mothers , the ICRC said .
In nearby houses in Gaza 's devastated Zeitoun neighbourhood , the team found another three corpses and 15 survivors , including several who were wounded , the Geneva - based agency said .

It accused Israel of delaying ambulance access to the area and said the Israeli army must have been aware of the situation but did not help the wounded , in violation of international law .
" This is a shocking incident , " said Pierre Wettach , ICRC chief for Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories .
The Israeli military said it would investigate any formal complaint against its conduct , but said it had " demonstrated its willingness to abort operations to save civilian lives and to risk injury on order to assist innocent civilians " .
In northern Israel , police said one of three rockets fired from Lebanon tore a hole in the roof of an old people 's home in the town of Nahariya , where two people were hurt .
The attack initially aroused fears that Hezbollah was behind it .
But a senior Israeli cabinet minister pointed the finger at Palestinian groups in Lebanon .
" These are isolated incidents , " Rafi Eitan said on Israel 's Channel 2 .
" We expected this . "
The army , which fought a 34 - day war with Shi'ite Hezbollah guerrillas in 2006 , responded only with a few artillery rounds .
There were no reports of casualties in Lebanon .
The commander of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon urged " maximum restraint " and the Beirut government criticised the perpetrators for violating the UN resolution that halted the 2006 war .
In the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip , Israeli air strikes and ground attacks killed seven civilians and three gunmen , medical officials said .
One Israeli soldier was killed , the army said .
The dead included two brothers aged six and 13 , who were killed when an Israeli air strike missed a group of Islamic Jihad fighters in Abassan in the southern Gaza Strip .
Four other passersby were wounded , medical workers and residents said .
In the occupied West Bank , Israeli police shot and killed a Palestinian who tried to set fire to a petrol station at a Jewish settlement , police said .
Gaza residents described an overnight bombardment east of the city as among the heaviest so far .
In the south of the strip , tanks advanced towards Khan Younis town , witnesses said .
Palestinian medics said Israeli soldiers shot a truck driver dead and wounded another as they headed through the Gaza Strip to pick up UN supplies at the Erez crossing .
There was no immediate UN comment .
The Israeli army said it was checking .
Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately trying to disrupt aid as part of propaganda efforts , charges the movement denies .
Although Israel pressed on with the offensive , it has said it accepts the " principles " of a European - Egyptian ceasefire proposal .
Washington has urged Israel to study the plan .
Israel again suspended its assault briefly today to help Gaza 's inhabitants stock up on much - needed supplies .
The army conducted a similar three - hour lull yesterday .
With both George W. Bush 's outgoing US administration and President - elect Barack Obama speaking out on the need for peace , officials said Israel sent an envoy to Cairo to discuss how the Egyptian plan might be implemented .
That could take several days .
For now , Israeli military commanders appear determined to keep up the pressure on the ground , even if the cabinet has put off a decision on a possible new phase to attack militants in Gaza 's towns and cities .
Israeli leaders face a parliamentary election in a month and will want to show the public that they have met their aims by dealing a blow to Hamas and preventing it from rearming .
Over a dozen rockets hit southern Israel today .
Hamas officials said the group was still considering the Egyptian plan , brokered with France .
European governments have offered to back Cairo 's proposal with an EU border force to stop Hamas , which took over Gaza in 2007 , from rearming via tunnels under Gaza 's border with Egypt .
The plan would also address Palestinian calls for an end to Israel 's economic blockade of the Gaza Strip .
Hamas called off a six - month ceasefire late last month , accusing Israel of breaking an agreement to open border crossings to more supplies .

Since I was I kid I 've been a fan of Dungeons and Dragons .
The Beholder has always been one of the most feared monster …
Here 's my first Beholder - Steampunk - Robot .
I plan to make bigger one , this one is only 4 cm large .

I had some code lying around which I thought I 'd share with you .
It is an adaption of a Processing algorithm by ART + COM , visualizing an elegant growing plant .
The source code has been organized in two simple classes so it might help you when learning from the tutorial on classes .
The first class , Tendril , defines a single branch in the plant .
As it grows it calculates the position of new segments by steering its current heading a bit to the left or right , hence the spiraling shape .
The second class , Plant , defines a group of tendrils .
It has some simple methods to grow and draw all the tendrils together .
size ( 600 , 600 ) from math import pi , sin , cos , radians class Tendril : def __init__ ( self , x , y , width= 15 ) : " " " A new sinewy tendril at location x and y .
Its segment width will gradually become smaller as it grows . " " " self .

v = 0 def grow ( self , distance = 3.0 , curl= 1.0 , step= 0.02 ) : " " " Tendril segment growth using fluid , spiral sine functions , taken from the ART + COM Tendrils class for Processing . " " " #
Think of a tendril having a steering compass .
#
For each new segment , the compass shifts a bit left or right .

grow ( curl= 1.0 , step= 0.02 ) plant .
draw ( )
Using the plant as a layer in Core Image
With a simple adaption we can use the plant .
path ( ) method as input for Core Image .
This way we can transform the plant shape as a layer of pixel data .
Simply add the lines of code below the image to the bottom of the script , and play around with the curl parameter a bit .
coreimage = ximport ( " coreimage " ) canvas = coreimage .
canvas ( WIDTH , HEIGHT ) layer = canvas .
append ( plant .
path ( ) , fill = color ( 1 , 0 ) , stroke = color ( 1 , 0.8 ) , strokewidth = 0.2 ) layer .
filter ( " zoomblur " , amount= 10 ) canvas .

International efforts to thwart Somali piracy would appear to be floundering .
Perhaps words from the 19th Century could offer a solution , writes the BBC News website 's world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds .
Palmerston did not hesitate to send in the gunboats
If the navies of the world need some advice on ways to stop piracy off Somalia , they could look to Lord Palmerston , British Foreign Secretary in 1841 .
" Taking a wasps ' nest ... is more effective than catching the wasps one by one , " he remarked .
Palmerston , the great advocate of gunboat diplomacy , was speaking in support of a British naval officer , Joseph Denman .
Denman had attacked and destroyed slave quarters on the West African coast and had been sued by the Spanish owners for damages .
It was British policy to try to destroy the slave trade , but this sometimes ran into legal complications .
The British attorney general , in a gem of delicate legal advice , declared the following year that he " cannot take it upon himself to advise ... that the instructions to Her Majesty 's naval officers are such as can with perfect legality be carried into execution ... " [ He ] is of the opinion that the blockading of rivers , landing and destroying buildings and carrying off of persons held in slavery ... cannot be considered as sanctioned by the law of nations . "
Denman , a hero of the anti-slave trade campaign , was eventually vindicated and the Royal Navy carried on with its anti-slavery operations .
The legal system in Kenya cannot deal with suspected pirates James Walvin notes in his book Black Ivory : " Between 1820 and 1870 the Royal Navy seized almost 1,600 ships and freed 150,000 slaves . "
With Somali piracy still threatening shipping , it sounds as if modern navies need a few Captain Joseph Denmans , or the like - minded American , Commodore Stephen Decatur .
Sent to attack the Barbary pirates off North Africa in 1815 , Decatur simply captured the flagship of the Algerian Bey [ ruler ] and forced a capitulation .
When the Bey later tried to repudiate the agreement , the British and Dutch bombarded Algiers .
No such action against the " wasps ' nests " along the Somali coast is possible today , even though the UN Security Council has authorised the use of the " necessary means " to stop pirates on the high seas and hot pursuit into Somali territorial waters .
Law of the sea
However , the resolutions that made these actions permissible ( 1838 and 1846 ) also contain restrictions .
Everything has to be done in accordance with " international law " and this is interpreted as complying with the conditions of the International Law of the Sea Convention .
This convention , in article 105 , does permit the seizure of a pirate ship , but article 110 lays down that , in order to establish that a ship is indeed a pirate vessel , the warship - and it may only be a warship - has to send a boat to the suspected ship first and ask for its papers .
This is hardly a recipe for a Denman or Decatur - type action .
Add to this legal restriction the relative lack of warships in the seas off Somalia - more than there were , but still insufficient - and the reluctance to tackle the pirates in their home bases , throw in the chaos in Somalia , where there is no effective government , and you have perfect conditions for piracy .
Even if they are caught , they are simply handed over to Kenya whose legal system is not designed to deal with them .
The German navy transported another batch of captured pirates to Kenya recently .
But nobody knows how long they will be in custody there .
And the UN Monitoring Group on Somalia issued a damning report last December in which it castigated ship owners for paying ransom .
" Exorbitant ransom payments have fuelled the growth of [ pirate ] groups , " it stated .
The report also expressed concern about " the apparent complicity in pirate networks of Puntland administration officials at all levels . "
Puntland is a self - declared autonomous region of Somalia , right at the tip of the Horn of Africa .
( Update : The French have adopted a different policy - that of trying to rescue hostages and capturing pirates , taking them back to France for trial .
This was successful until recently , when commandos stormed a yacht and in the process the yacht 's owner was killed , though his wife and young son were rescued . )
Since writing in December last year about the legal problems involved , I have had a lot of e-mails from people angry at the ineffectiveness of the measures taken so far and proposing their own solutions .
These include : Convoys .
Already done in the case of aid ships going into Kenyan and Somali ports
Arming the crews .
The crews might not want this , though in the latest case the American crew of cargo ship Maersk Alabama did fight back
Arming merchant ships with heavy guns .
Ship owners might not want to risk an engagement at sea
luring pirates into attacking apparently unarmed ships which then declared themselves as warships .
Would this be in " accordance with international law " ?
Other ideas suggested would appeal to officers Denman and Decatur .
( Update : I have had a flood of further e-mails , for which many thanks .
The plans proposed range from having submarines on stand - by to surface when needed , to ' Q - ships ' ( armed , disguised merchantmen ) , to immediate sinking , to blockades , to invasion .
The general feeling is that governments and navies are too weak .
There have been a few writers , though , who say that the real problem is in Somalia itself and that the pirates take to their trade because they cannot make a living in other ways . )

Kick - starting the hydrogen economy will require cheap ways to produce vast quantities of the gas .
But rather than building a new and costly plants , societies could modify existing gas powered stations instead , say Dutch and French chemists .
It is the latest proposal in a long line aimed at solving a problem that is the main barrier to a cleaner , low - carbon , hydrogen - fuelled future .
However , the new idea is not without its problems : critics say retrofitting gas plants would be inefficient , but agree that the hydrogen - generation hurdle will only be surmounted using existing fossil fuel technology .
Although cheaper fuel cells and other technology needed to convert hydrogen to power are fairly advanced , there is currently no way to cheaply generate the large quantities of hydrogen needed .
Gadi Rothenberg ‘s team at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands , working with colleagues at the University of Lyon 1 in Villeurbanne , France , say that because energy markets are conservative , only pragmatic solutions that use the existing fossil - fuel infrastructure are likely to succeed .

So the team has developed a catalyst it says could be placed in the combustion chamber of a methane - burning power plant which would allow it to produce hydrogen with little modification .
Coke problem
The researchers tested the cerium oxide and nickel catalyst using a mixture of methane and oxygen at 400 to 550 °C to simulate conditions in a power station .
Initially the methane burns up all of the oxygen present to generate heat .
This allows the catalyst to break down the remaining methane into solid carbon and hydrogen gas .
Two molecules of methane , containing eight hydrogen atoms between them , will yield roughly one molecule of H 2 – this gives an effective hydrogen yield of 25 to 30 per cent from the chemical process .
In a power plant , some of the heat produced could also be used to drive power generation in the usual way , claiming back lost energy and increase overall efficiency .
Tests showed that the catalyst remains active for seven hours before it becomes choked up with solid carbon .
Those coke deposits can easily be burned off to clean up the catalyst , says Jurriaan Beckers , a member of the research team .
Altering the mix of gas and air in the combustion chamber also provides a way to cut coke deposits , Beckers told New Scientist , although he adds that the researchers are unsure if they could achieve this level of control in a gas power plant .
That uncertainty prompts Andrew Harris at the University of Sydney , Australia , to question whether the new process really can be integrated efficiently into existing power plants .
Gas guzzling
Harris points out that around 95 per cent of the world ’s hydrogen is already sourced from natural gas , using fossil fuel reformers that react methane with steam to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide .
That process – usually 65 to 75 per cent efficient – should be sufficient to plug the gap until renewable sources of hydrogen become available , he says .
But Aldo Steinfeld at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , Zürich , is unconvinced .
Fuel must be burned to generate the steam needed , he points out .
By comparison , gas power stations extract energy from gas more efficiently , he says .
“ The production of hydrogen from methane in converters will generate higher CO 2 emissions per kilowatt hour since [ hydrogen production ] is an energy - intensive process . ”
Solar solution
Steinfeld ’s own research suggests concentrated solar energy could provide the necessary heat to break down methane and produce hydrogen ( Solar Energy , DOI : 10.1016/j.solener.2005.06.007 ) .
“ These hybrid processes where we “ mix ” solar energy and fossil fuel energy create a link between today ’s fossil - fuel - based technology and tomorrow ’s solar chemical technology , ” he says .
“ It conserves fossil fuels , reduces CO 2 emissions , and offers a transition path to solar hydrogen . ”
But like other ideas , for example using bacterial enzymes to generate hydrogen , the process is still only at a proof - of - principle stage .
It seems likely that even more novel proposals for ways to sustainably produce hydrogen in large volumes can be expected in coming years before a solution is finally found .

The third dimension is all the rage right now .
Hollywood is hoping that it will save the theater industry despite the fact that it has always fizzled out in the past , and now , thanks to NVIDIA and Resident Evil 5 , it looks like 3D PC gaming is going to be racking up another big name game .
It 's been confirmed that when RE5 hits on the PC this July it will feature support for NVIDIA 's GeForce 3D Vision technology .
Shnazzy , I know .
The 3D Vision technology will set you back around $ 200 , but they do work on variety of games , though evidently some games work better than others .
If you 've been to a 3D movie recently you 've probably put on a pair of glasses that work in much the same way .
This is n't your father 's 3D .
No more blue and red images , just subtle shades of gray and a slight feeling of going crosseyed .
I 'm not sure if this makes up for PC gamers getting the game so late though .
Would n't you rather have had even more extra content instead of a gimmick only a handful of people are able to use ?

North Korea 's nuclear test this week has deeply angered China , a mood shift signaled in statements showing that influential Chinese thinkers are coming to see Kim Jong Il 's regime as a liability .
The change in attitude does n't indicate China will support punishment that could threaten the stability of its neighbor .
China appears ready to support modest sanctions at the United Nations Security Council , along the lines of the restrictions on North Korean companies it has supported in the past .
But commentators from China have been stinging in their criticism since Monday 's test .
" North Korea has become a major problem for China , " says Zhang Yushan , who works for a government think tank in Jilin province , near the North Korean border .
" It has become a dangerous player in the world . "
It is impossible for outsiders to gauge how such statements reflect the views of those setting Beijing 's foreign policy .
Still , signs of Chinese anger over North Korea 's nuclear test are raising hopes in the Obama administration that Beijing will eventually take stronger action to restrain Kim Jong Il 's increasingly confrontational regime .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said he believes China was surprised by the North 's nuclear test , which made it more likely Beijing will cooperate with U.S. - led efforts to clamp down on the regime in Pyongyang .
NEW ORLEANS 
Years before Washington spent $ 787 billion on a national stimulus bill , it staged an unintended trial run in Louisiana , a huge injection of some $ 51 billion for which historians find few , if any , precedents in a single state .
The experiment is still playing out , but some indicators suggest that what occurred in Louisiana  dumping a large amount of reconstruction money into a confined space in the three and a half years since Hurricane Katrina  has had a positive outcome .
The state ’s unemployment rate of 5.7 percent in February was considerably below the national average of 8.1 percent , and it was the only state to see a drop in unemployment from December to January .
It was also the only state with an increase in non-farm employment in February .
State economists specifically mention what one called “ the ongoing building boom ” from federal dollars as a main reason for the numbers .
Largely a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina , construction projects have not dried up as they have elsewhere , and a few can even be seen in downtown New Orleans .
Construction has “ really hung in there and done very well , ” said Loren Scott , an emeritus professor of economics at Louisiana State University .
“ In most states construction is way down , but in ours it has been up . ”
The relatively low unemployment rate in Louisiana “ tells you that the stimulus can have an effect , ” Mr. Scott said .
Consumers to benefit from savings achieved through increased awareness of energy use but householders likely to pick up some of the costs of the compulsory , nationwide scheme
Every home in the UK must be fitted with a " smart meter " by 2020 to reduce energy use and pave the way for a low - carbon " smart grid " , under plans unveiled by the government today .
The new meters will send information on real - time electricity and gas use in households and small businesses direct to utility companies , eliminating the need for customers to stay at home for meter readings or to receive over - estimated bills .
However , consumers are likely to pick up some of the costs of the compulsory , nationwide scheme .
The government estimates putting smart meters in the country 's 26 m homes could save customers and energy companies £ 2.5 bn - £ 3.6 bn over the next 20 years , but says it will cost more than double this to buy and install the equipment .
Launching a consultation on how the smart meters should be rolled out , the Department for Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) claimed the scheme will be the biggest smart meter project in the world .
" The meters most of us have in our homes were designed for a different age , before climate change , " said Ed Miliband , the energy and climate change secretary .
" Now we need to get smarter with our energy ... so it 's important we design a system that brings best value to everyone involved . "
Energy companies welcomed the switch , which will reduce their running costs by making meter readers obsolete and eliminating the customer service time spent on dealing with estimated bills .
Consumers and small business owners could benefit from savings achieved through increased awareness of their energy use .
Previous studies have shown that smart meters encourage homeowners to cut their energy use by 3 - 15 % , although experts warn that the technology requires consumer education and is not an " install and forget " energy - efficiency measure like loft insulation .
Consumer groups warned that homeowners should not have to shoulder heavy costs for the new meters .
Replacing today 's meters by the end of 2020 is expected to cost £ 8.11 bn under the government 's preferred plan , with utility companies paying upfront , but able to pass on the charge .
" Bill - payers have been suffering for many years from ever - increasing bills , so I hope the cost of the scheme – up to £ 340 for every household – wo n't wholly be put at their feet , " said Scott Byrom , utilities manager at Moneysupermarket.com .
The Energy Retail Association – which represents the major electricity and gas companies – said that smart meters will be " cost - neutral " to customers because the savings to its members will part - fund the roll out .
Smart meters will also play a key role in helping the government meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets of at least 34 % by 2020 .
The meters make it easier for householders to sell power they generate through wind and solar back to the grid .
They will also allow suppliers to smooth the peaks and troughs of UK electricity demand by offering cheaper electricity at times of low demand , and increasing the price when demand is high .
Reducing peak demand means fewer power stations need to be on standby , thereby cutting carbon emissions .
Ultimately , smart meters will allow the electricity used by domestic appliances to be " dynamically " managed .
This would mean switching off refrigerators for a few minutes at times of high demand , or using plugged - in electric vehicles to store power .
This flexibility is crucial if a significant amount of clean , renewable energy is to be supplied from harnessing the sun , wind and waves , all of which vary with the weather .
A government report last year suggested such " demand management " technology could save 2 m tonnes of CO 2 a year .
Environmental campaigners and opposition politicians warned that the 2020 timetable was not fast enough .
The shadow energy and climate change secretary , Greg Clark , said : " In other countries around the world , smart meters are being rolled out now .
Ten years [ to install ] a technology that 's already available seems very leisurely considering the urgency of climate change . "
However , consultants Ernst & Young noted that even fitting 2.6 m homes with meters every until 2020 was " challenging " .
Three plans are under consideration for the natiowide roll - out of smart meters .
The first sees utilities take on all responsibilities , including supply and installation , plus the data management .
The second – the government 's preferred model – has energy suppliers responsible for the meters , but with a new third party body handling the energy data .
A third scenario envisages setting up a new organisation to oversee both the meters and data management .
Smart meter trials are already under way around the country through energy companies including British Gas and Npower , and smaller suppliers such as First Utility already supply smart meters as standard .
The first smart meters installed under the government 's new plans are expected to arrive in 2012 .

Leave it to Matt Taibbi to tear into Michelle Bachmann in a way only he can .
Matthews had to know what type of response he was going to get here and Taibbi did n't disappoint .
His reply when asked about some of Michelle Bachmann 's latest hackery .
Taibbi :
You know it 's funny this morning outside of Penn Station I saw a guy huffing glue out of a paper bag , and he was making more sense than Michelle Bachmann was making .
I can't believe it .
You need to pass a written test to drive a car in this country but I bet this woman can't even write her name in the ground with a stick .
I mean it 's just unbelievable to me that this person is in the Congress .
Political Base asks the obvious " elephant in the room " question :
At what point should we start calling Bachmann " treasonous " ?
The aim is to revamp the gallery for the 20th anniversary of the Berlin Wall 's fall
By Tristana Moore
BBC News , Berlin
Visitors to Berlin often ask " where is the wall ? "
They probably end up at the East Side Gallery .
But over the years , one of the city 's biggest tourist attractions has become a magnet for vandals .
Today , this section of the wall is crumbling and it is covered in graffiti , which is ubiquitous in Berlin .
But the East Side Gallery is now getting a fresh lick of paint .
The concrete is being scrubbed , and the graffiti has been removed so the artists can start from scratch .
It 's important for all Germans to learn about the negative and positive aspects of their history
Rosemarie Schinzler , German artist
It is part of a 2.5 m - euro ( £ 2 m , $ 3 m ) restoration project funded by the Berlin Senate , the federal government and lottery money .
The East Side Gallery is the longest remaining section of the Berlin Wall , billed as the world 's biggest open - air art gallery .
Shortly after the fall of the wall in November 1989 , 118 artists were invited to paint murals on the long section of the old Cold War barrier in Berlin 's Friedrichshain district .
Recreation Rosemarie Schinzler , an artist from the German city of Freiburg , travelled to Berlin after the wall fell in 1990 .
The Berlin Wall has become a magnet for both tourists and vandals She wanted to visit the German capital after the dramatic events of 1989 .
She later took part in a competition and was selected to paint a mural on the East Side Gallery .
Twenty years later , Rosemarie is back in Berlin trying to recreate her original mural .
" Everyone should come here , " she says , " especially children as they 've got no idea what it was like to live in a divided city and a divided country . "
" It 's important for all Germans to learn about the negative and positive aspects of their history . "
After the collapse of the Berlin Wall , artists from all over the world converged on the German capital and started painting murals on the 1.3 km ( 0.8 mile ) long section of the wall , which came to be known as the East Side Gallery .

The artists , from 21 different countries , painted their vivid murals which were an expression of their reaction to the historic changes .
But the weather , and graffiti , soon took their toll .
' Historic monument '
The organisers of the restoration work say they spent years trying to convince the authorities to fund it .
Famous paintings have already been painted over by the wall 's restorers " We need to restore the East Side Gallery for future generations " , says Kani Alavi , the head of the East Side Gallery Artists ' Initiative .
Alavi is an Iranian - born German artist who witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall from the vantage point of his flat near the famous Checkpoint Charlie crossing point .
" All these paintings must be recreated , like the famous picture of the Trabant car which comes crashing through the wall , " he says .
" People will then be able to feel the euphoria of that time when the wall came tumbling down 20 years ago and see how artists left their mark in 1990 , " he adds .
Another artist , the Frenchman Thierry Noir , is also helping to organise the restoration of the gallery .
In April 1984 , Noir and another French artist painted the first major works of art on the Berlin Wall , in the city 's Kreuzberg district .
It 's unbelievable , where is my work ?
Dmitri Vrubel , Russian artist " It was dangerous back then .
I lived near the Berlin Wall in Kreuzberg , " he says .
" We did n't want to make the wall beautiful - there were too many lives lost .
There was so much sadness surrounding the wall .
I just wanted to brighten up this sadness . "
Noir painted his large bright figures that later featured in Wim Wenders ' film , Wings of Desire , in which he played himself .
" The wall is like a historic monument .
If the wall is painted , we hope it will be protected .
Young people need to see what it was like and we should n't repeat the mistakes of the past , " Noir says .
' Unbelievable '
But one artist was apparently upset when he discovered the original murals would be scrubbed off .
The organisers spent years convincing the authorities to fund the work Dmitri Vrubel , the Russian artist who painted the famous mural of the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev kissing the former East German communist leader Erich Honecker , told Germany 's Bild newspaper that he was not keen on the idea of painting the same mural again .
" It 's unbelievable , where is my work ? " he told Bild .
But the organisers say it is a misunderstanding .
" Vrubel knew last year the East Side Gallery was going to be restored , " Alavi says .
" We told him .
He 's complaining now , but it 's all a bit of a PR stunt .
I hope Vrubel will come back to Berlin in June to repaint his picture .
We 're looking forward to seeing him again . "
Despite the big clean - up , tourists are still flocking to the gallery .
" This place is great , there 's so much history here , you can feel the energy when you look at these murals , " said one tourist from Los Angeles .
The aim is to revamp the East Side Gallery in time for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall this autumn , when the eyes of the world will be on the German capital .
" I hope the Berlin authorities put up some lights here or install a few cameras .
The East Side Gallery should be treated like any other memorial , " Alavi says .

Tennant already filmed a scene , from his final episode , where he says goodbye to 1970s traveling companion Sarah Jane Smith and her adopted son Luke .
But now Tennant is back in Penarth , where Sarah Jane 's house is , and so is his time machine , the TARDIS .
This could just be another pick - up scene from his Doctor Who episode , except that Tennant is wearing a different outfit .
Also , rumor has it he was at the script read - through for the third season of Sarah Jane 's spin - off show , the Sarah Jane Adventures .

Senate set to bust creation backer as board of ed leader McLeroy opposed as board of ed leader
AUSTIN – Senate Democrats say they have more than enough votes to remove Don McLeroy as chairman of the State Board of Education Tuesday when McLeroy ’s confirmation reaches the Senate floor .
The Bryan dentist has presided over a contentious 15 - member State Board of Education that fought over curriculum standards for science earlier this year and English language arts and reading last year .
Critics faulted McLeroy for applying his strong religious beliefs in shaping new science standards .
McLeroy believes in creationism and that the Earth is about 6,000 years old .
“ This particular State Board of Education under the leadership of Dr. McLeroy has been divisive .
It ’s been dysfunctional , and it has been embarrassing to the point of having commentary on this in the Washington Post , the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal , ” said Sen. Leticia Van de Putte , D - San Antonio , chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus .
McLeroy ’s leadership , she said , had made Texas “ the laughing stock of the nation . ”
It takes 11 votes to block a gubernatorial nomination .
Van de Putte said all 12 Senate Democrats plan to vote against McLeroy
McLeroy declined to comment Monday .
He would continue to sit on the State Board of Education if the Senate blocks his nomination as chairman .
At a confirmation hearing last month , McLeroy said he had no regrets about his leadership and emphasized he has not pushed his religious viewpoints into public education policies .
McLeroy recently fought for new science curriculum standards that require students to analyze and evaluate various scientific theories .
“ There ’s nothing religious about those standards , ” he told senators .
“ Our children will critically examine the scientific explanations for cells or the origin of life .
I think that by being honest with our kids , we will get really good scientists . ”
Sen . Eliot Shapleigh , D - El Paso , has been a strong critic of McLeroy .
“ He has used his position to push extreme beliefs on 4.7 million school children .
He has rejected solid science in favor of ideology , ” Shapleigh said .
“ He has ignored input from experts on what works best for reading . ”
The Senate rarely blocks a governor ’s appointment .
There is speculation in the Capitol and within the Texas Education Agency that Gov. Rick Perry might elevate Cynthia Dunbar , R - Richmond , to lead the board .
Like McLeroy , Dunbar also holds strong Christian beliefs and recently authored a book that advocates more religion in the public square .
“ We believe that Texans deserve better than divisive , destructive , extreme leadership , ” Shapleigh said .
“ If the governor chooses to appoint someone more extreme and more divisive , we ’ll have to deal with that at the appropriate time . ”

Could the Sun play a greater role in recent climate change than has been believed ?
Climatologists had dismissed the idea and some solar scientists have been reticent about it because of its connections with those who those who deny climate change .
But now the speculation has grown louder because of what is happening to our Sun .
No living scientist has seen it behave this way .
There are no sunspots .
The disappearance of sunspots happens every few years , but this time it ’s gone on far longer than anyone expected – and there is no sign of the Sun waking up .
“ This is the lowest we ’ve ever seen .
We thought we ’d be out of it by now , but we ’re not , ” says Marc Hairston of the University of Texas .
And it ’s not just the sunspots that are causing concern .
There is also the so - called solar wind – streams of particles the Sun pours out – that is at its weakest since records began .
In addition , the Sun ’s magnetic axis is tilted to an unusual degree .
“ This is the quietest Sun we ’ve seen in almost a century , ” says NASA solar scientist David Hathaway .
But this is not just a scientific curiosity .
It could affect everyone on Earth and force what for many is the unthinkable : a reappraisal of the science behind recent global warming .
Our Sun is the primary force of the Earth ’s climate system , driving atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns .
It lies behind every aspect of the Earth ’s climate and is , of course , a key component of the greenhouse effect .
But there is another factor to be considered .
When the Sun has gone quiet like this before , it coincided with the earth cooling slightly and there is speculation that a similar thing could happen now .
If so , it could alter all our predictions of climate change , and show that our understanding of climate change might not be anywhere near as good as we thought .

Sunspots are dark , cooler patches on the Sun ’s surface that come and go in a roughly 11 - year cycle , first noticed in 1843 .
They have gone away before .
They were absent in the 17th century – a period called the “ Maunder Minimum ” after the scientist who spotted it .
Crucially , it has been observed that the periods when the Sun ’s activity is high and low are related to warm and cool climatic periods .
The weak Sun in the 17th century coincided with the so - called Little Ice Age .
The Sun took a dip between 1790 and 1830 and the earth also cooled a little .
It was weak during the cold Iron Age , and active during the warm Bronze Age .
Recent research suggests that in the past 12,000 years there have been 27 grand minima and 19 grand maxima .
Throughout the 20th century the Sun was unusually active , peaking in the 1950s and the late 1980s .
Dean Pensell of NASA , says that , “ since the Space Age began in the 1950s , solar activity has been generally high .
Five of the ten most intense solar cycles on record have occurred in the last 50 years . ”
The Sun became increasingly active at the same time that the Earth warmed .
But according to the scientific consensus , the Sun has had only a minor recent effect on climate change .
Many scientists believe that the Sun was the major player on the Earth ’s climate until the past few decades , when the greenhouse effect from increasing levels of carbon dioxide overwhelmed it .
Computer models suggest that of the 0.5C increase in global average temperatures over the past 30 years , only 10 - 20 per cent of the temperature variations observed were down to the Sun , although some said it was 50 per cent .
But around the turn of the century things started to change .
Within a few years of the Sun ’s activity starting to decline , the rise in the Earth ’s temperature began to slow and has now been constant since the turn of the century .
This was at the same time that the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide carried on rising .
So , is the Sun ’s quietness responsible for the tail - off in global warming and if not , what is ?
There are some clues as to what ’s going on .
Although at solar maxima there are more sunspots on the Sun ’s surface , their dimming effect is more than offset by the appearance of bright patches on the Sun ’s disc called faculae – Italian for “ little torches ” .
Overall , during an 11 - year solar cycle the Sun ’s output changes by only 0.1 per cent , an amount considered by many to be too small a variation to change much on earth .
But there is another way of looking it .
While this 0.1 per cent variation is small as a percentage , in terms of absolute energy levels it is enormous , amounting to a highly significant 1.3
Watts of energy per square metre at the Earth .
This means that during the solar cycle ’s rising phase from solar minima to maxima , the Sun ’s increasing brightness has the same climate - forcing effect as that from increasing atmospheric greenhouse gasses .
There is recent research suggesting that solar variability can have a very strong regional climatic influence on Earth – in fact stronger than any man -made greenhouse effect across vast swathes of the Earth .
And that could rewrite the rules .
No one knows what will happen or how it will effect our understanding of climate change on Earth .
If the Earth cools under a quiet Sun , then it may be an indication that the increase in the Sun ’s activity since the Little Ice Age has been the dominant factor in global temperature rises .
That would also mean that we have overestimated the sensitivity of the Earth ’s atmosphere to an increase of carbon dioxide from the pre-industrial three parts per 10,000 by volume to today ’s four parts per 10,000 .
Or the sun could compete with global warming , holding it back for a while .
For now , all scientists can do , along with the rest of us , is to watch and wait .

The Sun explained ...
Core
The energy of the Sun comes from nuclear fusion reactions that occur deep inside the core
Radiative zone
The area that surrounds the core .
Energy travels through it by radiation
Convective zone
This zone extends from the radiative zone to the Sun ’s surface .
It consists of “ boiling ” convection cells
Photosphere
The top layer of the Sun .
It is this that we see when we look at the Sun in natural light
Filament A strand of solar plasma held up by the Sun ’s magnetic field that can be seen against its surface
Chromosphere A layer of the Sun ’s atmosphere above the photosphere , around 2000 km deep
‘ The last administration left us in a weaker posture than we ’ve been any time since World War II : less regarded in the world , stretched more thinly than we have ever been in the past , two wars under way , virtually no respect in entire parts of the world . ”
These remarks by US vice - president Joe Biden on Tuesday were in response to those made by his predecessor Dick Cheney two weeks ago in defence of the Bush administration ’s detention camps at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo .
These were necessary , Mr Cheney insisted , for the “ tough , mean , dirty , nasty business ” of “ keeping the country safe ” .
The intelligence gained prevented further 9/11 attacks , he asserted .
“ I think it ’s a great success story ” .
He went on to say the Obama administration has made the US less safe during its brief time in office and is continuing to do so .
Mr Cheney has evidently not lost the dark art of fighting tough , mean , dirty politics .
Republican diehards are hereby trying to pin responsibility for any more terrorist attacks on the Obama administration .
This explains why Mr Biden yesterday , and Mr Obama shortly after Mr Cheney ’s intervention , so strongly denied it by saying the facts do n’t bear out his contention that effectively torture saves lives .
Quite how damaging Guantánamo has been and will continue to be for the regard , respect and reputation of the US is revealed in the Red Cross report on some of its interrogations just published by the New York Review of Books .
This chronicles how 14 “ high value detainees ” transferred to Guantánamo in 2006 were treated in detention , as they explained in private interviews with the Red Cross the following year – four years after the organisation requested access to them .
The Red Cross has confirmed it is a legitimate but secret document , regretting it has been leaked .
It is a horrifying account of beatings , waterboarding , suffocation , prolonged stress standing and nudity , exposure to extreme cold and other ill - treatments .
Many of them are drawn from techniques used by Chinese , Russian and North Korean regimes , according to an accompanying commentary by journalism professor Mark Danner .
On any adequate legal definition they amount to torture , notwithstanding legal advice to the Bush administration that this was not so .
This raises the question of what Mr Cheney means by saying the interrogations revealed intelligence which prevented further attacks and Mr Obama ’s denial of that .
Any public investigation should address this question head on .
Great Britain ’s Defense Options
The United Kingdom , much like most Western militaries , is shaped in the image of the United States superpower except in miniature .
Her fine Army is built around heavy Challenger II tanks , and swift Warrior armored infantry carriers .
Her historic Royal Air Force is well equipped with new Typhoon air superiority fighters , older Tornado fighter bombers , and Harrier V/ STOL close support fighters .
The Royal Navy ’s composition makes it still one of the world ’s mightiest , with soon - to - be - built Queen Elizabeth supercarriers , ballistic missile and nuclear attack submarines , new Daring anti-missile destroyers , Duke anti-sub frigates , and large Ocean and Albion class amphibious ships .
Not surprisingly and much like in America , the British have found the cost of sustaining an all - high tech military with such exquisite platforms nearly untenable , as she fights a different kind of war in the Third World that requires different sorts of weaponry .
New Hybrid Wars , which involve a mixture of robot guided weapons and low cost platforms have increasingly allowed seemingly minor threats such as Islamic terrorists like Al Qaeda , or “ state within states ” such as Hezbollah , to stand up to the heavily mechanized armies of the West .
Also not so surprising , is UK Defence Secretary John Hutton seeking solutions from her Continental cousin , notably the planned military reforms instigated by US Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
From Defense
News we read :
Britain should follow the U.S. and refocus its military strategy on combating the threat of terrorism , Defence Secretary John Hutton will tell a conference in London on April 27 .
The strategy change proposed by Hutton would see Britain reprioritize its spending on equipment and force structure over the next 10 years to better focus on special forces and other counterinsurgency investments .
The Hutton plan for a “ major rebalancing ” of the armed forces would pose big question marks against some of Britain ’s conventional equipment programs .
What these changes will eventually consist of is up to the Minister and his superiors , but we have a few suggestions that should make the best use of static or shrinking military funds , that also will not decrease the nation ’s ability to wage war or protect the peace :
Scrap the Trident replacement .
Savings here would amount to £ 21bn ( US $ 31bn ) .
In its place , the RN could equip Tomahawk missiles for the nuclear role , as her excellent sub fleet is already so armed with conventional cruise missiles .
By spreading the deterrent around in more numerous ( see below ) attack submarines , they would also be more survivable and effective .
Scrap the Royal Air Force .
This was proposed recently as a cost saving measure considering the decreasing number of aircraft and the continued sad state of the historic air force .
Her remaining Tornadoes and Harriers , transport planes and Nimrod patrol jets should be spread among the Army and Navy which has good use for them .
As for the Typhoon … Trade Typhoons for more useful fighter bombers .
The cornerstone of the RAF is this Typhoon air superiority fighter , whose mission has outlived its usefulness in an age of multi-mission fighters and the increased importance of close air support and strategic strike against heavily defended airspace .
Scrap or sell the expensive Typhoon , each plane which costs about the same as an American F - 22 stealth without being nearly as capable .
Increase Ground Forces and Restore the Territorial Army .
Plans to raisethe importance of the long - ignored Territorials is welcome news .
By amalgamatin it closer to the British Army , similar to the US arrangements with its Reserves will give welcome relief to the overworked ground forces .
She should also seek to beef up the active strength , perhaps to 150,000 , given the increased importance of ground troops in today ’s insurgent - type conflicts .
Reduce the Number of Fres Vehicles .
Again taking the nod from Sec. Gates proposal of dramatically cutting the purchases of Future Combat System vehicles , the UK should halve the Future Rapid Effects System ( FRES ) buy , purchasing only the Piranha family , which is very similar to the highly successful US Stryker , totaling 1700 utility vehicles .
Savings would amount to about £ 6bn or half the entire program .
For the medium armor replacement vehicle , we recommend keeping some well - proven Challenger tanks around .
Sustain and Increase the Attack Submarine Force .
Britain ’s small force of nuclear attack submarine makes her a potent naval power of the first rank .
Some have insisted with its unmatched stealth the submarine is today ’s capital ships , so the RN should take advantage of this unique capability .
By increasing her Nuke subs to 12 total , adding a new class of conventionally powered AIP ( air - independent propulsion ) , she should field from 25 or 30 boats , for homeland defense , and long - range littoral warfare .
She would fund this new unmatched force with savings from the following : Cancel Supercarriers .
More of a jobs program than a real national security requirement , this would save the Navy £ 3.9 billion and several early warship retirements .
The giant new budget draining battleships would be replaced by : Building A Second Ocean helicopter carrier .
While not enjoying the capabilities of a large deck supercarrier , HMS Ocean has a unique troop and aviation capability few navies possess .
With some modifications , the design could be adapted into a V / STOL carrier , since the vessel itself was adapted from HMS Invincible .
A second ship should be purchased with such a role in mind , equipped with former RAF Harriers ( see above ) or potentially the F - 35B Joint Strike Fighter .
Scrap the PAAMs missile ships .
Without the need for large supercarriers to protect , these over - costly and very complicated Type 45 destroyers are so much overkill and should be canceled , saving up to £ 6 billion .
The older Type 42 should be allowed to expire with the excellent Duke frigates updated to enhance its proven Sea Wolf anti-missile defense .
The latter should soon be complemented and eventually replaced with a new type of missile corvette , often advocated here as the “ new destroyer “ .
Sell the Albion and Bulwark dock landing ships .
These huge and hugely expensive warships would make excellent command ships for small navies like Canada , who is seeking just such a craft .
The Bay class LSDs should be kept for now , and eventually replaced with the type of high speed vessels currently used by the US Navy , of a type the British are familiar .
For the future , we think the transformation will be complete .
Unmanned Combat Air Systems will dominate the air as the once manned fighter and bombers ruled supreme .
At sea , the naturally stealthy submarine armed with cruise missiles will drive larger surface vessels into port , leaving only small shore - clinging corvettes able to carry on the surface warfare mission .
On land , the infantry riding into wheeled battle taxis and armed with increasing lethal manned portable guided weapons will end the reign of the tank , which will be unable to carry the amount of defenses required to make it survivable in the precision era .
Until then we think our modest proposals for investment in affordable Hybrid Weapons is Britain ’s hope for sustaining a practical and capable military force well into this new century , just as such changes will renew the still dominant US Armed Forces .

This is the first sweater I ever knit , clearly not to completion .
Why not to completion ?
Because after I assembled the first sleeve and started on the second and then tried on the sweater , I discovered to my horror that the thing weighs as much as a knee - length coat and is hotter than Phoenix in August .
I thought it was silly to use smaller needles to knit the mock - rib edging , since ribbing pulls in , right ?
Um , no .

I have just uploaded Embedded GLIBC ( EGLIBC ) into the archive ( it is currently waiting in the NEW queue ) , which will soon replace the GNU C Library ( GLIBC ) .
The EGLIBC is a variant of the GLIBC which stays source and binary compatible with the original GLIBC .
While primarily targeted for embedded architectures , it has some really nice points :
We do not use some of these features yet , but this upload is a first step .
From the user point of view , the package names are unchanged ( except the source package and the binary package containing the sources ) so no transition is needed .
A police chief would rather face the prospect of jail than obey a court order requiring his force to return computer hard drives to their owner .
At issue is the big question of who ultimately makes the law in the UK : the police or the courts .
The story began in June last year when former computer forensics expert Jim Bates attended a police station in Bristol to clone computer hard drives alleged to contain paedophile material .
These formed part of a case in an upcoming trial for making of indecent images , and despite Bates ’ status as a now former expert – following a conviction for perjury in respect of his qualifications – it is claimed that the defendant had requested his involvement in the case on the basis of his in - depth expertise in these matters .
The police were unhappy with Bates ' involvement : throughout the summer there was vigorous discussion of whether he should have been allowed access to the material in question and , according to Bates , pressure applied to him by the Crown Prosecution Service .
This culminated , in September , in a police raid on his home which resulted in the seizure of 87 hard drives , and a reported 2,500 indecent images of children .
The police justification for this raid was that Bates had obtained the images through deception , and that the entire episode was part of a criminal conspiracy to obtain indecent images of children .
Earlier this month , a judicial review before the High Court upheld a complaint by Jim Bates that both the original raid , carried out to locate the cloned hard drives , and the extension of the search during that raid to encompass other materials on Bates ' premises had been unlawful .
The court ordered Avon and Somerset Police Force to return all materials that they had seized .
This weekend , it was reported that the chief constable of that force , Colin Port , would risk jail by refusing to comply with that order .
Arguing that the ruling went against common sense , he said : " Clearly , defying the court is a serious matter and one that is not taken lightly .
" We do n't know what 's on these hard drives , but it is highly likely they contain indecent material going back to the 1990s .
They were found with over 2,500 hard copies of child abuse images and they must have come from somewhere .
" Common sense dictates to me that we should n't be returning indecent images to anyone - yet I am prevented from even examining the material . "
The legal issues in this case are complex , but boil down to the question of who determines expert status before the courts , and whether such a thing as " privileged status " for legal documents may be overturned by police .
In ordinary circumstances , where an individual is acting as an expert in order to testify before a court , they may have access to papers and other materials that are deemed to be " privileged " .
Such material may not be seized by police in the course of an ordinary search and should be returned at once if it is found that it has been taken .
The police felt that Bates ’ conviction for perjury removed his status as an " expert " – and therefore also invalidated any claim to " privilege " in respect of material held at his property .
The court ruled , however , that not even a court could overturn expert status : where an expert was discredited , that might go to the credibility of their evidence , but not to the status of the individual .
In addition , some of the material seized was likely to be privileged in respect of previous cases in which Bates had acted : the police should therefore not hold on to it .
Although the subject matter in question is highly emotive , the point at issue is legal dynamite .
Within the UK legal system , various individuals and bodies , insofar as they are acting in a law enforcement capacity or as " officers of the court " , may be allowed temporary exemption from laws applied to the general public .
The police may break the speed limits where to do so is necessary in pursuit of offenders : the Sexual Offences Act 2003 made provision to allow individuals working for organisations such as the Internet Watch Foundation to access images that it would be illegal for the general public to possess .
According to Avon and Somerset Police , throughout this matter , their officers " believed that they were acting with good intent and in the interests of public safety and protection " .
Their Chief Constable has argued that this action is what the public would expect him to do .
Twenty - five years ago , a similar public interest defence was put before a jury in the case of a civil servant , Clive Ponting , accused of breaching the Official Secrets Act .
The judge in that case directed that " the public interest is what the state says it is " .
The jury disagreed . ®
I had a meeting with the Republican Leadership today .
It was eye opening - I did n't even know that they existed !
Anyway , that Cantor guy was pretty harsh .
Spend this , spend that .
I was with him until he explained that he was against all the spending - wow , can you imagine ?
After he left , I called in Geithner .
We needed to talk .
" The Republicans are worried about spending " I said .
Geithner replied " I have n't heard that in 8 years , what 's bugging them now ? "
" Well , Cantor said we are spending more than we have , is that true ? "
Geithner thought for a moment - you can tell when he 's having trouble with a concept ( which happens in most conversations ) .
He finally answered -
" I do n't think so . " , but I needed more information .
" How can you be sure that we are not out of money ? "
Geithner was thinking hard now - and then you could see the light bulb light up over his head .
" We have to have money left - we are not out of checks ! "
Boy , was I relieved ...

( NewsTarget ) A report released by a drug - tracking firm reveals that prescription drug use among Canadians was higher in 2008 than in any previous year .
The report , released on March 26 by IMS Health , a worldwide pharmaceutical - tracking company , assesses pharmaceutical use by tracking the number of prescriptions dispensed by pharmacists annually .
IMS estimates that Canadians spent $ 21.4 billion on prescription medications in 2008 , up from $ 20.2 billion in 2007 .
Pharmacists in 10 Canadian provinces filled 453 million prescriptions in 2008 , up 7.1 % over the previous year .
For 33.2 million Canadians , that 's an average of nearly 14 prescriptions per citizen .
The report also outlines that , although the current economic slowdown did not impact prescription drug sales in 2008 , the market share for brand - name pharmaceuticals is declining .
Dispensed volume for generic drugs grew by 15 % , in contrast to a decrease of 0.3 % for that of brand - name prescription medications .
" Basically it's an increased utilization , " said Brian Carter , director of external affairs for IMS Health Canada .
" But that 's driven by things like the aging population , an increasing number of products in the marketplace and increasing awareness of consumers of the diseases they have and the drugs that are there to treat them .
" Canadian health economist Steve Morgan pointed out that prescription drug use in Canada has been slowly , but steadily , increasing each year for about 15 years .
" Many people would point to the aging of the population as a potential explanation of this , " he said .
" Certainly the baby boomer generation is finding itself getting older and they 're entering the years in which it can be expected that they will be filling more prescriptions over time .
But ... we do n't see that aging of the population is a big cause of drug spending or drug utilization increases .
" Morgan further explained that the aging Canadian population accounts for about 1 % of the annual increases in pharmaceutical use , " not by this seven or eight per cent you see in the ( IMS ) data . "
The significant increases over the past two decades are more likely due to proliferation of newly developed medicines and an increase in marketing efforts of pharmaceuticals to both doctors and patients .
According to the report , the most prescribed drug categories in Canada in 2008 were Cardiovasculars and Psychotherapeutics , both of which increased in dispensation by more than 7 % over the previous year .
Another significant statistic was that of prescription drug sales to Canadian hospitals and pharmacies , which increased by 6.6 % in 2008 , compared to 6.2 % in the previous year .
The province with the highest number of prescriptions per capita was Quebec , with an average of 23 prescribed medications for each resident .
The next highest was Newfoundland / Labrador , with 14 .
The significant difference between the top two provinces in the report , however , is easily explained by the fact that prescriptions in Quebec are normally of a shorter duration than all other Canadian provinces , thus the number of medications dispensed is higher .
Alberta had the lowest number with 9 prescriptions per capita .
The report also provided statistics detailing the top reasons for physician visits in Canada .
Hypertension was the highest , with nearly 21 million visits .
" Routine General Medical Exam " was the second highest with about 10 million .
IMS
Health 's analysis does not indicate any statistics for Canada 's three territories ( Yukon , Nunavut , and North West Territories ) , however those non-provinces account for only about 0.3 percent of Canada 's overall population .
According to their website , IMS Health is " the world 's leading provider of market intelligence to the pharmaceutical and health - care stakeholders .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Although Democrats currently enjoy a party identification advantage over Republicans among Americans at every age between 18 to 85 , the Democrats ' greatest advantages come among those in their 20s and baby boomers in their late 40s and 50s .
Republicans , on the other hand , come closest to parity with Democrats among Generation Xers in their late 30s and early 40s and among seniors in their late 60s .
These conclusions are based on an analysis of more than 123,000 interviews conducted by Gallup between Jan. 2 and May 5 of this year .
This extremely large group of interviews allows for the analysis of party identification for each of the 67 distinct ages between 18 and 85 .
Gallup conducted interviews with at least 650 respondents at each age , with the average sample size of 1,756 per age year .
As shown in the graph above , there is significant variation in political party identification across the age spectrum in the United States today .
· The percentage of Americans who identify as independents is directly and inversely related to age .
More than one - third of the youngest Americans identify as independents , a percentage that drops steadily as the population ages , reaching a low of around 20 % among those 80 years of age and older .
· The percentage of Americans who identify as Republicans follows roughly the opposite pattern .
Only around 20 % of young Americans below the age of 25 identify as Republicans .
The percent Republican grows slightly from that point as age increases , up until roughly Americans ' mid-40s , and then settles back among baby boomers in their late 40s and 50s .
As Americans age into their 60s , the Republican percentage climbs , reaching levels of about 30 % and above on average after age 67 .
· The percentage of Americans who identify as Democrats follows still a different path .
Democrats are quite strong among the youngest Americans , particularly those under age 24 , among whom more identify as Democrats than independents .
The percent Democrat stays at about the one - third mark until about age 45 , when it climbs slightly and remains higher through the 50s and early 60s .
From that point on , the percent Democrat hovers around the 40 % point , although there is quite a bit of fluctuation from age to age for Americans in their late 60s , 70s , and early 80s .
From a broad perspective , Republicans face a deficit among Americans of all ages .
At no single age does the percent Republican exceed the percent Democrat .
Still , the range of this Democratic advantage (% Democrat minus % Republican ) is quite large , extending from an 18 percentage point Democratic advantage among those 21 , 23 , and 25 , down to just a to 3 - point edge among those 39 , 43 , and 69 .
Demographers and social observers have made attempts over the years to classify Americans into generational groups based on the social , political , economic , and cultural environment of the years in which they grew up and " came of age . "
The most clearly delineated such group is the baby boomers , generally agreed to be those born between 1946 and 1964 -- or roughly ages 45 to 63 today .
Generation X follows the baby boom and is generally considered to be those born between 1965 and 1979 -- or roughly between ages 30 and 44 .
Those younger than Generation X have been labeled Generation Y or the " Millennials , " who are 18 to 29 today .
There are various ways of grouping those who preceded the baby boom generation , including the famous sobriquet " The Greatest Generation " used by Tom Brokaw in his book of the same name , but it is convenient to label those who today are 64 and older as seniors ( even though some in this group would no doubt resist that label ) .
The current data suggest that political party identification in the United States today follows these generational patterns to a perhaps surprising degree .
· Generation Y ( 18 to 29 ) clearly is skewed fairly strongly in the direction of being either independent or Democratic in political orientation .
This group constitutes a significant weakness for the Republican Party .
· Generation X ( 30 to 44 ) includes some of the strongest support for Republicans .
For whatever reasons , the Democratic over Republican gap among Generation Xers , particularly those ages 37 to 43 at the heart of this generation , is on a relative basis much closer to parity than for any other age group with the exception of those in their late 60s .
· Baby Boomers ( 45 to 63 ) skew Democratic in their political orientation , with the Democratic advantage reaching a peak at ages 58 and 59 .
· Seniors have a more mixed pattern of party identification , with Republicans gaining on a relative basis among those in their late 60s , but with Democrats doing better as Americans age into their 70s and early 80s .
Bottom Line
Democrats have a significant advantage over Republicans today in terms of overall party identification , and the data reviewed here show that this advantage holds at every age between 18 and 85 .
At the same time , there are clear ebbs and flows in the degree of this Democratic advantage across the age spectrum .
Democrats have the greatest advantage vis a vis Republicans among Americans at the very youngest voting age and also among members of the fabled baby boom , particularly those in their late 50s .
Republicans do relatively better among those who are in Generation X , including in particular those in their late 30s and early 40s .
Republicans also show greater support among older Americans in their late 60s .
Certainly some of these patterns are typical generational differences .
Younger Americans have in the past been more likely to be independents and Democrats regardless of the particular cohort involved .
There is also the hypothesis that the differences are explained by the unique circumstances that surrounded the coming of age of the generations .
Baby boomers , as is well known , grew up in the tumultuous age of civil rights , Vietnam , Woodstock , and Watergate .
It is certainly possible that these events have marked this generation in a more Democratic or liberal direction for life .
Many Generation Xers came of age during the Reagan - Bush years ( 1980 to 1992 ) or the " Republican Revolution " marked by the 1994 midterm elections .
Today 's Generation Y has reached maturity in a time period largely marked by the administration of George W. Bush , and certainly for many the nascent Obama administration is a major formative factor in their political orientation .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 123,890 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Jan. 2 to May 5 , 2009 , as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is less than ±1 percentage points .
The maximum margin of sampling error for each individual age varies depending on sample size , ranging from +/- 2 % to 4 % for any individual age .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Atheist buses ?
Those are * so* 2008 .
We ’ve moved on to buildings now .
The sign says ( in Spanish ) : “ Probablemente Dios no existe .
Deja de preocuparte y disfruta la vida ” which basically translates to the classical version of the atheist buses in London : “ There ’s probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . ”
Here ’s the basic story behind this picture .
The Union of Atheists and Freethinkers ( UAL ) in Spain wanted to put up atheist bus ads of their own , so they contacted Transportes Urbanos de Zaragoza ( TUZSA ) to put them up .
TUZSA never responded to them — most likely to avoid the whole situation .
But the atheists are n’t going away .
The UAL , for now , has installed a large canvas of 160 square meters in a building under construction in the number 60 , Avenue de Goya , including the slogan of the campaign and … also Article 20 of the Constitution , which enshrines the right to freely express and disseminate thoughts , ideas and opinions by word , writing or any other means of reproduction , and prohibits any form of prior censorship .
The objective of this campaign with UAL … is not whether God exists or not , but to discuss whether the atheists have the same rights as believers and make visible the reality of these people .
This will definitely get everybody ’s attention .
Can we get these ginormous atheist building ads all over America ?
They definitely make our billboards seem quaint …

News : Q&A
Underwater archaeologist Jon Henderson is hoping to reveal the secrets of the ancient Greek town of Pavlopetri .
A building at Pavlopetri Jon Henderson
A few metres under the sea , near the town of Neapolis at the southern tip of Greece , lies Pavlopetri .
Discovered and mapped in the 1960s , it will become the first underwater town to be digitally surveyed in three dimensions .
Nature News caught up with Jon Henderson , an underwater archaeologist at the University of Nottingham , UK , before the project began on 18 May .
What does Pavlopetri look like ? < br/>
The site is submerged in about 3 – 4 metres of water , and covers an area of about 500 square metres , about 50 - 60 metres offshore .
There are about 15 buildings made up of three or four rooms , some streets , rock - cut tombs and courtyards — and there could be more underneath , because so far there has been no excavation .
Some ruins date from at least 2800 BC , but we think the town Pavlopetri itself dates from the Mycenaean period , about 1600 – 1100 BC .
Because it 's not on land , it has n't been interfered with by agriculture , and it has n't been rebuilt on .
It 's exactly as it was , although eroded down to floor level .
We 've still got the threshold stones from doorways and stones for grinding grain , for example .
Are there other submerged towns around the world like it ? < br/>
Pavlopetri is the oldest submerged town we know of , although no doubt others will be discovered .
The city of Alexandria is the other one that 's well - known — but most of the remains there are from the first millennium BC .
In the eastern Mediterranean in particular , there are hundreds of submerged sites , because it is one of the earthquake centres of the world and there has been so much land movement .
It has been known about for a while , has n't it ? < br/>
It was discovered in 1967 by Nicholas Flemming , who was then at the University of Southampton , UK , and who is one of the founding fathers of underwater archaeology in Britain .
He 's part of our team now — he 's in his seventies , still madly excited about these sites and he still dives .
A team from the University of Cambridge , UK , mapped the site with tape measures in 1968 , and recovered a few artefacts .
We 're going back now to increase the accuracy from the two - dimensional hand - taped plans .
This month is just the survey stage , and the second stage will be three to four years of excavation .
Divers explore the site Jon Henderson
How are you mapping the town ? < br/>
We 're using ' scanning sonar ' , which has been developed by an offshore engineering company [ Kongsberg Mesotech in Vancouver , Canada , a subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime , headquartered in Norway ] .
Their equipment does the same thing a terrestrial laser scanner would do , only using acoustic signals .
It can take thousands of points over a couple of minutes and also take photorealistic impressions , so we could produce three - dimensional models using this equipment .
Until now , sonar has n't been able to produce as accurate a survey as terrestrial techniques .
But if it does deliver everything it is supposed to , it could completely revolutionize underwater archaeology .
Getting decent plans quickly is often a problem , and we often use measuring tapes and lines — which is effective , but time - consuming .
Was it ruined before it was submerged , or eroded underwater ? < br/>
We do n't know .
The fact that it was n't rebuilt on , and that the pottery seems to stop at around 1180 BC , would suggest that it was submerged pretty soon after that date , but that 's just a hope at this stage .

What is particularly archaeologically interesting about the site ? < br/>
First , it 's from the Mycenaean period .
This is ancient Greece in the last phase of the Bronze Age , so the historical setting for much literature and myth .
All the epics of Homer , for example , are reflected back to these periods .
The Mycenaeans 's power came from having control of the sea , but we know virtually nothing about the harbour towns .
Pavlopetri is presumably a harbour town , where ships might have been brought in , unpacked and loaded and sent off again .
Also , the depleted oxygen levels in the water and the fact that any remains would be sealed in with sand makes for an anaerobic situation , and that could preserve organic artefacts , such as wooden tools .
We'd be very lucky , but the possibility is there .
Every citizen should be a soldier .
This was the case with the Greeks and Romans , and must be that of every free state .

Common Rules
All the sort benchmarks share the following ground rules :
Must sort to and from operating system files on secondary storage .
No raw disk usage allowed since we are trying to test the IO subsystem .
File or device striping ( RAID 0 ) are allowed ( encouraged ) to get bandwidth .
If file striping is used then the concatenated files must form a sorted file .
The output file must be created as part of the sort .
Time includes the launching of the sort program .
The sort input records must be 100 bytes in length , with the first 10 bytes being a random key .
Use the gensort record generator to create the input records .
The sort output file must be validated for correct key order and checksum .
The hardware used should be commercially available ( off - the - shelf ) , and unmodified ( e.g. no processor over or under clocking ) .
Sort Benchmarks

THE HAGUE , Netherlands ( CNN ) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was coy Monday about whether she would meet Iranian delegates at an international conference on Afghanistan , and she urged Tehran to play a positive role in helping stabilize its neighbor .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in the Netherlands Monday for a conference on Afghanistan .
" I believe that there will be an opening by this conference that will enable all the countries , including Iran , to come forward , " Clinton told reporters aboard her plane en route to The Hague for Tuesday 's conference .
" The fact that they accepted the invitation to come suggests that they believe there is a role for them to play , and we 're looking forward to hearing more about that . "
More than 80 countries and international organizations will be attending the conference , aimed at jump - starting political support for Afghanistan in the wake of the new U.S. strategy for the region , which President Obama announced last week .
Clinton said she would be sharing the administration 's policy review during the conference .
" We want to share the review in person with the friends and stakeholders in Afghanistan 's future and encourage them to begin thinking hard about what each can do to support governance , security , economic assistance , regional cooperation , all of the necessary steps that we have to see fulfilled , " she told reporters aboard her plane .
Obama on Friday announced his decision to send an additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan to increase training for the Afghan army and police force .
They will be joined by hundreds of civilian specialists , such as agricultural experts , educators and engineers .
The increase comes on top of an earlier announcement to send 17,000 additional troops to battle a re-energized Taliban insurgency .
Clinton said while the Obama administration has received a " good initial response " to the new U.S. strategy , it was time to " turn to operationalizing and implementing how we 're going to create more capacity within Afghanistan , internationalize support for stability and security , and [ achieve ] our primary mission of disrupting , dismantling and defeating al Qaeda " in advance of an August election .
Clinton said she would announce at the conference that the United States would pledge $ 40 million toward securing a free and fair election in Afghanistan .
She said the U.S. would not support or endorse a candidate .
The Afghan supreme court ruled Sunday that President Hamid Karzai will remain in office until the election .
Karzai's term is up in May , but an independent commission has set the election for August 20 .
The court 's decision found that allowing Karzai to remain in power until that vote " is in the interest of the Afghan people and state , and it is also consistent with the spirit and interpretation of the constitution . "
Karzai is Afghanistan 's first popularly elected leader in recent history .
He was named head of a provisional government after the U.S. - led invasion that dislodged the Taliban in 2001 , and he won an interim term in 2002 and a full term in 2004 .
He is seeking a new term in August .
But his government has come under increasing criticism for corruption and inefficiency , and an earlier effort to move the elections up to April drew criticism from opposition groups and the United States .
A major component of the new U.S. strategy involves a surge of civilian personnel to aid political reform , root out corruption and boost development .
Clinton said the U.S. would seek to " quit the redundancy and the duplicity " of existing international aid programs in Afghanistan .
The U.S. also would try to impose greater measures of accountability to " trace the investment and the payoff for the American taxpayers and for the people on the ground , " she said .
" We recognize we 're starting at a point where there is very little credibility for a lot of what 's already been invested , " she said .
" There are good programs within governments and good programs within NGOs [ nongovernmental organizations ] , but it is fair to say overall they have been a disappointment .
And we know that , and we 're going to have to try to get that fixed . "
The U.S. strategy also emphasizes the need to combat extremism in western Pakistan .
On Friday , Obama called for legislation authorizing " $ 1.5 billion in direct support to the Pakistani people every year over the next five years -- resources that will build schools , roads and hospitals and strengthen " the Pakistani government .
" It is absolutely essential that we look at Afghanistan in conjunction with Pakistan , " Clinton said .
Japan will host a donor 's conference for Pakistan in April .
Although the role of Tuesday 's conference was to seek political support rather than pledges for Afghanistan , Clinton said the United States wants " to encourage the participants to begin thinking hard about what their contributions will be . "
Clinton said she has " no plans " to meet with Deputy Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Mehdi Akoundzadeh , who is attending the conference .
But she left open the possibility , saying she would not predict how the discussions would flow .
Although Clinton tried to keep the focus on Afghanistan , her attendance at the conference with a senior Iranian official marked the first such meeting involving the two countries as the Obama administration seeks greater engagement with Iran .
Senior U.S. officials have said cooperation on Afghanistan could provide such an opening .
Clinton noted Iran 's history of cooperating with the United States on Afghanistan since the U.S. invasion in 2001 .
In 2003 , U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad held talks with Iranian officials in Geneva , Switzerland , about how the two countries could work together .
She cited border security and counternarcotics efforts as two specific issues that " have a direct effect on Iran 's well - being . "
" We are hoping that each neighbor , friend and stakeholder who is participating will have constructive ideas about what that country will do to try to help us achieve the security and stability goals that we 've set for Afghanistan , " she said .

The crew of the International Space Station ( ISS ) tasted their own urine Wednesday - and NASA did n't even have to double - dog dare them .
Astronauts celebrated by " clinking " their drinking bags together in a traditional cheers before sipping water composed of recycled urine , sweat and atmospheric moisture .
The cheers marked the initiation of a closed loop water recycling system aboard the ISS .
NASA claims each crew member creates about a gallon of water from urine every six hours , but the source water does n't just come from the space station 's human occupants .
" Lab animals on the ISS breathe and urinate , too , and we plan to reclaim their waste products along with the crew's .
A full complement of 72 rats would equal about one human in terms of water reclamation , " Layne Carter , a water - processing specialist with NASA , said in a statement released by the space agency .
On NASA TV , Flight Engineer Mike Barrett confirmed " the taste is great , " as another astronaut swam through the air catching floating bubbles of the recycled water .
" This has been the stuff of science fiction , " Barrett said on the program .
" Everybody 's talked about recycling water in a closed loop system , but nobody 's ever done it before .
Here we are today with the first round of recycled water . "
Tom 's Hardware is less enthusiastic about drinking the potent potable :
While it might sound completely gross to us , the water is probably cleaner than what we drink on earth .
That being said , I ’d rather take my chances with Earth water than drink the purified urine of a rat .
Really .
Similar water purification technology was employed after the Asian tsunami in 2004 , but with large scale use there is typically a much larger gap between urine and tap .
Would you be willing to drink reclaimed urine , or are you sticking to bottled water while Evian is available ?

To slow global warming , scientists are exploring ways to pull carbon dioxide from the air and safely lock it away .
Trees already do this naturally through photosynthesis ; now , in a new report , geologists have mapped large rock formations in the United States that can also absorb CO 2 , which they say might be artificially harnessed to do the task at a vastly increased pace .
The report , by scientists at Columbia University ’s Earth Institute and the U.S. Geological Survey , shows 6,000 square miles of ultramafic rocks at or near the surface .
Originating deep in the earth , these rocks contain minerals that react naturally with carbon dioxide to form solid minerals .
Earth Institute scientists are experimenting with ways to speed this natural process , called mineral carbonation .
If the technology takes off , geologic formations around the world could provide a vast sink for heat - trapping carbon dioxide released by humans .
Lead author Sam Krevor , a graduate student working through the Earth Institute ’s Lenfest Center for Sustainable Energy , says the United States ’ ultramafic rocks could be enough to stash more than 500 years of U.S. CO2 production .
Conveniently , most of them are clustered in strips along the east and west coasts -- some near major cities including New York , Baltimore and San Francisco .
" We 're trying to show that anyone within a reasonable distance of these rock formations could use this process to sequester as much carbon dioxide as possible , " said Krevor .
So - called carbon sequestration has become a hot area of research , but so far , most work has focused on storing liquid or gaseous CO 2 underground where there is room : in saline aquifers , depleted oil wells and porous coal seams that are not commercially viable .
However , concern about leaks has scientists pursuing natural chemical reactions within the earth to turn the carbon back into a solid .
Ultramafic rocks generally form in earth ’s mantle , starting some 12 miles under the surface and extending down hundreds of miles .
Bits of these rocks — peridotite , dunite , lherzholite and others -- may be squeezed to the surface when continental plates collide with oceanic plates , or , less often , when the interiors of continents thin and develop rifts .
Because of their chemical makeup , when the rocks are exposed to carbon dioxide , they react to form common limestone and chalk .
A map accompanying the report shows that most such rocks are found in and around coastal mountain ranges , with the greatest concentrations in California , Oregon and Washington , and along the Appalachians from New England to Alabama .
Some also occur in the interior , including Montana .
Worldwide , other formations are scattered across Eurasia and Australia .
Klaus Lackner , who directs the Lenfest Center , helped originate the idea of mineral sequestration in the 1990s .
The U.S. survey is the first of what Lackner hopes will become a global mapping effort .
" It 's a really big step forward , " he said .
Krevor produced the map as part of his PhD. dissertation , with help from another Columbia student , Christopher Graves , and two USGS researchers , Bradley Van Gosen and Anne McCafferty .
By combining more than a hundred existing maps , the researchers were able to pinpoint the areas nationally where ultramafic rocks are most abundant .
Another rock , common volcanic basalt , also reacts with CO 2 , and efforts are underway to map this in detail as well .
The U.S. Department of Energy has been working on a basalt atlas for the northwestern United States as part of its Big Sky Carbon Sequestration Partnership ; extensive mapping in Washington , Oregon and Idaho has already been done through Idaho State University .
The major drawback to natural mineral carbonation is its slow pace : normally , it takes thousands of years for rocks to react with sizable quantities of CO 2 .
But scientists are experimenting with ways to speed the reaction up by dissolving carbon dioxide in water and injecting it into the rock , as well as capturing heat generated by the reaction to accelerate the process .
“ It offers a way to permanently get rid of CO 2 emissions , ” said Juerg Matter , a scientist at Columbia ’s Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory , where a range of projects is underway .
Matter and his colleague Peter Kelemen are currently researching peridotite formations in Oman , which they say could be used to mineralize as much as 4 billion tons of CO 2 a year , or about 12 percent of the world ’s annual output .
And in Iceland , Matter is about to participate in the first major pilot study on CO 2 sequestration in a basalt formation .
In May , he and three other Lamont - Doherty scientists will join Reykjavik Energy and others to inject CO 2 - saturated water into basalt formations there .
Over nine months , the rock is expected to absorb 1,600 tons of CO 2 generated by a nearby geothermal power plant .
Matter and another Lamont - Doherty scientist , David Goldberg , are also involved in a study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , which will eventually inject 1,000 tons of C0 2 into formations beneath land owned by a paper mill near Wallula , Wash .
One model is to capture CO 2 directly from power - plant smokestacks or other industrial facilities , combine it with water and pipe it into the ground , as in the upcoming Iceland project .
Lackner and his colleagues are also working on a process using “ artificial trees ” that would remove CO 2 already emitted into the atmosphere .
Combining rocks and carbon dioxide could provide an added benefit , as Krevor points out .
For decades , some large U.S. peridotite formations were mined for asbestos , used for insulation and other purposes .
After a link between asbestos and cancer was proven , the substance was banned for most uses , and the mines were closed .
Mine tailings left behind , at Belvidere Mountain in Vermont and various sites in California , provide a ready supply of crushed rocks .
These potentially hazardous tailings would be rendered harmless during the mineralization process .
The report , Mapping the Mineral Resource Base for Mineral Carbon - Dioxide Sequestration in the Conterminous United States , is available online .
Whenever we talk about Windows 7 on OSNews , you ’ll always hear me advise you to change the UAC settings by setting it to its highest level , since Windows 7 ’s default simply is n’t secure .
You might wonder why you should deal with additional prompts – what is the security risk actually like ?
Well , it ’s pretty big .
When you run Windows 7 with the default UAC level , a technique using code injection and several components in Windows 7 that can auto - elevate can totally own your system .
Microsoft gave several components in Windows 7 special privileges ( like notepad.exe and calc.exe ) in order to reduce the amount of UAC prompts in Windows .
The end result , however , is that these components can be used to bypass UAC completely , and basically get full access to your machine .
This works even on the RC .
The proof - of - concept exploit works by injecting its own code into the memory of another process , a process with auto-elevation capabilities .
This is done using standard and documented APIs .
The first proof - of - concept just copied a file to a location , but further editions could do all sorts of nasty things – and ASLR does n’t help either .
This video should give you a good idea .
Whiskey tango foxtrot , indeed .
As the writer of the proof - of - concept code explains , the UAC API is a good API , but code does require refactoring to provide a good user experience ; to not flood users with prompts .
Microsoft did not do this right in Vista , and instead of addressing this issue properly in Windows 7 , they took the easy way out by creating UAC backdoors for their own code and programs ( the UAC whitelist ) as to reduce the number of prompts .
This list is n’t configurable by the user .
This leads to this weird situation where even though Microsoft have stated that UAC is supposed to nudge developers to fix their code so that it works for limited users as well , Microsoft itself does n’t seem to want to do that .
So , to avoid having to fix their own code to work well with UAC , they cheated .
This is n’t the kind of behaviour that befits an otherwise great release .
At this point in time , the default UAC level in Windows 7 , and all levels below that , are insecure .
You might as well turn UAC off completely , as it makes no difference to have it either off or at the default level .
This entire flaw becomes null the moment you set UAC to its highest setting ( as that disables auto - elevation ) .
That ’s why I always advise you to do so .
Microsoft needs to address this issue before the release , or else malware and virus writers are going to have a field day .
It ’s exactly this kind of braindead decision making that led to years of neglect of Windows NT ’s advanced security features , creating an environment where malware and viruses could prosper .
With Vista , it seemed as if Microsoft finally got their act together , and now , with Windows 7 , they ’re throwing it all away again .
They never learn .
In an earlier article about tactics and strategies ( Simple tips to master tactics and strategies ) , we discussed in general about the importance of tactics and strategies .
Let us try to understand the importance of tactics through a practical example .
This is a game from Bundesliga tournament in 2001 :
Look at the position given hereunder , where it is the turn of Black to move .
On a curious look at the above position , you will find that the number of pieces each player has is the same .
Apart from King and Queen , both players have 1 bishop ( in same color ) , 1 knight , 2 rooks and 6 pawns each .
The black pieces are well developed , especially with Knight at c3 in a very good position , controlling more number of squares , the rooks are more centralized and the bishop is also in a good position .
In contrast , the white rooks are not in favorable position and the white bishop at g2 is more or less blocked by the knight at f3 .
The King at f1 is also vulnerable relatively moving closer to the center .
In the normal course of thinking , one might be inclined to make the following moves :
1.….. Qxf4 – ( if black does not take the queen , white may capture the queen )
2. .gxf4 b5 ( to support the Knight at c3 )
Now , let us pause for a moment and think of any possible moves that can give an opportunity to make it advantageous to the black pieces .
Some tactics that might be of use must be explored .
Tactics need not be a long one .
They might not yield the desired results always , simply because the opponent will also think on similar lines and try to have his own tactics based on his own intuition .
So , tactics basically are for a short duration of may be two or three moves with some target in mind .
Let us see whether we can use any such tactic and deviate from the normal course of moves .
This is what Grandmasters make – consider the positional factors , analyze and foresee the moves and then make a move .
Let us revisit the pieces and consider them in a different angle – positional factors .
Take a look at the back rank of White – the 1st rank .
The King at f1 is protected by two rooks – one at a1 and the other at c1 .
Look at the rook at c1 .
It is vulnerable given that the protection for that rook from Queen at f4 might not be there once the queens are exchanged .
The rook at c1 is protected by rook at a1 as well .
Now , taking advantage of the probable vulnerability of the back ranks of white , we can think of a tactic to disturb the back rank of White .
Again , look at the black rook at c8 .
If the knight at c3 is removed , black rook at c8 can attack the white rook at c1 and give a check by distracting the other rook .
So , black might consider distracting the rook at a1 by taking the pawn at a2 by Knight at c3 .
The white has two options here – either it can take the black knight by rook at a 1 or else use the rook at c1 to remove the black rook at c8 .
If white resorts to c8 x c1 , then instead of taking the white rook at c8 by black rook at d8 , black can consider taking the rook at a 1 by queen at f6 .
In such a way , more than one move and counter move must be considered as tactics .
In this case , black knight decided to take up pawn at a2 and the tactics of distracting the rooks at back rank worked out well .
Black went on to win the game as given hereunder :

Van Gogh famously painted a self - portrait with his ear bandaged
Vincent van Gogh did not cut off his own ear but lost it in a fight with fellow artist Paul Gauguin in a row outside a brothel , it has been claimed .
It has long been accepted that the mentally ill Dutch painter cut off his own ear with a razor after the row in Arles , southern France , in 1888 .
But a new book , based on the original police investigation , claims Gauguin swiped Van Gogh 's ear with a sword .
The authors argue the official version of events contains inconsistencies .
Witness statements
The book , titled In Van Gogh 's Ear : Paul Gauguin and the Pact of Silence , is the product of 10 years of research by German academics Hans Kaufmann and Rita Wildegans .
They looked at witness accounts and letters sent by the two artists , concluding that the row ended with Gauguin - a keen fencer - cutting his friend 's ear off .
Van Gogh then apparently wrapped it in cloth and handed it to a prostitute , called Rachel .
Mr Kaufmann said it was not clear whether it was an accident or a deliberate attempt to injure Van Gogh , but afterwards both men agreed to tell the police the self - harm story to protect Gauguin .
He said the traditional version of events is based on contradictory and improbable evidence , and no independent witness statement exists .
" Gauguin was not present at the supposed self - mutilation , " he told Le Figaro newspaper in France .
" As for Van Gogh , he did n't confirm anything .
Their behaviour afterwards and various suggestions by the protagonists indicate they were hiding the truth . "
Gauguin later moved to Tahiti , where he produced some of his most famous works .
Van Gogh died in 1890 after shooting himself in the chest .

( CNN ) -- Postal authorities say a Michigan postal worker has admitted to stealing some $ 20,000 worth of first - class stamps since September and trying to sell them to online auction - site customers to help pay his mortgage .
An arrest warrant has been issued for John Auito , 42 , of Macomb , Michigan .
Auito , a postal employee since 2003 , resigned after investigators confronted him on April 30 .
He has made arrangements to turn himself in , authorities said .
Deputy Special Agent - in - Charge Breck Nowlin of the USPS Office of the Inspector General told CNN that Auito has admitted to stealing stamps that were being shipped to retail stores , and he said he used the money from selling them to make delinquent mortgage payments .
Nowlin said Auito was contacting customers of the online auction site eBay , and offering to sell them stolen stamps at below - retail prices .
A call from CNN to a listing in Macomb , Michigan , for John Auito was not answered .

MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) --
From the uncertainty that followed the breakup of the Soviet Union , a newly invigorated Russia has emerged , displaying unprecedented political , military and economic confidence that has , at times , put it on a collision course with the West .
A resurgent Russia has been flexing its military , political and economic muscles .
With no sign of strongman Vladimir Putin taking a political backseat , Russia looks set to continue its bid to regain superpower status , providing that its citizens can endure the crippling impact of the global financial crisis and shrug off fears that their newfound freedoms , outlook and relative prosperity will be short - lived .
Here CNN Moscow Correspondent Matthew Chance explains what has driven Russia 's re-emergence , how this has affected its role on the world stage , and what can be expected from the country in the future .
Q : What has been the driving factor behind Russia 's resurgence ?
A : Affluence was behind Russia 's resurgence , but there 's a real sense in which the global financial crisis has checked Russia 's aspirations of a return to superpower status .
Before the downturn , the booming price of commodities , such as gas and oil , of which Russia is big supplier , fueled prosperity and gave Russians a confidence they had n't previously enjoyed .
It also saw the Kremlin being taken much more seriously on the international stage , inserting itself into Middle East peace talks , the Iranian nuclear issue and a host of other issues .
It has also encouraged Russia to assert its presence in what is known as the near - abroad -- the former Soviet states .
Many of those states want to move towards NATO and Europe , but Russia wants to keep them within its sphere of influence .
The obvious example of this is Russia 's war last year with Georgia .
After Georgia announced its intentions to sign up to NATO , Russia launched a military offensive much to the dismay of the international community .
Q : Is there a change of atmosphere in Russia these days ; are people more optimistic about the future than they were 10 or 15 years ago ?
A : Despite the financial crisis , people enjoy a lot more freedom and a lot more prosperity than they did 15 years ago , but there 's a deep - seated insecurity among Russians that it could all -- the money , the freedom -- come to an end .
Watching their currency collapse by 30 percent over the last year , unemployment soar 10 percent and industrial output plunge has made Russians very uncomfortable about the future .
At the moment people do n't see an end to the hardship .
At the same time , the Kremlin has spent a lot of its hard currency softening the blow of the crisis , bolstering pensions and the welfare system , and that 's been appreciated by many Russians too .
Q : Is there much rose - tinted reminiscing about the past ?
A : There is on lots of levels , certainly among Russia 's pensioners , who gave their lives to the cause of communism , fought in World War II against Nazi Germany and perhaps enjoyed a privileged position in Soviet society .
Do n't Miss In - depth : Eye on Russia
There 's a great sense of loss about the collapse and nostalgia about what were seen as the good things : strength , order and global power .
The younger Russians did n't have that experience of the Soviet Union .
Nevertheless , icons of that period such as former Soviet leader Josef Stalin are still viewed with affection by many people in part because of what he represented : Russia as a world power .
The idea that he oversaw brutal oppression is very much ignored .
Q : Are there any changes in the way Russia sees the rest of the world ?
A : Yes , not least because in the Soviet period people did n't get to travel overseas and foreigners always viewed Russia with suspicion .
This has started to change noticeably .
Russians are more visibly internationally .
They go on holiday all over the world : Turkey , Thailand , the South of France , the Caribbean .
They are much more assimilated into the global village than they ever were during the Soviet period .
This has broadened people 's minds here and made them much more tolerant in their global outlook in general .
Q : Will Vladimir Putin remain key to Russia 's future ?
A : There is very little doubt in the mind of most Russians that Vladimir Putin remains not only a central figure in the country 's decision making , but is perhaps the main decision maker .
A recent opinion poll by an independent Levada - Center showed that 24 percent of Russians consider Putin to have the real power , compared to just 12 percent for his hand - picked successor , President Dmitry Medvedev .
As for the future , in the past year since Medvedev was sworn in , there is very little sign he has stamped his mark .
It still looks to domestic and international audiences that Putin is calling the shots .
At this point it 's hard to see any evidence that the situation is going to change .
George Bush
Since leaving the White House and moving to Dallas , the former president has almost completely stepped out of public life .
He has decided that , unlike Cheney , it is more dignified to maintain his silence about Barack Obama 's presidency .
On the day that Obama and Cheney were trading speeches , he was speaking to high school children in New Mexico , telling them he found it a strange experience walking his dog Barney in the new neighbourhood , with a plastic bag for picking up its droppings .
Condoleezza Rice
Survived the length of the Bush administration , first as national security adviser and then as secretary of state .
She is blamed by right - wingers for shifting Bush away from neo-conservatism to a more pragmatic view of the world in his second term .
Rice came from the academic world and returned there last March , to teach political science at Stanford .
Paul Wolfowitz
The former deputy defence secretary was one of the leading neo-conservatives , advocating the invasion of Iraq .
After losing his job , he became head of the World Bank , where his tenure proved divisive and he was eventually forced out in a scandal over a job for his girlfriend .
He is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute .
Donald Rumsfeld
Although not ideologically a neo- conservative , the former defence secretary often found himself in alliance with them , in particular over the Iraq invasion .
He attended the White House correspondents ' dinner this month , but otherwise is not seen much around Washington since being sacked by Bush .
Rumsfeld has talked about writing his memoirs but so far does not appear to have been offered a contract .
He spent a year at Stanford University in California studying events post September 11 .
Colin Powell
Bush 's secretary of state in his first term , which included the invasion of Iraq .
His reputation has not recovered from his performance at the United Nations when he claimed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
Powell supported Barack Obama rather than John McCain during the election .
The conservative radio commentator Rush Limbaugh has questioned his Republican credentials , as did Cheney , who earlier this month said pointedly : " I did n't know he was still a Republican . "
The tax goes to Ireland , where the corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent is considerably lower than the US threshold of 35 per cent and Australia 's 30 per cent .
That explains why Google Ireland reported a whopping € 5.2 billion ( $ 9.2 billion ) turnover for the year ending December 31 , 2007 .
It is thanks to the likes of Google that Ireland was able to call itself the Celtic tiger , and not a Celtic pussycat .
This simple transfer pricing arrangement has allowed Google to claim its Australian revenues are $ 90 million when the real figure is much , much larger .
The problem is that no one really knows how much revenue it gets from its Australian operations .
The US Securities and Exchange Commission stipulates any country that contributes more than 10 per cent of a company 's revenues must be broken out in its accounts .
That explains why the only two countries that are listed on Google Inc 's accounts are the US and Britain , leaving the other 23 countries in which it operates largely in the dark .
Depending on who you talk to , estimates of the size of Google 's business in Australia vary from $ 600 million to $ 800 million .
Every quarter , Google plays a game with PricewaterhouseCoopers , the auditor commissioned by an industry body to collate figures from all the major online businesses , including Google .
In order for PricewaterhouseCoopers to build an accurate picture of the market 's size , the online businesses , which include Fairfax , News Ltd , Yahoo ! and Sensis , supply the auditors with their revenue figures in confidence .
All but Google , that is .
So it is left to the man from PricewaterhouseCoopers to play a little game , where he rings Google and quotes a figure back to a senior executive .
He is then told whether he is hot or cold .
Google 's profit margins in Australia are among the highest in the world at 70 per cent , so the company is avoiding a possible tax bill in Australia of up to $ 160 million .
Last year it paid just $ 3.9 million .
And Google is not alone .
eBay bills out of Switzerland , Yahoo !
Search Marketing also bills out of Ireland , Facebook bills out of the US .
Microsoft uses an Irish subsidiary , Round Island One , which reportedly controls about $ US16 billion ( $ 20 billion ) of Microsoft assets .
They are all doing it .
But for how much longer is uncertain .
Two weeks ago the US President , Barack Obama , called for an end to the practice by 2011 .
In Britain , Google is feeling the heat from politicians and the media after a newspaper revealed the company was paying only £ 600,000 in tax ( $ 1.2 million ) on local revenues of £ 1.2 billion .
Furthermore , Google Ireland is owned by entities based in the tax haven of Bermuda .
The Australian Tax Office 's insouciance with this situation is breathtaking ; there 's even a website advising companies on how they can get away with it .
The Tax Office declined an opportunity to comment , as did all of the companies involved .
The irony is that the very people Google sees as its future customer base - small businesses - are taxpayers .
Google 's informal company motto is : " Do n't be evil " .
Put that in your search engine , Google , and smoke it .

While on ABC’s This Week , former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said that the stories about the Obama ’s dog were stupid , and asked who cares ?
Believe it or not Mr. Speaker , some people , especially kids , care .
More importantly , after eight years of gloom and doom , America just wants to have a little fun .
Gingrich had no time for the puppy talk , “ I hope that the girls love the dog .
I hope the family and all the pressure they are going to be in finds it useful , and I think this whole thing is fairly stupid .
It ’s great that they have a dog .
It ’s great that the kids are adjusting , and where they got it from who cares .
It was a nice gesture on Sen .
Kennedy ’s part to give it to them , but who cares , and of course now they have done their liberal gesture because they donated money to the pound . ”
From a strictly political point of view this story is total fluff , but I can tell you who cares about this story .
Kids care .
One of the nice things about having children living in the White House again is that it gives kids around the country an emotional connection to their government .
When Mr. and Mrs. Obama are mentioned by kids , they always mention their daughters .
Advertisements
For children , a new puppy is a big deal .
It is natural that they would be interested in the kind of dog that the Obamas were going to get .
I think that anything , even a puppy , that helps humanize the White House and the government for children is a good thing .
Gingrich is expressing some sour grapes over the kind of pop culture coverage that Obama is getting .
After the scandal plagued Clinton years , and the secrecy and mistrust of the Bush years , people are hungry for a president and First Family that they can like .
Many Americans want to feel good about the president and the presidency again , and they have embraced Obama much for the same reason that so many were motivated by his message of hope .
A majority of people in this country want to believe in the president again .
Sure stories about Bo Obama the First Dog are frivolous , but after all the gloom and doom of the Bush years , the nation wants to have a little fun .
It is nice to have a president that is respected around the world , but it is much more important to have a president who lends respect to the office at home .
It is no coincidence that one of the presidents that Obama is compared to most often is Ronald Reagan , because it has been since Reagan that the nation had a president who did n’t embarrass it in some way .
I have a hunch that Newt Gingrich would think that the coverage of the First Dog was great if a Republican president was getting the press .
Searchology Google has rolled out its answer to Twitter 's much - discussed real - time search .
Beginning today , the world 's largest search engine will offer a new " search options " page that gives users the power to instantly sort results according to certain , predefined criteria .
Among other things , you can leap to what Google describes as the most recent results matching your particular query .
" You really need some type of slice and dice mechanism , " Google golden child Marissa Mayer told reporters this morning at the company 's annual Searchology shindig inside its Mountain View , California headquarters .
" So when you get your search results from Google , you need to be able to say ‘ I really just want the most recent ’ or ‘ I really just want reviews ’ - to slice and dice search results so that you can experience and visualize them in an entirely new and enriched way . "
In theory , when you type a keyword into Google.com , you 'll now be greeted with a " show options " link that takes you straight to Mayer 's slice - and - dice page .
( If you do n't see it , you can kick the proverbial tires here ) .
Halfway down the new page , you 'll find a " recent results " link , which lets you browse , well , recent results .
And " recent " could mean anything .
" These are actually a combination of recent and relevant , " Google associate product manager Nundu Janakiram told The Reg .
" What we 're trying to do here is pick the best of the most timely . "
As Janakiram spoke , a Tweet appeared at the top of his display .
But he downplayed Twitter 's influence on the new recent results play .
" It 's certainly important that we try to crawl as much information as possible whenever it 's relevant ...
If we crawl Twitter and it's a great source of relevant content that 's fresh , we 'll use it . "
Many a pundit suspects that Google will one day purchase Twitter , if only to tap its ability to instantly search the world 's Web2.0rhea .
But Google chief executive Eric Schmidt seemed to pour cold water on the idea earlier this year , calling Twitter a " poor man 's email . "
As you could in the past , via Google 's Advanced Search page , the new search options page also lets you browse relevant links from the past 24 hours , the past week , or the past year .
And there are all sorts of other ways to slice and dice .
You can narrow your search to videos , forums , reviews , images , and more .
Google even takes a stab at so - called visual search , offering a new interface that automatically sorts results in various sub-categories and lays them out in a kind of graphical map .
Think Kartoo - without the cartoon - ish icons .
Google calls it the Wonder Wheel .
" It gives you spatial arrangements of things , and as you start clicking through , one of the benefits of these spatial arrangements is that we keep a trail of where you came from , " Janakiram told us .
" At any time , you can go back to where you were .
You get this sort of path of what you 've searched . "
They 're gonna throw it back to you : Google 's Wonder Wheel
Mayer and team also announced the addition of something called " rich snippets " to Google 's main search engine .
Basically , Google now recognizes two microformat standards : RDFa ( Resource Description Framework ) and , yes , Microformat .
If a web page offers up metadata coded in these formats , Google may or may not use it to slip relevant information just below a hyperlink on its results page .
At the moment , Google is targeting review sites like Yelp and Cnet and so - called people sites like LinkedIn and Facebook .
A rich snippet may be a Yelp ranking or a Linked In job title .
In a way , Google is following in the footsteps of Yahoo ! 's Search Monkey effort .
But unlike Yahoo ! ,
Google wo n't give webmasters the power to monkey with their own search results .
Webmaster can add microformat data to their sites , and Google will pick and choose what it likes .
" First and foremost , when we were working on this , we were trying to figure out how we serve the user , " product manager Kavi Goel told us .
" Part of the reason that we 've done it in a fairly limited and subtle way to begin with is because we 've done a lot of testing .
With every piece of information we show , we 've done some sort of validation to make sure that that 's actually helpful or people to understand more about the page and decide whether they should click .
" We 're encouraging more sites to markup their information on their page in this way .
Then we can apply our own algorithms and policies to decide when it 's relevant to users . "
Like the new search options page , rich snippets were scheduled to be available to most users sometime on Tuesday . ®
The phrase “ delusions of grandeur ” is often used in casual conversation to describe a person who imagines him or herself to be more important or more powerful than he or she really is , but it is more accurately used to describe a very real and potentially very serious mental health imbalance .
Medically speaking , delusions of grandeur are manifestations of a psychopathological condition in which a person has fantasies of power , wealth , and omnipotence that can hinder social engagement and impair sound decision - making .
People who suffer from this condition — which is sometimes also called “ megalomania ” — often also have an inflated sense of self - esteem , and may hold an obsession with grandiose or extravagant things or actions .
Even when they are presented with evidence contradicting their delusions , they will still typically cling to their erroneous beliefs .
Treatment is often possible through therapy and the use of certain anti-psychotic drugs , and with the proper care people who suffer from this imbalance are often able to lead functional and happy lives .
A mentally ill person who thinks he 's Napoleon is an example of someone with delusions of grandeur .
Characteristics of the Condition
When a person has clinically recognized delusions of grandeur , he will often believe that he has extraordinary powers or may believe himself to be famous .
He will typically assume that people around him know who he is , and may also believe that they are admiring him .
One of the hallmarks of this condition is a sense of innate superiority , be it through physical abilities , wealth , or personal connections .
Some of the most extreme forms of the disorder cause people to believe that they are famous historical figures .
The mentally ill person who truly thinks that he is Napoleon may be one of the most common media references made to this delusion .
Cognitive therapy might help patients change patterns of delusional logic .
Patients who firmly possess such unrealistic beliefs may eventually harm themselves physically , mentally , or emotionally .
A person who thinks he has special powers , for example , might jump off a building because he genuinely believes he can fly .
Isolation from family and friends is also quite common .
Delusions of grandeur may be the sign of a serious mental health condition .
Primary Causes
It ’s usually somewhat rare for these sorts of delusions to happen all on their own , which is to say , not as a symptom of some other , usually larger mental health imbalance .
A number of different psychological conditions and disorders can include these sorts of delusions , though they attach perhaps most frequently to narcissistic personality disorder .
Narcissistic personality disorder is a condition in which a person is extremely preoccupied with himself and has inflated feelings of self - importance .
People with delusions of grandeur are often seen as selfish and egotistical .
Megalomania is also sometimes found in patients with varying degrees of dementia and psychotic or depressive disorders , such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia .
In some cases , delusions of fame and fortune are accompanied by other more negative feelings , including those of persecution , in which the patient thinks others are out to get him .
Issues with control may also surface , in which the patient believes an outside force is controlling his thoughts or actions .
Some drugs , especially phencyclidine ( PCP ) and amphetamines , may also contribute to or exacerbate episodes .
This is especially dangerous because users who are high may believe they have powers that will enable them to perform dangerous feats that a normal human being could not , such as flying off a tall building or stopping an oncoming train with one hand .
Treatment Options
Treating this condition can be somewhat difficult since so much depends on the root cause or larger mental health condition at play .
The first thing that any care provider will typically do is come up with a diagnosis for the underlying condition , and begin treatment for that .
It ’s often the case that the delusions will fade over time once things begin to rebalance .
Talk therapy is used in many cases , although people with this condition often feel they do not need the help .
When the megalomania is caused by chronic drug use , delusions and other psychological effects usually disappear over time once the chemicals and the effects of addiction wear off .
Problems of Public Perception
The term " delusions of grandeur " is often used non-technically and incorrectly , as are the names of many serious mental health conditions like “ anti-social . ”
It is sometimes used to describe people who are disliked dictators of countries , prominent businessmen , or celebrities ; these sorts of people are often seen to be selfish and egotistical .
Misusing the term in this way can be dangerous , though , since it could mask or even underplay situations in which actual delusions present a very real psychopathological threat to a person 's health .
Saw Flight 0 f the Conchords live last night , it was freakin awesome .
I happened to be seated right in front of Flip and MacArthur from The Local Landing .
I ’ve been talking to these guys online a little recently and it was a crazy coincidence to meet them there in person .
Twenty - third century warfare is n't all it 's cracked up to be .
You'd think that weapons and tactics would have progressed in 200 years .
But the new Star Trek movie shows that the United Federation of Planets has a lot to learn about warfare .
A military analysis of young Cadet Kirk 's War is n't easy .
Director J.J. Abrams ' frenetic rock 'em , sock 'em style can be tough to follow .
But here is * Star Trek ' *s vision of future warfare .
( Warning : all sorts of spoilers ahead . )
* The villainous Romulan ship pulverizes Federation vessels with volleys of torpedoes .
Yet no Federation warship employs electronic jammers , decoys or point defense phasers .
Very depressing .
Two hundred years later , missile defense still does n't work .
* But why does the Romulan ship need torpedoes ?
If its energy drill can bore holes through planets , then it can slice a starship like a phaser through butter .
Future humans must still learn to master dual - use technology .
* Speaking of phasers :
The ones in the movie fire bolts of energy , like in Star Wars .
What happened to the Marvin - the - Martian - style disintegrator beams from the original Star Trek ?
Perhaps someone realized that disintegrating bulkheads in a pressurized starship in deep space is n't the safest way to fight .
* There is only one scene in the movie where phasers are ordered to be set on stun .
Otherwise , everyone cheerfully uses lethal force .
The classic * Star Trek *rules of engagement are out the window .
* Kirk and his team are dropped from the Enterprise orbiting above Vulcan , and then deploy parachutes once they 're in the atmosphere .
I can see not swatting Kirk with torpedoes or the energy drill .
But again , some point defense phasers on the Romulan ship might have swatted them .
At least Heinlein 's Starship Troopers had self - contained , individual jump capsules for its troops .
* No one loves the Department of Homeland Security .
But just look what happens when DHS is n't around !
Poor Vulcan had no evacuation plans or Code Orange threat warnings .
* BTW , where the heck are Vulcan 's orbital defenses ?
Would n't logic demand some planetary protection ?
The Federation receives a report that an alien vessel destroyed 47 Klingon warships .
That vessel next appears at Vulcan , and Starfleet only sends seven ships against it ?
Kirk is n't the only one with an inflated ego .
* Vulcan must have relied on the Federation , whose main fleet happened to be cruising in a different part of the galaxy .
Seems like the Federation is a little big to be covered by one fleet .
Want to bet that the head of Federation strategic planning is named Rumsfeld ?

A soldier from North Texas is making national headlines and proving that real men do wear pink undies .
An Associated Press photographer captured 19 - year - old Army specialist Zachary Boyd fighting off a Taliban ambush in Afghanistan -- in his underwear .
The photo of Boyd , clad in the pink " I * heart * NY " printed boxers ended up on Tuesday 's front page of the New York Times .
His mother , who lives in Keller , said her son was sleeping when someone opened fire on his base and he did n't have time to put on his uniform or boots .
Boyd called his parents on Monday to let them know he might be in the paper .

I do n’t want to start a holy war here , but what is the deal with you Mac fanatics ?
I ’ve been sitting here at my freelance gig in front of a Mac ( a 8600/300 w/64 Megs of RAM ) for about 20 minutes now while it attempts to copy a 17 Meg file from one folder on the hard drive to another folder .
20 minutes .
At home , on my Pentium Pro 200 running NT 4 , which by all standards should be a lot slower than this Mac , the same operation would take about 2 minutes .
If that .
In addition , during this file transfer , Netscape will not work .
And everything else has ground to a halt .
Even BBEdit Lite is straining to keep up as I type this .
I wo n’t bore you with the laundry list of other problems that I ’ve encountered while working on various Macs , but suffice it to say there have been many , not the least of which is I ’ve never seen a Mac that has run faster than its Wintel counterpart , despite the Macs ’ faster chip architecture .
My 486/66 with 8 megs of ram runs faster than this 300 mhz machine at times .
From a productivity standpoint , I do n’t get how people can claim that the Macintosh is a superior machine .
Mac addicts , flame me if you ’d like , but I ’d rather hear some intelligent reasons why anyone would choose to use a Mac over other faster , cheaper , more stable systems .

No place for traditional publishers in digital market - Lau - Kee " Blood - sucking leeches " bring nothing to digital distribution that developers can't do themselves , says Kerb and Unity exec
Matt Martin Wednesday 29th April 2009
Share this article Share
Traditional videogame publishers have no place in the digital distribution market , and have done themselves a disservice by taking advantage of the development community now spearheading growth in emerging online services .
That 's the opinion of David Lau - Kee , co-founder of Renderware developer Criterion , ex-Electronic Arts VP and now an executive for browser games outfit Kerb Games and tools provider Unity .
" Traditional publishers are blood - sucking leeches who have no place in the future of digital distribution , " said Lau - Kee , during a panel discussion on digital distribution held last night at BAFTA headquarters .
" If you look at what traditionally publishers have brought to the party – finance , marketing , distribution , taking a huge margin , and not necessarily in that order .
And they own the IP as well . "
What used to be considered publisher strengths – marketing games and established relationships with bricks and mortar retailers – are no longer important to a digital market , said Lau - Kee , who encouraged independent studios to bring as many aspects of the business in - house as possible .
" When it comes to traditional marketing , it 's so yesterday in this new world .
We no longer care about what authority tells us , the verticality of authority telling us to ' buy this ' just does n't work today at all , " he said .
" Now we care about what our peers say , we care about what our friends are playing .
That 's what works .
Guerilla and viral marketing is a huge part of that .
There 's nothing that traditional publishers can tell us about that type of marketing because a lot of it comes from grass roots . "
He continued : " When it comes to channels , what they previously had was really nice relationships with retailers .
Again , retailers are largely put to one side when it comes to digital distribution , so we do n't need publishers for that either .
There are some who are reinventing that are much more interesting , but it could be something that a developer can do itself .
You really need to take a close look at what a publisher is going to bring other than finance . "
Publishers that have left development partners disillusioned through questionable business practices and are unwilling to change their relationships with game makers wo n't see success in the digital market , said Lau - Kee .
" Anybody who 's been in game development for some amount of time is gong to have legion of terrible stories about bad publishing deals and how they were ripped off or not paid .
The publishing industry has done itself a huge disservice over the last 10 or 15 years "
Company 's such as ngmoco , the iPhone publisher founded by another former EA exec Neil Young , is a good example of a business willing to address the change in relationships between publisher and developer , said Lau - Kee .
" I say traditional publishers because there are some who are looking to do it in a slightly different fashion and I think there 's some validity there .
It 's not to say there has n't been some great success stories , but publishers today are having to reinvent themselves . "
" ngmoco is doing a great job of that .
That 's interesting because Neil Young came from a very traditional publisher , and said we 'll do things in a different fashion , and one of those is figure out how we engage with the development community in a different way . "
" There are other publishers out there who are trying to do different things as well , " he offered .
2 But a lot are completely unreconstructed , and I do n't have the time of day for them at all .
I think they miss the point entirely because when it comes to finance , maybe that 's the only thing they can bring .
But other models now are coming forward that no longer have you spending ten or15 million dollars to spend on a game , you can do it for much less than that . "
Up to 25 times more victims than official figure , hospitals overwhelmed , virus already at level 6 pandemic phase
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , April 30 , 2009
A doctor in Texas claims that swine flu cases are at least ten times worse than officials are letting on , and that hospitals are becoming overwhelmed as the virus has already crossed the threshold to be considered a phase 6 global pandemic .
Dr. Marcus Gitterle , an emergency medicine physician based out of New Braunfels , Texas , sent out an internal alert which contains several stunning claims about swine flu that , if true , officials have presumably sought to keep from the public .
“ After I returned from a public health meeting yesterday with community leaders and school officials in Comal County and Hays County , ( name removed ) suggested I send an update to my patients in the area , because what we are hearing privately from the CDC and Health Department is different from what you are hearing in the media , ” writes Gitterle .
The doctor claims that the actual number of confirmed cases of swine flu is 10 to 25 times worse than has been reported , and that people are not recovering easily , as has been claimed , but that many Americans are in fact seriously ill .

A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ The way they fudge on reporting this is that it takes 3 days to get the confirmatory nod from the CDC on a given viral culture , but based on epidemiological grounds , we know that there are more than 10 cases for each “ confirmed ” case right now , ” claims Gitterle .
“ This has not been in the media , but a 23 month old in Houston is fighting for his life , and a pregnant woman just south of San Antonio is fighting for her life , ” he writes .
Gitterle ’s mention of a “ 23 month old in Houston ” obviously refers to the Mexican toddler who died on Monday night and was announced as the first U.S. fatality on Tuesday morning .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Quick access to drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza , as well as ventilators , is preventing fatalities on the scale of Mexico , but Gitterle warns that “ within a couple of weeks , regional hospitals will likely become overwhelmed ” .
Gitterle warns , “ ER ’s south of here are becoming overwhelmed — and I mean that — already .
It is coming in waves , but the waves are getting bigger . ”
The doctor states that the severity of the situation has already crossed the threshold of the definition of a WHO phase 6 pandemic .
“ This has not happened in any of our lifetimes so far .
We are in uncharted territory , ” he writes .
Gitterle claims that President Obama is being advised to declare a national emergency and that this could happen within the next 48 hours .
“ This may not happen , but if it does n’t , I will be surprised .
When this happens , all public gathering will be cancelled for 10 days minimum , ” writes the doctor .
Gitterle advises people to avoid all public gatherings , especially those held indoors , to avoid going to their ER if they feel ill , and to take the nutritional supplements N - Acetyl - Cysteine and Oscillococinum .
He recommends Relenza as a more powerful drug than Tamiflu but warns that supplies of both drugs are running out fast .
The doctor states that swine flu is infectious for about two days prior to symptom onset and that the virus can spread for more than seven days after symptom onset .
The symptoms are the same as normal flu , although it has been discovered that swine flu causes a distinctive “ hoarseness ” in many victims .
“ Since it is such a novel ( new ) virus , there is no “ herd immunity , ” so the “ attack rate ” is very high .
This is the percentage of people who come down with a virus if exposed .
Almost everyone who is exposed to this virus will become infected , though not all will be symptomatic .
That is much higher than seasonal flu , which averages 10 - 15 % .
The “ clinical attack rate ” estimation from CDC and WHO may be around 40 - 50 % .
This is the number of people who show symptoms .
This is a huge number .
It is hard to convey the seriousness of this to those outside of the medical fields , ” he writes .

Comment on this article
President Obama signaled his intention Wednesday to press forward on his plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison , despite a growing challenge from both political parties and a limited set of options to make his detainee policy work .
In a sign of his lost momentum , the Senate on Wednesday voted 90 to 6 to block funding for the shutdown .
The vote followed criticism that the administration was backtracking on Americans ’ security .
But Obama , in a bid to retake the initiative , plans an address today to forcefully defend his proposal for closing Guantanamo by year ’s end .
In the morning speech at the National Archives in Washington , he also will address prospects for a controversial proposal to hold detainees indefinitely without trial , if necessary , and will reassert his argument that closing the prison would advance U.S. security .
“ The president signed an order early in his administration to close it , and he intends to keep that promise , ” said White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs .

In a possible sign of a new approach , an administration official said that for the first time , a Guantanamo detainee is being sent to the U.S. to stand trial in a criminal court .
Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , a Tanzanian captured in Pakistan in 2004 , had been indicted by a federal grand jury in New York on allegations that he took part in attacks on two U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998 .
Obama met with leaders of human rights organizations Wednesday as Congress debated the issue and the White House planned its response .
Since Obama ’s decision four months ago to close the prison , few new options have emerged to ease the way to a shutdown .
To clear the political logjam , the administration and Congress face difficult and politically unpopular choices .
“ The president is going to have to spend political capital ; he will have to lean on people and call out the political cowards , ” said John D. Hutson , a retired Navy admiral and judge advocate general who advised Obama on detention policy during his presidential campaign .
“ He is going to have to regain the high ground and the initiative .
He had the initiative and it slipped away . ”

The administration ’s counterattack began Wednesday , when a top Pentagon official challenged the growing congressional opposition to moving detainees to the U.S. , saying some detainees must be placed in mainland prisons .
“ This is a case where we need to ask members of Congress to take a more strategic view , ” said Michele Flournoy , undersecretary of Defense for policy .
“ Many of these members called for the closing of Guantanamo , and we need their partnership in making that possible . ”
But Republicans seized on remarks Wednesday by FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III , who told Congress that detainees could pose risks in U.S. prisons , such as radicalizing others .
Mueller , appointed by former President George W. Bush , also noted that convicted criminals had run gangs from within prisons , suggesting that terrorists could coordinate attacks from behind bars .
Democratic lawmakers and human rights activists said that Obama must use today ’s speech to recover ground lost to the GOP in the Guantanamo debate .
By expanding public support for his plan , he can avert future battles , they said .

“ One thing he has to do is begin to articulate the specifics of a plan for closing Guantanamo , ” said Mark Mellman , a Democratic pollster .
“ The Hill needs to hear that . ”
The administration has been caught up in a series of national security controversies in recent weeks .
Liberals have criticized its reluctance to punish architects of the Bush administration ’s detention policies , its refusal to release photos of harsh interrogations , and its decision to stick with the Bush administration ’s military commissions .
Conservatives have denounced Obama ’s policies , charging that the president has lowered the nation ’s defenses and made terrorist attacks more likely .
Former Vice President Dick Cheney , a frequent critic , is scheduled to speak today to the American Enterprise Institute , a Washington think tank .
U.S. trials are seen as one solution to the detainee puzzle .
A U.S. court trial in New York for Ghailani , indicted in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , and Nairobi , Kenya , has been planned but was just announced .

“ This was approved well before today and has been in the works for some time , but now we ’re in the position to make a final determination , ” the administration official said .
Gibbs said that Obama would not release a lengthy report today on his plan for Guantanamo .
But experts and analysts said that clearing the political and legal logjam will probably require the Obama administration to endorse additional policies unpopular with its political allies .
For instance , with few nations volunteering to accept prisoners , the administration may have to transfer some back to their home countries -- even at the risk that those suspects could be abused in prison or be released to rejoin fighting against the U.S .
The Pentagon thinks that dozens of the more than 500 detainees released have gone back to militant activity .
The most recent Pentagon figures put the return rate at 11 % .
The New York Times reported Wednesday on its website that an unreleased report shows that about 14 % have returned to the fight .

The administration also is considering ways to hold detainees in the U.S. without trial .
Two national security officials confirmed that administration officials were likely to establish a policy of detention without trial for at least some of the Guantanamo detainees .
The administration has created several task forces to examine detention and interrogation policies , and officials said the groups were wrestling with various proposals to hold detainees without traditional U.S. trials or military commissions .
The task forces are to complete their work in July .
Another senior administration official said that some form of detention without trial was likely because , with some suspects , officials have little evidence that was not acquired through coercive techniques .
Even in those cases , however , officials are searching for ways to assess detainees ’ past actions and future risk .
“ Even if there is no evidence that will stand up in a criminal court , it could be possible that they could be adjudicated in some other system , and there are a range of options , ” said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because no administration official is authorized to speak publicly about the internal deliberations .
Advertisement
Options include an administrative court based on international treaty rules , or another kind of national security court .
The fight over who can be held and for how long will probably be difficult , said John B. Bellinger III , the former State Department legal advisor who pushed for Guantanamo ’s closure during the Bush years .
“ Assuming President Obama does not back off his plan to close Guantanamo , the big fight will really be over the legal rules for holding the detainees when they are moved to the United States , ” Bellinger said .
Tom Malinowski , Washington advocacy director of Human Rights Watch , said his organization thought that suspects who must be detained for long periods should be tried in the U.S .
Advertisement
“ The more we try to create something new , the greater the risk of challenge and defeat , ” he said .
“ In the short term , it may be easier to detain potentially dangerous people if you design a system specifically for that purpose .
But in the longer term , the risk of having to release those people is greater because the system could collapse . ”

Installing Lighttpd With PHP5 And MySQL Support On Debian Lenny
Lighttpd is a secure , fast , standards - compliant web server designed for speed - critical environments .
This tutorial shows how you can install Lighttpd on a Debian Lenny server with PHP5 support ( through FastCGI ) and MySQL support .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 Preliminary Note
In this tutorial I use the hostname server1.example.com with the IP address 192.168.0.100 .
These settings might differ for you , so you have to replace them where appropriate .
2 Installing MySQL 5.0
First we install MySQL 5.0 like this :
aptitude install mysql - server mysql-client
You will be asked to provide a password for the MySQL root user - this password is valid for the user [ email protected ] as well as [ email protected ] , so we do n't have to specify a MySQL root password manually later on :
New password for the MySQL " root " user : <-- yourrootsqlpassword
Repeat password for the MySQL " root " user : <-- yourrootsqlpassword
3 Installing Lighttpd
Lighttpd is available as a Debian package , therefore we can install it like this :
aptitude install lighttpd
Now direct your browser to http://192.168.0.100, and you should see the Lighttpd placeholder page :
Lighttpd 's default document root is / var / www on Debian , and the configuration file is /etc/ lighttpd/lighttpd.conf .
Additional configurations are stored in files in the /etc / lighttpd / conf - available directory - these configurations can be enabled with the lighttpd - enable - mod command which creates a symlink from the /etc / lighttpd / conf - enabled directory to the appropriate configuration file in /etc / lighttpd / conf - available .
You can disable configurations with the lighttpd - disable - mod command .
4 Installing PHP5
We can make PHP5 work in Lighttpd through FastCGI .
Fortunately , Debian provides a FastCGI - enabled PHP5 package which we install like this :
aptitude install php5-cgi
5 Configuring Lighttpd And PHP5
To enable PHP5 in Lighttpd , we must modify /etc/ php5/cgi/ php.ini and add the line cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1 right at the end of the file :
vi /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini
[...] cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1
To enable the fastcgi configuration ( which is stored in /etc/ lighttpd/conf-available/10-fastcgi.conf ) , run the following command :
lighttpd - enable - mod fastcgi
This creates a symlink /etc/ lighttpd/conf-enabled/10-fastcgi.conf which points to /etc/ lighttpd/conf-available/10-fastcgi.conf :
ls -l /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled
server1:/usr / bin# ls -l /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 44 2009-03-19 15:16 10- fastcgi.conf ->
/etc/lighttpd/conf-available/10-fastcgi.conf
server1:/usr/bin#
Then we reload Lighttpd : Advertisement
For people like me with a slight anarchist streak that loves to see smarmy , self - righteous politicians squirm , this is going to be divine :
The Republican governor of Florida , Charlie Crist , who is strongly considering a run for Senate , will be outed in a independent film being released today .
The film , Outrage , tracks the outings of prominent gay political figures , such as Crist and former Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman .
It ’s being produced by Magnolia Pictures and will appear in Landmark Theaters across the country .
“ Using some firsthand accounts of former sexual partners , old campaign footage ( to occasionally humorous effect ) and commentary from gay political media watchdogs , the film makes the case for each man ’s homosexuality , and presents his lifetime gay rights voting record , ” according to one reviewer .
“ In each instance , the disconnect is staggering .
“ The usual suspects are all there : Craig , Florida Governor Charlie Crist , former New York mayor Ed Koch , former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey , former Rep. Ed Schrock , even dusty McCarthy relic Roy Cohn . ”
Someone buy some popcorn and Junior Mints .
Wonkette dishes :
Charlie Crist , the governor of Florida , is known for precisely two things : being orange , and having a dreadful porn mustache in the 1970s , which was the style at the time .
Everybody likes to make jokes about how ( allegedly ! ) gay he is , jokes that were only made more hilarious by his engagement to a lady right around the time last year that John McCain was supposed to pick him as his running “ mate . ”
But Crist got passed over and he still had to marry that woman .
And people shook their heads sadly over what a mess he ’d made of things , having to marry some broad and put his suspiciously long bachelor days behind him .
It ’s that last part that ’s actually kinda sad .
In order to groom himself to be seen as a potential heavy hitter in the national GOP , Governor Crist felt like he had to marry a beard in order to hide his sexuality .
Although it ’s a bit tragic , what ’s really sad is that the GOP has become a party filled with ignorant homophobes .
Update :
To dispel any confusion , my main reason for posting this was to point to the hypocrisy of Republican leaders who embrace anti-gay policies as a way to achieve political power while secretly hiding their own gayness from the world and their constituents .
I was one of the first persons who received the log , and had been trying to figure out the link since 9:30 am this morning .
But I am in awe of Zinxx , how did he ever figure out the partner part of the link ?
Nice ..
Thanks !

Has anyone ever notice anything similar to this happening on other game boxes ?

In the United States , the Dow Jones industrial average closed at the lowest level since October 2002 on worries about a new jobs report and investor fears of government control of U.S. banks that could wipe out shareholders .
In China , a central bank official said that cutting interest rates further would be risky and might not help the economy .
Barack Obama , in his first international trip as U.S. president , met with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper in an effort to quell Canadian concerns about U.S. protectionism and talk about energy cooperation .
The latest financial scandal spread through the Americas and Europe , with Venezuela and Ecuador seizing entities tied to billionaire Allen Stanford and his far - flung empire .
Britain ’s Serious Fraud Office was monitoring a possible UK link after reports that Stanford ’s books were audited there .
Stanford was found by the FBI in Virginia on Thursday , two days after U.S. regulators accused him and his companies of selling $ 8 billion in certificates of deposit with high interest rates from his Antiguan affiliate .
He was served with a complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission but not arrested .
No criminal charges have been filed against him .
In eastern Europe , evidence mounted of governments having trouble finding sources of financing , as global economic woes have reduced the available cash to fund budget deficits , investment and domestic lending .
Romania is expected to decide later this month whether it needs to seek financing help from the European Union or the International Monetary fund .
Similar difficulties finding cash swept through Hungary , where bond yields jumped as buyers demanded a premium to invest in the region ’s wobbly economies .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that her country stood ready to help eastern European countries in financial trouble , primarily through the IMF .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the commission was “ contemplating all scenarios ” and had 15 billion euros available after previously providing a total of 9.6 billion euros to Hungary and Latvia .
The Dow fell 1.2 percent to 7,465.95 .
The S&P 500 also lost 1.2 percent .

Russia ’s government also released a report showing a struggling jobs market .
About 300,000 people lost their jobs in January , the government said , taking the total number of unemployed to 6.1 million , close to rates not seen since the socially unstable 1990s .
An index of top European shares closed slightly higher , snapping three days of losses , but well below the day ’s highs as investors faced further evidence of U.S. economic turmoil .
“ U.S. data continues to get worse and worse , and is even coming in below expectations , ” said Georgina Taylor , equity strategist at Legal & General Investment Management .
“ The last few days have highlighted that the volatility is going to continue . ”
The U.S. dollar fell against the euro , amid the relatively steady world stock markets .
U.S. crude oil futures surged 14 percent to more than $ 39 a barrel after U.S. government data showed an unexpected fall in crude inventories last week amid lower imports and higher demand .
In Britain , lower tax receipts in January drove the budget deficit to the highest level since records began in 1993 .
Policymakers at the Bank of England are grappling with how close interest rates can get to zero , Bank of England Deputy Governor John Gieve said .
He said Britain also faced a risk of entering a Japanese - style depression and that was why the bank ’s Monetary Policy Committee had cut interest rates to a record low of 1 percent this month .
In Germany , a survey showed business expectations at their lowest in 32 years .
In Asia , Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei average closed up slightly higher , a day after closing at its lowest point in nearly four months .
The Bank of Japan kept its key interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent , but extended a program to buy commercial paper to improve corporate funding and pledged to boost low cost funding .
South Korea moved to calm fears its banks might fall under the weight of foreign debts but the won weakened for the eight straight session as investors were unconvinced .

So while you were all chillin ’ out maxin ’ relaxin ’ all cool this weekend , your Congress was hard at work , you know , doing all those really important things they do , like , introducing resolutions to declare 2010 “ The National Year of the Bible . ”
Apparently Rep. Paul Broun of Georgia — the guy who introduced this , the most important bill ever — was shocked to learn that 30 million Americans are pretty much illiterate , and he figured ‘ hey , if I assign them one book a year , that ’ll solve the problem . ’
So being the modern - day LaVar Burton / Ptolemy that he is , Mr. Broun did a quick scan of his bookshelf .
The entire Twilight series ?
No .
That Robert Pattinson is just too damn sexy , and would distract everyone from reading .
Harry Potter ?
No , that ’s been done to death .
My Pet Goat ?
Too confusing .
So Mr. Broun slipped on his thinking cap , and did what any good Republican would do when faced with a tricky conundrum : he thought , what would Ronald Reagan do ?
Well it turns out Reagan actually faced the same frightening dilemma way back in 1983 , and he solved it as only Ronald Reagan could , by declaring it “ The National Year of the Bible ” .
Inspired ( as always ) by Reagan , and proving , once again that all good Republican ideas died along with the Gipper , Broun pretty much just mimeographed that legislation and offered it anew .
Of course , there are still some pretty fun “ whereas ” clauses in the bill :
Whereas many of our Presidents have recognized the importance of God and the Bible , including George Washington ; Franklin D. Roosevelt ; Harry Truman ; John F. Kennedy … and especially Abraham Lincoln , whose 200th Birthday Celebration in 2009 highlighted freedom for the slaves .
Hey , that ’s a pretty good section , right ?
Let ’s throw in some presidents who appeal to everyone .
There ’s George Washington for everyone who loves truth and the Delaware River ; FDR for socialists ; Kennedy for the Massachusetts Liberals ; oh , and hey , throw in Lincoln .
Everyone loves that guy !
Except there ’s one problem with talking up Lincoln ’s Bible and God beliefs : they ’re not all that clear .
Here ’s what John G. Nicolay , the president ’s private secretary had to say about his boss :
Mr. Lincoln did not , to my knowledge , in any way change his religious ideas , opinions , or beliefs from the time he left Springfield to the day of his death .
I do not know just what they were , never having heard him explain them in detail .
Lincoln ’s biographer — and lifelong friend — Colonel Lamon had this to say :
Never in all that time did he let fall from his lips or his pen an expression which remotely implied the slightest faith in Jesus as the son of God and the Savior of men .
Numerous scholars agree that Lincoln was a man of great and deep faith .
Some have said he prayed frequently , but the one thing almost all scholars and Lincoln contemporaries agree on is that the president was not the least bit public about his faith .
In fact , when he ran for reelection to the Illinois House of Representatives , Lincoln complained about religion intruding into the campaign :
My wife had some relations in the Presbyterian churches , and some in the Episcopal churches ; and therefore , wherever it would tell , I was set down as either one or the other , while it was everywhere contended that no Christian ought to vote for me because I belonged to no Church , and was suspected of being a Deist and had talked of fighting a duel .
So , Mr. Broun , before you go using Lincoln ’s name as a justification for “ National Year of the Bible , ” maybe get your facts straight .
It ’s unseemly and inappropriate for your resolution to call for :
Citizens of all faiths to rediscover and apply the priceless , timeless message of the Holy Scripture which has profoundly influenced and shaped the United States and its great democratic form of Government , as well as its rich spiritual heritage , and which has unified , healed , and strengthened its people for over 200 years .
That ’s what churches and other houses or worship are for ; it ’s not the job of Congress .
We get it though .
As Congress ’ minority party , Republicans feel like it ’s important to spend the overwhelming majority of their time reminding everyone that they ’re Christians .
You know what ?
We get it .
Give it a rest .
Take a hint from Abe Lincoln , and keep it to yourself for a while .
Somewhere along the way , pornographers got the idea that people only liked on - camera coitus if it had a believable back story .
And , after a few decades struggling to find good actors willing to do it on camera , the industry came up with the concept of reality porn .
So today there 's a huge selection of videos that claim to capture real random girls tricked into having sex via some set of convoluted circumstances .
But apparently , the good ideas for reality porn were taken pretty quickly , and as you 'll see , at this point they 're kind of scraping the sides of the jar .
We have censored the pictures to make them vaguely work - safe .

It 's been known since the days of the Kama Sutra that nothing gets a woman quite as aroused as a man whose dick is encrusted in bits of rubbery mozzarella cheese .
Thus , the team of physicists who crafted the perfect website , Big Sausage Pizza , were really onto something when they found a way to mix the thrill of eroticism with the greasy smell of deep dish .
Every encounter features an unsuspecting young lass ordering a pizza , then when it arrives , opening the box to discover the delivery man 's wang jammed through the bottom of both the box and the pizza .

The woman is always surprised by this , though the positioning of the rest of the man 's body in relation to the box probably should have cued her in .
Either the poor man has gotten the box glued to his groin somehow , or he has his boner poked through there .
The presence of the camera crew should probably have alerted her that something was n't on the level either way .
Most Shameful Moment :
The teaser photos in which we 're forced to acknowledge that the deliveryman , resembling a curious sort of Vince Vaughn meets Forrest Gump , is actually firmly rooted in what is not at all a delivery pizza , and is instead some manner of frozen personal pan cheese shit since the producers are too cheap to shell out for real pizza each time .

The concept of the site really does n't flesh out much beyond " bum love on a boat , " with random girls meeting the boat 's captain and being summarily rutted in a variety of ways .
Though , there is the tasteful addition of each girl being tossed overboard once her poop deck 's been swabbed , where they are presumably eaten by sharks .
These are cautionary tales , indeed .
Most Shameful Moment : Pervasive and continued reference to the boat as " SS Stabbin . "
Really , girls , when you saw that on the bow an anal defiling was really the best case scenario .

ACS Introduces A New Journal
Society 's family of physical chemistry publications will gain a letters journal
Courtesy of George Schatz / Northwestern U Schatz
In a move that reflects our increasingly digital era , the American Chemical Society will soon begin publishing its first online - only journal .
The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters will start up in January 2010 .
Northwestern University chemistry professor George C. Schatz , who is editor - in - chief of the Journal of Physical Chemistry A , B , and C , will serve in the same capacity for the new letters journal .
Prashant V. Kamat , professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame , will be deputy editor .
ACS is " starting JPC Letters in response to interest in the physical chemistry community in having a letters - only journal , which provides greater visibility to papers that need rapid communication , " Schatz says .
One criterion for acceptance will be urgency of publication , he adds .
Schatz estimates that JPC Letters will publish accepted papers in an average of seven weeks after submission .
The new peer - reviewed publication ??? s online - only format makes the most of Web features , such as links between the journal ??? s content and scientific databases , including SciFinder .
ACS is also exploring additional links between material in the letters journal and other JPC journals .
More On This Topic Press Release : A New Forum for High - Impact Results in Physical Chemistry — Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters — Debuts in January 2010
Offering the journal exclusively online makes sense given the behavior of today ??? s readers , Schatz says .
" Most readers only use the online versions of existing journals , " he notes , " so in many respects this simply conforms to an accepted publication model that already exists . "
" The online format is appropriate for this type of journal , where rapid publication is essential , and faculty and students generally prefer the online format over print , " agrees Mary Ann Mahoney , head of the chemistry and chemical engineering library at the University of California , Berkeley .
She adds that she is converting all of her library ??? s journal subscriptions to the online format , even when print is available , " due to financial and space constraints . "
Mahoney notes that " librarians are facing unprecedented pressure to reduce their spending due to severe reductions in library funding .
Unfortunately , in order to purchase this new journal , I would have to cancel even more journals than are already on my cancellation list , " she says .
" So I am not sure at this time if subscribing is feasible , " despite the publication ??? s association " with a journal as prestigious as the Journal of Physical Chemistry . "

Will the last activist who hopes the antiwar cause will re-emerge as a central tenet of the Democratic Party please turn out the lights on the way out the door ?
Little evidence exists that any antiwar movement is alive , well and influencing policy in this country .
Certainly no voice for it is coming from Barack Obama 's White House .
In fact , Obama has been pretty consistent in jerking - around antiwar crusaders , beginning with last summer 's vote as a U.S. senator for a federal surveillance law and its provision shielding telecommunications companies that cooperated in warrantless wiretaps - a law he previously opposed .
The only sound coming from the left at the time was a momentary backlash from the blogosphere .
The president reinforced his dismissal of antiwar activists last week , when he performed an enormous flip and decided to halt the release of photographs of detainee abuse .
He said that releasing the photos would put U.S. troops at risk and inflame anti-American opinion .
On April 23 , the Obama administration had said the Pentagon would hand over 44 photos of detainee abuse in Afghanistan and Iraq under the Bush administration .
Less than two years ago , the liberal public - policy group MoveOn.org ran its now - infamous " General Petraeus or General Betray Us ? " ad , accusing the four - star of exaggerating the success of the troop surge in Iraq .
Go to MoveOn.org 's website today , and ending the war is fourth behind health care , climate change and the economy in its goals for 2009 , buried in a nondescript click on the site .
" With an anti-war Democrat in the White House , the anti-war activists are cutting him some slack - for now , " said Purdue University political scientist Bert Rockman .
" I have no doubt that an anti-war movement will eventually focus on the Afghan - Pakistan front ... it will be up to Obama to explain what is at stake . "
A year from now , if circumstances have not changed or worsened on the Afghan - Pakistan front , Obama will have trouble holding the center against left - wing Democrats on one side and right - wing Republicans on the other .
So far , he has shown himself to be politically agile in explaining through reason what is at stake - but agility has its limits .
Note that the debate so far has been about tactics rather than necessities , according to Rockman .
That 's why Gen. David McKiernan was replaced as U.S. commander in Afghanistan - " not that he was an incompetent commander , but he may have been the wrong one for this kind of war . "
The Obama administration appears to be planning to wage war there with decreasing risks to Afghan civilians but likely increasing risk to our own soldiers .
There will be less high - penetration ordnance and more dependence on cultivating intelligence sources and carefully targeted strikes - " Which is why a Special Forces general is the new commander in Afghanistan , " Rockman adds .
Tactics that cause increased casualties for our troops is apt to stimulate anti-war fever , however .
" Where is Code Pink " - another liberal activist group - " or Moveon.org today ? " asks Republican strategist Alex Castellanos .
" Is it all okay if Barack Obama does it ? "
" Being against the war was something the left used to draw a bright line between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , " he says .
" But there is no cause now , because there was no cause then . "
St. Louis University law professor Joel Goldstein says the antiwar movement has lost steam for at least three reasons :
It was centered on a widespread lack of faith in the Bush administration ; real concerns about Afghanistan and Pakistan which implicate our security interests have emerged ; the economy now has the attention of the public and the media .
The left ousted Republicans who it was convinced were intent on continuing the war in Iraq , so the " antiwar effort necessarily loses its steam , " Goldstein adds .
While President Obama gingerly takes ownership of the war in Afghanistan - pumping up troop levels , hand - picking his own commander , adding Pakistan as part of the solution and the problem - he is disowning antiwar activists who voted for him , expecting him to put an end all wars .
Unfortunately for them , they have nowhere else to go , Castellanos says , " So the noise you will hear from them will be voiceless . "

As we edge toward world government , it pays to recall the Illuminati's last great social experiment , Soviet Communism , which Juri Lina describes as a " social catastrophe . "
In his book , " Under the Sign of the Scorpion " ( 2002 ) , the Estonian writer says about 150 million people died as a result of the Bolshevik Revolution , subsidized by the Illuminati ( Masonic Jewish ) banking cartel .
The West pretended to oppose the Bolsheviks but in fact defended them and betrayed the White Russians who were our allies in WWI .
The Bolsheviks would have lost except for Western intervention . ( 322 )
An additional 60 million people were murdered under Chinese Communism .
These Satanic regimes " gripped the ... people by the hair of their heads " ( Winston Churchill ) and brutally destroyed two advanced civilizations .
The Illuminati central bankers still run the world .
If " Past is Preface , " are we being set up for similar brutal treatment ?
Is this the reason why the truth about these " revolutions " is suppressed ?
Why we are being dumbed , degraded and trivialized ?
INSIDE STORY
Juri Lina claims that the USSR was ruled by Jewish gangsters .
Soviet " anti-Semitism " was the spin they put on their gang wars .
Marxist ideology was a smokescreen .
Josef Stalin was a Jew who spoke Yiddish and married Jewish women .
He was diagnosed as a " paranoid hysteric " by a doctor he murdered for revealing this .
He had an inferiority complex due to being only five foot one inch tall and employed a stand - in for public appearances .
He murdered his second wife in 1932 when she accused him of genocide .
Like Lenin , another Jew ( who died of syphilis ) Stalin was also bisexual .
( pp. 284-286 ) .
These are the freaks the Illumati bankers put in power .
Stalin was under the influence of another Jew , Lazar Kaganovich ( and married his sister . )
Kaganowich played on Stalin 's paranoia to murder over 20 million Comunist party leaders , functionaries , and army officers , especially those aware of his nefarious deeds .
Stalin and Kaganovich were after their rivals ' gold .
During the Great Terror of 1934 - 38 , NKVD
Officers began wearing a new symbol on their sleeves , a sword and serpent .
" This symbolized the struggle of the cabbalistic Jews against their enemies , " Lina writes .
" There is no devil according to the Talmud .
Satan and God are united in Yahweh . " ( 301 )
At the peak of Stalin and Kaganovich 's terror in 1937 - 38 , executions reached 40,000 a month .
Alexander Solzhenitsyn estimated a million executed and another two million died in death camps .
Literaturnaya Rossiya estimated total deaths due to murdder , induced starvation and maltreatment at 147 million , five million a year for the period 1918 - 1938 .
Lina points out that many killed were women and children who were classed as " enemies of the people . "
After all " they cost money " i.e. were " useless eaters " in Communist eyes .
Huge mass graves surround the major cities of the USSR .
One containing 100,000 bodies was found in Kuropaty , six miles from Minsk .
Every night from 1937 to June 1941 , the NKVD lined people up at the grave side , gagged abd blind - folded .
To save bullets , the executioners tried to kill two people with one shot .
( 303 )
At the peak of the terror , the NKVD began gassing people to death in lorries .
The West considered all this to be normal .
Bernard Shaw said nations had the right to eliminate undesirables .
The US ambassador to Moscow , Joseph Davies , a Freemason , was especially enthusiatic about the show trials .
( 304 )
The USSR lost an additional 35 - 45 million people during the Second World War .
The historian Nikolai Tolstoi claims that half of these were actually killed by the Bolsheviks and blamed on the Nazis .
During campaigns against counter revolutionaires in 1949 - 1952 another five million people were murdered .
( 307 )
Apart from the Holomodor ( 1932 - 32 ) which killed 15 million Ukrainians , there was another ( lesser known ) organized famine in the Ukraine in 1946 - 1947 to put down political resistance .
This killed two million .
Another million Russians were killed or irradiated in 1954 when the Communists tested an atomic weapon on their own people .
( 318 )
SATANIC GENOCIDE SPONSORED BY THE WEST
The Bolshevik Revolution was totally organized and financed by Illuminati bankers ( Schiff , Rockefeller , Warburg etc. ) and the German government , which they controlled .
( 206 )
Anthony Sutton found that 95 % per cent of Soviet technology came from the US or their allies .
He said the Communists could n't have lasted " one day " without Western aid .
While pretending to be engaged in a " Cold War , " the West actually provided billions in direct military and economic aid to the Soviets .
How else have a war ?
( 322 )
A quarter million tractors were needed for the " collectivization " of the Kulak farmers land .
With financing from Kuhn Loeb , 80 US companies participated in building three huge tractor factories .
These were also used for building tanks .
Under the Rapallo Treaty signed in April 1922 , German consortiums built numerous airplane , locomotive and munitions factories throughout the USSR .
Krupp built tanks and submarines in Leningrad and Rostov .
German troops rehearsed Blitzkreig tactics on Russian soil .
Clearly the Illuminati elite sponsors both sides of every conflict .
Without this industrial activity and economic aid , the USSR would have quickly failed .
The West's Illuminati politicians and financiers did n't lose any sleep over the executions or the 15 million sent to the Gulag .
( 343 ) Their newspapers suppressed this information .
They are as guilty as the NKVD executioners , and it was all done on our dime .
" The Western financial elite wanted to use market economy capitalism as an anvil and Communism as a hammer to rule the world and entirely subdue it , " Lina writes .
Eventually the cost of maintaining the USSR became too heavy , and the new Russia was born , under the Freemasons Yeltzin and Putin .
The same gang of Satanists and mass murderers continue to rule our planet .
Our politicians are their conscious or unconscious agents .
This does n't bode well for the New World Order .
A thin patina of law and civilized tradition separate us from the barbarism and chaos experienced in Russia .
Those machines , however , get no cell signal on their own ; you have to supply your own cellular modem .
They ’re also big and metal and ugly .
But the real deal - killer is that they have to be plugged into a power outlet .
You ca n’t use one at the beach or in the woods unless you have a really , really long extension cord .
The MiFi is remarkable for its tiny size , its sleek good looks , its 30 - foot range ( it easily filled a large airport gate area with four - bar signal )  and the fact that it ’s cordless and rechargeable .
Image Novatel 's MiFi , a 3G Wi-Fi router .
How is this amazing ?
Let us count the ways .
First , you ’re spared the plug - and - unplug ritual of cellular modems .
You can leave the MiFi in your pocket , purse or laptop bag ; whenever you fire up your laptop , netbook , Wi-Fi camera or game gadget , or wake up your iPhone or iPod Touch , you ’re online .
Last week , I was stuck on a runway for two hours .
As I merrily worked away online , complete with YouTube videos and file downloads , I became aware that my seatmate was sneaking glances .
As I snuck counter - glances at him , I realized that he had no interest in what I was doing , but rather in the signal - strength icon on my laptop  on an airplane where there was n’t otherwise any Wi-Fi signal .
“ I ’m sorry , ” he finally said , completely baffled , “ but how are you getting a wireless signal ? ”
He was floored when I pulled the MiFi from my pocket , its power light glowing evilly .
If he ’d had a laptop , I would have happily shared my Wi-Fi cloud with him .
The network password is printed right there on the bottom of the MiFi itself .
That ’s a clever idea , actually .
Since the MiFi is in your possession , it ’s impossible for anyone to get into your cloud unless you show it to them .
Call it “ security through proximity . ”
The second huge advantage of the MiFi is that , as with any wireless router , you can share its signal with other people ; up to five road warriors can enjoy the same connection .
Your youngsters with their iPod Touches in the back of the van could hop online , for example , or you and your colleagues could connect and collaborate on a corporate retreat .
Your task in this fun game is to join the first line of defense against the deadly H1N1 Swine Flu plague that is about to decimate the world .
We 've got to get these pigs as far away from Mexico as we can so grab a pig and start throwing .
Have fun !
Use YOUR MOUSE to click / drag to throw a swine then click LEFT MOUSE BUTTON again to fire bullets into poor piggy .

Eleven days of revelations about MPs ' expenses published in the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph have boosted circulation at the papers by more than 600,000 copies , unofficial industry figures reveal .
The continuing upswing in circulation has shown little sign of diminishing and comes as the Metropolitan police said yesterday that it will not investigate the leak of information to the Telegraph titles .
Senior officers ruled that a criminal investigation into how a terabyte of data containing 2 m documents was removed from the House of Commons and given or sold to the Telegraph Media Group would not be in the public interest .
Commons authorities called in the Met to investigate , but Scotland Yard yesterday said that although the unauthorised disclosure of information appeared to " breach public duty " , much of the information was in the process of being prepared for release under the Freedom of Information Act .
Telegraph Media Group has neither confirmed nor denied whether it paid for the information on MPs ' expenses .
Estimates on a price tag have stretched from £ 70,000 to £ 300,000 , although the payment is believed to be at the lower end of this range .
Monday 's Daily Telegraph , which covered the secret mortgage payouts of MPs and details about the speaker Michael Martin 's staff , sold about 57,000 copies above its regular base , according to initial industry figures .
The Sunday Telegraph sold an extra 56,000 copies at the weekend when it detailed the expenses claims of MPs that attempted to block the freedom on information requests for the expenses data .
On Saturday the Daily Telegraph , which featured the expenses claim for MP David Chaytor , who claimed £ 13,000 for a mortgage that he had already paid off , was up about 42,000 copies .
The day before , Friday 15 May , the Daily Telegraph published the expenses claims of justice minister Shahid Malik , who has stepped down after receiving discounted rent , boosting sales by 74,000 copies .
Friday 's sales boost was the second - best circulation increase since the first day of the investigation a week earlier , 8 May , when sales soared by about 87,000 copies .
On Thursday 14 May , details of Labour MP Elliot Morley , who claimed £ 16,000 for a mortgage that did not exist , sent sales up by about 65,000 copies ; while on Wednesday 13 May , the Daily Telegraph covered the expenses of several Liberal Democrat MPs , sending sales up by 37,000 copies .
Tuesday 12 May 's revelations about Tory grandees ' claims , which included £ 2,000 by Douglas Hogg for his moat to be cleaned and £ 380 spent on horse manure by David Heathcoat - Amory , boosted sales by about 51,000 copies .
The stories on Monday 11 May about the Conservative leader , David Cameron , and the shadow cabinet are understood to have added a " significant " number of additional sales , with early estimates suggesting additional circulation of 49,000 copies compared with a regular Monday circulation .
The 10 May edition of the Sunday Telegraph , with its revelations about Sinn Fein , had a circulation 34,000 copies higher than the previous week .
Circulation of the Daily Telegraph on Saturday 9 May , the second day of revelations that focused on Labour ministers , rose by 52,000 copies on the previous week , according to unofficial figures seen by MediaGuardian.co.uk .
All figures are initial estimates and subject to change and have not been certified by the official industry body , the Audit Bureau of Circulations .
Official circulation figures for May will be published by ABC early next month .
In April the Daily Telegraph sold an average of 817,692 copies each day , according to official ABC figures for last month , with the Sunday Telegraph averaging a circulation of 590,970 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama proposed on Thursday nearly doubling funds to enforce U.S. tax laws next year , with an aim of more than quadrupling funding for tax compliance to $ 2.1 billion within five years .
The budget plan seeks $ 12.1 billion for the Internal Revenue Service , responsible for collecting and enforcing individual and corporate tax laws , for fiscal 2010 , which begins October 1 .
That amounts to a roughly 5.2 percent increase over the IRS budget for 2009 , which was $ 11.5 billion .
The budget proposal , which must be approved by Congress , includes a $ 890 million request to boost tax enforcement , including in the international arena , an increase of $ 400 million from 2009 .
Underreporting of income by individuals and businesses led to a “ tax gap ” of $ 345 billion in 2001 , the most recent year available , according to the government .
Of that , corporate income tax and employment tax underreporting made up about $ 84 billion , according to a report by the Government Accountability Office .
The Obama administration said it would use the funds to further expand its efforts to boost compliance outside the U.S. , “ placing greater scrutiny on cross - border transactions and tax issues . ”
Earlier this week , Obama unveiled a series of proposals to overhaul mainly corporate tax rules and close loopholes in an effort he said would raise $ 210 billion over 10 years .
Included was a proposal to tighten rules on financial institutions which hold money abroad for U.S. citizens .
The U.S. government is currently suing giant Swiss bank UBS AG to get the names of thousands of mostly wealthy U.S. clients who may be trying to evade tax laws by keeping their money overseas .
LIFE IN PARADISE
By train through the Hermit Kingdom , our reporter dodges officials and sifts through the lies and secrecy on track to follow his family 's Great Escape By Ron Gluckman / North Korea M Y FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE LAND OF LIES comes just after Dandong , when the train climbs the bridge over the Yalu River , then plunges forward into the Great Unknown , the world 's last refuge of secrecy and deception .
China recedes back along the tracks , and up ahead looms a huge bronze statue of the Great Leader , Kim Il Sung .
Longest reigning dictator on Earth , Kim has run North Korea like a police state since 1945 .
His statue towers over the trees , and it's a fitting welcome to the weird world he has cast in his own demented image , for Kim is everywhere .
As we pull into the drab railway station in the border town of Sinuiju , an enormous huge mural depicting the heroic deeds of the Great Leader dominates the view .
Both monuments will be repeated endlessly in every city and town I pass through during my tour of North Korea ( during the summer of 1991 ) .
Yet the first view of the Great Ego still thrills .
After more than a year of effort at obtaining entry permits for the Hermit Kingdom , I have finally penetrated the paradoxical , paranoid paradise of North Korea .
My companion , guidebook author Robert Storey , grabs my hand in a victory shake .
" We made it , we 're inside North Korea , " I mutter , as we share a sweet conspiratorial smile .
For weeks we have kept our fingers crossed , prepared for new complications every step of the way .
Visa applications have repeatedly been rejected , six times over in my case .
Even after obtaining a rare and very expensive visa , the train tickets we paid for never appeared in Beijing .
North Korean officials at the embassy in China were not sympathetic , clearly piqued to find that two Americans dismissed earlier at the same office had obtained visas elsewhere .
Determined to proceed , we buy our own black - market tickets in Beijing , paying double the previously - agreed price .
Indeed , nobody was more surprised than I that day Robert called from Macau , the ( until the end of 1999 ) Portuguese colony across the Pearl River from Hong Kong , where North Korea has long maintained a diplomatic corps involved in gambling , gun running , smuggling and counterfeiting .
The officials also occasionally dealt in visas ; and we managed to elicit a rare pair .
Even now , on the train with tickets in hand , I suspect some last - minute hitch will prevent us from crossing over the Yalu River into the ancient empire of Koryo , known as the land of Morning Calm until war quelled the serenity and split the place in two for 40 years .
Paranoid ?
Perhaps .
When I discover a stray business card that had eluded an earlier search - it's my bookmark - I quickly hop out of bunk and take it to the train bathroom , where it burns and the ashes are washed out the toilet in the floor .
Journalists are n't welcome here , so we 're traveling as English teachers .
All outsiders are considered to be cultural invaders in this wayward republic .
Therefore , I am careful not to be seen taking notes .
I jot down impressions inside a bathroom stall , keeping my diary in a tiny notepad , tucked into a hip pouch along with rolls of exposed film .
I wear this even while asleep .
All this sneaking about seems suitable here , in an atmosphere of scrutiny and suspicion .
And , if the truth be known , the North Koreans have every reason to suspect us .
We have indeed come to report upon the last bastion of hard - line socialism - in a sense , to spy upon them .
But , that is always the case with reporting .
Yet , in over a decade of snooping , from Belfast to Burma , I have never felt so oppressed by officialdom , nor so vulnerable to the vagaries of a paranoid population .
Storey is on assignment for Lonely Planet , which produces the Shoestring and Survival Kit series of books that have become bibles of the backpack circuit .
I intend to file stories on any subject that can be adequately researched within the tight limitations of this restrictive society .
I 'm posing as a train buff , to cloud the true purpose of my travels .
My main goal is to simply ride the rails from Shenyang all the way to the South Korean border , the most militarized region on Earth .
The 1.5 million armed Koreans glaring at each other across the expanse of barbed wire and concrete concern me no more than the nuclear weapons factory western nations believe North Korea is constructing in Yongbyon .
Good stories , both , but this time the journey itself is the tale I fancy telling .
Half a century ago , my father , then a child , and his parents rode these same rails to escape from Hitler and the Nazis .
They boarded a train in Berlin , came across Poland and the USSR , down through Manchuria , to the southernmost tip of Korea , then the Japanese colony of Chosen .
A ferry to Shimonoseki connected to a ship that took them across the Pacific , to the safety of America , where they would survive World War II .
Most of our relatives were not so lucky .
About 2,000 German Jews eluded the Gestapo by this route , which was open for a scant six weeks .
My family caught one of the last trains out in late 1940 .
During a year of fellowship at Oxford University , I had prepared for retracing the great escape , but did it in a more leisurely fashion .
My grandparents had moved the family across two continents in three weeks .
I spent over a year , roaming around East Europe , visiting places familiar to me only from family history .
I stopped at our former wood furniture factory in Breslau , now Wroclaw , Poland , and checked concentration camp records for the names of relatives .
By the time I arrived in North Korea , I had already logged 11,000 kilometers across Siberia and through China .
And , I had waited in Hong Kong for seven months , plotting plans to retrace the rail journey through the Hermit Kingdom .
Still ahead is the trip down through South Korea , the ferry to Japan , and a long crossing of the Pacific in a cold container ship .
The company that shipped my family to America is still operating , but unwilling to put me on board .
Maritime codes ( then , and since the 1960s ) prohibit passengers on Japanese cargo ships and few foreign carriers would even answer my pleas , an eerie reminder of the deaf ears turned to Holocaust victims .
But so far , nothing has compared to the difficulties covering the few hundred miles of track through North Korea .
" You are Americans ? " asks an Indian diplomat , who has been sharing our rail car .
For hours , we have chatted with the diplomat and his wife , about travel and language and curries , everything imaginable except our telltale accents .
Neither has been bold enough to broach the subject , until we do .
Then , they pour out their feelings of amazement .
" Yes , I 've been very surprised , I must say , when you mentioned that you had visas , " the wife says .
" It 's usually not possible at all for Americans .
You are most lucky . "
They have been stationed in Pyongyang for two years , so we bombard them with questions .
They have little to reveal , chiefly because they are confined to a radius of 40 kilometers from the embassy housing estate unless they have permission to go further from the Foreign Ministry .
They never visited the homes of North Koreans .
" Not even our own girl , who cleans our house , " the wife says .
" She 's so nice and friendly in the house , but if we see her on the street , she wo n't smile , she wo n't even wave to us . "
Visitors are rare to a country desperate for foreign currency but fearful of the consequences .
We are the only tourists on the entire train .
The remaining passengers are diplomats , save for a family of Russians .
He is a reporter for Pravda .
As we pull into Pyongyang , the capital of North Korea , his pretty wife predicts : " You will be surprised . "
When I ask her meaning , she simply shakes her head and repeats , " You will be surprised . "
We are met by a car and driver .
Our guide , Li Yong Bom , hustles us through the comfortable foreigner 's waiting room .
There are a dozen padded chairs and , needless to say , a portrait of Kim Il Sung overhead .
A glass case displays a selection of books and magazines in English , French , German , Spanish , Russian and Arabic .
All extol Sung , except the few that focus upon his son and self - designated successor , Kim Jong Il .
My favorite booklet is titled : " North Korea , An Earthly Paradise For the People . "
Mounted in the hallway are a dozen photographs showing injustices to the North Koreans perpetuated by American and South Korean forces .
We saw the same photographs in Shinuiju and see them again in every other railway station .
Americans are " imperialists , " " aggressors " or " hooligans ; " South Koreans are " stooges " and " puppet police . "
Yet the first thing I notice in our hotel is the wide array of western goods in the tourist shop .
There are cameras from Japan , canned milk , chocolate and coffee from America , whiskey from Scotland , brandy from France , soda from England and Australia .
Everything is overpriced , but I stock up on American cigarettes .
In a country that claims no corruption , doors tend to open easier when the path is greased by Marlboros .
The streets of the capital are as wide and clean as the lush green Korean countryside .
And just as empty .
That 's the thing that always shocks visitors .
" There are no cars , no traffic , " the Indian diplomat tells us .
" The streets are empty .
Pyongyang has no crime .
And it must be the cleanest city in the whole world . "
It 's also pretty in its way , with tree - lined boulevards and huge squares ornamented with fountains and statues .
A river runs through the center of the city and along its banks are a series of beautiful parks .
The disturbing aspect of all this scenery , though , is that you never see anyone enjoying it .
The parks are empty , the theaters vacant , the stores all seem to be closed .
Eeriest of all is the 150,000 - seat stadium Pyongyang constructed in a failed bid for a portion of the 1988 Olympics .
A stadium filled with drunken sports fans can be loud and chaotic , but an empty bowl of yellow benches is downright depressing .
Movement in Pyongyang is strictly controlled , as is residency itself .
" Before we arrived two years ago , " our Indian friend tells us , " there used to be no disabled and hardly any old people .
You could n't have gray hair . "
Pregnant women were also banned from Pyongyang , but these rules have been relaxed .
The Koryo Hotel is the finest place in Pyongyang and it's an impressive sight , two twin towers rising 47 stories .
Both are topped with revolving restaurants , but only one is open .
There 's not much demand , since the 500 - room hotel has only 35 guests during our stay .
Not much else is open in Pyongyang or anywhere in North Korea .
The most famous building in the country has to be the Ryugyong Hotel .
At 105 stories , it 's one story taller than a hotel constructed by a South Korean firm in Singapore .
The pyramid - shaped Ryugyong is said to contain a hospital , bowling alleys , a cinema and 3,000 hotel rooms .
Nobody knows when it will be finished .
Nobody can even say how long it 's been under construction .
Subway stations in Pyongyang are in the Moscow mold of proletarian luxury , with polished marble floors , arched white pillars and sparkling chandeliers .
Among the many murals of Kim Il Sung is one showing him and his son in a mountain setting .
All the scenery is red or violet .
Mars comes quickly to mind .
Above ground , too , Pyongyang has the same unworldly quality with its dazzling fountains surrounded by park benches with nobody upon them , ghost trolleys that run sleekly through silent streets , empty save for the state fleet of Mercedes , reportedly the largest in the world , conveying top cadres to furtive ministries .
Only the department stores are filled with people , but nobody seems to be allowed to purchase anything .
I stand outside one store for a full hour and not a single person leaves with a bag .
Pyongyang would make a great setting for a science fiction film .
The place is already filled with props .
In the center rises the Arch of Triumph , taller than the original in Paris - which is n't mentioned in Pyongyang .
I focus my camera for three minutes at midday upon the Arc before a car passes through .
The train to Kaesong leaves at midnight and arrives at dawn in the ancient capital of the Koryo empire .
Kaesong is the prettiest city in Korea and among the loveliest in all Asia .
Kaesong is winding alleys , old homes with curved tile roofs , gardens and guest houses with bamboo bed mats .
The serenity of this sleepy , peaceful city gives way to the greatest concentration of military muscle on the planet .
The train tracks used to continue south to Pusan , but now we ride a car 10 miles to the peace village of Panmunjom , where the poorly named Reunification Highway ends in barbed wire .
Panmunjom is surely the strangest tourist trap on Earth .
Visitors sit at the peace conference table , a line running right through the room .
While guards from the South Korean side peer through windows , North Korean officers give a briefing on the outrages of the western imperialists .
A gift shop sells separatist souvenirs .
Then the cars leave for a ride through the hilly countryside .
A battery of tripod - mounted binoculars await at a viewing site .
They focus upon a concrete wall curving over the distant hills .
" That 's the wall built by the Americans to divide our country . "
Actually , according to a western diplomat , it 's a tank barrier two kilometers wide built in the 1970s to prevent against another North Korean sneak attack .
" The North Koreans never mentioned it until the Berlin Wall fell , " she says .
" Then , they cried Wall . "
One Korean returning to his homeland from Germany sadly comments on the presence of so many soldiers .
" They could be my relatives , " he says .
" Why must relatives be divided , pointing guns .
Even in Germany it 's ended .
" It must end here . "
Koreans from all over the world pay US $ 150 a day to tour their ancestral home .
They are taken to temples , into the misty mountains , and everywhere wined and dined in a style that is otherwise unimaginable in North Korea .
" This is more meat than they see in a year , " one Korean from Japan says at mealtime .
" They are trying to pretend there is abundance , but we know they have not even enough rice to feed the people . "
Indeed , diplomats and reporters confirm rumors of years of rice crop failures .
Oleg Polovko , on assignment for Russian news agency Tass , confides : " We hear of rice shortages , but there is no way to know for sure .
We can not call any of the ministers .
We can not go to the farms in the country .
The only news they give out is the good news of the government .
It 's all lies . "
One truth is the need for foreign currency .
With the Soviet Union in recession , North Korea is deprived of the patronage that provided most of the nation 's energy and equipment needs .
Turning to tourism , even in moderation , has helped .
Many visitors come from Japan and several join us on the train back to Pyongyang .
North Korea is courting yen .
Listening to two of them chat in Japanese , I think of my father , who still remembers a few words he learned from Japanese soldiers returning from the front when he was a child refugee .
" When I was on that train , during the war , " he says by phone upon my return to Hong Kong , " it was only soldiers and us .
And the windows were blacked out so we could n't see anything . "
Half a century later , little has changed .
The train windows open , but North Korea remains closed to the world .

Two years ago , I was walking up Charles St. towards Mount Vernon Square to check out the annual Baltimore Book Festival .
As I waited to cross the street about a block from the main part of the festival , I saw out of the corner of my eye a small table set up on the other side of the street .
" Odd that they ’re set up so far away from the other tables , " I thought .
I squinted to read what they were about .
The Socialist Party of the United States of America .
It seemed all too appropriate that they were positioned just out of spitting distance from everything else , and that the two people behind the table had no cover from the drizzle that had been falling all morning .
In spite of the prominence of such voices as Noam Chomsky , Naomi Klein , Howard Zinn , and even the late Studs Turkel , broadly socialist left - wing ideas have not , in recent years , found a secure place in mainstream American political discourse .
Even still , 100 or so days into President Obama ’s tenure , “ socialism ” has become a byword , in the mouths of ideologues like Eric Cantor and Glenn Beck , for all that is European , anti-entrepreneurship , un-American and therefore very wrong .
In order to make some sense of the sound bytes , Splice Today contacted Thomas Schaller — professor at UMBC , Salon.com contributor , Colbert Report guest , and author of Whistling Past Dixie — to get his take on how socialism really figures in American politics .
In our discussion , we started by defining socialism broadly as a political ideology based on a commitment to the creation of an egalitarian society based on people being able to seek fulfillment without barriers of systemic inequality , and that challenges the property relationships that are fundamental to capitalism .
SPLICE TODAY : When the average American hears the word “ socialism , ” what do you think he hears ?
THOMAS SCHALLER : I suspect the average American hears and thinks “ communism ” when they hear “ socialism . ”
I wonder how many Americans who have taken Social Security payments , unemployment insurance payments or Medicare benefits — some of the largest and most redistributive programs in the history of the planet — consider themselves to be the practicing beneficiaries of socialism they are .
ST : Forms of democratic socialism ( I ’m thinking of Eugene Debs and elements of the New Deal ) had much greater political currency in the early 20th century .
How did socialism come to be in the position it currently holds in the American political landscape ?
TS : Socialism in the partisan sense gained a lot more traction in the early part of the 20th century in part because of the huge disparities in income in the United States , coupled with the then - inability of the two major parties to rig an electoral system to reinforce the partisan duopoly they enjoy today .
There is no sign of the latter changing , but the reemergence of income inequality of a magnitude not seen in almost a century and the reemergence of all this socialist talk is no coincidence .
ST : In terms of third parties , the American Socialist Party makes Bob Barr and Ralph Nader look like leaders of enormous political machines .
Why have n’t socialist ideas had more momentum in recent times ?
TS : Few third parties gain any traction in our single - member - district , plurality rule system because such systems have been proven to inevitably gravitate toward two - party systems , for no power is attained for third - place finishers as is the case in proportional representation systems .
ST : How much of it is a function of our media environment ?
TS : Socialist Party successes do not even rate with those of a Ross Perot or Pat Buchanan in part because , in the eyes of the American media , being labeled a socialist is barely a notch above child molester .
In fact , a child molester who started a small business would probably get more favorable coverage than a self - avowed socialist .
ST : But where did the media stigma come from ?
TS : I do n't know , other than to say that we have a private , corporate - owned media and matters would be decidedly different if we had the American equivalent to Britain 's BBC or Canada 's CBC .
ST : Eric Hobsbawm , the historian , recently wrote that , at this point , both socialism and unregulated free - market capitalism have failed , saying that the world ’s biggest governments are too addicted to maximizing economic growth .
Do you think his vision is too polarized ?
Do you think the current recession represents a serious threat to the American , even the global , political status quo ?
TS : I do n't know Hobsawm 's work , but I do know that Larry Bartel 's new book , Unequal Democracy , dispels the notion that economic disparities are somehow the natural consequence of economic growth .
In fact , the two - decade period of great growth in the United States following the Second World War was also characterized by greater income equity between top and bottom and , not coincidentally , high marginal tax rates approaching 90 percent at one point .
So the notion that growth and socialist - style tax rates or redistributive programs are somehow mutually exclusive choices is a fallacy .
Henry Ford wanted his employees to make a competitive wage for a reason — so they could afford to buy the very cars they built .
Somehow , in the post - Reagan era we seem to think that shipping somebody 's well - paid job with benefits and a pension to Chennai will result in the lower - wage Indian who now holds that job somehow buying the American product or service the American worker formerly produced .
This is absurd .
ST : Really , just how socialist are the Obama Administration ’s policies so far ?
TS : The Obama administration 's policies constitute the most dramatic growth in the size and scope of governmental action since the New Deal .
We have a massive , Keynesian stimulus coupled with new domestic investments in education , health care and the environment , with a new regulatory ( or re-regulatory ) plan to prevent future credit crisis and reckless financial speculation .
Capitalism requires regulated markets , and Obama 's Cooper Union speech in March 2008 foreshadowed everything he is now proposing to reform Wall Street .
Anybody calling these actions socialism understands nothing about the operation of free , open , and fair markets .
When government uses its power to engage in fixed prices or no-bid contracts for military contractors we call it entrepreneurial capitalism , even though such actions are more socialist than anything Obama has proposed to regulate under - or unregulated financial instruments , mandate transparent accounting and require sufficient capital reserves .
ST : After the defection of Arlen Specter and the probable seating of Al Franken , it looks likely that the Democratic Party will soon have 60 potential votes in the Senate .
If not towards socialism , might their newly filibuster - proof agenda move further to the left ?
TS : Not much connection to the 60 votes and socialism , and I really do n't think it changes the calculus that much .
It 's not hard to get one vote to make 60 right now , with Franken in there putting pre-Specter Democrats at 59 seats .
After all , when the Liebermans and Bayhs want to make a fuss , Specter is probably going to be with them anyway , whatever his party label .
ST : Is the current recession a bad financial mess , or a broader crisis of free - market capitalism ?
TS : It 's both a really bad mess and an indictment of unregulated capitalism , which is a less efficient and less productive and less equitable alternative to properly regulated markets — and for all non-corrupt or predatory parties involved , from the top of the income ladder to the bottom .
Look , when the financial services industry accounts for one - fifth of our economy , it 's clear we have a serious problem .
You can only generate so much growth from managing wealth without generating sufficient wealth to manage in the first place .
Laugh all you want at the Germans and other European economies , but at least many of them realize you still need to make stuff in order to have wealth to invest .
Never owned an Intel chip in my life , and I never will .
I 'm AMD inside all the way .

Fuck Intel .

Cowboy up and play by the rules .
Say you want to build a frequency distribution of many thousands of samples with the following characteristics :
fast to build
persistent data
network accessible ( with no locking requirements )
can store large sliceable index lists
The only solution I know that meets those requirements is Redis .
NLTK ’s FreqDist is not persistent , shelve is far too slow , BerkeleyDB is not network accessible ( and is generally a PITA to manage ) , and AFAIK there ’s no other key - value store that makes sliceable lists really easy to create & access .
So far I ’ve been quite pleased with Redis , especially given how new it is .
It ’s quite fast , is network accessible , atomic operations make locking unnecessary , supports sortable and sliceable list structures , and is very easy to configure .
Classification
Building a FreqDist allows you to create a ProbDist , which in turn can be used for classification .
Having it be persistent lets you examine the data later .
And the ability to create sliceable lists allows you to make sorted indexes for paging thru your samples .
Here ’s some more concrete use cases for persistent frequency distributions :
RedisFreqDist
I put the code I ’ve been using to build frequency distributions over large sets of words up at BitBucket .
probablity .py contains RedisFreqDist , which works just like the NTLK FreqDist , except it stores samples and frequencies as keys and values in Redis .
That means samples must be strings .
Internally , RedisFreqDist also stores a set of all the samples under the key __samples__ for efficient lookup and sorting .
Here ’s some example code for using it .
For more info , checkout the wiki , or read the code .
def make_freq_dist ( samples , host=' localhost ' , port=6379 , db=0 ) : freqs = RedisFreqDist ( host=host , port=port , db=db ) for sample in samples : freqs.inc( sample )
Unfortunately , I had to muck about with some of FreqDist ’s internal implementation to remain compatible , so I ca n’t promise the code will work beyond NLTK version 0.9.9 .
probablity .py also includes ConditionalRedisFreqDist for creating ConditionalProbDists .
Lists
For creating lists of samples , that very much depends on your use case , but here ’s some example code for doing so .
r is a redis object , key is the index key for storing the list , and samples is assumed to be a sorted list .
The get_samples function demonstrates how to get a slice of samples from the list .
def index_samples (r , key , samples ) : r.delete ( key ) for word in words : r.push ( key , word , tail = True ) def get_samples (r , key , start , end ) : return r.lrange ( key , start , end )
Yes , Redis is still fairly alpha , so I would n’t use it for critical systems .
But I ’ve had very few issues so far , especially compared to dealing with BerkeleyDB .
I highly recommend it for your non-critical computational needs 🙂

According to National Geographic ( NG ) , two students teams are closer to developing cloaks that will allow for true invisibility .
It says teams from the University of California ( Berkeley ) and Cornell University have each found a different way to bend light around a very small object .
And by bending the light they are able to deflect rays and stop the object from absorbing light thereby making it invisible to the human eye .
Although teams developed different way to hide objects , NG reports that the students say they are from developing material that effectively hides large objects .

Bush 's CIA Suspected of More Torture The Bush administration may have abused or tortured many more detainees at secret CIA prisons than the 14 “ high - value ” terror suspects already known , the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a confidential report .
Email
Printer friendly
The 41 - page ICRC report , dated Feb. 14 , 2007 , and published in full this week at the Web site for the New York Review of Books , cited a Sept. 6 , 2006 , speech by President George W. Bush saying “ many ” suspected terrorists held at secret CIA prisons “ have been returned to their home countries for prosecution or detention by their governments ” after it was determined they lacked intelligence value .
But the ICRC said the U.S. government had not disclosed where the detainees were sent , so the organization , which monitors international compliance with the Geneva Conventions and other human rights laws , could not determine the detainees ’ fate or investigate their treatment in CIA custody .
Due to the “ inhuman ” treatment of the 14 known detainees , the ICRC said it “ remains gravely concerned by the fact that a significant number of other persons have passed through this detention program and may have been subjected to similar , if not the same , conditions and treatment . ”
Because the ICRC ’s report is more than two years old – and because the ICRC still considers its contents confidential – it is not clear if the CIA has since provided more information on the whereabouts of those transferred detainees .
The ICRC report noted that the organization – as of February 2007 – “ has been able to begin discussions with the CIA on this question . ”
However , documents that were released in other investigations reveal that the Bush administration conducted a kind of shell game with ICRC representatives to conceal the treatment and even the existence of some detainees .
Guantanamo Tricks
Last year , the Senate Armed Services Committee released dozens of pages of internal government documents related to the treatment of detainees and the conversations that preceded the implementation of “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” at the Guantanamo Bay prison , which was under the control of the Department of Defense .
One document was a copy of the minutes of an Oct. 2 , 2002 , meeting at which Lt. Col.
Diane Beaver , then the chief military lawyer at Guantanamo whose responsibilities included working with the ICRC , discussed concealing abusive interrogation tactics when ICRC officials visited .
“ We may need to curb the harsher operations while ICRC is around , ” Beaver said , according to the minutes .
“ It is better not to expose them to any controversial techniques . ”
“ We have had many reports from Bagram [ detention center in Afghanistan ] about sleep deprivation being used , ” responded Dave Becker of the Defense Intelligence Agency .
“ True , but officially it is not happening , ” Beaver said .
“ It is not being reported officially .
The ICRC is a serious concern .
They will be in and out , scrutinizing our operations , unless they are displeased and decide to protest and leave .
This would draw a lot of negative attention . ”
Jonathan Fredman , who was the chief counsel for the CIA 's Counterterrorism Center , noted that the “ the CIA is not held to the same rules as the military ” when it comes to using aggressive techniques to interrogate detainees .
“ In the past when the ICRC has made a big deal about certain detainees , the DOD has ‘ moved ’ them away from the attention of the ICRC , ” Fredman said .
“ The Torture Convention prohibits torture and cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment .
The US did not sign up on the second part , because of the 8th amendment ( cruel and unusual punishment ) , but we did sign the part about torture .
This gives us more license to use more controversial techniques . ”
Beaver interjected : “ We will need documentation to protect us . ”
“ Yes , if someone dies while aggressive techniques are being used , regardless of cause of death , the backlash of attention would be extremely detrimental .
Everything must be approved and documented , ” Fredman said .
Last year , during testimony before the Armed Services Committee , Beaver said she did n't recall her comments about stopping the harsh treatment of detainees when ICRC officials were present .
In its legal arguments , the Bush administration insisted that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to suspected terrorists .
Medical Complicity
Another disclosure from the ICRC report , which was obtained by journalist Mark Danner , was the participation of medical officers in monitoring the torture of the “ high - value ” detainees , presumably to make sure they did n’t die before the interrogations were completed .
“ The alleged participation of health personnel in the interrogation process and , either directly or indirectly , in the infliction of ill - treatment constituted a gross breach of medical ethics and , in some cases , amounted to participation in torture and / or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , ” the ICRC report said
According to the minutes of the Oct. 2 , 2002 , discussion , the Bush administration also involved psychologists in the preparation of the “ enhanced interrogation techniques . ”
Psychologists Maj. John Leso and Maj. Burney of the Behavioral Science Consultation Team discussed use of the Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape ( SERE ) program for interrogating detainees .
SERE was meant to prepare U.S. soldiers for abuse they might suffer if captured by an outlaw regime .
Instead , it was reverse - engineered to provide interrogation tactics for the Bush administration .
Burney and Leso led a presentation on “ SERE Psych Training , ” the minutes showed .
When Beaver asked whether SERE employs the “ wet towel technique , ” otherwise known as waterboarding , Fredman , the CIA attorney , responded with a meticulous description of how the human body would react .
“ If a well - trained individual is used to perform [ sic ] this technique it can feel like you 're drowning , ” Fredman said .
“ The lymphatic system will react as if you 're suffocating , but your body will not cease to function .
It is very effective to identify phobias and use them ( i.e. , insects , snakes , claustrophobia ) .
The level of resistance is directly related to person 's experience . ”
Burney , the psychologist , then weighed in with a brief analysis of the psychological impact to the person subjected to the torture techniques .
“ Whether or not significant stress occurs lies in the eye of the beholder , ” Burney said .
When the minutes were sent to Mark Fallon , Deputy Commander at the Criminal Investigation Task Force ( CITF ) , he remarked to a colleague that the Beaver - Fredman discussion " looks like the kinds of stuff Congressional hearings are made of . "
“ Quotes from LTC Beaver regarding things that are not being reported give the appearance of impropriety , ” Fallon wrote in an e-mail obtained by the Senate Armed Services Committee .
“ Talk of ‘ wet towel treatments ’ which results in the lymphatic gland reacting as if you are suffocating , would in my opinion shock the conscience of any legal body looking at using the results of the interrogations or possibly even the interrogators .
Someone needs to be considering how history will look back at this . ”
The ICRC report essentially vindicates Fallon ’s concern , depicting an ugly process in which the Bush administration subjected detainees to both pain and humiliation , from the waterboarding that created the panicked gag reflex of drowning to keeping the prisoners naked for long periods of time and causing them to soil themselves .
After questioning the " high - value " detainees separately , the ICRC wrote that “ the allegations of the fourteen include descriptions of treatment and interrogation techniques — singly or in combination — that amounted to torture and / or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment . ”
The ICRC recommended that “ U.S. authorities investigate all allegations of ill - treatment and take steps to punish the perpetrators , where appropriate , and to prevent such abuses from happening again . ”
Calls for Investigations
The publication of the ICRC ’s report led to renewed demands by human rights and civil liberties organizations that Attorney General Eric Holder appoint a special prosecutor with the mandate to launch a criminal inquiry .
“ It 's imperative that the Justice Department appoint an independent prosecutor to conduct a criminal investigation , ” said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
“ Government officials who violated the law should not be shielded from investigation .
Transparency and accountability are critical to the restoration of the rule of law . "
Other calls were made for professional organizations to enforce their own ethical standards .
" It is time for the American Medical Association , the American Psychological Association , and others to demand a nonpartisan commission to investigate these crimes , " said Frank Donaghue , Chief Executive Officer of Physicians for Human Rights ( PHR ) .
" The associations must sanction any of their membership found to have violated their professional ethics . ”
Last year , PHR published a report , “ Broken Laws , Broken Lives , ” that concluded that 11 former detainees held in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay were systematically tortured .
The prisoners were later released and were never charged with any crimes .
PHR ’s medical representatives evaluated the detainees and found instances of “ medical complicity in torture . ”
One former Abu Ghraib detainee known only as Hafez told PHR that his arm was dislocated during an abusive interrogation .
He said an individual whom he believed was a doctor , put his arm back in place and told the interrogators to " continue . "
In February , at a conference for medical professionals , PHR officials presented Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse , D - Rhode Island , with a petition signed by attendees calling on Congress to form a committee to probe the torture of prisoners detained in the “ war on terror . ”
" The Bush Administration weaponized medicine by using health professionals to break the bodies and minds of detainees , " John Bradshaw , PHR's Washington director , said about the new evidence of medical personnel collaborating in torture .
" Congress must act to restore medical ethics by finally authorizing a non-partisan commission to probe these crimes . "
Similar concerns have been raised about the Bush administration ’s twisting of legal standards in securing clearance from the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel to abuse detainees .
Sen .
Whitehouse has been leading the charge for the release of a Justice Department watchdog report that is said to be highly critical of attorneys John Yoo , Jay Bybee and Steven Bradbury , who helped create the legal framework for the Bush administration ’s torture policies .

Mexico ’s “ war on drugs ” employs army torture and police - state tactics
By Rafael Azul and Kevin Kearney
25 May 2009
Mexico ’s National Human Rights Commission ( CNDH ) , an independent government agency , has reported that the Mexican army is torturing citizens just across the US border in its war on drug cartels .
The report reveals a systematic practice of arbitrary detentions , beatings and electrical shocks against innocent citizens with no connection to the drug trade .
Continuing policies implemented under Bush , the Obama administration wholeheartedly supports the current military operations in Mexico .
Since early 2007 , the US government has provided millions in cash , military technology and military trainers , promising billions more in the coming years .
Just a month before the latest torture revelations emerged , Obama described the US as a “ full partner ” in Mexico ’s bloody drug war , sending “ hundreds of federal agents along with high - tech surveillance equipment ... to help Mexico fight the cartels , ” the BBC reported .
The CNDH torture report centers on the situation in Ciudad Juarez , which became a testing ground for martial law in early March , when 10,000 troops were deployed there .
According to the Washington Post , Mayor José Reyes Ferriz said — in an interview in his office overlooking the US border — “ This is something that has never been tried before in Mexico : to have the army take over the police so completely . ”
According to Reyes , President Felipe Calderón and Defense Secretary Guillermo Galván Galván are involved in every major decision regarding security in the city .
Ciudad Juarez is intended as a “ national model ” for other Mexican cities , he added .
The rule of law has been almost completely abandoned in Juarez .
Nearly every bourgeois democracy has historically required that there be some objective evidence that a crime is being committed before a citizen is detained .
However , in Juarez , the Mexican government has erected a cryptic legal apparatus that allows the army to conduct raids , arrest suspects and initiate wiretaps after informally presenting evidence to local prosecutors that is purportedly sent to an anonymous panel of judges in Mexico City for approval .
Héctor García Rodríguez , a representative of the federal attorney general ’s office in Juarez told the Washington Post : “ We know [ the judges ] exist , but they work in a place that is unknown to the public ....
I do n’t even know who they are . ”
Mauricio Ibarra , a CNDH spokesperson , indicated that since the military deployment in Ciudad Juarez , the number of reported human rights violations has escalated dramatically .
During the first quarter of the year , the commission received 172 complaints , a yearly rate of 684 , more than twice the 311 filed last year .
In addition , the attorney general of Juarez recently opened separate investigations into the killing of two men while in the army custody .
According to the attorney general , the army has detained 1,465 people this year .
Javier Pérez Chávez , a public defender who represents the vast majority of suspects arrested by the military , told the Washington Post the majority of those detained reported they were held for periods varying from several days to a week , while nearly all have reported being beaten while in the army ’s custody .
Gustavo de la Rosa , the state human rights commissioner , describes the situation in a sentence : “ The army has turned Juarez into an occupied city in which all citizens are presumed to be drug traffickers . ”
According to the Spanish daily El Pais , military barricades have been set up all over the city , where citizens are routinely detained for up to 12 hours at a time , threatened and often beaten before they are later handed over to investigators or released .
Numerous media reports paint a picture of a town crawling with heavily armed , masked soldiers staging raids , detaining citizens , and searching travelers at the airport and border crossings , virtually at will .
The Washington Post article cited one illustrative case .
In early April , Javier Eduardo Rosales , 21 , a former X - ray technician , was found beaten to death on a motorcycle trail outside the city .
Another citizen , Sergio Fernández , told Rosales ’s family that while buying beer , he and Rosales were detained by soldiers , blindfolded and taken to an unknown location , where they were beaten .
Fernández explained that the two were then sprayed with gasoline while a soldier stood by with a match .
According to Fernandez , Rosales caught the attention of soldiers because he had a tattoo of a serpent .
With a startling brazenness , the Mexican army has actually admitted to and defended some of the abuses charged by the CNDH , going so far as to declare that the torture of citizens is justified because drug gang violence has diminished under the heel of military occupation .
The statement eerily echoes Washington ’s claims that a regression to barbaric methods of rule such as torture and a dictatorial legal structure can be justified in the name of its endless “ war on terror . ”
Nonetheless , the army has denied other — more shocking — acts of torture .
Military spokesman Enrique Torres told El Pais the more egregious cases must have been committed by civilians pretending to be army personnel , while another , nameless military spokesman gave a more detailed version of this implausible explanation to the Washington Post in April saying , “ organized criminals have been donning army uniforms and impersonating soldiers to sow mistrust and anger against the armed forces . ”
While Juarez is a community plagued by poverty and desperation , the city has a deeper significance for US and world capitalism .
Ciudad Juárez is located in the Mexican state of Chihuahua , among the top states in Mexico in terms of foreign investment .
The Ciudad Juárez - El Paso area is one of the largest manufacturing centers in North America .
Due to its conditions of poverty , Juarez offers some of the lowest labor costs on the continent , while its proximity to the border secures cheap and easy transportation to the world ’s largest consumer market .
Several corporate entities such as Bosch , Lexmark , Delphi , Visteon , Lear , Boeing , Yazaki , Sumitomo , and Siemens have set up maquiladora sweat shops there , converting Juarez into a cheap labor platform of growing importance in the “ backyard ” of US imperialism .
According to the El Paso Times , the Juarez maquiladoras employ up to 250,000 people every year , while as many as 50,000 have lost their jobs due to last year ’s financial collapse and the ensuing economic contractions .
Mexican repression backed by Washington
For the past three years , the Mexican government has closely coordinated with Washington in its effort to militarize the entire country .
The current acts of torture by the Mexican military are not new or isolated events .
Rather , they represent the malignant growth of torture and police state tactics since the inauguration of President Felipe Calderon and the inception of the “ war on drugs ” at the close of 2006 .
The Mexican daily La Jornada reported that in the period immediately after Calderon was elected president , nearly 600 soldiers in the Mexican military received more than 50 training courses in anti-terrorist and intelligence tactics at military installations in both the US and Mexico .
In 2006 , the US provided nearly $ 600,000 in support to the Mexican military and Secretary of Defense ( SEDENA ) .
The following year , after the declaration of the drug war and the signing of the Merida Initiative between Washington and Mexico , this US aid expanded to a three - year package consisting of $ 1.6 billion dollars worth of equipment and training for the Mexican military .
Interestingly , the Joint Task Force North ( JTFN ) was identified by La Jornada as one of the US military agencies involved in joint anti-terrorism training exercises .
The JTFN is a subordinate branch of Joint Forces Command organized under US Northern Command , or NORTHCOM — quickly created after the terrorist attacks in September 2001 and based in Fort Bliss , Texas .
According to General Anthony R. Ierardi , head of JTFN , in 2008 the agency ’s mission is to provide military support to domestic police forces in the United States — particularly on the Mexican border .
Ierardi explained to Joe Corsi of the right - wing web site WorldNetDaily the value of participating in military operations in the Mexican border region : “ ... If an Army aviation unit is ... preparing for deployment to Iraq , or Afghanistan ... their commanders might deem that volunteering for a mission at JTF
North might be good training , because of the opportunity to operate in a relevant environment that would replicate what they will face in the Middle East . ”
The CNDH report is only the latest in a series of reports documenting torture .
Since the outset of the drug war little more than two years and four months ago , the human rights agency has chronicled more than 2,000 cases of military abuse against the civilian population .
According to the CNDH , there has been more military violence reported against the civilian population in the first three months of this year than in any other period since the drug war began — representing 20 percent of the cases since 2006 .
While military violence against civilians has been registered in nearly every state of Mexico , the majority of cases in the first trimester of 2009 have come from Chihuahua State , in which Ciudad Juarez is located .
According to the Mexican weekly El Proceso , “ The military has n’t violated human rights so much since the ‘ dirty war ’ of the 1970s , as it has under the Calderon administration . ”
What ’s worse , El Proceso reports that military tribunals have exclusive jurisdiction over civilian complaints , facilitating the military ’s impunity before civil authorities while exacerbating public anger .
The United Nations Committee on Torture has also denounced the widespread abuses in Mexico , while identifying the fundamental connection between torture and the dissolution of the basic right of habeas corpus .
In a democracy , habeas corpus requires a public hearing in which a detainee can demand to know what he is being accused of , requiring some showing of proof by the state that there is actually a factual basis for the accusations .
However , Mexican law now allows for 80 days of so - called “ preventive detention ” without charges — the longest period in any “ Western democracy , ” according to Human Rights Watch .
It is part of a practice known as an inquisitorial justice system , or “ arraigo , ” in which torture is used to extract false testimony and confessions .
México ’s Supreme Court declared the arraigo unconstitutional in 2005 .
Yet , as part of the war on drugs , the system was brought back under Calderón .
The use of military tribunals — as opposed to civilian courts — against Mexican citizens has also caught the attention of the UN Committee on Human Rights .
At the behest of several member nations , the committee has officially summoned the Calderón administration to answer at a hearing this June in Geneva , Switzerland .
In the face of these developments , President Barack Obama continues to endorse the Calderón government , providing military support above and beyond that agreed to in the Merida Initiative .
According to El Proceso , Obama promised three Blackhawk helicopters valued at more than $ 27 million each as of April 9 .
By all indications , US support for and guidance over the militarization of Mexico during the last three years will only escalate , posing a mortal threat to the basic rights of workers on both sides of the border .
Indian Premier League final , Johannesburg :
Deccan Chargers 143-6 ( 20 ovs ) beat Royal Challengers Bangalore 137-9 ( 20 ovs ) by six runs Skipper Adam Gilchrist celebrates victory with his Deccan teammates
Deccan Chargers beat Royal Challengers Bangalore by six runs in Johannesburg in the final of the second season of the Indian Premier League .
Having lost captain Adam Gilchrist for a third - ball duck , Herschelle Gibbs ( 53 not out ) and Andrew Symonds ( 33 from 21 balls ) helped Deccan post 143 - 6 .
And despite Roelof van der Merwe's 32 , Symonds took 2 -18 and a late collapse left Bangalore six runs short .
The tournament was staged in South Africa because of security concerns .
It clashed with the recent Indian general election and with the government unable to provide security assurances , South Africa pipped England to act as replacement hosts .
606 : DEBATE
The 2009 tournament was the first to involve centrally contracted England players , and batsman Kevin Pietersen captained Bangalore for six games in the early stages before returning to England for their Test and one - day series against West Indies .
Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff were the most expensive players at the second season 's auction in February , each earning $ 1.5 m on a pro-rata basis , but Flintoff managed only three games for Chennai before getting injured .
Meanwhile , Australian skipper Ricky Ponting and key players Michael Hussey and Mitchell Johnson opted out of the competition , preferring instead to concentrate on the build - up to this summer 's Ashes Test series in England .
Pietersen and Flintoff played in the early stages of this year 's IPL One innovation for the 2009 competition was a compulsory " tactical time out " halfway through each innings , lasting seven - and - a- half minutes but it was seen by some as hampering the game in order to provide broadcasters with more time to show commercials - and attracted criticism from India stars Sachin Tendulkar and Harbhajan Singh .
The tournament saw last year 's winners , Rajashtan Royals , fail to reach the semi-finals and 19 - year - old Manish Pandey become the first Indian to hit an IPL century when he made 117 for Bangalore against Deccan in a round - robin match .
But he could not repeat that in the final , scoring only four before being caught behind off Pragyan Ojha , who took 3 - 28 for the Chargers .
Robin Uthappa hit Ryan Harris for a huge six in the penultimate over to give Bangalore hope but the task of scoring 15 off the final six balls , bowled by left - arm pace bowler RP Singh , proved beyond them .
Despite the defeat , Bangalore skipper Anil Kumble , now retired from international cricket , was named Man of the Match for taking 4 - 16 , including the wicket of opposite number Gilchrist .
IPL commissioner Lalit Modi , meanwhile , revealed that this year 's Twenty20 Champions League - of which he is also chairman - will be contested by 12 teams rather than eight , with a total prize fund of A prize fund of US $ 6 m ( £ 3.77 m ) .
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUALIFIERS
Deccan Chargers ( Ind ) Royal Ch'gers Bangalore ( Ind ) Delhi Daredevils ( Ind ) Cape Cobras ( SA ) Eagles ( SA ) Victoria ( Aus ) New South Wales ( Aus ) Otago ( NZ ) Trinidad & Tobago ( WI ) Wayamba ( SL ) Twenty20 Cup winners and losing finalists ( Eng )
The eight teams already due to take part were both IPL finalists - Deccan and Bangalore - plus the Cape Cobras and Eagles from South Africa , Victoria and New South Wales from Australia , plus the finalists from England 's Twenty20 Cup , which begins on Monday .
They will now be joined by domestic Twenty20 champions from New Zealand ( Otago ) , Sri Lanka ( Wayamba ) and West Indies ( Trinidad and Tobago ) - plus a third IPL franchise , Delhi Daredevils - for the tournament , which will take place in India from 8 to 23 October , just after the Champions Trophy .
There will be 23 games played , with teams divided into four groups of three .
Two teams in each group will move onto the second phase , with the four top teams reaching the semi-finals .
Fixtures will be announced in London on 23 June .
However , Pakistan 's domestic Twenty20 champions , Sialkot Stallions , will not feature because the Pakistan government has restricted travel to India .
Anil Kumble celebrates Symonds ' dismissal with Mark Boucher
The first Champions League was scheduled to be held in December 2008 , but was postponed following the terrorist attacks in Mumbai .
Middlesex , 2008 's Twenty20 Cup winners , had been due to take part , although losing finalists
Kent were barred because some of their players had played in the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League ( ICL ) , which is a rival to Modi's IPL .
Modi added : " The inaugural edition did not take place last year due to unfortunate circumstances but we are fully equipped this time around to conduct an extremely successful tournament . "

Hell , I ’ve used this excuse before too — and there ’s a good reason for it .

3 rules on how to travel cheap
They all had a lot of a whole lotta great ideas on how to best travel on a budget that easily distilled into three simple rules :
Get the best travel credit card Travel at the right time Budget consciously
At the end of each rule , we ’ll provide action steps you can take today to make that trip ( and that Rich Life ) even more attainable .
Cheap travel rule # 1 : Get the best travel credit card
We ’ve written about travel credit cards before — but since I ’m sure there is someone out there who has n’t read it ( shocking , I know ) , allow me to politely reiterate a lesson that goes for anyone who is n’t in any form of credit card debt .
* Ahem *
YOU SHOULD GET A TRAVEL CREDIT CARD !!!!!
Travel credit cards offer some of the best ways to earn Big Wins .
By maximizing and accruing points through their associated rewards programs , you can save thousands per year on travel .
This is also the way most of these travel experts we ’ve talked to do it so cheap : on points .
It ’s the bare minimum you should do if you want to travel cheap .
“ The biggest bang for your buck when it comes to your travel is definitely rewards points and miles , ” Bryce told us .
“ People think that if you do n’t travel for work or travel all the time that you ’re never going to earn enough points and miles , and that ’s really not true .
For the vast majority of people , you ’re going to earn more points and miles on the ground through responsible credit card use than you ever will traveling for business . ”
Though a good travel credit card has a number of components that make it great , when you boil it down , it all comes down to two things : points and perks .
Points
Airlines and travel credit cards give you points on certain purchases that you can exchange for things like flight tickets and hotels .
However , not all points are made the same .
From Gary :
“ What you really want out of your credit card earnings are points that transfer to a variety of frequent flyer programs .
I ’d rather have a point with Chase that can be transferred to United or to another airline or hotel programs than just earning a point with United . ”
So you want points that can be exchanged to a wide variety of frequent flyer programs with different airlines .
That way , you can maximize your spend when you want to exchange your points .
The airlines that you prioritize will depend on a number of factors , including :
Proximity to your home .
Does the airline operate at an airport near you ?
Does the airline operate at an airport near you ?
Your loyalty to them .
Do you absolutely love your experience with a certain airline ?
Is there one you ’d rather avoid completely ?
.
Do you absolutely love your experience with a certain airline ?
Is there one you ’d rather avoid completely ?
Your destination .
Does that airline operate in the place you want to travel to ?
By deciding on the airlines you ’d like to prioritize , you can make a better judgement about which rewards card you get .
The amount each point is worth in dollars varies from rewards program to rewards program .
Luckily , our good friend Brian Kelly over at ThePointsGuy.com keeps a monthly tally of how much certain points are worth .
Perks
Each travel credit card rewards program is unique in the perks they will offer you .
Often times , those perks can be amazing .
“ I ’ve flown with all the bells and whistles using perks , ” Bryce says .
“ Lying flat seats , amazing meals with a chef on board , Dom Perignon champagne before take off .
That ’s all what you can really understand your perks .
That alone has been life changing in a travel perspective . ”
That ’s why it ’s so important to take the time to understand all of the benefits that come with a certain card before you get it .
The small amount of time you spend learning about your card can actually save you a lot of headache later on .
“ Take ten minutes to understand the perks of your card , ” Bryce suggests .
“ Many people do n’t understand the perks that they have because they get the card and do n’t read the fine print or read blogs like mine .
That ’s why people still contact me saying their flight got delayed and how much it sucked — when many times their card might reimburse them $ 500 to cover those issues .
And they had no idea ! ”
And while you ’re going to want to tailor your card to your goals ( more on that later ) , there ’s one travel credit card that recently came to market that has been making waves for its undeniable awesomeness : The Chase Sapphire Reserve .
The king of all travel credit cards : Chase Sapphire Reserve
$ 450 / year
Bonus : 50,000 points ( after you spend $ 4,000 in the first 3 months )
If this card went to your high school , it ’d be the prom king quarterback who still managed to get straight As and become an Eagle Scout .
It ’s really that good .
“ This is by far the best card to go with .
It ’s been very widely publicized in the financial press and with good reason , ” Bryce says .
“ It comes with a ton of perks including free travel insurance , car rental insurance , TSA PreCheck , and Global Entry . ”
NOTE : TSA PreCheck allows you to breeze through the line at security , while Global Entry allows you to breeze through the line at immigration .
It ’s totally worth all the dirty looks you ’ll get .
And if that $ 450 annual fee throws you off , do n’t worry — the card practically pays for itself with $ 300 in annual travel credit as well as its perks .
“ Many people get scared away though because of that $ 450 annual fee , ” Bryce continues .
“ Sure , you ’re paying $ 450 , but the perks alone are worth that each year , plus the big sign - up bonus on points . ”
The card also offers 50,000 bonus points after you spend $ 4,000 in the first three months , and you ’re earning triple points on dining and travel .
Other fantastic perks :
Lounge access in over 900 airports .
Chase gives you access to airport lounges all over the world .
These are areas where you can escape the hustle and bustle of the airport terminal , grab a drink , use Wi -Fi , relax in comfy chairs , and even shower in some lounges .

Reimbursed Global Entry and TSA PreCheck ( $ 100 value ) .
If you travel frequently for work or life , this perk should have you salivating .
Free Global
Entry means you ’ll be able to speed right through the immigration line at the airport AND get access to TSA PreCheck , allowing you to speed through the line at security .

Free Global
Entry means you ’ll be able to speed right through the immigration line at the airport AND get access to TSA PreCheck , allowing you to speed through the line at security .
Better protections if your flight is canceled .
If your flight is delayed more than six hours , Chase reimburses you for up to $ 500 per ticket .
And while we recommend the Chase Sapphire Reserve , we encourage you to get a card that ’s tailored to your goals so it ’ll best suit your individual needs ( Hop down to our “ Set a travel goal ” section for more info ) .
How to maximize your travel rewards
Once you get your card in the mail , there are 3 great tactics you can take in order to get the most bang for your buck .
Stop using cash .
“ Use your card for everything you can , ” Bryce says .
“ Try not to pay cash . ”
The best way for you to get as many points as possible on your travel rewards program is to spend it on everything you normally would .
That means leaving the cash in your wallet ( unless you ’re at one of those weird bars that do n’t take credit cards like it ’s the dark ages ) .
You can even spend it on things you would n’t have expected .
“ The amount of money you spend is often more than you mentally think it is , ” Bryce says .
“ You can start paying off your utilities on your card .
There ’s even ways to pay off your student loans , mortgages , and rent . ”
Do n’t go into debt .
While this may seem painfully obvious , it ’s a lot easier to be more liberal about spending when you know each dollar is going towards that awesome trip to Nairobi .
“ When you get a new card , it ’s easy to get really excited about points , ” Bryce explains .
“ You decide maybe you do need that new flat screen TV and that new coat when you might not otherwise have purchased it . ”
Instead , do n’t change your lifestyle for your travel credit card .
Instead , be judicious about your purchases and make sure you pay your credit card bills .
You can do both of those things through one of my favorite financial systems : Automating your personal finances .
Keep reading to find out exactly how to get started doing that today .
Track your points .
If you decide to really get into the weeds of travel rewards hacking and get multiple travel credit cards , you ’re going to want to keep track of all of your points in one place .
Gary ’s tip for the best way to do this ?
Use AwardsWallet .
It ’s an incredibly helpful online travel rewards tracking tool that ’ll even notify you if there are any changes in your flight .
“ AwardsWallet lets me track most of my points in one place and it ’ll flag when your points are going to expire , ” Gary says .
“ It also helps me track when there are changes to the itinerary or if I have to change my seat .
It ’s really helpful . ”
For more information on how to maximize travel credit cards , be sure to check out our article on the best travel credit card of 2017 .
While your travel credit card is only one part of how to travel cheap , the most important thing you could do to get started is setting a goal .
Set a travel goal to help you choose the best card
Much like literally anything else you want to do in life , set a travel goal .
Not only will setting a goal help you keep focused ( and as a result , increase your chances of accomplishing said goal ) , it can also help you save money when it comes to travel .
“ The important thing to do when you begin travel hacking is to come up with a plan , ” Nomadic Matt says .
“ Have a goal in mind .
What do you want ? ”
And I get it .
The question of what you want to get out of your travels is a HUGE one .
After all , we ’re talking about a literal world you can travel here .
That ’s why Nomadic Matt suggests you niche down your goal with some specific questions :
What do you want out of your perks ?
Do you want free flights ?
Do you prioritize hotel points ?
Are you loyal to one brand ?
Is there a specific trip you have in mind ?
The answers to these questions can help you come up with goals that can help you decide on which travel credit card you want to go with .
From Nomadic Matt :
“ If you ’re a loyal flier with American Airlines , the best cards to start off with would be the Citi / AAdvantage Executive World Elite MasterCard ( 50,000 - point sign - up bonus ) and the Starwood Preferred Guest Card from American Express ( 25,000 - point sign - up bonus , plus a 20 % bonus when you transfer your SPG points to one of their partner airlines like AA ) .
That way you get the perks the card comes with ( free checked bags , special discounts , and priority boarding ) and can jumpstart your point balance right away .
Just want free hotel rooms ?
Sign up for the card from the hotel brand of your choice .
Having a trip in mind and then working backwards to see what cards get you there is the best way to optimize your spending .
That way you do n’t get any card with a flashy bonus , you get the right card .
I skip a lot of cards because they just do n’t meet my travel needs . ”
ACTION STEP : Sign up for a travel credit card
Now it ’s time to actually sign up for a travel credit card that ’s tailored to your goals .
Doing so is simple — but it ’ll take a little bit of time ( one to two weeks ) .
But if you ’re patient and you do your research , you ’ll end up with a card that ’ll be earning travel points for you in no time .
Step 1 : Set a travel goal .
Use the questions above to help you find out what exactly you want out of a travel credit card .
Step 2 : Research 3 - 5 travel credit cards .
Based on your goals , you ’re now going to try to find a good travel credit card that ’ll fit your needs .
Start with a simple Google query for your goal ( ex . “ Best travel card for hotels ” “ Best travel credit card for flights ” ) and go from there .
Every travel credit card has a web page that ’ll contain all of the minutiae related to the card ’s perks and rewards program .
Spend 10 – 20 minutes reading through each of the pages so you understand what each card has to offer .
Here are a few suggestions to get you started :
Best for hotels : AmEx Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card .
With the sign - up bonus that gives you 25,000 points to spend on hotels , as well as 2 points for every dollar spent for Starwood properties ( not to mention the fantastic transfer partners ) , this card is great for the accommodation conscious .

Best for beginners : Chase Sapphire Preferred .
This one is a perfect introductory card as it has a relatively low annual fee ( $ 95 ) that ’s actually waived the first year .
You also have plenty of great rewards as well including 50,000 bonus points if you spend $ 4,000 in your first three months .

Seriously , this card is just GOOD .
Step 3 : Sign up for one .
Eventually , you ’ll want to niche your choices down to one — and only one for now .
We ’re going to start slowly here because you do n’t want to run up a bunch of new lines of credit and go crazy .
Instead , choose the one that ’s the best for you .
Signing up is easy .
Simply go to the credit card ’s website , click on the “ Apply Now ” button ( each site will have a variation of that ) , and start the application process .
The application itself is relatively simple and will ask you for the following information :
Name
Address
Date of birth
Employment status
Yearly salary
Once you ’ve applied , the credit card company will find out your debt - to - income ratio ( your risk as a client ) to determine whether or not you can get a card .
If you ’re approved , great !
You ’ll receive your card in the mail in one to two weeks .
If not , that ’s okay !
I have a great system that can help you improve your credit score and get out of debt .
Cheap travel rule # 2 : Stay flexible about travel
Much like comedy , travel is all about …
.
.
.
.
.
.
… timing .
Flexibility can mean the difference of hundreds , possibly even thousands , of dollars in airfare and points .
More specifically , you should be flexible in these three areas :
When you fly .
Where you stay .
Where you go .
When you fly
“ Flexibility is the most important thing in finding a cheap flight , ” Nomadic Matt says .
“ You need to be flexible in either your date or destination .
If you have to go to Paris on a specific date , then you have to pay the fare .
There ’s no magic bullet to make the price go down . ”
He continues , “ But by changing your date by a day or two , you might be able to drop the price .
Same works for destinations .
If there ’s a cheaper flight to London instead of Stockholm , consider going to London instead . ”
It also helps to travel during times when there are drastically less people traveling .
Off - peak season for uber - popular destinations like New York City or London can have a huge effect on not only airline prices but also hotels , museum entry , and tours as well .
From Bryce :
“ One of my wife and I ’s favorite thing to do each year is to go to Western Europe either over President ’s Day weekend or MLK Day weekend .
Those days are n’t holidays over there and everything is half the price it would be if you went during the summer because summer is the peak travel season .
For example , we were in Paris just over a weekend and in just a couple days we were able to hit all of the highlights of what we wanted to see because you ’re not waiting 2 hours in line for the Louvre , you ’re not having to buy Eiffel Tower tickets weeks in advance .
You can just walk into all these places !
Also , our flights were insanely cheap . ”
Along with traveling during off - peak season , you can also leverage a variety of online tools to help you travel on a budget .
“ Using multiple flight search engine websites like Google Flights , Skyscanner , and Momondo before you choose helps narrow down the cheapest options , ” says Expert Vagabond .
“ You can sign up for fare alerts on these sites too , and they ’ll notify you by email if the prices for your destination change . ”
Where you stay
This means you can skip the expensive Big Box hotels that are looking to squeeze you of as much money as possible .
“ But Ramit , ” you might be saying .
“ I do n’t want to stay in a hostel that ’ll require me to get a tetanus shot afterwards . ”
A common misconception is that traveling cheap means you have to stay in sketchy hostels or flea - ridden hotels .
“ When people picture hostels , they picture the dirty , smelly , cramped places of the 70s and movies that have entered our cultural consciousness , ” Nomadic Matt says .
“ That ’s not really the case .
Hostels have modernized themselves to meet the demands of the market .
They often have nice beds , restaurants , bars , free Wi-Fi , offer tours , and all have private rooms and showers . ”
He continues , “ I ’ve stayed at hostels that rival boutique hotels .
I would n’t count them out as an option .
You can find some really nice ones out there . ”
If hostels are n’t your thing , websites such as Airbnb offer a wide array of fantastic alternatives to hostels AND hotels .
“ If you ’re not into hostels , then hands down the best way to save money on accommodation is via Airbnb ( or similar websites ) , ” Nomadic Matt says .
“ You have a huge selection and great prices .
That ’s the only way to go if you want something that ’s between a hostel and a hotel . ”
Where you go
While big cities like Paris , New York , and Tokyo are undeniably alluring , they ’re also insanely expensive .
In fact , those three cities I just mentioned consistently rank in the top ten most expensive cities in the world .
If that is enough to turn you off from traveling , have no fear !
Instead , you can choose to travel to a place with a lower cost of living .
Doing this can help you save a ton of money .
“ One of the best ways to travel cheap is to go to places that have a cheaper cost of living than the place you currently live , ” Bryce says .
“ People get caught up with costs of the $ 1,500 to fly to Asia .
What they do n’t realize is that once you get there , you can live a really similar lifestyle to what you do in the States for about $ 30 a day . ”
HOWEVER , this is n’t to say that in order to travel cheap you have to avoid places like Paris and Tokyo at all costs .
If you want to go to a more expensive destination AND not break the bank , you ’ll need to learn how to practice conscious budgeting .

Cheap travel rule # 3 : Budget consciously
Budgeting for travel is going to come in two different forms :
How you save money for travel
How you spend money while traveling
You can approach budgeting for both of these things through painless , automatic systems that do the work for you .
Here ’s how .
How to save money before travel
Long time readers can probably guess what the best way to save money for travel is , so let ’s all just say it together :
“ Automate your finances . ”
For those who do n’t know what that is , I ’ll give a quick breakdown .
Automating your finances is a system wherein your money works passively for you .
It ’s the ultimate cure to never knowing how much you have in your checking account and how much you can spend .
When you receive your paycheck , your money is funneled to exactly where it needs to go — whether that be your utilities , rent , Roth IRA , 401k , or your savings account .
How do you save for travel using this system ?
Simple :
You start a sub - savings account exclusively for travel and automate your finances so money goes there every month .
Most banks allow you to create a sub - savings account along with your normal savings account ( you can even name them too ! ) .
Create an account for your traveling goals and start saving today .
“ You need to make travel a priority [ if you want to do it cheap ] , ” Nomadic Matt says .
“ Start a separate savings account .
Audit your expenses .
Keep track of everything you spend money on for a few weeks and find out where the low hanging fruit is . ”
“ BUT RAMIT !
THIS GOES AGAINST YOUR RICH LIFE PHILOSOPHY !
WHO AM I TO BELIEVE ??? ”
Look , there ’s more than one way to save money .
I actually LOVE that the experts and I disagree on this topic .
It goes to show that Rich Life philosophy might not work for everyone … and that ’s fine .
What matters more to me is that you are willing to put forth the effort and start saving money for your goals , whether it be traveling , buying a new house , or getting a new car .
“ Not everyone can save a ton of money or even has the means to travel all the time , ” Nomadic Matt says .
“ But with enough time and dedication , the majority of us can get somewhere . “
How to save money while traveling
This one can be boiled down to one line : Live like a local .
“ Do you think local Costa Ricans pay for tours all the time when traveling in their own country ? ” the Expert Vagabond asks .
“ Or stay at fancy hotels ?
Or eat out at nice restaurants every night ?
No .
They go to the beach and chill .
They stay with friends or in cheap guesthouses .
They take the bus .
They visit a National Park .
They eat at cheap mom & pop eateries .
You , as a traveler , can do the same .
All you have to do is pay for a flight to get down there ! ”
And often times , there are also resources at your destination tailormade to help you get the most out of your travels while saving money .
“ Go into the local tourism office too , ” Nomadic Matt suggests .
“ They exist to help you save money .
They know everything going on in your destination and can point you to free exhibits , attractions , and discounts you wo n’t find in your Lonely Planet guide .
When I was in the Loire in France , they sold discounted entrance to all the castles .
I saved about $ 30 bucks by just walking in .
Too many people skip them . ”

Setting everything up wo n’t take more than one or two hours out of your day , but it will save you thousands of dollars over your lifetime .

May 14 , 2009
By Roger Boyes and John Carr ( The Times , UK )
Do n’t tell anyone , do n’t breathe a word , but the world ’s most powerful men are meeting secretly again to save the planet from economic catastrophe .
Oh , and their address , should you want to send them your opinions , is : c / o Nafsika Astir Palace Hotel , Apollonos Avenue 40 , 16671 Vouliagmeni , Greece .
Bed space is a bit tight there for the next two days while the Bilderberg illuminati hold their private conclave in the five - star Greek hotel .
Every year since 1954 a club of about 130 senior or up - and - coming politicians gather at the fireside of a secluded hotel with top bankers and a sprinkling of royalty to discuss burning issues , to trade confidences and just stay abreast of the I - know - something - you - do n’t - know circuit .
No lists of participants are disclosed , no press conferences are held ; spill the beans and you ’re out of the magic circle .
For those of us standing outside the locked gates all that is left is to hope that they will sleep well , avoid jet ski injury and solve our problems for us .
For the Bilderbergers it is a little like that recent MI5 recruitment ad : “ See all your best work go unnoticed ! ”
Each country delegates two people to the steering committee that is the intellectual hub of Bilderberg .
In the past Kenneth Clarke , the Shadow Business Secretary , and Martin Taylor , formerly head of Barclays Bank , have had their hand on the British tiller .
This year the club is going to talk about depression .
“ According to the pre-meeting booklet sent out to attendees , Bilderberg is looking at two options , ” says the Bilderberg - watcher Daniel Estulin — “ either a prolonged , agonising depression that dooms the world to decades of stagnation , decline and poverty — or an intense but shorter depression that paves the way for a new sustainable economic world order , with less sovereignty but more efficiency . ”
Since Bilderberg does not officially exist , it cannot deny anything and is therefore manna from heaven for the conspiracy theorist .
Eurosceptics are convinced that the future development of the European Union was plotted here — EU commissioners have always been welcomed into the coven , with Peter “ We are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich ” Mandelson a particular favourite .
Margaret
Thatcher , it is said , was a shy debutante at a Bilderberg meeting in 1975 .
Jim Tucker , veteran stalker of the Bilderberg club meetings , claims that Mrs Thatcher was ordered “ to dismantle British sovereignty , but she said , ‘ no way ’ , so they had her sacked ” .
Left - wing conspiracy theorists believe that Bilderbergers form a capitalist nucleus , and there is a germ of truth in this .
The meetings were started in the Netherlands , in the Hotel de Bilderberg , near Arnhem , by the Polish exile Joseph Retinger .
He was worried about growing anti-Americanism and the advance of Communism in Western Europe .
Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands agreed to sponsor the idea , the head of the Central Intelligence Agency , Walter Bedell Smith , threw his weight behind it and so did the White House .
The Bilderberg consensus is that national problems are best solved by an internationally oriented elite , that a global network of decision - makers should have a common language and that the boundaries are fluid between the monied and the political classes .
And so there has been a natural bias towards inviting conservatives and market liberals .
The only socialists invited are those who “ understand money ” .
Ed Balls has taken part and the most indiscreet Bilderberger of all time was Denis Healey , the former Labour Chancellor and fierce Atlanticist .
“ To say we were striving for a one - world government is exaggerated , but not wholly unfair , ” Lord Healey told the author Jon Ronson for his book Them : Adventures with Extremists .
“ Those of us in Bilderberg felt we could n’t go on for ever fighting one another for nothing .
So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing . ”
Another way of viewing the club is that of Metropolitan Seraphim , the bishop of Piraeus , who said that the Bilderbergers represented a “ criminal cabal of world Zionism and its efforts to set up a cruel world dictatorship under the headship of Lucifer ” .
This line is quite common on the blogosphere , where the club ’s secrecy is taken as evidence of evil intentions .
Whether Lucifer will be down there on the sun-loungers remains to be seen .
But what we have been able to establish from a World Bank spokesman , Alexis O’Brien , is that the organisation ’s president , Robert Zoellick , will be in Athens on unspecified business on May 14 .
And that US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner ’s public schedule is mysteriously empty for the next two days .
Jo Ackermann , head of Deutsche Bank , will be travelling “ somewhere in Europe ” .
Jean - Claude Trichet , head of the European Central Bank , will not be around until the end of the week .
You get the drift .
Something is going on .
If only somebody would let us in on the secret .

We 've seen some pretty weird stuff in our years on this planet -- heck , we 've revived our own drenched Sony DAP by burying it in rice for 48 hours -- but this is easily one of the most bizarre gizmo resurrections we 've ever come across .
As the tale goes , one valiant NVIDIA GPU owner apparently bit on a myth which suggested that a pinch of time in the oven ( quite literally , might we add ) would repair faulty GPUs that were throwing up oodles of vertical lines .
After purchasing another GPU to replace his ailing 8800GTX , he figured he had zilch to lose and gave it a shot ; lo and behold , the temporary warmth seemingly melted the solder points and healed micro-fractures that were causing the unwanted lines .
We 've yet to hear how his attempt at returning the new GPU went , but hey , there 's always eBay .

An open topped car is driven through central London past a speed camera in this file photo from July 26 , 2001 .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A senior executive at a speed camera firm was banned from driving for six months Wednesday after admitting speeding at more than 100 mph on a 70 mph limit dual carriageway .
Tom Riall , a divisional chief executive at Serco , was recorded driving at 103 mph in his blue Volvo on the A14 in Newmarket , Suffolk , just before 1 p.m. on January 4 .
Riall was sentenced at a hearing at Sudbury Magistrates ’ Court , the Press Association reported .
Riall is head of Serco ’s Home Affairs division , which has installed Gatso speed cameras at around 4,500 sites around Britain since 1992 .
We are living in very strange times in the United States .
The U.S. has become a bizarre police state in which all the dirty tricks and tactics developed in the Soviet Union , East Germany , and Israel are now used on the unwitting American population .
As we discovered in suburban Hoffman Estates ( N.W. Chicago ) before I was assaulted by undercover police , several of the people who tried to be our friends were actually F.B.I. informants .
I know of at least three .
These F.B.I. informants would come to my house and try to engage me although there was never any real reason why I would want to be involved with them in the first place .
In the summer of 2005 , we discovered the first two F.B.I. informants .
They were a male - female team that swarmed around us like flies .
One was a handicapped American male ; the other a woman from the Philippines .
The first ( who had met my wife at the library ) had introduced us to the latter , which is typical of such operations .
Later , a Lebanese friend I had known for years , a U.S. postal worker , told me he had " started " working for the F.B.I .
This swarming of F.B.I. informers around our house was the main reason we left our home in the fall of 2005 and went to Europe .
This is also why I have learned to be very careful about the people I associate with .
I do n't abide F.B.I. informants .
Amazingly , only a few days after President Obama met terror - specialist Benjamin Netanyahu , now prime minister of Israel , four American black men have been arrested in what certainly appears to be a very shady " terror " bomb plot against Jewish buildings in the Bronx and a plane at the privately - owned airport / military base at Stewart Airport in Newburgh , N.Y.
Bibi Netanyahu was the Israeli foreign minister who told the New York Times on 9 - 11 that the terror attacks that killed thousands of Americans were " very good " for U.S. - Israeli relations .
Amazingly , he was also on the scene of the bombings in London in July 2005 , and reportedly escaped danger after being warned by Israeli intelligence of the imminent bombings .
Netanyahu , a violent Jewish racist of the most extreme sort , meeting with America 's first " black " president .
Truly amazing !
What will come next ?
The bombing of Iran ?
All indications point to a continuation of the radical Zionist agenda .
There is no organized resistance to this agenda , which has complete control of the mass media .
Judith Miller , the disgraced and convicted Zionist propagandist from the New York Times , wrote about the terror plot on FOX Forum ( Rupert Murdoch 's FOX News ) where she is now employed .
Still a devoted Zionist propagandist , Miller 's article was meant to underline the main point that the Zionists want to drill into the minds of Americans : " Watch Out , America , Our Biggest Terror Threats Are Increasingly Homegrown . "
" The foiled plot in New York demonstrates that the terrorist threat to America , and to New York in particular , did not end with Obama 's election as president , " Miller wrote .
On this , I agree .
The United States is still in the hands of terrorists .
Obama 's chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel from my hometown of Chicago , is named after a Jewish terrorist and comes from a family of dedicated Zionist terrorists .
The Zionist Irgun , Haganah , LEHI , and Stern Gang of Palestine invented the use of terrorism as a political tool .
Sherman Skolnik , the late Chicago muck - raking journalist of the Jewish faith , wrote that Rahm Emanuel 's father , Dr. Ben Emanuel ( formerly Auerbach ) was actually involved in the Irgun murder of the U.N. Special Envoy to Palestine in 1948 , the Swedish Count Folke Bernadotte .
How interesting .
What is very clear from this latest " terror " plot in New York is that this was another false - flag conspiracy in which the U.S. government , specifically the F.B.I. , played a very active , if not the leading , role .
From reading the statement and complaint from the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York it is very clear that the F.B.I. was directing and guiding the terror plot from the beginning .
How typical .
One of the four defendants , a Haitian , can not even read or write English .
The bombs and Stinger missile that are described in the complaint were fakes produced by the F.B.I .
That is to say that if the F.B.I. had not been involved in this plot there would not have been any plot , nor bombs , nor Stinger missile .
This was clearly more of a terror plot " with the U.S. " rather than " within the U.S. "
The U.S. government was involved in every aspect of this planned crime .
So , why are n't the government agents involved in plotting terrorist crimes exposed ?
Who was leading whom ?
Do we actually pay for this kind of government service ?
This is a case that is strikingly similar to the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center .
Like the 1993 false flag attack , this case is also being prosecuted by the Zionist prosecutor Lev Louis Dassin , acting U.S. Attorney in New York .
" Acting " means , in this case , that U.S. Attorney Lev Dassin holds his position without being appointed by the President or approved by Congress .
Somebody retired and , BINGO , Dassin is put into the crucial position .
I have written more extensively about Lev Dassin 's Zionist background in relation to the Madoff and Nadel cases .
He is clearly part of the terror problem - not the solution .
Dassin , the scion of a family of Russian Zionists , is also handling the Madoff and Art Nadel cases .
In the Madoff case , Dassin did not file the most obvious charge of conspiracy .
He obviously accepted Madoff 's statement that he had stolen the $ 50 billion all by himself and had no accomplices .
According to Dassin 's complaint against Madoff , his closest business partners , Sy Syms and Jacob Ezra Merkin , who funneled billions of dollars to his investment fund , were completely clueless and out of the loop .
They just invested billions of dollars into a black hole .
Is that believable ?
The conspicuous fact that Madoff 's partners are the directors and owners of " private " Israeli banks ( privatized under then finance minister Bibi Netanyahu ) and have branches in Switzerland that are allowed to make use of Swiss secrecy laws is of no interest to Lev Dassin .
Golly Lev , so where did the $ 50 billion go ?
Lev Dassin , who comes from a very Zionist Jewish family , worked closely with Michael Chertoff on the prosecution of the 1993 " false flag " bombing of the World Trade Center .
Do we see a pattern here ?
I find it outrageous that the U.S. Dept. of Justice is involved in plotting and setting up such crimes while it hides the real evidence of what really happened on 9 - 11 .
This is , however , the Zionist - controlled terror state we are faced with .
As Joe Biden clearly revealed in Los Angeles , the U.S. government refuses to address the evidence of super - thermite in the dust of the World Trade Center as it conspires to frame American Muslims for crimes that it designs .
What is most disturbing for patriotic Americans is that we have met the enemy and it is -- U.S. Sources Bollyn , Christopher , " < http://www.bollyn.com/articles-by-subject>Is the Prosecutor Protecting Madoff's Fellow Conspirators ? "

Police intervened as protesters from the left and right clashed
Five immigrants have been injured after far - right demonstrators tried to storm a disused courthouse in Athens occupied mainly by illegal migrants from Africa .
Dozens of protesters hurled stones and fireworks at the eight - storey building on Saturday night , while those living inside threw bricks and masonry slabs .
Police said nine officers were also injured in the violence .
Three youths were arrested over the attack , which came after a march by the anti-immigrant Golden Dawn group .
The protesters waved banners reading " Foreigners mean crime " and " We have become foreigners in our own country " .
Some of the immigrants said the police did little to help
Enlarge Image
Left - wing groups staged a counter - rally nearby and riot police were deployed to keep the two sides apart .
Petrol bombs and stones were thrown between the two groups , and the violence continued when anti-immigrant protesters descended on the old courthouse .
The Associated Press news agency reports that hundreds of immigrants live in squalid conditions in the building , amid piles of fetid rubbish and human waste without electricity or running water .
Fouad , a 33 - year - old Moroccan immigrant living in the building , told AP that he could not understand why the protesters had attacked .
" We did n't do anything .
Why do they treat us like this ? " he said .
" The police did nothing .
Here in Greece , human rights do n't exist . "

Two people died Monday during a fight between anti-government protesters and Bangkok residents , Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said in a televised address .
Earlier , former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , whose supporters have engaged in escalating clashes with Thai police , reiterated Monday that he is willing to return to his country but would not say when .
" Well , you know I am ready to go when the time is right , " Thaksin told CNN .
" But now , I like to see peaceful protests by the demonstrators .
Actually , you know , they are all innocent people .
They come with bare hands ; they are asking for true democracy and justice .
But they got back undemocratic ways with a lot of brutal suppression . "
Watch Thaksin denounce government »
Thaksin would not say when he might return .
Earlier , he had asked his supporters to " come out for a revolution , " saying he would lead them in a march to the capital if necessary .
He fled Bangkok last year while facing trial on corruption charges .
Thaksin spoke to CNN as clashes between protesters and police intensified Monday , the beginning of the Thai New Year .
The army fired a volley of shots at the anti-government protesters , who are demanding that the current prime minister step down .
It was not immediately known whether the troops fired rubber bullets or live gunshots .
iReport :
See images from the protests
Demonstrators commandeered at least two buses , rigged the steering wheels and sent them toward police officers , who fired at the vehicles in response .
Other buses were seen burning .
Watch more about the situation on the streets »
Earlier in the day , protesters hurled gasoline bombs , blocked intersections and set fires in many parts of Bangkok , the capital .
Scores of riot police descended on the streets .
At least 70 people -- 23 soldiers and 47 protesters -- were wounded in clashes , some from gunshot wounds , the prime minister said in a televised address .
iReport : Numerous buses set ablaze
" The first objective is to clear up the traffic blocks around the city , " said Panitan Wattanayagorn , a Thai government spokesman .
" The second is to return the government offices and compound back to the officers .
Lastly , reduce the threat to the prime minister and his cabinet ministers . "
The Thai New Year , or Songkran , began Monday and is traditionally a multi-day celebration in the country .
People roam the streets , drenching one another and passers - by with water guns or containers of water .
This year , however , thousands of " red shirt " protesters -- so named for their clothing -- have rallied for days , saying that Abhisit 's 4 - month - old government is not democratically elected and that he should call new elections .

The demonstrators have given the prime minister repeated deadlines to resign , but those have come and gone .
" He insists under the circumstances , where there is a lot of deep division in the society ... resigning wo n't solve any standing conflict , " Panitan said .
On Sunday , Abhisit declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and surrounding areas after the protesters forced the postponement of a summit of Asian leaders in the southern coastal city of Pattaya , embarrassing the government .
Protesters took over two gas tanker trucks Monday , slashed the tires of a police van and surrounded the prime minister 's office , which seemed devoid of any security presence .
The government , which had appeared unable to order the army or police to use force in tamping down the protests , set up a " center " Monday with the heads of the police , army , air force and navy to coordinate a response , Panitan said .
" We 're trying as best as we can to go on with our daily lives , and we are hoping that our prime minister is able to resolve everything peacefully soon , " resident Supatra Jenstitwong said .
The protesters are loyal to Thaksin , who was ousted in a 2006 coup .
The government has blamed him for fomenting the latest clashes .
" Now that they have tanks on the street and the soldiers are coming out , so it is time for the people to come out for a revolution , " Thaksin told supporters , speaking by video link from an unknown location .
Immediately after Abhisit 's state - of - emergency declaration , dozens of protesters stormed the country 's interior ministry and pelted Abhisit 's car with rocks , chairs , flags and sticks as he escaped .
Protesters climbed atop two military armored cars after lying in the road and blocking their path .
A police officer was led away by demonstrators and beaten , said Sathit Wongnongtoey , an official in the prime minister 's office .
" It 's unprecedented , " opposition member Jakrapob Penkair said Monday .
" I would n't say it is a revolution .
At least it 's a starting point of the people 's uprising against the old power . "
The emergency measure allows officials to arrest and detain protesters without a court order , and to restrict gatherings , authorities said .
Bruce Bugajski and his brother arrived Sunday night for a four - day trip to Thailand and were driven to their hotel by a cabdriver with a red ribbon on his dashboard , signifying his support for the protesters .
The normally congested highways leading into the city were deserted .
" He had a picture of the old prime minister , " Bugajski said .
" He said that 's who he wants to get back to power down here . "
Monday morning , the scene outside their hotel was calm , a contrast to the images of clashes blaring from their television screen .
" Kids were outside squirting tourists with their squirt guns , and some of the tourists were getting into it , " Bugajski said .
" It 's quite a different picture . "

All About Thailand • Thaksin Shinawatra
Recognizing the resentment , a few upscale hotels have begun to drop Internet charges — at least for some of their guests .

Hyatt announced last month that it would waive the charge for in - room Internet access for members of its loyalty program at platinum and diamond levels .
In March the luxury Liberty Hotel in Boston did away with the $ 10.99 fee it had been charging for Internet access and began offering free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel .
Some hotels , however , have taken the opposite direction .
Thompson Hotels , a small group of boutique hotels that used to boast about free Wi -Fi , started charging $ 10 per 24 - hour period earlier this year .
“ As rates of all of the hotels have decreased , ” said Jennifer Walters , a publicist for the hotel group , “ certain services that do n’t affect all guests had to be altered — one such item being Wi -Fi .
Not all guests use it , so to include it complimentary in the rate no longer makes sense with the consumer wanting the most attractive rates . ”
Yet on the whole , more hotels do seem to be moving away from the fees .
Over all , 15 percent of hotels charge for Internet service in a guest room , down from 22 percent in 2004 , according to a 2008 survey by the American Hotel and Lodging Association .
Those that still require payment for the service are overwhelmingly at the high end : 49 percent of luxury or upscale hotels charge for in - room Internet service compared with just 16 percent of economy or budget properties .
Only 5 percent of midprice hotels require payment .
Some major chains that charge for Internet service in guest rooms have been offering free Wi-Fi in lobbies , but travelers say it ’s not the same .
“ Everyone has to line up in the computer room , and the hotel lobby becomes an Internet cafe , which is rather unappealing , ” Kevin Leibel , president of a brand strategy company in Chapel Hill , N.C. , wrote in an e-mail message from the business center at the Westin Palace in Madrid while on vacation .
For in - room Internet , that hotel charges 18 euros for 24 hours ( about $ 24 at $ 1.33 to the euro ) or 12 euros an hour , but users are allowed 30 minutes at a time free in the business center .
The historians who unearthed the 17 volumes of files that revealed Mr. Kurras ’s double life say there is no evidence to support the theory that the Stasi was behind the killing .
Berlin officials have resisted public calls from victims ’ groups and others to retry Mr. Kurras .
He was acquitted in 1967 , the year of the shooting , of manslaughter charges and was later allowed to rejoin the police force after the verdict was upheld .
In an interview with the Bild , Mr. Kurras , 81 , confirmed that he had been in the East German Communist Party .
“ Should I be ashamed of that or something ? ” Mr. Kurras was quoted as saying .
As for the Stasi , he said , “ And what if I did work for them ?
What does it matter ?
It does n’t change anything , ” the paper reported .
Mr. Kurras does not deny that he shot the demonstrator , Benno Ohnesorg , in the back of the head , but has said the shooting was an accident .
He denied records showing he had been paid by the security service , and said the agents who had put those details in his file must have been lining their own pockets .
Mr. Kurras was born in East Prussia and volunteered for military service in 1944 when he was 16 years old .
He was imprisoned not long after the war by the Soviets at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp for three years .
He was known to be an enthusiastic gun collector and an excellent marksman .

He began leading a secret double life in 1955 , when he went to the authorities in East Berlin and asked to move to East Germany and join the police there .
Instead , according to files unearthed by the historians Helmut Müller - Enbergs and Cornelia Jabs , he was told to stay with the police in West Berlin while spying for the Stasi , and he had a cover name , Otto Bohl .
If Mr. Kurras seemed to fit the bill of the “ fascist cop , ” Mr. Ohnesorg came across as the most innocent of victims .
A student who also wrote poetry , he was married , his wife pregnant with their first child , when he went to a demonstration against a state visit by Iran ’s leader , Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi .

Rep. Manzullo to Geithner : Your Plan Is ' Radical '
UPDATED at 1:21 P.M. :
In testimony before the House Financial Services committee that just adjourned , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner just had to defend his institutional takeover plan against charges of radicalism .
" Do you realize how radical your proposal is ? " Rep. Donald Manzullo ( R - Ill . ) asked .
" It 's not radical . . . "
Geither began , before Manzullo interrupted him .
" You 're talking about seizing private businesses and you do n't consider that radical ? "
Manzullo replied , his voice rising .
Manzullo is trying to get Geithner to give details of the plan -- that 's where Geithner got stung before -- but Geithner does n't have them yet .
If the plan were not radical , Manzullo said to Geithner , " you would have answers to some of my questions , such as , what size business would be subject to this ? "
Geithner : Banning ' Naked ' Credit Default Swaps Not Necessary
Noon : Geithner said banning so - called naked credit default swaps " is n't necessary and would n't help . "
A credit default swap is insurance one party sells to another against default on a debt .
In a " naked " swap , one party carries no actual risk in the transaction ; instead , it 's a bet on the transaction 's outcome .
Naked swaps have been criticized as being speculative at best and actually creating risk .
Rep. Joe Donnelly ( D - Ind. ) asked Geithner if he would consider banning the swaps .
" To me , I 'm from the Midwest , these just look like simple bets , " Donnelly said , which American taxpayers have been forced to pay off .
Geithner allowed that there is strong debate on the issue and that " my own sense is that banning naked credit default swaps is n't necessary and would n't help . "
He said it is " terribly hard " to differentiate between a legitimate hedge and a pure speculative bet .
The House Financial Services committee , where Geithner is testifying , is now in recess so members can vote on legislation .
Geithner : New Regulatory Power Over Financials Should Rest With FDIC
10:54 A.M. : Geithner said the governments sweeping new powers to seize non-bank financial institutions , if passed by Congress , would be based on the FDIC 's model .
Asked by Rep. David Scott ( D - Ga. ) where such sweeping powers would rest , Geithner said " we would rely on the FDIC to run the regime . "
Congress appears open to Geithner 's plan , if Rep. Paul Kanjorski's ( D - Penn . ) statement earlier represents the general sentiment of the body : " We need to provide the administration with a bigger hammer . "
Geithner : ' New Rules Of the Game ' Needed
10:12 : A.M. : Geithner is rolling out his proposed sweeping changes to the the regulatory system governing the financial industry , which were first reported here by The Post 's Binya Appelbaum and David Cho .
Geither is proposing " new rules of the game . "
You can read his entire testimony here .
Geithner said it his intent to lay out the " substance of reform " today but not " the complex and sensitive questions of who should be responsible for what . "
This could be troublesome for Wall Street , which freaked out the last time Geithner failed to provide details for a big plan , when he rolled out the " substance " of his toxic asset plan but not its details .

What is being decided by the California Supreme Court ?
The state ’s top court will rule on whether to uphold or strike down Proposition 8 , a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage .
The justices will also decide whether the state will continue to recognize the estimated 18,000 same - sex marriages carried out in 2008 .
How did we get to this point ?
After San Francisco officials began allowing same - sex couples to wed there in 2004 , the courts intervened , invalidating the marriages on grounds that local officials had overstepped their authority .
Advertisement
But in May 2008 , the California Supreme Court ruled that the state Constitution protects a fundamental “ right to marry ” that extends to same - sex couples .
That made California the second state in the union , after Massachusetts , to permit same - sex marriage .
About 18,000 gay and lesbian couples married between June and November , when voters approved Proposition 8 , which amended the state Constitution to recognize marriage as only between a man and woman .
Opponents of Proposition 8 appealed to the California Supreme Court to overturn the ballot measure .
They contend that the proposition changed the tenets of the state Constitution and therefore amounted to a revision , which can only be placed on the ballot by a two - thirds vote of the Legislature ; Proposition 8 reached the ballot after a signature drive .

What do legal experts expect the court to do ?
Based on comments the justices made at a hearing earlier this year , most legal experts expect the court to uphold Proposition 8 but continue to recognize the marriages of same - sex couples wed before the November election .
If the court upholds Proposition 8 , what happens next ?
State officials would continue to prohibit issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples .
Supporters of same - sex marriage , however , are expected to go back to the ballot box as early as 2010 with a constitutional amendment recognizing same - sex marriage .
Advertisement
If Proposition 8 is upheld , would that affect the state ’s domestic partnership law , which gives same - sex couples the legal rights of marriage ?
No .
State law surrounding domestic partnerships is separate from the issue of allowing same - sex couples to marry .
There is no dispute about the legality of domestic partnerships .
After the California Supreme Court ruled in May 2008 that same - sex couples could marry , the state also began to recognize same - sex couples married out of state .
If Proposition 8 is upheld , would California continue to recognize those couples as married ?
Advertisement
That ’s a question the California Supreme Court will decide .
How have other states handled same - sex marriage ?
Most states do not recognize same - sex marriage , either by state law or constitutional amendment .
The federal government does not recognize same - sex marriage .
Some states , mostly on the West Coast and in the Northeast , offer same - sex couples civil unions or domestic partnerships , giving each partner some of the legal benefits granted to spouses , such as the ability to file joint income tax returns and receive spousal health insurance benefits from government agencies .
Five states now allow same - sex couples to marry : Massachusetts , Connecticut , Iowa , Vermont and Maine .
In New Hampshire , New York and New Jersey , lawmakers are considering legalizing same - sex marriage .
In Iowa and Maine , opponents of same - sex marriage say they plan to use the ballot box to overturn decisions to legalize same - sex marriage .

What are some tips for reading the state Supreme Court ’s decision ?
The majority decision should be revealed in the first or second page of the ruling and reiterated in its last paragraph .
Separate concurring and dissenting opinions would follow .
Counting votes may be tricky because the court is dealing with three different legal issues : whether Proposition 8 amounts to an impermissible revision of the state Constitution ; the attorney general ’s challenge contending that marriage is an “ inalienable ” right that ca n’t be taken away without compelling justification ; and the fate of existing same - sex marriages .
The court ’s vote on the revision issue , for example , will probably differ from its vote on whether existing marriages should continue to be recognized by the state .
Advertisement
Justices who disagree with the majority file dissents .
If they agree with only part of the majority decision , they file an opinion called a partial concurrence and dissent .
During oral argument in March , every justice expressed support for upholding existing marriages .
Justice Carlos R. Moreno indicated that he believed Proposition 8 was an illegal revision , a sign that he could dissent on that question .
Moreno might be joined by Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar , a former civil rights lawyer who stressed that the court was dealing with a novel legal question .
Werdegar , however , did not join Moreno in voting to put the measure on hold pending the court ’s ruling .

Robert posed a few questions on the Morality and God post that I thought deserved a little attention ( actually , all of them from everyone were good , but this is a good easy place to start I think , the conversation that ensued after the post delighted me though , so thanks to those of you that participated , feel free to continue ! )
Robert says :
Matt you say God created man and woman imperfect .
Is the freedom and ability to do wrong an imperfection or part of perfection ?
I do n’t really think freedom nor ability to do wrong would be the act of creating imperfection … but creating us in the LIKLIHOOD that we will screw it all up and then planting the device by which we will fail Him in the middle of the garden , then providing the Serpent to tempt man .
It ’s that the Bible teaches that God essentially SET MAN UP FOR FAILURE that makes HIM the bad guy , that is imperfection .
Regarding God creating evil ?
I think God IS good ( He defines it by his being God ) .
Evil exists when we do that which is not of God .
Its not created surely ?
Lets take a literalistic view here .
“ I form the light , and create darkness : I make peace , and create evil : I the LORD do all these things . ” ( Isaiah 45:7 , KJV )
The Bible says God created evil .
Creating choice is one thing , but creating evil is entirely another .
IF god created something ( out of nothing or void ) that we can definitively say we do n’t need ( bad things are n’t needed surely ? ) then is n’t that just setting us up to fail ?
Why create the unnecessary ?
And the Sovereign God argument , that God did it so it must be part of his perfect will etc , is bunk because he must know that it is far beyond reasonable comprehension for us feeble minded humans and that our lack of understanding will CAUSE many of us ( myself ) to go astray .
Once again HE is creating the chaos , just like the Bible says .
I know this is brief , tomorrow I intend to bring up the different views that exist regarding God and Satan — one being that Lucifer is the good guy — what do you think ?

Abstract :
We can easily understand the cultural logic inherent in the global financial crisis as a ‘ world historical moment , ’ a moment where the very tenets of globalization and mediation are being challenged at their most underlying theoretical core .
However , the event also must be understood as the first global event that is wholly and uniformly a postmodern crisis .
In the financial collapse of the banking and credit systems we see the most fundamental aspects of postmodernism revealing itself in material reality .
I examine the crisis and how it is ultimately perfectly predicted and consummated in the ontological works of Lyotard ( The Postmodern Condition ) , the global theories of Baudrillard ( The Precession of Simulcra ) and the mind–politics of Foucault ( Discipline and Punish ) .
I argue that high Modernism has remained the dominant socio–cultural mode despite the emergence of mainstream postmodern theory in the 1970s , but with the global capitalistic system in greater flux theoretically than ever before we are glimpsing the ultimate death of the last Grand Narrative in modern history .
After the death of God ( Nietzsche ) , the death of dialectic ( Fukuyama , Zizek , Baudrillard ) , and now with the possibility of the death of late capitalism we find ourselves at another cultural cross–roads , one that can only find refuge in simulation .
Introduction
This paper attempts to investigate and understand the cultural logic inherent in the global financial crisis as a worldwide historical moment , a moment where the very tenets of globalization and mediation are being challenged at their most underlying theoretical core .
However , the crisis also must be understood as the first global event that is wholly and uniformly postmodern .
In the financial collapse and subsequent bailout of the banking and credit systems , AIG executive bonuses and Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme we see the most fundamental aspects of postmodernism revealing itself in material reality .
Before the intertextual analysis begins it will behoove the reader to understand the interpretative definitions by which modernity , postmodernity and dialectic will be referred to throughout .
The ideological differences inherit in modernity and postmodernity becomes as significant as any historical time period the two might be associated with .
Modernity comes from the Latin word modo meaning “ just now . ”
In relation to postmodernism we can think of the modern as a cultural or superstructural force in place since the late 19th century .
Defined here modernity is historically reactionist , energized by attitudes with fixed relational ideological points or dialectical relations to the past or another .
Ideological claims of absolutes or ultimate truths such as progress reign .
The cultural logic of modernity can be defined by the rise of capitalism , industrialization , world wars , mass media and a democratic and socialist dialectic .
Modernity as defined by Jean - Francois Lyotard also means a historical time period where grand or metanarratives are used to legitimate various projects political or scientific .
The aims of the modernist movement are for hyper- rationality , objectivity and progress .
While apparent that postmodernity follows modernity , any sort of teleological destination is absent with the arrival of a postmodern paradigm .
Unlike modernity , postmodernity is not predicated on a fixed relational ideological point or dialectical other .
Instead postmodernism can be defined as ideologically pluralist .
The movement suggests a dissolved dialectic in relation towards an advancement of one specific ideal against another and also exhibits a possible cultural pluralism that allows for new socio-political possibilities .
Postmodernity ’s cultural logic is articulated through globalization , the end of the Cold War and the rise of information technology .
Lyotard uses an aphorism to define postmodernity as “ skepticism towards all metanarratives , ” while Baudrillard calls the period a theory , a negation , an end and a simulacrum .
Using the aforementioned definitions I believe western society has yet to experience a truly postmodern cultural event on the scale exhibited by the global banking crisis that has reached its apex during September 2008 .
The Great Depression of 1929 must be seen as a modern counterpart to our current crisis because the dialectic was still very much in play .
Had the United States government not intervened , the failure of capitalism could likely have led to totalitarian governments and communism under the semblance of the same modernist teleological progress .
Today , the financial crisis of the banks in the United States comes during an era some of seen as the end of history , a time that has come to be defined by global free market capitalism as the closest thing to ideal and liberal democracy as the only eschatology .
Fukuyama ’s end of history doctrine interprets a postmodern landscape as one where the failure of Marxism can be seen as a historical synthesis that heralds liberal democracy as the supreme end of ideology .
While this provocative argument held serious consideration in the early 1990s when his Fukuyama ’s thesis was published , today we are seeing the last modern moment capitulating to postmodernity with the failure of the banks .
What happens when the dominant western ideology fails in an era without an obvious ‘ other ’ to engage in a synthesis towards an ideal ?
When the power structures reveal themselves flaccid ?
Has the last remaining Grand Narrative of endless consumer consumption and late - capitalism finally revealed the fictions that constitute that every dominant ideology ?
Never before have these questions been so pertinent .
However , they have at least been broached in critical theory .
This paper seeks to argue that upon examination , the crisis appears to be the ultimate consummation of the works of two postmodern theorists , Jean - Francoise Lyotard and Jean Baudrillard .
Lyotard provides a strong starting point to position how we can understand the postmodern and offers a possibility for hope and change amid crisis .
Baudrillard offers a bleaker outlook , but one with relevant and literal correlations to postmodern culture and the financial crisis .
After influential postmodern arguments on the death of God ( Nietzsche ) , the death of the dialectic ( Fukuyama , Zizek , Baudrillard ) , and now the possible end game as the death of capital , we find ourselves at unique historical crossroad .
Revealing itself slowly , the financial crisis gives most in society little choice but to take refuge in simulation and delusion : the first thoroughly postmodern event .
Lyotard and Legitimation
In many ways , the most logical place to begin understanding the financial crisis as ultimately one of postmodern significance is with Jean - Francois Lyotard .
The Postmodern Condition describes a shift in western knowledge that has realized itself during the last half of the 20th century .
The shift is still very much in play , unraveling itself in myriad ways , but one area that comes to the fore in relation to the financial crisis is the postmodern theory of legitimation .
For Lyotard , postindustrial , computerized society brings with it a crisis of legitimation .
The competing structuralist language games used in western culture are vastly different and incapable of legitimating rules , structures or truths when adhered to in relation to each other .
Lyotard says in other words , scientific empirical knowledge structures can never be truly resolved with narrative qualitative knowledge structures and vice versa .
They have different sources of legitimation and play by their own rules and compatibilities .
So how does culture progress ?
Scientific and narrative tools are used hand - in - hand in economics , finance and government .
The answer to this is that these different types of knowledge are all ultimately subservient to teleological and fundamental ideologies vis -à - vis institutions .
Certain truths are accepted , while others ignored simply because they certain types of knowledge serve the institutional structure better than others .
This is the modernist narrative .
In Late - Capitalism , the only knowledge that matters as a means to an ends is capital itself .
So what happens when the ultimate knowledge in a modern society , capital , becomes challenged or deeply devalued ?
That is symptomatic of the postmodern break we are currently witnessing .
Suddenly , the infallible worship of the almighty dollar is thrown into question and we are left with no answers .
We retreat into the basic language based structuralist knowledge games that are insufficient as pointed out in Lyotard ’s critique of Wittgenstein .
In turn , we have economists , politicians , governments , CEOs , workers , lawyers , judges , tax payers , businessmen , academics , etc. arguing to determine the fate of global capitalism .
The problem is they are not speaking the same language .
This is a communication model predicated on unintelligible noise when taken in total , encoders with no decoders .
As the institutions themselves face impotency , there is no ultimate arbiter of the language games that occur .
The great irony of course comes to be seen when governments attempt to take over the free market , in effect a group of people trillions of dollars in debt attempting to regulate those with billions of dollars in debt .
This is the only legitimation that can occur .
It is at once completely illogical and also completely necessary if liberal democracy is to assert itself as the dominant ideology .
Beneath this disquieting period , where languages inadvertently undermine fictions , the central postmodern questions arise :
Is legitimation even possible ?
Is money legitimate ?
Is western hegemonic socio-political dominance predicated on grand narratives ?
And if the grand narratives are untrue , must we believe them anyway to maintain our place in the world ?
Lyotard points out that the types of understanding institutions tend to strive for are ones of ideological purity and universalism , concepts at odds with the chaotic nature of man .
Further Lyotard understands the appearance of the grand narrative as the development of a “ truth ” for a reason .
And the reason at the heart of the lie can almost always be seen as one of wealth and more importantly , power .
When a grand narrative proves to be neither purely rational nor universal it fails to exert its power .
A history of ideology during the 20th century finds plenty of examples of the fall of modernist grand narratives : the rise and fall of Nazism , the fall of the Soviet Union , the detonation and aftermath of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and perhaps most telling , the People ’s Republic of China ’s rise as a global capital leader .
Each of these events had profound impact on the ideological development of late capitalism .
And now it is late capitalism that is in fear of failure with the financial crisis .
But not necessarily because it is being posed as a diametrically opposed ideology to an Other , as seen in the modernist dialectic .
Instead it is facing the worst kind of failure , an internal collapse under its own Lose Weight Exercise .
A self - inflicted blow that reveals far more fictions than truths in a dominant system without an obvious dialectic challenge : a postmodern failure .
This is the fight Timothy Geithner and Ben Bernanke take up on a daily basis .
It is the fight for grand narrative , for late capitalism , for western hegemonic dominance .
The fight to reassert capitalism and the stock market as systems of exponential monetary growth is being questioned as economic imaginary .
As Geithner and Bernanke testify in Congressional hearings , the stocks fluctuate as if to suggest if we all believe the lie we might be ok .
This is a fight being made all the more difficult by technology .
Lyotard might say that now more than ever the stakes of knowledge are in a vulnerable position .
They are in a stable disequilibrium : the power still appears to remain in the hands of the institutions , but discourse and resources are more readily available and waiting to be moved like pawns in a chess game by anyone willing to challenge policy and the past .
After all , only in a postmodern environment can a society exhibit enough pluralist attitudes , often through technology , to elect the other as president .
So what of Barack Obama ?
Is there hope for a transparency in a free market economic structure that allows for a truly egalitarian , democratic discourse ?
When the present is in flux and guidance is deeply desired , what will the new era look like ?
Is Obama doing the same work as Geithner and Bernanke or is something else at play ?
Have we truly moved past the modern with the election of Obama or will Grand Narratives be re-introduced ?
On paper it appears Obama would side with Lyotard .
Both seem to understand the monumental stakes at play for power , knowledge , capital and technology .
However , it is also clear Obama is not an overt postmodernist .
Obama attests to believing in Grand Narratives ( God , the United States , Democracy ) but in a way that might suggest he actually is the first postmodern president .
Simon Critchley notes that while Obama subscribes to certain dominant ideologies , he does so in a way that he is personally able to reconcile them , so although they may guide his principles , he understands they are likely not teleological , universal truths .
For Critchley , and in theory Lyotard , this is absolutely critical to Obama ’s character and allows him to negotiate a postmodern political landscape with an open mind .
It is not surprising that Obama is a proponent of net neutrality and free content systems , as is Lyotard .
How will a president with such complex , seemingly contradictory fundamental ideologies handle a crisis of capital and finance ?
Perhaps instead of perpetuating financial impossibility in a no-option , no - exit , endless economic crisis that we can escape only by believing a lie , perhaps Obama will live up to his credo of “ change ” and announce a return to modernist thinking and put cultural grand narratives back on the table .
Just as Foucault , Derrida and Lyotard fought to reconsider the Grand Narrative philosophers like Kant , Hegel and Marx in an attempt to find meaning in the rapid gyre of history , Obama might find respite from a turbulent postmodernism by attempting to reinstitute the foundational democratic theories and liberal practices of Rousseau , Jefferson and FDR .
The reappearance of romantic ideals is something missing in our daily lives and something that would likely lead back to modernism .
The first truly postmodern event as evident in the financial crisis could likely also be the last , an impetus back towards the modern .
The possibility of a complete transformation , one referenced by Lyotard that uses technology to move beyond even postmodernism , still seems too far distant and ahistorical at this point .
For example , the idea of the Internet as a liberating and completely revolutionary concept seems to be rendered hopeful idealism today .
Ideas like this might as well be considered romantic .
That is to say , modern .
While Lyotard allows for an ambiguously possible liberation in and through postmodernism , this paper seeks to argue that this does not appear likely in the current historical situation .
The other option for extrication from the financial crisis is one that simply moves farther down the road of postmodernism into deeper and deeper simulation and delusion .
In the wake of bailouts and government interventions , simulations and strategies , the postmodern condition is revealing itself as never before .
The postmodern theorist whose ideas exemplify this view most is Jean Baudrillard .
Baudrillard ’s Simulations can be read as having disturbingly prophetic accuracy today .
Using Simulations as a guide , this analysis explains how Baudrillard ’s theories provide further evidence that the global financial crisis of 2008 is the postmodern apotheosis fully realized .
Baudrillard and Simulation
The procession of simulacra in Baudrillard provides an excellent model when we look at how modern capital has become distorted out of reality .
In the successive phases of the image , Baudrillard identifies the first as a reflection of a basic reality .
In this first stage the “ image ” is clearly an artificial placeholder for the “ real ” item .
Although Baudrillard often associates this period with pre-history , we can think of it in terms of the monetary system as the point when money and tokens were first invented .
Early tokens stood in place for actually commodities such as goats and grains .
That is to say money was invented to more easily trade commodities in reality .
It was a specific placeholder that had a specific referent .
For example , one coin actually meant you actually had one goat in tactile reality .
In the second phase of the simulacra , the image masks and perverts a basic reality .
This can be understood as the distinction between the “ image ” ( the artificial placeholder ) and the real beginning to break down .
At this point the image ’s ability to imitate the real threatens to replace the original referent altogether .
Baudrillard often associates this period with the industrial revolution and the proliferation of mass production / copies .
In terms of the monetary system , we can compare this with the rise of a modern financial system .
Abstract numbers instead of goods become how wealth is accounted for , a credit system is put into place and the referent has begun to be replaced .
For example , the ability to check bank statements online reduces the reality of physical legal tender to mere binary code of the data base .
The power of the real becomes subsumed .
This becomes a problem of power and legitimation when those who can bypass the language of the medium can easily manipulate the real .
With the recent news suggesting the U.S. is not ready for cyber attacks , we see not only Baudrillard ’s theory of the Simulacra having real world consequences , but also Lyotard ’s worries of open source power struggles .
The third stage in the precession of the Simulacra occurs when the simulation masks the absence of a basic reality .
That is to say the real no longer exists – only a simulation that attempts to uphold the real .
This phase is associated with postmodernity and is found precisely in the financial markets leading up to the crisis .
It is a system where people trade abstract numbers whether or not they actually exist in reality .
Tokens without goats in the earlier example , credit without money in the housing and credit crisis .
The loan practices in place by the financial institutions clearly had no real referent when the bubble burst .
Banks had given out billions more than they actually had because the power of the copy ( money in its image form ) did n’t need a real referent to actual financial reality .
The global financial crisis now finds itself on the precipice of the fourth stage of the simulacra , as described by Baudrillard , where the market bears no relation to any reality whatsoever .
It is its own pure simulacra .
The danger at this phase is monumental for Late - Capitalism .
Once society begins to understand the market as ultimately unreal , all institutions making up the world economy are put at risk of relevance and power .
Timothy Geithner and Ben Bernanke are desperately trying to go back to Baudrillard ’s third state of simulacra .
The American public meanwhile is seriously beginning to question the work being done on Wall Street .
It would appear that the stock market trades in a simulation that has totally preceded reality , a hyperreal that has displaced the real .
The apotheosis of the Post - Modern age is at last here .
Baudrillard sees this sort of anti-scandal as endemic in postmodernism .
Disneyland is a hyperreal imaginary , not unlike credit .
While Disneyland works as a perfect model of America , it is also becomes the real not unlike the images of God or credit system .
Baudrillard argues Disneyland is more real than Los Angeles just as the prison system is more real that the outside world because it is society that is carceral in its banality .
This is the postmodern landscape , constantly at a third phase in its procession of Simulcra , where as far as the established order is concerned , all is real that is in simulation .
This is the model predicated on Baudrillard ’s famous saying that art has totally penetrated reality .
In the background , peeking through the whole time like an omniscient observer , have been notions of power .
Baudrillard quotes Lyotard when he says that only capital takes pleasure , before coming to think that we take pleasure in capital .
Capital is a tool , a sorcery relation ; it is a challenge to society and should be responded to as such .
Capitalism is in the process of proving itself through a crisis of capital , proving itself as unreal , through hyperreality .
However , this will forever change the way we understand Capitalism critically .
Only through a reinjection of the real will a Grand Narrative become wholly rational and re-establish itself as an unchallenged dominant ideology .
The question that remains to be seen is how exactly it plans to go about this process .
Is it even possible ?
Has it ever been possible ?
The government and private sectors are going about an attempt to re-establish power and economic equilibrium not through a reinsertion of material reality and dialectical reasoning , but through more abstraction and simulation .
This can be thought of as a thoroughly postmodern solution to a modernist narrative .
It is in this fact we see the cure to the last modern crisis revealing itself and solving itself through postmodern practices .
This is clearly evident in the financial bailout , auto bailout and stimulus packages .
In fact , almost no debates have been considered regarding a complete overhaul of the financial and credit markets .
The idea to dissolve and start anew seems absurd .
The iconoclastors fight a notion that there is a possibility to live with mass Capital .
We are too entrenched historically and ideologically to go back now .
And furthermore , where would we go ?
Conclusion
It appears that capital continues to be the ends , while simulation and delusion will continue to be the means .
The financial crisis marks itself ultimately as the first postmodern crisis because we have moved into a pluralist , anti-telological landscape as the last remaining grand narrative , that of America and Late - Capitalism , threatens to reveal itself as a mere shadow of itself .
It appears at this point the institutions believe a shadow to be sufficient .
But what then of Lyotard ’s potential for hope and epistemological emancipation ?
What of Obama ?
Perhaps someone will come along and try to save the modern in a different way .
Perhaps through romanticism and idealism we can begin to see something new and reinvigorate the dialectic through a move back towards modernism .
However , maybe technology has allowed reality to be penetrated irreparably and the future will forever be seen as a coalescence of simulation and delusion .
