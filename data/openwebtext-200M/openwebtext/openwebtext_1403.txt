“ Donnie and Fran are a street version of Cinderella and Prince Charming , but when they fell in love they did n’t have any magical dust in their eyes , ” said the Rev. Frank M. Reid III , pastor of the Bethel A.M.E.
Church here , who will perform the ceremony .
“ They also show us something about salvation , since now they ’re using their skills from the corner to pull other people through . ”
When Mr. Andrews and Ms. Boyd met more than 10 years ago , each was a prisoner — although only one was behind bars — and each began helping the other get free .
Ms. Boyd , 50 , has been clean for more than 10 years , in large measure , she says , because Mr. Andrews , 53 , saw her through the worst times , using all he earned in the prison factory to make daily calls to her .
When another man was living with her , when she was too high to make sense , when she screamed at him to stop calling , he called anyway , all the while gently nudging her to get her life back .
“ Yeah , she put on a routine , being all tough , ” said Mr. Andrews , his 6 - foot - 1 , 230 - pound frame enveloping the 5 - foot - 4 Ms. Boyd in a bear hug .
“ But who was home every single day waiting by that phone at 4 p.m. ? ”
The first time they saw photos of each other was two years into their relationship .
“ By that time , it was too late for us , ” said Ms. Boyd , who was introduced to Mr. Andrews over the phone by the police officer who arrested him .
Ms. Boyd spends her days now walking her old haunts , persuading addicts to go into rehab and working with a local hospital ’s H.I.V. prevention program , when she is not home raising the three nephews and nieces she rescued from their troubled home .
The Titanic director 's monstrously - hyped creation does look fantastic but , in trying to cover all the bases with militarist sci-fi , vacuous eco-waffle and an intra-species love story , it 's too baggy
Any lingering suspicions that James Cameron has become the Al Gore of Hollywood will be firmly extinguished by his new , monstrously - hyped creation .
For a while , it looked like he was giving us a reasonably sweet - natured blockbuster , suggesting that the natural world has , like , the power to heal us all , or something .
Then Cameron sends in the helicopter gunships and starts blowing shit up , big time .
Way to undermine your own message .
Avatar , for anyone who's had their head in the sand for the last few months , is the first film in over a decade from the man behind Titanic , still the all - time box - office champ .
The success of that film presumably allowed Cameron to write his own cheques for this one , and it's a project that 's been stewing on the back burner for at least as long , waiting for the special - effects industry to catch up .
And whatever the truth behind the rumoured hundreds of millions spent on it , Cameron certainly gives Hollywood a lot of bang for its buck .
Avatar , in all conscience , looks fantastic – a near - seamless melding of fantasy extraterrestrial landscapes and cutting edge computer - generated imagery , all inserted beautifully into the high - testosterone camerawork which Cameron has made his specialty .
But what is this highest - of - high - end image - making aimed at ?
Cameron has constructed a fable that combines militarist sci-fi , alarmingly vacuous eco-waffle and an intra-species love story that is presumably designed to cover all the bases .
The central character is one Jake Sully ( Sam Worthington ) , a paraplegic marine who is assigned to a mining colony on the alien world of Pandora , where he joins a band of nerdy scientists trying to establish friendly relations with the locals ; this they hope to achieve by fusing their brains with specially developed beings ( the " avatars " of the title ) that are a blend of human and alien DNA .
The locals turn out to be spindly blue 10 - foot humanoids with distractingly twitchy ears – suggestions that Avatar is somehow channelling Ferngully are not all that wide of the mark .
Sully quickly falls for the non-specific mystical rabbitings of the tribe , involving memory - harbouring trees , intimate relationships with flying lizards , and other such prog-rock - influenced stylings .
It really is like a Yes album cover come to life .
Sully 's position is made considerably more tricky by the genocidal glee of his human military commander , who – in a plot move shamelessly similar to Cameron 's earlier film , Aliens – is prepared to cause mass casualties in the service of the sleazy mining - corporation executive .
There are heavy - handed attempts to implant contemporary references ( at one point , the marines are told to fight " terror with terror " ) , but there 's no mistaking what Avatar is taking aim at : the founding myth of America , and the incursions of European colonists into indigenous civilisations .
The Na'vi , the tribe with whom Sully fetches up , are a sort of grab - bag of generic tribal characteristics – a little bit African , a little bit Amerindian , the equivalent of one of those worldbeat restaurants that serve up teriyaki tortilla and the like .
To his credit , Cameron is a skilful narrative organiser , and fairly soon he has you rooting for the aliens , not those pesky human invaders .
( This may not be the most tasteful approach though , to use on an American audience that still does n't appear to feel especially guilty about what happened to the indigenous people on their own continent . )
Be that as it may , Avatar tries to have it both ways , to be preachy and a thrill - ride at the same time .
I can't in all honesty say it pulls it off – it's baggy , longwinded and , for all the light - speed imagery , just not quick on its feet .
Cameron used to be the tautest film - maker around , but he just got slack .
• Avatar is released on 17 December
A measure that would develop curricular standards for using the Bible in elective courses in public schools won a House panel ’s approval Wednesday .
House Bill 2321 would authorize the state Board of Education to adopt guidelines for the nonsectarian , nonreligious academic study of the Bible and its influence on literature , art , music , culture and politics .
Several members of the House Common Education Committee raised questions about the bill , but the measure eventually passed 12 - 0 .
It now goes to the full House .
Lealon Taylor , chief of staff for state schools Superintendent Sandy Garrett , told the committee the measure requires personnel assigned to teach the course to meet teacher certification requirements .
Bibles now can be used in public schools , he said .
HB 2321 sets up curriculum requirements .
Rep . Todd Russ , the measure ’s author , said , " This lays down some ground fire to back these school teachers who would like to refer to the Bible . ”
The bill requires that a Bible course would be taught in an objective and nondevotional manner with no attempt made to indoctrinate students as to either the truth or falsity of biblical materials or texts .
The course would not include the teaching of religious doctrine or sectarian interpretation of the Bible .
" It ’s not intended to be a study of the Bible , ” said Russ , R - Cordell .
" It ’s intended to be an additional tool for presenting our heritage and the history of America and the value system of America and where it came from . ”
The courses could be offered to students from kindergarten through high school , he said .
Russ said local school districts would decide whether to offer the coursework .
" This is not mandated by anybody , ” he said .
" It ’s literally a local decision . ”
Rep. Joe Dorman , D - Rush Springs , said there are 48 versions of the Bible and asked Russ which would be used .
Russ said each local school district would decide what classroom materials to use .
Rep . Ed Cannaday , D - Porum , asked whether state funds would be used to pay for Bibles or biblical materials .
Russ said he did n’t foresee state money being used .
Rancho La Vista Estates in the Ojai Valley came by its name honestly .
From many of the homes , the view of the Topa Topa Mountains , which climb sharply out of the basin and pierce the clouds , is stunning .
Or at least it used to be .
Dave Olson , a professor at Cal State Bakersfield , can no longer see the mountains from the yard he designed specifically to take advantage of the panorama .
For a few years now , he and his neighbors have been fighting a losing battle against the guy who bought the 400 - acre Milner ranch and planted tall , fast - growing trees on the perimeter .
That would be TV and film producer Jerry Bruckheimer , he of “ Pirates of the Caribbean , ” “ Beverly Hills Cop ” and “ CSI : Crime Scene Investigation . ”
What Bruckheimer has done in the Ojai Valley ought to be investigated , these neighbors say .
“ It has been a real theft , ” said Karen McAuley , who for 16 years enjoyed her view of the mountains from her home on Tiara Drive .
She also enjoyed the steady procession of neighbors who walked by each day to enjoy the natural wonder .
Now , that view is completely obliterated by the pepper and acacia trees at the end of Tiara , on the edge of the Bruckheimer property .
It further irks the neighbors that Bruckheimer ’s home is several hundred yards away from the trees , making them skeptical that anyone could invade his privacy from such a distance .
Also , the Bruckheimers are rarely at the multimillion - dollar ranch , according to neighbors .
Yet the property values of the neighborhood homes -- which sell in the $ 500,000 range -- are decreased , real estate agent Sharon MaHarry assured me , because of the loss of their best feature .
“ It ’s such a thing in our culture to have wealthy and powerful people take what really is the people ’s right to enjoy the environment , ” said McAuley .
Jackie Kuehn , another outraged neighbor , seconded that motion .
“ Jerry Bruckheimer does not own the pink moment , ” said Kuehn , referring to the legendary sunsets in a place where views are at least as valued as the sense of community .
Bruckheimer , speaking through publicist Paul Bloch , expressed surprise at his neighbors ’ wrath .
Bloch said the Bruckheimers had received notes of appreciation from neighbors who were glad they moved in with the intention of preserving the spectacular spread , with its huge meadow , rolling hills and pond .
Bloch said Jerry and Linda Bruckheimer had their business manager send letters to neighbors in early 2007 explaining that they were enhancing security after some vandalism on their property .
This was after neighbors became alarmed when tall poles were erected on the edge of the property .
“ It appears our ‘ story poles ’ have generated questions as to our intentions , ” said a letter from Bruckheimer business manager Rob Philpott .
“ We are considering the placement of additional trees and orchards on the land next to your subdivision .
The poles were placed to help visualize the size of a tree . ”
The letter went on to say :
“ It ’s our client ’s desire to be a good steward for the land and a thoughtful neighbor . ”
How thoughtful could he be , some neighbors wondered , if he was planting trees that would be 20 feet high or even taller and blot out the view from many homes ?
Some sent letters asking for consideration , but the trees and shrubs were planted anyway , just inches from property lines in some cases , and they grew fast .
Kuehn , McAuley and others have been fighting and losing this battle since early 2007 .
They said they think of themselves as David going up against Goliath .
But Olson , the Cal State teacher , sees Bruckheimer differently .
“ He ’s David , looking up , and he sees Bathsheba and he says , ‘ You know , I have everything I want .
But I could use a little more . ’ ”
Nobody was more distraught than Josephine Dolezel , who ’s in her 80s and lives with her husband , Joe , who ’s in his 90s .
They subsist largely on the organic produce Josephine grows in her yard , but Bruckheimer ’s trees and shrubs stole the sunlight and greatly reduced her harvest of zucchini , tomatoes , watermelons and grapes , they say .
Last week , some of the trees and shrubs were trimmed next to Dolezel ’s property , but part of the garden is still in shade .
There was some trimming on Tiara Drive too , but not enough to restore the view .
And residents fear that as more trees grow taller , they ’ll lose the views from even more streets , as well as from the community pool and tennis courts .
Their complaint to the county was rejected because tree heights are not regulated when the trees are used as fences , but they ’ve now raised $ 2,000 to appeal the verdict .
And I do n’t get the sense that they ’ll give up this fight any time soon .
I mean no disrespect when I say they ’re as tenacious as the stars of one of Bruckheimer ’s recent movies , “ G Force . ”

PEOPLE born overseas are less likely to be assaulted than those born in Australia , according to new Australian Bureau of Statistics data .
The national survey found that those born in Australia were more than twice as likely to be the victim of a physical assault .
It showed an assault rate of 3.6 per cent for Australian - born people , or 445,000 victims , compared with an assault rate of 1.7 per cent , or 82,000 , for those born in other countries .
The new data comes as international debate rages over the extent of racism involved in the spate of attacks on Indian students .
The assault rate for people born in non-English speaking countries was 1.4 per cent .
With Europe finally regaining its rightful place as the epicenter of the peripheral economic crisis , it is time we shift focus , albeit briefly , from America and its increasing cadre of troubles , to those of the Euro area .
Below we present some of the key charts and observations that will frame the imminent [ bail out | default ] of a whole host of minor EMU and EU countries .
The first , and most relevant data series , is unemployment .
And while in the US everyone is well aware of the various seasonal adjustment gimmicks , DOL definition loopholes , and ridiculous birth - death model models which make the final number completely irrelevant , it is useful to note that both the EU and the US are sharing roughly the same " broad definition " ( U - 3 ) unemployment rate as a percentage of the labor force .
Notable is that while the U.S. equivalent of this metric has allegedly started to improve ( even as NSA data indicates the reading is at record recent highs ) , the European unemployment rate has yet to plateau .
Next , counting to use data from the ECB 's Statistical Data Warehouse , we present the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices , or , in brief , Euro Area Inflation rate .
After hitting a low of - 0.3 % in August of 2009 , the most recent reading indicated a +1 % rate of inflation .
This number is suspect for several reasons as will be shortly discussed .
One reason why one should take the inflation number with a grain of salt is that Unit Labor Costs , after peaking at 4.77 in Q4 2008 , have taken a sharp downturn , in essence offsetting any direct gains in the HICP .
Furthermore , as BarCap demonstrates , the rate of decline in Negotiated Wages ( both on an absolute and relative basis ) in the Euro area is showing no moderation .
This is a decidedly deflationary economic reading : absent a firm turnaround in wages , many will say , the case for inflation is baseless and at best will translate into highly volatile and speculation driven commodity prices ( both in Europe and globally ) .
One redeeming feature for a contrarian inflation outlook is the inflection point that appears to have been hit in broad output metrics .
With the manufacturing output index starting to trend down after a recent high , the slack in the economy may see some tightening , eventually leading to a rise in final prices .
Combining this data indicates that projected inflation , as represented by HIPC and by the BarCap underlying index , confirms that there will be deflationary pressures on European prices for the next couple of years .
Another consideration when evaluating economic slack is the recent dramatic inversion in current account balances as many of the hardest hit nations ( the PIIGS come to mind ) will promptly revert from a spending to a saving regime , thus eliminating much of the internal export - led growth by core countries ( Germany ) .
This may well be one of the more critical consequences of the austerity measures that will be shortly adopted by various EMU countries with a high Deficit / GDP ratio .
As BarCap notes :
It seems likely that under pressure from the markets , there will be an abrupt narrowing in these deficits – in other words , national saving will need to rise sharply as governments tighten fiscal policy .
In turn , this would result in a shortage of domestic demand in the euro area .
For example , last year we estimate that the current account deficit of ‘ southern Europe ’ ( on our definition ) was around € 190bn , ie , 2.1 % of euro area GDP ( for Q4 09 , we estimate that it was still around € 50bn , ie , still around 2 % of GDP ) .
To meet this domestic demand gap , Europe will look to Germany .
Yet the German household saving ratio has also risen in recent years .
On a gross basis ( ie , including capital consumption ) we calculate that it has risen from a low of 14.7 % of personal disposable income in H2 00 to around 17.5 % in Q3 09 .
Admittedly , this is not as strong as the rise of Spain ’s , which grew from 9.7 % of GDP ( on the same basis ) to around 19 % ( SA ) in Q3 09 , but still significant .
In Germany ’s case , this is likely to reflect concern about demographics and pension reform .
To compensate for the likely shortfall in domestic demand in southern Europe , it will be important for the German household saving ratio to decline .
Yet that will be a formidable task .
As well , given the lags in the monetary transmission process , the ECB must seek to anticipate developments in 2011 , which is likely to be a year of concerted fiscal tightening ( whereas Germany is undergoing tax cuts worth at least 1 % of GDP this year , next year it also will tighten , along with the rest of Europe and possibly the US ) .
Speaking of not just a lagging but outright broken " monetary transmission process " , we highlight what could be the scariest chart in this presentation : Europe 's Monetary Aggregated M3 , which is in freefall .
Inflation may be whatever the ECB wants us to believe it is .
However , as in the US , unless the money entering into the economy is circulating properly and receiving the benefit of the money multiplier , it is essentially useless from an inflationary standpoint .
And while many lament the passage of banking lending to the private sector in the US , the M3 data indicates that the situation in Europe is in no way different , and will likely get worse before it gets better , especially should a liquidity crisis ( not if but when ) engulf one of the EMU nations .
The contraction in M3 and bank lending is sufficiently important that the ECB 's recent release had a several paragraph discussion on its implications :
Turning to the monetary analysis , the annual growth rate of M3 remained negative in December 2009 , standing at - 0.2 % .
In the same period , annual growth in loans to the private sector was zero .
These data continue to support our assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term .
Actual monetary developments are likely to be weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion , owing to the downward impact of the rather steep yield curve [ Prior sentence :
The decline in actual monetary growth is likely to overstate the deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion ] .
Looking ahead , M3 and credit growth is likely to remain [ very omitted in most recent release ] weak for some time to come .
The prevailing interest rate constellation continues to have a strong influence on both the level and composition of annual M3 growth .
On the one hand , the low rates of remuneration on short - term bank deposits foster the allocation of funds away from M3 and into longerterm deposits and securities .
On the other hand , the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different short - term deposits imply a low opportunity cost of holding funds in the most liquid components included in M1 , which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of more than 12 % in December .
The zero annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector reflects a further increase in the growth in loans to households , while the annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations moved further into negative territory .
Such divergence remains in line with business cycle regularities .
The ongoing contraction in the outstanding amounts of loans to non-financial corporations continues to be accounted for entirely by a strong net redemption of loans with a short maturity .
For the sector as a whole , the overall contraction may be due partly to substitution with market - based financing [ Previously , the continued negative flows in short - term bank loans to non-financial corporations observed in recent months may partly reflect better possibilities for substitution with different sources of longer - term financing . ]
Yet , just like in the US , the number one concern for Europe is the future source of funding in light of increasingly elevated leverage ratios .
The most recent reading of government deficit as a % of GDP indicated a near - record reading of over - 6 % .
This is an average representation , with some countries such as Greece , Portugal and Spain representing material double digit outliers , as has been extensively demonstrated previously .
Lastly , the Euro area 's Debt as a % of GDP is skyrocketing , indicating that just like the US , Japan , and virtually most countries , any future budget expenditures will need to be financed with external borrowings .
Yet if every country is dependant on China as the only source of endogenously created capital ( instead of economies like the US ' where new money is either originated by printing or by new shadow economy financial " innovation " ) , now that China is turning off the liquidity spigot , this spells doom for all nations that rely on the benevolence of external creditors to continue funding endless deficits .
It is on this fragile backdrop that the deterioration of the PIIGS is taking place .
What is certain is that the increasing funding crisis , which may promptly turn into a liquidity crisis should spread persist in their widening , will soon find a path of least resistance to impair countries previously considered immune from a domino effect such as Germany , BeNeLux and Scandinavia .
This is why in our belief the ECB , Germany and all heretofore more fiscally prudent countries are damned if they do and damned if they do n't bail out Greece : as one outcome will lead to an escalation in the fiscal crisis , while the other will impair monetary policy for years to come .
Europe is faced with a lose - lose proposition .
The only real question is whether Europe 's ( and the Euro's ) loss will be US ' ( and the dollar 's ) gain or whether investors will soon see America for a comparable hollow economic box , and will shun exposure to the " reserve " currency , instead finally focusing on the commodity economies in Asia , as Nouriel Roubini expects to happen .
The next several weeks will surely provide many answers .
The Senate Armed Services Committee is holding a hearing today on Paravant , a previously little - known subsidiary of Xe Services ( aka Blackwater ) .
It caps a six - month investigation by the committee , and it promises to be a doozy .
Sen . Carl Levin of Michigan , the Democratic chair of the committee , met with reporters yesterday to give a sneak preview .
According to a statement released last night by Levin , the investigation revealed " failures in U.S. government oversight " that allowed employees of Blackwater – sorry , Paravant ( Levin said he saw " no meaningful distinction between the two " ) – to go buck wild in Afghanistan .
Paravant employees were supposed to be helping train Afghan security forces .
But according to the committee investigation , Paravant employees were also indulging in extracurricular activities like joyriding with automatic weapons , and treating an Afghan National Police arsenal like their own personal weapons stash .
The company first garnered headlines after two former Paravant contractors were arrested on murder charges in the shootings of two Afghans in a May 2009 traffic accident in Kabul .
They were charged under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act .
According to the Senate investigation , Paravant employees were involved in a second , previously undisclosed shooting that happened in December 2008 .
Paravant program manager Johnnie Walker told committee staff the incident happened after an employee decided to get on the back of a moving car with a loaded AK - 47 and " ride it like a stagecoach . "
The employee accidentally discharged the rifle when the vehicle hit a bump .
The round struck another Paravant team member , who was seriously injured .
" The reckless disregard for weapons safety is particularly striking given that he and his team were hired for the specific purpose of teaching the Afghan National Army how to safely use their weapons , " Levin 's statement dryly notes .
Another issue the committee probed was Bunker 22 , an armory near the notorious Pol - e - Charki prison that held weapons meant for the Afghan National Police .
According to the committee investigation , more than 200 AK - 47s were taken out of Bunker 22 in September 2008 and signed for by a Paravant / Blackwater employee named " Eric Cartman . "
Some of the weapons apparently withdrawn by our favorite South Park character were unaccounted for for months afterward , according to the committee .
Blackwater 's reputation is already in tatters , thanks to a string of deadly incidents .
And the conduct of some private security contractors in Afghanistan has n't done much for the industry either .
But getting a handle on this is crucial .
As Levin noted , the campaign in Afghanistan is primarily a struggle to win the support of the population .
" If we are going to win that struggle , " he said , " We needed to know that our contractor personnel are adequately screened , supervised and held accountable . "

I ’m going to go under the assumption that the first two names off the board on draft day are Albert Pujols and Hanley Ramirez .
Yes , it ’s possible that someone jumps over one of the two ( most likely Ramirez ) , but in my mind those are the top two hitters in the game and deserve to be taken 1 - 2 in every single draft .
The question , then , is who comes next ?
There does n’t appear to be a consensus third player off the board , rather three players with the potential to go in that slot : Alex Rodriguez , Chase Utley and Ryan Braun .
Let ’s take a look at each of them in more detail to help determine whom we should be targeting :
Ryan Braun – Milwaukee Brewers
Entering his fourth season , there is little question surrounding his ability at the plate .
Since debuting in 2007 , Braun has three straight seasons of over 30 HR .
He ’s increased his runs each year , reaching the 113 plateau in 2009 .
He ’s also increased his RBI year - by - year , reaching 114 last season .
He has speed ( 20 SB ) and can hit for average ( he ’s hit .320 or better twice ) .
So , what ’s not to like ?
He spent the majority of his time hitting third last season , meaning he has Prince Fielder and his immense power hitting behind him .
That means the runs scored should continue .
The RBI opportunity should be there as well , especially if Alcides Escober takes over at the top of the lineup , giving them the dynamic leadoff hitter they ’ve been looking for ( or , should I say , waiting for Rickie Weeks to develop into ) .
The average is certainly not set in stone , as his .320 success came courtesy of a BABIP of .355 .
While he does n’t strikeout a significant amount ( last season it was 19.1 % ) , his average is likely to come down a bit .
Still , .300 is quite possible .
He is an outfielder , which needs to be weighed in here .
While it is a position that is not quite as deep as it once was , it still is easier to find a potential replacement in the second , third or fourth rounds .
It ’s the one glaring negative on an otherwise impressive resume .
Alex Rodriguez – New York Yankees
Long considered one of the top hitters in baseball , A - Rod did little to convince fans otherwise in 2009 .
With injury costing him the first month of the season ( he debuted on May 8 ) , he still managed to hit 30 HR and drive in 100 RBI , the twelfth straight season he ’s done so .
He was great wherever he played , but 18 of his HR did come in the new Yankees Stadium in just 227 AB ( 64 games ) .
Imagine what kind of numbers he ’ll be able to post there if healthy and able to man 3B for all 81 games ?
He ’s in a deep Yankees lineup , joined by names like Derek Jeter , Curtis Granderson and Mark Teixeira , just to name a few .
Does it appear unlikely to anyone that he does not reach 100 RBI and 100 R ?
In fact , last season was the first time he had n’t scored 100 runs since he became a regular in 1996 , and that ’s easily attributed to his time missed .
He still scored 78 and if healthy , he likely would have reached the plateau again , or at least come incredibly close .
He ’s a career .305 hitter and also should pick up at least 15 - 20 stole bases .
He has the potential to be a 40 + HR hitter .
He also is a 3B , a position that was once incredibly deep , but is no longer the case .
There ’s potential for other players at the position , but no one ( and few in the game , period ) , offer the same type of upside potential to match his type of production .
Chase Utley – Philadelphia Phillies
There was fear that he was going to miss the beginning of the 2009 season , forcing him to drop down draft boards .
Instead , he was ready for Opening Day and posted a monster campaign .
At second base , he does things for fantasy owners that no one else in the league does .
He ’s a near lock to hit over 30 HR , score 100 runs ( thanks to Ryan Howard and company hitting behind him ) and drive in 100 RBI .
Of course , he fell short there in 2009 but if Jimmy Rollins can rediscover his stroke and with Placido Polanco now hitting second , a rebound should be a given .
He also adds speed , much like the other two options for the third overall pick .
They should all be about equal here , picking up 15 - 20 or so stolen bases .
His potential downfall is his average , hitting .282 last season and failing to reach .300 each of the past two years .
Before we point to his .332 average in 2007 , it came courtesy of a BABIP of .368 , so it ’s tough to imagine him repeating it .
While there was a time that we would say that position scarcity made him more worth selecting , second base is not the shallow spot that it once was .
The emergence of players like Aaron Hill and Ben Zobrist have certainly helped to deepen the position , allowing you to get a good option a few rounds later if you opt to bypass Utley .
Conclusion :
The first player I ’d eliminate from the discussion is Utley , though it ’s not because of his talent .
He easily could post similar statistics to Braun and Rodriguez , but the question in the average is enough of a knock against him .
Throw in the fact that the position may be deeper now than it ever has been and it ’s easy to look past him in Round One to another option .
Between the other two options , as much as I want to take Braun , Rodriguez would get my pick .
The two are extremely close , but Rodriguez does play the shallower position and also is in a home park that is conducive to some lofty offensive numbers .
Can you imagine the type of production he could post over a full season in that ballpark ?
I , for one , do n’t want to risk losing that on my team .
What are your thoughts ?
Which of these players would you select third overall ?
Is there someone I left out of the discussion that deserves to be here ?

The magnitude 7 earthquake that leveled much of Haiti 's capital Tuesday – the strongest temblor to hit the country in some 200 years -- may have increased strain on a segment of the same fault that lies across the border in the Dominican Republic .
That concern , based on calculations made during the first 24 hours after the quake hit , may ease with additional on - the - ground data , cautions Purdue University geophysicist Eric Calais , who has spent years studying faults on Hispaniola , the island both countries share .
But since the mid-1980s and the advent of precision satellite measurements of ground movement , plus other high - tech advances , earth scientists have developed an increasing respect for the ability of the slip of one fault to increase the strain on other , nearby faults , or on a different segment of the original fault .
In any effort to track changes in strain , " I would focus on the eastern termination of the fault towards the Dominican Republic , pending more information , " he says .
The reason :
The rupture slid to the east .
While strain would build at both ends of the ruptured segment , another rupture farther to the west would occur in a sparsely populated , hard to reach portion of Haiti .
To the east , however , the fault traces a path through the mountains separating Haiti from the Dominican Republic and into the more - heavily populated southwestern portion of Haiti 's neighbor .
Already , teams of researchers are planning to visit the stricken area to take the full measure of the quake before erosion or rebuilding efforts erase key pieces of evidence .
" A lot of the data we need to collect are pretty ephemeral , " says Carol Prentice , a US Geological Survey researcher who is part of a relatively small group of scientists who have studied the area .
Accurate measurements of ground movement -- seen in offset stream beds or displaced roads , for instance -- help establish the amount of strain released .
Careful monitoring of the strongest aftershocks , which can die off fairly quickly after a quake , help establish how deep in the crust the quake 's break - point was .
Tracking the quake 's aftermath over the long term will help researchers better understand the slow rebound that occurs along the fault after the initial snap .
Why Haiti's fault got less attention
The tragic event has struck a broad patch of the globe -- the Caribbean -- well known for earthquakes and volcanic activity .
But while islands such as Puerto Rico , Jamaica , and the Antilles chains are fairly well studied , Haiti has n't received the same attention , since working in a country that is no stranger to poverty and hardship can be downright unsafe .
Still , scientists have pulled together an increasingly clear picture of the broad geophysical context in which Monday 's event took place .
Hispaniola sits squarely atop a boundary between two plates in Earth 's crust : the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate .
The Caribbean Plate is trying to slide past a particularly tough block of crust underlying the Bahamas .
The two are grinding past each other , much like the motion along another plate boundary -- California 's San Andreas Fault .
Tuesday 's quake occurred along the Enriquilla - Plantain Garden Fault , an east - west crack in the Earth that also runs west through Jamaica and out to the Cayman Islands .
But Hispaniola also is home to another major fault , which cuts across its northern interior and heads toward Cuba .
These two fault systems trace their origins to a broader interaction between the North American plate and the Caribbean Plate .
The North American plate is plunging under the Caribbean plate north of Hispanola and Puerto Rico .
But one portion of the North America plate dubbed the Bahamas Platform is too bouyant to make the plunge easily , reseachers say .
The result :
The giant collision is deforming Hispanola .
Over millions of years , Hispaniola 's northern fault , the Septentrional , has been the major pathway for building and releasing strain from the sideways motion of the two plates .
But some researchers now argue that activity may be shifting ; the Enriquilla - Plantain Garden Fault may slowly be taking over as the main strain - relief valve for the plate boundary , explains Uri ten Brink , a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey 's office in Woods Hole , Mass .
In effect , the region has two parallel plate boundaries .
" That 's quite unusual , " he says .
Indeed , given the number of people who live on the island , as well as the number who visit , " this was really a wake - up call to me to try and understand this system . "
VANESS REID , a 16 - year - old student from Sydney , Australia , runs cross-country , plays touch football , enjoys in - line skating , swims and goes bodyboarding .
She also has a cerebral side : she plays competitive chess .
She represented Australia at a tournament in Malaysia in 2002 and played in a tournament in New Zealand this year .
While Ms. Reid is clearly no novice at the game , she is n't exactly taking it by storm .
She is not on the World Chess Federation 's list of the world 's 50 top female players .
In fact she is ranked 47,694th among both men and women .
But Ms. Reid , who has auburn hair , light - blue eyes and a winning smile , is arguably the top player in the world based on a more subjective criterion : her looks .
A Web site called World Chess Beauty Contest ( www.1wcbc.com) ranks her as the world 's most beautiful woman in the game .
The site was started earlier this year by Vladislav Tkachiev , 32 , a Kazakh grandmaster who is ranked 83rd in the world , and his brother , Eugeny , 39 .
The younger Mr. Tkachiev , who appears in photos to be well - built and boyish looking , said they had started the site to raise the profile of the game .
" Chess desperately needs some glamour , " Mr. Tkachiev said .
The brothers are not the only ones trying to inject some glamour , or at least sex appeal , into the game .
Alexandra Kosteniuk , 21 , a dark - haired , porcelain - skinned Russian grandmaster who is ranked fifth in the world among women and 525th over all , models and uses her Web site to sell photos of herself posing in bikinis next to giant chess pieces .
Maria Manakova , 31 , who is the fourth - ranked woman in Russia and who is ranked eighth on the Beauty Contest site , attracted attention last year when she posed nude for Speed , a Russian magazine .
She followed it up by posing for Maxim and the Russian edition of Playboy .
The FBI and telecom companies collaborated to routinely violate federal wiretapping laws for four years , as agents got access to reporters ' and citizens ' phone records using fake emergency declarations or simply asking for them .
The Justice Department Inspector General 's internal audit , released Wednesday , harshly criticized how the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's Communications Analysis Unit – a counterterrorism section founded after 9/11 – relied on so - called " exigent " letters to get carriers to turn over phone records immediately .
The letters were a hangover from the investigation into the 9/11 attacks in New York and promised telecoms , falsely , that subpoenas would follow shortly .
" The FBI 's use of exigent letters and other informal requests for telephone toll billing records circumvented , and in many cases violated , the requirements of the Electronic Communications Protection Act statute , " according to the report , which was referencing a leading federal wiretap law .
" We found that a distinct lack of oversight and scrutiny by CAU managers , counterterrorism officials and FBI Office of General Counsel attorneys enabled the improper practice of obtaining ECPA - protected telephone records with the promise of future legal process to expand and proceed virtually unchecked for over 4 years , " the report found .
But in a surprise buried at the end of the 289 - page report , the inspector general also reveals that the Obama administration issued a secret rule almost two weeks ago saying it was legal for the FBI to have skirted federal privacy protections .
It all started after 9/11 as FBI agents hunting terrorists began relying heavily on call toll records – essentially a person 's phone bills – in a frantic effort to find terror plots before they were carried out .
The agency even gave AT&T , Verizon and MCI multimillion dollar contracts to keep phone records longer and to answer FBI requests faster .
The companies then set up remote terminals inside the FBI 's offices , staffing them with telecom employees who quickly became friendly with the agents requesting phone records .
The telecom employees had FBI e-mail addresses , access to shared drives and invitations to happy hours , according to the report .
The telecom employees were supposed to be responding to National Security Letters , which are essentially FBI - issued subpoenas .
But those Patriot
Act powers say the target must be part of an open investigation and that a supervisor has to approve it .
While they require some paperwork , FBI agents have been issuing about 40,000 such NSLs a year .
But an AT&T employee provided the unit with a way around some of those requirements .
The employee introduced them to " exigent letters . "
Those letters , first used immediately following 9/11 , asked for information by saying that the request was an emergency and that prosecutors were preparing a grand jury subpoena .
The letter falsely promised that the subpoena , which gives the telecoms legal immunity , would be delivered later , the report said .
What 's more , the report noted that the cozy relationship between the bureau and the telecoms made it hard to differentiate between the FBI and the nation 's phone companies .
" The FBI 's use of exigent letters became so casual , routine and unsupervised that employees of all three communication service providers told us that they – the company employees– sometimes generated the exigent letters for CAU personnel to sign and return , " the inspector general reported .
In fact , one AT&T employee even created a short cut on his desktop to a form letter that he could print out for a requesting FBI agent to sign .
Even that became too much .
Agents would request " sneak peeks , " where they 'd ask if it was worth their time to file a request on a given phone number , the inspector general noted .
The telecom agents complied .
Soon it graduated to numbers on Post - it notes , in e-mails or just oral requests .
There 's no telling how many of those there were , but the audit estimates more than 3,500 off - the - book requests from 2003 to 2007 .
AT&T also offered to look up calling information for those connected to the original target in what is known as a " community of interest , " according to the report .
That term refers to the social networks learned by looking at who is calling whom – a leap in degrees of separation from your initial target .
In its statement on the report , the FBI excused itself for its failure to follow the law .
" The OIG report finds no intentional attempts to obtain records that counterterrorism personnel knew they were not legally entitled to obtain , " said Michael P. Kortan , the FBI ’s assistant director for public affairs .
" No FBI employee obtained telephone records for reasons other than a legitimate investigative interest .
FBI employees involved in this matter obtained the telephone records at issue to perform their critical mission to prevent a terrorist attack or otherwise to support a counterterrorism investigation . "
( The report refers to the three telecoms involved as Company A , B , and C , but previous statements by FBI officials have helped sort out the details . )
An AT&T spokesman declined comment on the report .
Verizon , which has acquired MCI , did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
AT&T took a particular interest in using its " community of interest " technology to become analysts for the agents , the report said .
For instance , according to the report , an AT&T analyst looked at one informal FBI request and said the calling patterns on four numbers were " very interesting , " and " we strongly suggest " the bureau examines other , associated phone numbers .
The telecoms also violated wiretapping law by instituting more than 100 so - called " hot watches " that would alert FBI agents if a targeted number made or received a call , the report said .
What 's more , FBI agents also used the exigent letters in a leak investigation to get records on more than 1,500 calls by Washington Post and New York Times reporters .
Many FBI higher - ups denied knowledge of the loose and illegal practices the inspector general cited , the report said .
But was there any connection between these exigent letters and the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program ?
The report – and other memos – strongly suggest many of the FBI 's leads came from the NSA listening in on Americans ' overseas calls and e-mails .
Many times the exigent letter or verbal request for telephone records turned up areas worth opening a more detailed investigation .
In some cases , they showed the agent that a full - blown wiretap was necessary , the report said .
But permission for listening to a suspected terrorist 's phone calls has to come from the nations ' secret spy court , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .
But how do you get a search warrant when the evidence you have to support it came from an illegal request ?
How do you explain to a judge you got your probable cause illegally ?
You do n't .
You " make false statements " in your affidavit .
That 's what agents did in order to use the poisoned fruit of these secret searches , according to the report .
Years later – after the inspector general 's earlier reports on the exigent letters , the National Security Division investigated a few of the affidavits , found the " false statements " and told the FISA court about the lies .
But the Justice Department said in the report that false statements do n't matter – the wiretap orders from the FISA court remain usable even if evidence is acquired unlawfully , the report noted .
The FBI kicked the telecoms out of its offices in 2007 , saying the bureau and telecom employees had become too comfortable working together .
The Obama administration retroactively legalized the entire fiasco through a secret ruling from the Office of Legal Counsel nearly two weeks ago .
That 's the same office from which John Yoo blessed President George W. Bush 's torture techniques and warrantless wiretapping of Americans ' communications that crossed the border .
In the report 's final and heavily censored section , it discloses that the Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion that it was legal for the FBI to obtain Americans ' phone records in the same manner that was harshly criticized by the inspector general 's report .
The inspector general also warned that the Office of Legal Counsel 's ruling needs to be considered by Congress .

Prime Minister Gordon Brown has accused the Tories of trying to " scare " people into accepting a " bleak " future with talk of the record budget deficit .
Mr Brown stepped up attacks on the Conservatives ahead of a Labour election event at the weekend .
He has been boosted by letters signed by 60 economists , who say they support delaying spending cuts until 2011 .
But shadow chancellor George Osborne said leading economists and business organisations supported the Tories .
The parties ' rival plans to tackle the deficit - set to rise to £ 178bn this year - is set to be a key issue at the election , widely expected to be held on 6 May .
In a speech to centre - left European leaders in London the prime minister attacked the response of the " well - financed right wing " to the financial crisis .
' Bleak and austere '
He said the letters from the economists showed the " first priority must be robust growth " and criticised opponents of government action .
" I say to the British people this is not the time to put the recovery at risk ; this is the time to make sure that growth and jobs are secured , " he said .
They seek to frighten us with the present level of the deficit
Gordon Brown
Experts back spending cuts delay
He said opponents of centre - left policies were spreading the " myth " that the government caused the financial crisis and government spending was prolonging it .
And he accused them of " trying to use legitimate concerns about deficits to scare people into accepting a bleak and austere picture of the future for the majority " .
Mr Brown added : " They seek to frighten us with the present level of the deficit but mention neither the automatic reduction that would be achieved as and when growth is resumed , nor the effects of growth on investor confidence for the good of the British people . "
On Saturday , the Labour Party will launch its election slogan and themes , which will include a promise to secure the economic recovery .
Mortgage rates
The economists ' letters have given Mr Brown a boost , but on Sunday , 20 other economists backed the Conservatives ' call for cuts this year in a letter to the Sunday Times .
On Tuesday , Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson also called for spending cuts to begin this year - saying the UK budget deficit was a " serious risk " to economic recovery .
It 's the lack of a plan of action from Gordon Brown that is undermining confidence in the British economy
George Osborne
Shadow chancellor
The Tories say many business groups agree with them that the government lacks a credible plan to deal with the deficit , risking higher mortgage rates .
Mr Osborne said : " There are leading economists who support the Conservative position , but more importantly , there are also leading business organisations , top entrepreneurs - people like Richard Branson - who know more about creating jobs than the entire Labour cabinet put together .
" And people at home know that when you 've got a debt problem then you have got to get on and deal with it and that is the key to the recovery . "
He added : " It 's the lack of a plan of action from Gordon Brown that is undermining confidence in the British economy . "
Official figures out on Thursday showed the government borrowed another £ 4.3 bn last month to plug the growing hole in the UK 's finances .
It was the first time the government had borrowed money in January - usually a bumper month for income from tax receipts - since records began in 1993 .

Exploring what it means to be frugal I think back to my own journey of saving and budgeting .
Check out my post on being frugal .
I really did n’t know what it meant to budget or if it was even necessary to budget .
What strategies should I use to get started .
Here ’s my easy guide to identify your need to budget .
My Journey
My idea of budgeting was tracking my income and expenses .
Move into my first apartment , set some money aside , money for medical bills , put some money away .
Have kids , put a lot of money away .
Buy a home put some more money away .
I was budgeting , right !
No I was only monitoring money coming in and out .
When I really needed to budget I was n’t sure where to start .
Without computers and Internet ( This was the early 90s ) , finding ways to start and maintain a budget was limited .
I came across a book at the grocery store , which had pages to record monthly income and expenses so I picked it up .
The book had tips for creating a budget this was an eye opener for me .
I went from just writing down our spending to analyzing every purchase we made .
Since I needed to write everything down it became apparent where the money was going and most of it was to things the family did n’t need .
Finally , I was able to create a spending plan .
In a few short months I had the money I needed for a down payment and we went out house hunting .
I wish I could say that I was budgeting pro , but no .
I kept sliding in and out of budgeting and only doing it when I wanted a big purchase and needed more cash to do so .
Budget Guide
Need to know how much you earn and spend ?
Is big purchase in your future ?
Do the kids need to go to college ?
Do you want to retire ?
Have the traveling bug ?
If you answered yes to any of the above questions , then you need to budget .
Choosing a budget
There are many different thoughts on what is the best way to budget and save , but really as long as you have a plan that is all that matters .
I decided to use the Dave Ramsey Method .
If you are n’t familiar with his work check out his website at www.daveramsey.com
( I am not affiliated with his site , I just like his strategies ) .
Although , I use some of the strategies I am not a die hard fan .
There are a few things that I do n’t use just because they do n’t work for me an my family .
Searching budgeting on the internet will result in many other strategies .
Check them out and find one that fits your needs .
Dave Ramsey outlines 7 baby steps for financial freedom .
If you are new to budgeting you should follow his steps to the letter , do n’t skip over any ( I ’ll add some caveats here in a minute ) .
Think about the baby steps before you create your budget .
Where are you in the budgeting journey ?
Are you in debt , have no money in your savings account , or living paycheck to paycheck .
Baby Steps explained
Step 1 : Emergency Fund
Have a $ 1000 emergency fund .
This is n’t fun money or something you should be taking from when you want a new phone .
This is for true emergencies such as a car breaking down or a leaky faucet .
Dave Ramsey recommends having this money in a separate but available account .
You do n’t want this money getting lost in your other funds .
I actually keep mine in cash hidden in my house , because if my husband sees the money in the account he will want to spend it .
In order to start your emergency fund try selling unused items or taking on a side job .
Once you have your emergency fund money move to step 2 .
Step 2 : Snowball
Pay - off your debt with the snowball effect .
At this time , I only have one debt and I could pay it off easily .
I owe my orthodontist , but for some reason I do n’t want to pay it off until my treatment is completed and the expense is less than $ 200 a month and will be paid off in a few more months .
There are many strategies around paying off debt such as , Avalanche , snowfall , balance transfers , etc . I prefer Dave ’s way .
Using the Ramsey method you list all your debt ( credit cards , student loan , car payments , medical bills , etc. except mortgage payment ) in order from smallest to largest .
Include the minimum payment and interest rate .
You will start paying off the smallest balance first and minimum payments on the remainder .
The only time you will worry about interest rates is when you have two identical balances , then pay - off the higher interest rate one first .
Once you pay off the smaller debt , you will add this amount to the next bill and continue in this way until all your debts are gone .
Celebrate !
Your debt is gone .
Best of all the money you were using to pay these bills will be the money you use to create your step 3 .
Snowball example
Debt Min payment Balance Payment Medical bill 185 935 185 per month Credit Card 29 2000 29 + 185 Car Loan 500 32000 500+29 + 185 Debt snowball
In the above example the medical bill is the smallest payment .
First pay the $ 185 ( and any other money you can pay by saving in other areas ) .
Therefore the credit card and car loan will get the minimum payment .
Once the medical bill is paid off you add that amount to the credit card for a payment now of $ 214 .
Continue paying off the credit card until the balance is zero .
Then add that amount to the car payment .
You are now paying $ 714 a month .
Soon all your debts will be paid .
Step 3 : Emergency Fund
Create a 3 - 6 month of expense emergency fund .
This is for 3 - 6 months of living expense incase you are suddenly without an income because of loss of job or other major emergencies .
This is the step I am currently on .
I do have a plenty of money set aside and we will be okay if either my husband or I lose our jobs , but I am also using this to cover any unexpected house repairs .
Step 4 : Retirement
Invest 15 % of household income toward retirement .
My husband and I work for companies that provide matching retirement funds and we are contributing our maximum allotment .
However , if your company does n’t have a matching fund you need to seek advice on the best investment fund .
We probably do have 15 % of our income going to retirement , but we decided that we will want to have a separate retirement fund , as we started contributions later then we should have and will fall short when retirement comes .
Plus I would like to retire early due to health issues .
Step 5 : College Fund
Save for children ’s college fund .
Just like in the airplane when they say take care of your oxygen mask first then assist your children , this is the same idea .
Make sure you have done steps 1 - 4 before doing this step .
In my case my children are grown and we have all completed our college careers .
If you do n’t have children or a need to save for college skip this step .
Step 6 : Pay off Home
Pay - off your home early : I skipped some other steps to get to this one .
I am already making extra payments to my mortgage even before I found Dave Ramsey and the payments were already allotted so I just see them as a part of my mortgage payment .
A home is probably the biggest purchase you will make in your life and will take anywhere between 15 and 30 years to payoff ( See Dave Ramsey ’s site for information regarding purchasing a home ) .
Therefore , much of your money is tied up in paying off a home .
In our case we had circumstances that forced us into a 30 year fixed loan .
This is why I wanted to make extra payments .
At the schedule I have us at right now we will be paying off more to the principal then to the interest in less than two years .
I would recommend that you follow Dave Ramsey ’s advice , as I ’m sure he would n’t agree with the way we are doing things , but this works for us .
Step 7 : Build Wealth
Build wealth and give .
You have no debt ; you own your home so now you can do whatever you want .
Well not really , but that sounds so good .
You still have other bills ( Utility , insurance , and of course taxes ) ; do n’t forget to continue to pay those .
You have developed wonderful skills by now and you know what you can and cannot due with your money .
In part two I will discuss Dave Ramsey further ( this is the area where I do n’t follow his recommendations ) and how to set up your own budget , and ways to save on certain expenses .
Do you budget ?
Share some of your budgeting success or failures .
There are few things more condescending and arrogant than a journalist who arrives in a foreign country , walks around briefly in its streets , and from a few superficial observations , believes they can make a judgement on the entire economic situation of a country , as well as the social movements and hopes of millions of members of that country .
In yesterday ’s article “ Venezuela ’s economy in further slide ” , BBC journalist Robert Plummer admits it ’s been a long time since he set foot in Venezuela .
His article ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8464960.stm) is an un-contextualised , gloomy surface skim of a list of things apparently going wrong right now in Venezuela , creating the impression of a dirty , downtrodden country wrecked by economic crisis and bad governance .
Ironically , he writes it at a time when the rest of the world really is suffering such a calamity .
He begins by remembering a honey moon stop over trip of his to Caracas in 2002 , and suggests that little has changed since then .
Caracas has “ bags of rubbish piled up ” , pro and anti Chavez graffiti , and shops that are “ less well - stocked than before ” .
Oh horror .
It ’s hard to know whether these bags of rubbish are part of the simple rubbish collection system here ( where rubbish is put out in the street on certain days of the week to be collected ) , or if its something else , but it is worth pointing out that the current government has invested in a range of large bins , big containers , and small garbage trucks .
And for a bit of balance for the BBC who purports to like the stuff , the UK is the fourth highest producer of industrial waste , whereas Venezuela does not make the list of the 33 highest waste producing countries .
The UK also produces 34.85 million tonnes of rubbish per yeah , ranking it 5th in the world , and giving it a per capita production of roughly three times that of Venezuela , with 7.3 million tonnes yearly .
Lots of pro and anti Chavez graffiti .
The BBC and most mainstream media always talk about Venezuela in terms of Chavez .
It ’s true that Chavez is playing a big role here , but he is n’t the only player and there is a lot of grassroots organising that the media tends to condescendingly overlook .
Likewise , most graffiti is n’t actually about Chavez , but it is political , interesting , and often very creative and beautiful .
Frankly I love it , it makes the streets much more alive and interesting to walk in .
As to the shops having less , well it ’s hard to say if that ’s true or not .
Perhaps some shops do have less .
Clearly a sign of a healthy economy that looks after all its citizens is when supermarkets have at least 19 varieties of cereal .
Lack thereof is proof that life is rough , and never mind all the advances here in health , education , grassroots democracy , indigenous representation , recuperation of history and culture , and the massive decrease in poverty and extreme poverty .
Plummer ’s article intentionally ignores all these things and anything that is positive , preferring to list apparent problem after problem and create the impression that everything is just going wrong and falling apart .
He begins his anti-Chavez diatribe by quoting the only person he quotes in the whole article , described as a “ former colleague ” and therefore probably not Venezuelan .
The colleague notices “ some deterioration ” and so does Plummer , and that ’s it , that ’s all that has apparently changed about Venezuela since Chavez first became president .
Next , Plummer reads a few of the latest AFP articles about the electricity problems here and the recent devaluation , does a rough summary of them , adds in a quote from “ respected survey organisation ” Consensus Economics and apart from a few sentences , does n’t at all bother to examine causes of these issues or propose any possible solutions that the government has some how overlooked .
He concedes that previous administrations are “ equally responsible ” for the lack of investment in electricity infrastructure , but ignores the other causes of the electricity shortage ( such as the draught drying up the main hydropower plant and increased electricity consumption due to higher disposable incomes ) and does not mention any of the various projects and agreements that the current government has undertaken in an attempt to deal with the demand .
Hence the reader has the impression that the government is doing next to nothing .
Regarding inflation , Plummer ’s “ research ” is selective and plain wrong .
He says that inflation was “ at least 27 % in 2009 ” when in fact it was 27.6 % in 2008 and 25.1 % in 2009 .
He says , “ More worrying is Venezuela 's apparent inability to get to grips with persistent inflation . ”
But inflation under Chavez has averaged 22 % and under the previous government of Caldera it averaged 57.8 % .
Ah , its doomsday for the Venezuelan economy !
Chavez ’s attempt to “ impose price controls …. have largely failed to work ” and his “ heavy - handed measures … have not done anything to promote economic growth … Venezuela is still bogged down in the financial mire . ”
Venezuela has been one of the countries least affected by the global economic crisis , why single it out when in the United States many people have lost their homes and jobs ?
Unemployment here increased by 0.6 % last year from 7.4 % in 2008 to 8 % .
This is not a good thing , but relative to other countries , is minor .
Venezuela has also had 20 quarters of non stop economic growth , then last year , a 2.9 % contraction in the GDP , but has maintained its levels of social spending .
Finally , Plummer refers to the recent nationalisation proceedings initiated against the Exito supermarket chain , saying its “ French owners failed to please Mr Chavez ” and that , “ As a result [ of “ failed ” price controls , Chavez ] has increasingly resorted to the ultimate economic sanction - confiscating the businesses of those who refuse to curb their prices . ”
One gets the impression that Chavez is driving around like a dictator , closing shops he does n’t like and those who do n’t charge prices that he has demanded .
However , since the recent devaluation of the bolivar , many businesses have increased prices on their current stock , bought at the old exchange rate , thereby earning huge profits at customers ’ expense .
The majority of workers at Exito support the nationalisation measure , and Exito will now be incorporated into the Corporation of Socialist Markets ( COMERSO ) , a publicly owned network which sells products at subsidised rates .
The BBC ’s coverage of Venezuela , in general , is highly biased against the government , but usually includes a few token paragraphs quoting government officials towards the end for “ balance ” .
However , it is clear their main writer in Caracas , Will Grant , sees the country and its processes , changes , mistakes , dreams and problems , from the perspective of a very comfortable first world citizen .
He sympathises with the upper class and opposition minority , and complains of petty things like the price of luxury goods , while ignoring all the improvements and the increased voice of the majority poor .
Further , the BBC , like most mainstream press today , targets Venezuela ( as well as a short list of other countries like China ) , constantly highlighting what it perceives to be problems here in a way that it does not do for other countries .
The media finds one or two mistakes or problems with the Venezuelan government , and uses it to discredit the Bolivarian revolution , and therefore , the possibility that other ways are possible .
On the other hand , the 55 % of Mumbai ’s population living in slums , and the one billion people in the world living in slums and going without sufficient food , and so on , could n’t possibly indicate that capitalism is the system that is failing .
A planned fundraiser for Wyclef Jean 's charity in 2006 was canceled in part because Jean 's personal $ 100,000 performance fee made the event too expensive , according to internal e-mails and a source familiar with the event .
In 2006 , a representative of FXB International , a French charity , approached Yele Haiti about co-sponsoring a benefit concert to raise funds to build a new school and community center in the village of Lasere , Jean 's hometown .
The event , which the organizers hoped would raise $ 150,000 , was to be held at Sunset Beach , Andre Belazs ' Shelter Island Hotel in August 2006 ; Jean was to perform .
According to this e-mail , obtained by Gawker from someone who was not one of its original recipients ,
Yele president Hugh Locke laid out Jean 's personal fee for performing as $ 100,000 , with an additional $ 15,000 slated to pay his band and production costs :

We are set to go with Friday , August 4th for Wyclef to perform .
Just want to check on the " deal " : - performance fee to Wyclef of $ 100,000 paid via Platinum Sound - costs for band separate , probably in the $ 15,000 range ( fees , equipment , etc. ) to be paid to Platinum Sound - $ 150,000 guaranteed net from the evening to be earmarked for Wyclef 's home town of Lasere using the FXB model , but with this money going through Yele Haiti ( and identified as a joint initiative with FXB ) with no admin overhead to Yele … straight to Lasere - the Lasere project to include building a new k to grade 9 school combined with a Yele Center , as well as a basketball court that the community can also use as income generator because they can charge for attendance - net above the $ 150,000 to go to Yele as un-earmarked contribution .

According to someone familiar with Yele , the event never ended up happening because it got " too expensive " to produce , in part because of Jean 's fee .
Yele , which stands to raise millions from tonight 's Hope for Haiti telethon and has been raising a reported $ 1 million a day through text donations since the earthquake , has been under fire over tax returns showing that the charity repeatedly directed funds to Jean and his business interests — including a $ 100,000 performance fee to Jean 's production company Platinum Sounds for a 2006 fundraising concert in Monte Carlo .
Locke has defended that payment by claiming that it covered " production costs " for the show , including payments for the band , and that Jean 's fee was only $ 25,000 .
The e-mail , written by Locke , clearly shows that Jean was seeking a $ 100,000 fee for himself in 2006 , and that band members and " equipment etc " were to be paid with an additional $ 15,000 .
According to tax experts quotes by the Associated Press , there is nothing illegal about charities paying their own board members for services as long as they are not above market rate .
As the Smoking Gun reported earlier this month , in 2002 Jean 's going rate for a performance was $ 40,000 .
A publicist for Yele Haiti did not immediately return a request for comment .
This afternoon , Locke announced that Yele was hiring new accountants to help it avoid repeating its past " mistakes , " including failing to file tax returns for three years .
Fish oil may be the true elixir of youth , according to new evidence of its effect on biological ageing .
Omega - 3 fatty acids from fish oil preserve the genetic " fuse " that determines the lifespan of cells , say scientists .
The discovery , made in heart disease patients , may explain many of the claimed health benefits of omega -3 .
Taking fish oil supplements is said to protect against heart disease , improve survival rates after a heart attack , reduce mental decline in old age and help to prevent age - related changes in the eye that can lead to blindness .
Research has also shown that rodents live one - third longer when given a diet enriched with fish - derived omega -3 .
Although omega - 3 fatty acids have powerful anti-inflammatory properties and lower levels of some blood fats , the mechanisms behind these effects are poorly understood .
The new research suggests that omega - 3 has a direct effect on biological ageing by slowing down the rate at which protective caps on the ends of chromosomes shorten .
The caps , called telomeres , are made from copied strands of DNA and have a similar function to bookends or the plastic ends of shoelaces .
They prevent the ends of chromosomes – the " packages " of DNA in the cell nucleus – becoming damaged and keep the DNA organised and contained .
Each time a cell divides , its telomeres get shorter until a critical point is reached .
DNA then becomes damaged and the cell stops dividing , and may die .
In this way , the telomere acts like a biological fuse .
The rate at which the fuse " burns " can vary both between individual people and individual cells .
This is believed to have an impact on age - related diseases .
US scientists conducting the research looked at the effect of omega - 3 fatty acids on telomere shortening in 608 hospital out - patients with heart disease .
At the start of the study , measurements were taken of the length of chromosomal telomeres in the patients ' white blood cells .
Blood levels of the two fish - derived omega - 3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) were also measured .
The tests were carried out again after five years , and showed a clear correlation with omega - 3 intake .
Patients consuming the least omega - 3 had the fastest rate of telomere shortening , while those in the top 25 % of consumption levels had the slowest rate .
The scientists , led by Dr Ramin Farzaneh - Far of the University of California at San Francisco , wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association : " The present findings identify deceleration of telomere attrition as a potentially novel pathway for the anti-ageing effects of marine omega - 3 fatty acids .
" In summary , among patients with stable coronary artery disease , there was an inverse relationship between baseline blood levels of marine omega - 3 fatty acids and the rate of telomere shortening over five years ...
These findings raise the possibility that omega - 3 fatty acids may protect against cellular ageing in patients with coronary heart disease . "
There are company of Russian photographers that travel around Russia and world taking pictures of everything they see .
Recently they decided to split up ; one of them went to Africa to make a picture story and the other one went to one of the mining towns in Siberia .
Just compare it , +40C ( +95 F ) in Africa and - 40C ( - 40 F ) in Siberia .
It is kinda funny to be there at nights .
If you open a window , you will hardly close it after 5 minutes .
One of cozy streets .
The temperature outdoors is - 42C ( - 44 F ) .
Each fast breath hurts unaccustomed to such fierce frost lungs and everything inside your nose freezes up .
The main thing is to breathe smoothly and to walk slowly .
Many houses have boiler installations which burn coal .
Because of that , the whole city is being smog - immersed and all snow grays out the next day it falls .
One of the locals .
Camera lens freezes up and resists zooming .
Frost and the sun , what a beautiful day !
And it is just - 42C ( - 44 F ) outdoors .
The sign says : the best yard 2005 .
For sure , you ca n’t argue with it .
Bleak fire of the winter sun .
The first man .
Almost every car is with a started motor .
In the morning only those cars that have been staying in heated parking place at night can be started .
After 15 minutes of being outdoors the photocamera frosted over and refused to work .
This is a parking place with heating .
You can recognize it because of thick ice built - up on the doors .
The car of the photographer can start while it is - 40C ( - 40 F ) outside , but it is better to park it into the parking place to be on the safe side .
To warm the camera up , the photographer came into the riser block of flats in one of the houses .
It is warm over there , just - 5C ( +23 F . )
Night city .
These snow sculptures have frozen up so badly that one can break stones upon them .
Hot water is being delivered to houses by external pipe system , they say that it is much comfortable like that .
Actually , you do n’t need to be a skilled technician to find out where is the leakage .
One of the going coal - pits of the town .
Once there were 16 of them , but nowadays more than a half are closed .
Nevertheless , the town is being one of the leading suppliers of carbonized coal in Russia .
The next day the photographer went to one of the major coal - pits of the town .
There its coal - preparation plant smokes .

The new year has barely started , but it 's already become apparent that at least one dire prediction about 2010 is n't going to come to pass .
IP v4 address space will not be exhausted in 2010 as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) had once forecast .
But that does n't mean that network managers or even consumer electronics vendors should sit on the sidelines .
This week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , the American Registry for Internet Names ( ARIN ) is advocating that vendors start making the move to IP v6 now .
IP v4 technology uses a 32 - bit address space providing capacity for 4.3 billion IP addresses .
The next - generation IP v6 system has a 128 - bit address space , providing a capacity orders of magnitude larger ( the number of addresses IP v6 could support can be expressed as : 34 x 10 to the 38th power , or 340 trillion trillion trillion ) .
The timeline for IP v4 address space exhaustion may not be 2010 , but it is likely to be exhausted within the next two or three years at the present rate of IP address allocation .
" We 're at about 10.2 percent ( IPv4 address space ) remaining globally , " John Curran , president and CEO of ARIN told InternetNews.com .
" At our current trend rate we 've got about 625 days before we will not have new IP v4 addresses available .
We 're still handling IP v4 requests from ISPs , hosting companies and large users for IP v4 address space , but that 's a very short time period . "
Curran added that ARIN has sent formal notices to U.S. ISPs to let them that they 'll have to move to IP v6 for address space allocations as IP v4 is near exhaustion .
On the other hand , ARIN is also having some success in reclaiming unused IP v4 address space back from organizations that are n't using all of their addresses .
" Some of the largest allocations of IP v4 addresses that have ever been made are held by large entities like technology companies and governments , and we 've been in contact with them and we 've had success , " Curran said .
" We 've had a number of universities , private companies and government agencies return unused addresses .
So it is possible that we 'll see more of that and that could push out the date ( of IPv4 depletion ) . "
That does n't mean that IP v4 can be saved , though .
Curran noted that even if they get a large number of returns that will likely only extend the IP v4 depletion date by six months to a year , at most .
The pending depletion of IPv4 is the reason Curran is at the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas this week , talking to vendors about the importance of migrating to IPv6 .
" The goal is that ARIN is trying to get out in front and make sure that the people who are actually building the technology that consumers use are aware of the important changes that are happening with IPv6 , " Curran said .
While American technology consumers may not be familiar with IPv6 on their devices , consumers in Japan are a different story .
IP v6 enabled TVs have already shopped in Japan and are in use by Japanese carrier NTT .
NTT has an IPv6 IPTV service called NTT Plala Hikari TV , which NTT talked about at the CES show in 2009 .
" I think in the U.S. and in Europe there has n't been the same traction that we 've seen in Asia for IP v6 enabled consumer electronics devices , " Doug Junkins , NTT America 's CTO and vice president of IP development , told InternetNews.com .
Junkins noted that in Asia there has long been a greater urgency in moving to IPv6 , as Asian countries do not have as much IP v4 address space as the U.S .
" I do n't think it ( IPv6 ) will be a huge issue at CES this year , " Junkins said .
" Maybe next year when we 're another year closer to having IP v4 address space exhausted we 'll see more of an emphasis on the U.S. consumer electronics , but I do n't think we 're there quite yet . "
What 's Wrong With The Anarchists ?

Sometimes you encounter people who challenge the way you think , the values that you hold true .
Sometimes it can make you uncomfortable , but it helps you grow much more than being around people who nod and smile and keep their true thoughts to themselves .
I think I 'm a nod -and - smiler , but luckily I 've encountered several challenge - the - way - you - think 'ers this week .
They might make a challenger out of me yet .
One of those " challengers " was reading my FAQ .
Under the What 's all this stuff about punk - ethics ?
heading , I included a statement that I do n't really identify with the anarchist side of [ the Anarchist 's Punk Ethic ] anymore .
That prompted a challenging email question from the document 's author - what 's wrong with the anarchists now ?
I did n't have an immediate answer - not anything coherent anyway - so I sat down tonight for several hours to work out exactly why I do n't identify as an anarchist anymore .
I mean , it 's not as if the Sex Pistols are suddenly uncool or anything .
Dissociation
My disappointment with anarchists peaked during the Iraqi War protests .
Peaceful protests are a good thing , they encourage people to develop views on important issues .
However the methods used by two protest groups ( some of whom identified as anarchists ) left me disheartened .
In Perth , like most cities , we had a huge number of high school students walk out of classes to protest .
I think that protesting during class hours weakens their cause .
If you 're really committed to something , you 'll be prepared to give up your own time for it , eg protesting on a Saturday , or after school .
Instead , this seemed like students " anarchists " using any excuse to get out of class - Disappointment One .
More seriously , another protest group blocked major roads during peak hours as their protest against the war .
Why ?
How does disrupting daily life and reducing productivity aid their cause ?
Sure , it brings media attention , but it does n't provide an incentive for people with contrary views to change their opinion - in fact it 's likely to harden their current views .
It 's a form of coercion , and coercion is not a long term solution .
This little group made me ashamed to have given myself the anarchist tag .
Disappointment Two .
I 'm tired of people who protest for the sake of it , who seek to cause mayhem without any real commitment to a cause - basically the rent - a- crowds and the bandwagoners .
I do n't identify with those " anarchists " .
I believe that if you want to criticize something , you should offer a credible alternative .
In many cases it is n't happening .
In short , I wanted to dissociate myself from anarchists I did not identify with .
Anarchist by definition
Of course , one should n't base their decisions solely on the actions of others .
It would be wrong to denounce anarchism due to the actions of a few .
Instead my decision should be based on the meaning of anarchism - and for that , I turn to Dictionary.com as my reference .
Each heading below is one of the definitions of anarchism quoted from The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language , Fourth Edition .
Rejection of all forms of coercive control and authority .
I have no problem with rejecting coercive control .
I can't think of any occasions where threats or intimidation would be justified - unions and employers take note .
However I do n't reject all forms of authority .
I will challenge authority if warranted , and I have some history of doing this , but I wo n't reject authority for the sake of it .
I 'm happy to co-operate with the police , but I would challenge corrupt police practices .
Active resistance and terrorism against the state , as used by some anarchists .
I have a real problem with this , so I 'm thankful the definition was qualified with the phrase " some anarchists " .
Terrorism is immoral and pointless - it's a form of coercion and it does n't benefit any cause or anyone .
It 's just plain wrong .
The theory or doctrine that all forms of government are oppressive and undesirable and should be abolished .
I 'm not entirely convinced of this - and considering this is the crux of anarchy , it 's a big deal .
I can't say that all forms of government are oppressive - I have n't experienced them all , I have n't done research to support or deny the claim .
I would expect that most governments use at least some form of oppression .
Does this make them undesirable ?
I do n't know if I feel that way .
Would anarchy reduce oppression ?
Or should we accept oppression under anarchic systems because anarchy is ethically right ?
I 'm not convinced that anarchy is a credible alternative anymore , but feel free to try and convince me .
Internet Anarchy
Hang on , is n't the internet an anarchic system ?
Most of my early anarchic views were predicated on the internet being an anarchy .
If the internet works and provides a functioning and prosperous community , does n't that demonstrate that anarchy can work in practice ?
Unfortunately , I now think both my predicate and conclusion are false .
Is the internet a true anarchy ?
I do n't think so now .
There are underlying rules that control the internet , the network protocols .
They define how computers should talk to each other to interact correctly - and if they do n't adhere to the protocols , something tends to stop working somewhere down the line .
The protocols themselves are ( to my knowledge ) ratified by a single organization , the Internet Engineering Task Force .
There are gatekeepers to the internet - my ISP can cut off my dialup connection whenever they like , and can ban me from their services if I breach their terms and conditions .
All of these restrict in some way what a user can do online , and demonstrate some form of control or governance .
None of them control everything that happens online , but neither do governments control everything every single person does .
Does the internet provide a functioning community ?
For the most part , yes ... but the spam epidemic is getting worse and I believe it does threaten the health of the internet .
Spam shows how the actions of a few individuals can affect many other people .
There are technical solutions being put forward , some of these solutions involve authorities vouching for the identity of a user ( or a spammer as the case may be ) .
It 's a step away from anarchy and closer to governance ... even then , internet performance may still be degraded by spammers .
So the internet works , but for how long ?
Hence my original conclusion may have been false too .
... so ?
It comes down to this : I still hold some anarchic views , but since I do n't act on all of them , I do n't see myself as an anarchist .
Imagine for a second that I am an anarchist - by definition , this would mean that I reject all authority and believe that all government should be abolished .
When was the last time that I acted on that ?
I can think of few occasions where I 've stood up to authority lately , and no occasions where I have advocated the abolishment of government .
At the very least I 'm not a practicing anarchist .
It 's more likely I was a faux anarchist all along .
I believe that one should always act on their views .
Failure to do so can be hypocritical , and hypocrisy causes those views to be devalued by others .
I have n't acted on the few anarchic beliefs I hold , nor do I have a real passion or desire to act on them .
For that reason , I no longer identify as an anarchist .
Sorry Johnny .
I 'm still an antichrist though .

* SEC agreed with AIG to keep some bailout terms sealed
* SEC granted “ confidential treatment ” last May
* Secrecy order stays in place until November 2018
NEW YORK , Jan 11 ( Reuters ) -
It could take until November 2018 to get the full story behind the U.S. bailout of insurance giant American International Group AIG .N because of an action taken last year by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
In May , the SEC approved a request by AIG to keep secret an exhibit to a year - old regulatory filing that includes some of the details on the most controversial aspect of the AIG bailout : the funneling of tens of billions of dollars to big banks like Societe Generale , Goldman Sachs GS.N , Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE and Merrill Lynch .
The SEC ’s Division of Corporation Finance , in granting AIG ’s request for confidential treatment , said the “ excluded information ” will not be made public until Nov. 25 , 2018 , according to a copy of the agency ’s May 22 order .
The SEC said the insurer had demonstrated the information in the exhibit , called Schedule A , “ qualifies as confidential commercial or financial information . ”
The expiration date for the SEC order falls on the 10th anniversary of Federal Reserve of New York ’s decision to provide emergency financing to an entity set up to specifically acquire some $ 60 billion in collateralized debt obligations from 16 banks in the United States and Europe .
All the banks that got money from the Fed - sponsored entity -- Maiden Lane III -- had purchased insurance contracts , or credit default swaps , on those mortgage - related securities from AIG .
The SEC ’s decision to approve AIG ’s request for confidential treatment got scant attention at the time .
But it could spark controversy now following the release last week of 14 - month - old emails that reveal that some at the New York Fed had discussions with AIG officials about how much information should be disclosed to the public about the Maiden Lane III transaction .
The New York Fed , then led by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , plays a critical role in the world of finance given its close dealings with all the major Wall Street banks , many of which were counterparties of AIG .
SEC spokesman John Nestor declined to comment on the reasons for granting AIG ’s request to treat the exhibit as confidential .
In a typical year , the SEC receives 1,500 requests from U.S. companies for confidential treatment for portions of regulatory filing , said Nestor .
The agency grants those requests , “ all or in part , ” 95 percent of the time , he said .
It ’s not clear what information is in the exhibit beyond a listing of the 16 banks that were beneficiaries of the Maiden Lane transaction .
Last March , under pressure from Congress , AIG released the names of the banks that sold CDOs to Maiden Lane and how much money the banks got in the process .
When AIG filed the Schedule A exhibit with the SEC , it redacted the information it wanted to keep confidential , in anticipation regulators would approve its request .
The Fed ’s bailout of AIG long has been controversial because the banks that sold CDOs to Maiden Lane III were paid 100 percent of face value , even though many of the securities were worth substantially less at the time of the government bailout .
Last Thursday the furor over the Maiden Lane transaction was reignited after Rep. Darrell Issa , a California Republican , released copies of emails detailing discussions between the New York Fed and AIG over how much information to disclose .
The emails have provided fresh ammunition for critics of Geithner .
New York Fed General Counsel Thomas Baxter Jr. said in a letter to Issa ’s office that Geithner “ played no role in , and had no knowledge of ” the emails .
Issa , the highest - ranking Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , said the panel will soon hold hearings about how information was disclosed to the public about the Maiden Lane deal .
Issa ’s spokesman Kurt Bardella declined to comment on the SEC ’s handling of the AIG ’s confidentiality request .
But Issa , in a prepared statement , said “ as much information as possible should be made available to Congress to review the details and decisions ” regarding the payments .
The batch of emails released by Issa discussed the SEC ’s requests for more information about the exhibit that AIG wanted to keep secret .
But the emails did not mention the SEC ’s decision to grant AIG ’s request for confidential treatment .

I have n't much cared for Pat Quinn thus far in Edmonton .
I 've enjoyed listening to him talk about hockey after the games and on practice days but when the team is actually playing the games - you know , those things we keep on losing - his performance as a bench coach has been , well , frustrating .
For a good part of the season he 's been rolling lines and defence pairings with little regard for match - ups .
He plays Strudwick in the last minute when all the other defencemen are healthy .
He gives Taylor Chorney the least zone - start ratio of anyone on the team at EV plus a bunch of PK minutes ... with Strudwick ( way to put the young offensive defender in a position to succeed ! ) .
He plays J.F. Jacques and makes Fernando Pisani a healthy scratch .
He thought about taking Marc Pouliot out of the lineup despite generating more scoring chances than most of the team 's forwards because the dude does n't hit like Jacques does .
The team as a whole , widely predicted to be bad , is actually on pace to be one of the worst in Oiler history .
In other news , Ken Hitchcock just became available .
I 'll say it right now .
I would be thrilled if Pat Quinn was fired and Ken Hitchcock hired in his place .
That last bit may be a bit unrealistic given the fact that Tom Renney is standing on the bench beside Pat Quinn these days but the first part certainly is n't .
If you start the season coaching a team that ends up finishing in the bottom three in the league , you usually get fired sometime in the next two years :
Within two years ten of twelve coaches were fired .
Wayne Gretzky 's situation in Phoenix was one of the exceptions and was ... rather unique .
And without saying that the Coyotes situation ( on the ice ) was all his fault , Dave Tippett seems to have that team playing a wee bit better .
Scott Gordon is n't out of the woods yet , especially if the Islanders take a great fall .
In some of these instances the coach changed despite the results not being his fault ( John Tortorella in Tampa Bay seems like a good example ) .
In others ( I 'm looking at you Trent Yawney ) the coach probably played a significant role in the team 's failure .
I tend to think Pat Quinn belongs to the second group of more culpable men this season while Hitchcock belongs to the first .
If Pat Quinn is going to be moving down the road , I think the Oilers would be well - advised to go after Hitch .
It was yesterday that Scott Howson , general manager of the Columbus Blue Jackets , decided that firing Ken Hitchcock was in " the best long - term interests of the hockey team " despite the fact that Hitchcock " is an excellent coach . "
The quotes come from Howson himself ( you can hear the whole press conference at the Blue Jackets ' website ) and paint an interesting picture of coaching in the NHL .
It 's not often that a manger will fire an employee that does his job with excellence but such is the nature of the coaching business in the NHL .
There are enough competent coaches out there that most managers seem to think that even excellent ones can be somewhat easily replaced .
And maybe that 's true , but the Oilers sure did n't get it right last summer .
So why do I think Hitchcock is so good ?
Well , first of all , I do n't think the Columbus situation is his fault .
When Howson was giving reasons for firing Hitchcock he said that " it became clear that the message was not being responded to by the performance of the team .
We had lost some of our identity , some of our passion , some of our hard work and we certainly were n't checking like he hoped we'd check . "
Interesting language from Howson .
At the beginning I had assumed he was focused on wins and losses but his explanation at the end has as much or more to do with process .
I can get behind a firing based on process and maybe Hitchcock had worn out his welcome .
Howson did n't mention the Nikita Filatov situation , but I would imagine that played a role as well .
So why is this Blue Jackets team worse than a year ago ?
The Blue Jackets goal differential this season is listed at nhl.com as - 43 compared to - 4 one year ago .
If we take out the shoot - out goals from the standings , the figures move to - 37 this year and - 3 last season .
Next we 'll look at the EV percentages .
So far this season the Blue Jackets have gotten a .902 save percentage five - on - five compared to .917 a year ago .
That shift in save percentage has cost the Blue Jackets 20 goals so far this season based on the number of shots they 've allowed .
And you know the great thing about .917 at EV ?
It 's exactly average .
It 's not like Hitchcock was asking for the moon from his goalies .
The other side of the coin is shooting percentage , which is also down at five - on - five .
They 've been a below - average 7.1 % this season after an above average season of 8.8 % one year ago .
If the Jackets had shot 8.8 % this season they would have scored an extra 12 goals .
So the percentages at five - on - five have cost them about 32 goals season - over - season .
They 've also been outshot this year five - on - five ( - 0.53 shots per game ) despite outshooting teams last season ( +1.89 shots per game ) .
This last change can perhaps be left at the feet of the coach and could be what Howson was alluding to above with regard to the lack of identity , hard work and checking .
On the other hand , the team has been more disciplined this season when it comes to taking penalties ( 4.22 power - play opportunities against per game last season compared to 3.95 this season ) and they 've also done a better job on the power play ( their goal differential of +36 on the PP already exceeds the +31 they put up all of last season ) .
Broadening out a bit , one of the ways I like to evaluate coaches is by comparing their performance at the NHL level with the coaches that immediately preceded and immediately followed them .
The methodology comes from the Contrarian Goaltender who did something similar while trying to determine the effect of Pat Burns on defensive play .
Hitchcock has been hired and fired three times which gives us five different coaches to compare him against :
The non-Hitch coaches are Bob Gainey , Rick Wilson , Bill Barber , John Stevens and Gerard Gallant / Gary Agnew .
In only one of the five instances was Hitchcock 's points percentage worse than the other coach ( John Stevens , but Hitchcock only coached 8 games in the sample season ) .
This number alone does n't mean that Hitchcock is a good coach ( Pat Quinn 's number by this measure was also impressive ) but combined with what I know about Hitchcock 's aggressive bench tactics it leaves me feeling confident .
He uses players in a variety of roles ( just look at the zone start for his defenders last year ) that suit their abilities .
He matches lines ( an example of a game in Columbus , dueling with MacTavish ; no way in hell MacT gets Hemsky v. Voracek but he will see plenty of Hejda ) .
He forces his talented players to play the game without cheating for offence ( see : Filatov spat ) .
He 's just a good coach .
Oh , and Steve , he 's from Edmonton !
And he worked for Hockey Canada !
Please hire him .
I 'll record this song if it happens .
Note from Kyle : I ’ve kept this post up for archive purposes , but I ’ve deleted the photos since I revisited Dixie Square mall in higher resolution on my main blog , which can be found here :
http://www.cityeyesphoto.com/3298/dead-mall-exploration-of-the-abandoned-dixie-square-mall/
Went out to Chicago again this weekend .
Took a few photos of some new places .
First destination – An abandoned shopping mall .
Once in an area of great promise , now the area has descended into high crime and depression .
The mall , used for the chase scene in the Blues Brothers movie , closed in 1978 and since then had been the site of a murder , multiple rapes , and a few other very nasty things until the police station moved nearby .
Fire damage is apparent in the building and the once sturdy concrete upper floor has caved in at multiple sites within .
A sign hangs from the position where it once stood .
Vandalism has removed much of what was once in the mall , but sometimes you ’ll stumble upon signs of what used to be :
Walls are torn down – only flaps of wallpaper and wood grid remains in some areas :
This room was particularly interesting to me .
I ’m not sure if I ’m right , but I think that the blue tint in my photo is due to the holes in the ceiling becoming a giant pinhole camera type device .
The blue and white is actually a projection of the sky above :
An escalator , once part of a bustling JC Penny , now stands silent .
Water collecting at the bottom makes for a tricky climb as well as corroding metal steps :
Two escalators cross in a large department store area :
Colorful murals and wallpaper adorn the dreary halls of the old mall :
A sign advertising “ beautiful things ” still holds true , in a way .
My second destination was , as far as I could tell , an abandoned chemical research factory .
I ’m told that it was once an oil company , but I ca n’t for the life of me tell exactly what they did in there because I found all sorts of obscure chemicals not related at all to petroleum .
A piano is in the hallway across from a lab .
I have no idea why it ’s there :
Some insane machinery fills up one of the rooms in the building :
Various equipment , bottles , and papers create shadows in this room .
It smelled of sulfur , so I did n’t stay in there for long :
Notice the “ asb 9 ” in this photo .
I ’m pretty sure that means that there was asbestos present and needed to be removed .
Still , the least of our worries :
As always , you know where to find more and larger .

Apple has removed over 5000 applications from the App Store while dictating a new set of rules which bans all sexual apps , according to Jon Atherton developer of the popular Wobble application .
-----
I have spoken with Apple , and the following are the new rules :
1 . No images of women in bikinis ( Ice skating tights are not OK either )
2 . No images of men in bikinis !
( I didnt ask about Ice Skating tights for men )
3 . No skin ( he seriously said this ) ( I asked if a Burqa was OK , and the Apple guy got angry )
4 . No silhouettes that indicate that Wobble can be used for wobbling boobs ( yes  I am serious , we have to remove the silhouette in this pic )
5 . No sexual connotations or innuendo : boobs , babes , booty , sex  all banned
6 . Nothing that can be sexually arousing !!
( I doubt many people could get aroused with the pic above but those puritanical guys at Apple must get off on pretty mundane things to find Wobble overtly sexual ! )
7 . No apps will be approved that in any way imply sexual content ( not sure how Playboy is still in the store , but )
-----
It would be easy to write a thousand words about how ridiculous this is , especially considering that the iPhone offers parental controls and these applications are already rated accordingly .
It is interesting that Playboy and Sports Illustrated are still present in the App Store .
Perhaps
Apple only wants to squash the livelihood of developers that can't afford to respond with legal action .
Congratulations Apple !
You just made Microsoft look good

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Energy Secretary Steven
Chu did n’t reach the pinnacle of his profession by treading the well - worn path of modern group - think .
It ’s regrettable that the Nobel Prize - winning physicist is stuck in that rut now .
Mr. Chu took great pains in a Feb. 19 speech to a Denver energy summit in arguing the case for human - induced climate change .
“ We have to convince all of America that this is a nonpartisan issue . …
This is our economic future , ” he said .
You have to feel for a man of science trying to make the jump to politics .
In science , facts speak for themselves .
In politics , facts are often run to ground by baloney .
As energy secretary , Mr. Chu has traded fact for fiction and now spends his days selling President Obama ’s discredited climate - change policy .
Surely , Mr. Chu must be aware that the case for human - induced climate change , the cause that he has embraced as the paramount mission of his secretariat , has been exposed as fraught with fraud .
Two weeks ago , Yvo de Boer , the United Nations ’ pre-eminent climate - change official , announced his resignation amid a groundswell of derision over his failure to confront the global - warming hoax .
Evidence of falsified data , errors in the U.N. ’s own Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report and biased ground - based temperature data are all part of the body of bogus science that has become known as Climategate .
On Wednesday , when Mr. Chu toured the site of Abu Dhabi ’s Masdar City - touted as “ the world ’s first carbon - neutral , zero - waste city ” - he felt compelled to voice climate - change - equals - jobs rhetoric similar to that which he delivered in Denver .
When completed , the sparkling 6 - square - kilometer model city will be equipped with the world ’s priciest energy technologies , including solar , hydrogen and geothermal power plants - energy toys that a few opulent oil sheiks can afford to play with , but a country the size of America cannot .
What he saw there will not be “ our economic future , ” at least not anytime soon .
Mr. Chu ’s official government biography crows that he has “ devoted his recent scientific career to the search for new solutions to our energy challenges and stopping global climate change - a mission he continues with even greater urgency as secretary of energy . ”
The Cabinet secretary could learn from the example of the wise Viking King Canute .
Legend has it that when His Majesty learned that his flattering courtiers were claiming he was “ so great , he could command the tides of the sea to go back , ” he had his throne carried to the seashore .
When the tide rose , he commanded the waves to halt .
When his command had no effect , he pointed out to all that though the deeds of kings might appear great to men , they were nothing compared to the forces of nature .
Likewise , the energy secretary would be smart to apprehend the limits of his power .
Climate will change - or cease changing - but not by his leave .
The real challenge of helping Americans develop clean , affordable and plentiful energy sources should be enough to occupy his days in office .

Require most employers to contribute to the cost of coverage for some or all of their employees .
Employers would have to contribute at least 72.5 percent of the premium cost for individuals and 65 percent for families for the lowest - cost plan that meets the minimum benefit requirements set by the government .
Penalty : Up to 8 percent of wages in payroll taxes .
Employers with payrolls of $ 500,000 to $ 750,000 would pay 2 percent to 6 percent of wages , and those with payrolls above $ 750,000 would pay the full 8 percent .
Require employers with annual payrolls of $ 500,000 or more to offer coverage to employees or pay a new federal tax .
Senate version
Would not explicitly require employers to offer coverage .
But a company with 50 or more full - time workers would pay a penalty if it does not offer health benefits and if any of the workers obtain subsidized coverage through the new health insurance exchanges .
Penalty : $ 750 for each full - time worker in the company .
Employers with more than 50 workers that offer coverage would also pay a penalty if any of the workers obtain subsidies to buy insurance .
In this case , the penalty would be $ 3,000 for each employee who receives subsidized coverage or $ 750 for each full - time worker in the company , whichever is lesser .
Employers who offer coverage would be required to provide vouchers to low - and middle income workers to obtain insurance on their own through the exchanges .
People with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level ( $ 88,200 for a family of four ) would be eligible for the vouchers if they spend between 8 and 9.8 percent of their income on premiums .
God of War II released on the PS2 in March of 2007 , only 4 months after the launch of the PS3 .
Fast forward to now .
God of War III is a mere 3 weeks away and is the hottest topic in gaming at the moment , just as God of War II was back when it first released .
Lets see how God of War II stands up against God of War III in terms of graphical prowess in these exclusive comparison shots …
In general comparing a PS2 title to a PS3 title is a bit like comparing apples to oranges .
That being said , it ’s still quite amazing to see what the team at Sony Santa Monica Studios have done with the power of the PlayStation 3 .
Kratos ( GoW II ) Vs. Kratos ( GoW III )
Kratos on the PlayStation 2 was a quite a feat for the God of War developers at the time , with the “ Ghost of Sparta ” pushing a polygon count of roughly 5,000 polygons .
Kratos on the PlayStation 3 , however , quadruples that amount for as many as 20,000 polygons .
While that is not quite as much as the reigning graphics king on the PS3 , Nathan Drake , it ’s more than double that of Old Snake .
Then again Drake was n’t battling a 1600 foot tall Cronos , which surely eats up a god ’s share of polygons .
Cyclops Eye Rip ( GoW II ) Vs. Cyclops Eye Rip ( GoW III )
The first God of War was limited to 15 - 20 generic looking characters on screen at once .
Due to the Cell ’s unique architecture , Kratos can battle over 50 distinct enemies on screen at once .
Enemy AI has also been improved dramatically , allowing enemies to team up to attack Kratos , or even protect one another .
Now that you ’ve seen gameplay shots of God of War II vs.
God of War III , the following images showcase God of War II ’s pre-rendered cut - scenes vs. gameplay God of War III shots .
Hades pre-rendered ( GoW II ) Vs. Hades in - game ( GoW III )
Gaia pre-rendered ( GoW II ) Vs. Gaia in - game ( GoW III )
The God of War III in - game screens look much , much better than God of War II ’s pre-rendered cut -scenes .
Quite an accomplishment , especially since pre-rendered cut - scenes generally have better visuals than in - game cut - scenes , mainly due to pre-rendered scenes being produced on more powerful hardware .
Whereas in - game cut - scene is dependent completely on the game engine .
Just goes to show what a difference three years can make with a quantum leap of hardware .
This past week , new footage of God of War III was revealed on GameTrailers TV .
To see all the new footage of the upcoming blockbuster PS3 exclusive , click here .
For some brutal HD screenshots grabbed straight from the footage , click here .
God of War III brings chaos to the PlayStation 3 on March 16 in North America , while Europe will have to wait 3 more days until March 19 , to finally get their hands on Kratos latest adventure .
The BBC has commissioned a 3D trailer to help launch the new series of Doctor Who .
The 40 - second advert , which features new Doctor Matt Smith and assistant Karen Gillan , will be shown in cinemas nationwide before screenings of Alice In Wonderland .
The trailer is a converted version of the new 2D trailer that will premiere on BBC
One this weekend .
A BBC spokesperson told Broadcast : " Doctor Who is the appropriate vehicle for 3D .
It just fits .
It ’s a great way to introduce and showcase the new Doctor to younger viewers . "
The new series of Who will launch in the Spring .

Last Wednesday
I decided I wanted to get my hair cut .
I do n’t know why , but it ’s always a spontaneous decision .
I drove to Great Clips , where I normally go , and noticed that there was a line of people waiting to get their hair cut so I decided I ’d go to Super Cuts .
As soon as I pulled in , I noticed the NO WAIT sign glowing in the window .
I should have put two and two together then and realized I should n’t go in .
As soon as I sat down , the hair stylist told me we ’d go wash my hair .
I knew it would be an extra charge , so I politely declined .
She said “ oh , it ’s only $ 7 and you get a much better cut ! ”
I told her that I did n’t have the time .
She then started cutting my hair dry and using these weird scissors .
From there , it went downhill even more .
By the time I left I had a total mullet hairdo .
I was so upset and embarrassed I could feel how hot my cheeks were .
I paid ( $ 15 ) , left her a $ 3 tip , and left .
I went home , looked in the mirror , and got even more mad .
I looked so stupid .
The next day I ended up going to Great Clips and having a sweet girl there fix my haircut .
I was so relieved I ended up giving her a $ 10 tip .
That day I tried calling Super Cuts to complain to a manager .
They said she ’d be in the next day .
The next day , I called , talked to a manager , explained the whole situation , and asked for a refund since I had to go spend even more money to get it fixed .
She said that they only do redos , not refunds and that I could go in sometime in the next few months for a haircut .
I declined , because I ’ll never step foot in there again , and then she said that because of everything I had to go through that she would refund my money if I brought both receipts in .
I went in that night , took my receipts in , and got my refund .
Now , I will say that I almost did n’t call to complain because I am pretty shy and thought that if I called and complained that the stylist would be there and I ’d have to deal with her again .
I ’m glad that I did call because I got my money back .
I kept my cool , was very nice , and explained the situation thoroughly .
It all worked out in the end .
Have you complained about bad service and it paid off ?
Duke Rape Accuser : ' I 'm Going to Stab You [ Expletive ] ! '
The Duke Lacrosse rape accuser is arrested and charged with attempted murder .
Feb. 18 , 2010  --
The woman who was at the center of the phony Duke lacrosse rape case was arrested today and charged with attempted murder .
The Durham Police Department told ABC News that Crystal Gale Mangum got into an argument with her boyfriend , Milton Walker , shortly after midnight on Thursday .
The arrest warrant claims that Mangum , 33 , scratched , punched and threw objects at Walker before taking all of his clothes and setting them on fire in a bath tub .
Firefighters were sent to the home to extinguish the blaze .
Listen to the 911 call HERE .
Police said they had to evacuate three children , ages 10 , 9 and 3 , from the apartment because of the fire .
It was not immediately known whose children they were .
Mangum is charged with first - degree attempted murder for communicating a threat because she allegedly told Walker in front of officers , " I 'm going to stab you [ expletive ] ! "
She was also charged with five counts of arson , simple assault , identity theft , damage to property and resist , delay and obstruction of justice .
In addition , she faces three counts of child endangerment .
Mangum is being held without bond and her first court appearance is scheduled for today .
Mangum triggered a furor in 2006 when she accused three Duke Lacrosse players of raping her while working at an off campus party .
Prosecutor Mike Nifong heightened the seriousness of the charges by declaring the alleged assault a hate crime .
The charges against the three , Reade Seligmann , Collin Finnerty and David Evans , were eventually dropped , but not before it roiled race relations in the university town and the players were suspended from school .
Another member of the team said in an email response to ABC News " All I can really say is that , like everyone , she has the right to due process and is innocent until proven guilty . "
Nifong pursued the prosecution vigorously despite the growing evidence that Mangum had lied about being sexually assaulted and despite the fact that Magnum changed key facts in her version of what happened .
Duke Lacrosse Prosecutor Mike Nifong Reacts
As pressure mounted and the accuser 's account of the alleged attack began to fall apart in late 2006 , Nifong asked the state attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor , as Nifong was by then the target of an ethics investigation by the state bar association for his handling of the prosecution .
In April , 2007 North Carolina State Attorney General Roy Cooper dropped all charges against the students .
Three months later , Nifong resigned as district attorney , just days before he was found guilty of a battery of ethics violations and disbarred at a dramatic state bar association disciplinary hearing .
A tearful Nifong publicly apologized to the three players .
Reached by ABC News today , Nifong initially said he doubted press reports about Mangum 's arrest , saying he found news reports " to be of questionable value . "
When told that police had confirmed the charges against Magnum , Nifong said , " I 'm not involved in the district attorney 's office in any way .
I 'm not involved in law enforcement in any way , so I do n't really know that I have anything to say . "
Asked whether Mangum 's arrest gave him any new regrets about prosecuting the Duke students , Nifong sighed audibly and said , " I do n't really have any comment for you at all on this " and hung up .
Brooklyn law professor K.C. Johnson , a legal blogger whose exhaustive , daily coverage of the case produced one caustic critique of the D.A 's prosecution after another , said on Thursday that Mangum 's arrest could revive one the last remaining mysteries of the case – the contents of Mangum 's 1000 - page mental health file .
Nifong had access to the file throughout the case , but it was only turned over to defense lawyers by the judge , under seal , late in the case .
It 's contents have never been disclosed publicly .
" If this case against Mangum goes to trial , one likely avenue of defense would be mental health impairment , so we might finally learn just how serious Mangum 's mental health problems , which Mike Nifong ignored to bring his case , actually were , " Johnson told ABC News ' Law & Justice Unit .
Adm Ozer Karabulut is among those accused of plotting a coup Twenty military officers have been formally charged in Turkey with attempting to overthrow the government .
They include four admirals , a general and two colonels , some of them retired .
The men were among more than 40 officers arrested on Monday over an alleged 2003 plot to stir up chaos in Turkey and justify a military coup .
The head of the armed forces , General Ilker Basbug , will meet the country 's prime minister and president later to discuss the alleged plot and arrests .
The meeting was called after the country 's top generals and admirals met at short notice on Tuesday to evaluate what the military called a " serious situation " .
' Sledgehammer ' plot ?
The scale of Monday 's operation against the military was unprecedented and increased the tension between the government and the armed forces .
Dozens of current or former members of the military have been arrested in the past few years over similar plot allegations , and some have been charged .
The generals believe the AK Party has a hidden agenda to subvert the country 's secular system
Roger Hardy
BBC regional analyst
Turkish military faces crossroads
This is now turning into a critical test of the government 's authority over the military , says the BBC 's Jonathan Head in Istanbul .
Never before have so many senior officers faced charges like this in a civilian court .
The charged men were arrested over the so - called " sledgehammer " plot , which reportedly dates back to 2003 .
Reports of the alleged plot first surfaced in the liberal Taraf newspaper , which said it had discovered documents detailing plans to bomb two Istanbul mosques and provoke Greece into shooting down a Turkish plane over the Aegean Sea .
The army has said the plans had been discussed but only as part of a planning exercise at a military seminar .
The alleged plot is similar , and possibly linked , to the reported Ergenekon conspiracy , in which military figures and staunch secularists allegedly planned to foment unrest , leading to a coup .
Scores of people , including military officers , journalists and academics , are on trial in connection with that case .
' Power struggle '
Analysts say the crackdown on the military would have been unthinkable only a few years ago .
HOW 'COUP PLOTS ' EMERGED June 2007 : Cache of explosives discovered ; ex-soldiers detained July 2008 : 20 arrested , including two ex-generals and a senior journalist , for " planning political disturbances and trying to organise a coup " July 2008 : Governing AK Party narrowly escapes court ban October 2008 : 86 go on trial charged with " Ergenekon " coup plot July 2009 : 56 in dock as second trial opens Jan 2010 : Taraf newspaper reports 2003 " sledgehammer " plot to provoke coup Feb 2010 : More than 40 officers arrested over " sledgehammer " ; 20 charged
The army has regarded itself as the guardian of a secular Turkish state .
It has overthrown or forced the resignation of four governments since 1960 - the last time in 1997 .
But the power of the army has been eroded in recent years , with Turkey enacting reforms designed to prepare it for entry to the European Union .
And General Ilker Basbug , the head of the army , has insisted that coups in Turkey are a thing of the past .
Many
Turks regard the cases as the latest stage in an ongoing power struggle between Turkey 's secular nationalist establishment and the governing AK Party .
Critics believe the Ergenekon and sledgehammer investigations are simply attempts to silence the government 's political and military opponents .
The AK Party has its roots in political Islam , and is accused by some nationalists of having secret plans to turn staunchly secular Turkey into an Islamic state .
The government rejects those claims , saying its intention is to modernise Turkey and move it closer to EU membership .

How I started playing Crawl , and the early history of the Stone Soup project .
In the winter of 2002 , I had large amounts of free time at my job , and I spent it in two ways : reading books and playing roguelikes .
I ’d played a lot of NetHack , but I ’d reached a point where the game was quite easy and boring , and I was looking for a new roguelike to play .
It was n’t that roguelikes were the only games that interested me , but they possess several features that make them perfect for playing at work .
Looking for fresh material , I saw a mention of Crawl on Erik Inge Bolsø ’s site Balrog .
The description looked interesting , so I downloaded Crawl b24 and took it for a spin .
My first game started with a kobold shouting at me , which I found odd .
The tiny map display made me feel claustrophobic , and the constant scrolling of the map was disorienting .
The game ended rather abruptly soon after it started .
I do n’t recall what killed me , but the overall experience quenched my interest in Crawl for a while .
I tried Adom and played enough to score a bug - temple - abused win or two , but it was a little too story - heavy to hold my interest for long .
I ’m all in favour of rescuing mad carpenters in moderate quantities for humanitarian reasons , but starting every game by rescuing eccentric carpenters palled on me quickly .
There was also a regrettable incident when I read a description on herb farming in the bigroom in Andy Williams ’
Guidebook , and spent the next several hours of my life in a glazed zombie - like trance accumulating absurd stockpiles of stomafillia herbs .
Adom has numerous fine qualities , notably its beautiful locations , but my lack of self - control in the face of its numerous encouragements to farm meant that playing it involved terrifying amounts of self - inflicted brain damage .
Still looking for new games , I decided I could n’t get into Angband or Tome ( I kept getting beaten up by things in town , and the non-persistent levels bothered me strangely ) , and after dabbling in some of the lesser known roguelikes , I came back to Crawl .
The quotes page ( http://www.dungeoncrawl.org/?l.q) had interesting endorsements , and I decided it was time to find out just how accurate they were .
I bit the bullet , endured the constant scrolling and the postage - stamp - sized map display , and discovered a wonderful game .
I played summoners and was thrilled that my friendly white imps could use their frost spell , unlike NetHack where pets are dumb things that magically lose all their fun abilities when tamed .
I played enchanters , and the first time I used enslavement on an orc sorcerer in the Mines , I could n’t stop laughing for half an hour .
One thing did niggle at me a lot , though .
When moving around on a level , I kept getting lost in the winding corridors .
If I wanted to go downstairs after clearing a level , I ’d have to keep hitting ‘ X ’ to look at the level map , figure out my next few moves towards the stairs , then go back to the main screen and trace the steps I remembered from the map .
It seemed like it would be so much more convenient if I could just move the cursor to the place I wanted to go on the ‘ X ’ level map and hit Enter to go there .
I ’d already seen travel in NetHack , I ’d found it handy there , and it would obviously be even more useful in Crawl , with its large levels and tiny map display .
So one evening after work I decided to hack a travel command into Crawl .
I was happily ignorant of pathfinding algorithms at the time , and I decided to use NetHack ’s ( NetHack uses Dijkstra ’s ) .
This was also the first time I ’d looked at Crawl ’s source , and after cautiously poking at various bits and going “ Ohh , so that ’s what that does ! ” , I shoehorned most of the travel code into acr.cc .
I was n’t very proud of shoveling the travel code into acr.cc , which had apparently suffered much punishment over the years and looked like a sad , whipped , source file , but I thought it would serve as a starting point .
It was amazing how much that one small change ( travel ) improved the playability of the game .
I also made some minor tweaks to other settings , including an implementation of Roderick Schertler ’s pickup_thrown patch for NetHack , and a change in similar vein to autopickup to ignore items that the player had previously dropped , and decided to share these patches with the Crawl community .
At the time ( 2003 ) , most Crawl players hung out on the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.roguelike.misc .
I believe there was IRC discussion even at this point , but it was minor ; I ’d certainly never heard of IRC discussion .
The Crawl devteam apparently collaborated by email and on Yahoo groups mailing lists , but i was unaware of this at the time , so I announced my patch only on rgrmisc :
http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.misc/msg/0433064b9d36786c
The patch proved popular , so I asked the NetHack team for permission to use the travel code under the terms of the Crawl license , which was almost , but not quite , identical to the NetHack license , and Warwick Allison graciously agreed .
Players suggested new features , and I experimented with a minor riff on travel to create autoexplore .
For a while I was unsure that I actually liked autoexplore , but other players seemed to enjoy it , and then I got used to it too . :-)
I was discussing Crawl in email with another ex-NetHacker , Tina Hall , when she mentioned how tedious it was to keep track of items in stashes — she actually took notes outside the game .
After a few discussions on how this could be improved , I added a first cut at a feature to track stashed items to the patch .
The early stash - tracker looked almost nothing like its modern self — you could n’t search for items using ^F , you could n’t travel to items directly ( travel between levels with G was n’t around yet ) .
The only way to use the stash - tracker in its first incarnation was to make a character dump and grovel around in the .lst file it created to find items you wanted .
For a while I was n’t sure if the stash - tracker was worth keeping , and toyed with throwing it out entirely , but Tina insisted that it was useful and convinced me to keep it around . :-)
In all this time , official Crawl development seemed to barely advance at all .
I ’d started playing Crawl with 4.0 beta 24 , and I ’d seen beta 25 and 26 soon after , but nothing beyond b26 .
In the meantime , I kept working on the Patch ( which players dubbed the Travel patch , after its signature feature ) , improving it based on player suggestions .
Real interlevel travel ( ^G ) made it into the patch in May 2004 .
It took me a while longer to make the stash tracker searchable and integrate it with interlevel travel ( Oct 2005 ) , but in my defense I ’d changed jobs and my new job kept me a lot busier than the lazy years of 2002 / 2003 . :-)
After the long , slumbrous reign of 4.0 b26 , Crawl maintainer Brent Ross announced that an alpha version of the next Crawl release ( 4.1 ) was available for players to look at in Jul 2005 .
4.1 was new and excitingly different from b26 .
I spent a feverish couple of days porting the Travel patch ( by now a massive beast ) to work with 4.1 .
Brent accepted the travel patch and merged it into the Crawl 4.1 svn repository , which thrilled me to bits .
Back in 2001 and 2002 , when I was playing NetHack , I ’d written a NetHack patch or two , to general indifference , so being able to actually contribute to Crawl was a huge , pleasant change .
Brent had made a lot of improvements to 4.1 .
The old , nightmarishly ugly view code that gave me such trouble writing the initial travel patch was gone , replaced with a much cleaner view layer .
Brent also repaired the mutation system and overhauled all the crufty layers of combat code .
Where Crawl 4.0 was ugly , 4.1 was beautiful .
There was just one problem : 4.1 ′s gameplay and balance was nothing like 4.0 .
The early game was too easy for fighters , too hard for spellcasters .
The mid -game was brutally hard for all characters , and the sight of a monster wearing a shield in 4.1 was enough to make the best Crawl player cringe , because you knew almost * nothing * was going to get past that shield . :-)
Brent fixed some of the balance problems in 4.1 , but he was also very busy and had little time to work on Crawl , so development languished after he released the 4.1.2 alpha .
Months passed , it began to look as if Brent might never get back to Crawl development , and it was obvious nobody else was working on it .
All through the long b26 days , I ’d rarely been troubled by the lack of visible Crawl development , but now with 4.1.2 out there , it was obvious that I ’d been missing out .
4.1 was loaded with good stuff , but the game was n’t really playable .
I ’d won a fair few Crawl games by then , but I was n’t good enough to get far in 4.1 .
Since Brent had apparently retired , I decided that I should try my hand at fixing 4.1 to be more playable .
I did n’t trust my judgement of game balance issues much , so I asked Erik Piper — a very cool person , and the best Crawl player I knew — whether he could help me to analyse and rebalance 4.1 .
Erik agreed , and we got together and worked on 4.1 for a while .
After a couple of weeks wrestling with 4.1 , it was obvious to us that too many things had changed in 4.1 for it to be easy to rebalance .
We began to reconsider whether fixing 4.1 was the best approach .
At this point , Martin Read suggested on rgrmisc that it might be better to start with 4.0 b26 and gradually add new features from 4.1 , instead of trying to fix 4.1 outright , and Erik and I agreed that this was the way to go .
So back we went , Erik and I , in the summer of 2006 , to 4.0 b26 as the basis for development .
Erik thought we needed a codename for the project , and he proposed we call it “ Stone Soup ” .
Stone Soup progressed quickly , since we had a rich larder of good ideas in the 4.1 alphas .
Erik picked the things we should lift , and I hacked them into the b26 codebase , cleaning up code where possible .
Since I ’d mainly focussed on user interface changes up to that point , I was not familiar with the core gameplay code such as combat and spellcasting , which meant that I made several amusing mistakes in the 4.1 imports .
Initially , Erik and I worked more or less in secret on Stone Soup , because we were n’t sure if we ’d be able to make a worthwhile release , and we did n’t want to announce ambitious plans on rgrmisc and disappoint everyone later .
I was pretty hopeful that once we had a decent first release , we ’d be able to find more players to help us out , because there were other people on rgrmisc who looked interested in contributing to Crawl , including Haran Pilpel , who had written an excellent patch adding Angband - style inscriptions to Crawl .
I also exchanged a few emails with David P. , who I knew from rgrn , and who was enthusiastic for Crawl development to keep moving .
Eventually , Erik and I decided that we had enough material to make a first release of Stone Soup and see how it was received .
A little before the 4.1 alpha release discussion , two gentlemen ( Nat Lanza and Peter Berger ) had started a Sourceforge project ( crawl - ref ) to revive Crawl development .
It seemed logical to join forces with them and host Stone Soup on the crawl - ref Sourceforge project instead of starting a brand new Sourceforge project .
We asked Nat and Peter if they wanted to collaborate on DCSS , and they agreed .
And so it began , and Stone Soup was officially launched with Erik ’s announcement :
http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.misc/msg/4d0676b75dea067c
Players seemed happy with the release , despite the rough edges ( I still did n’t know much about the code : P ) .
I was delighted at how well DCSS was received , but at that point Erik and I were spending unsustainable amounts of time working on Crawl , and we desperately needed more developers to lighten the load .
I asked Haran Pilpel if he would be interested in joining the team , and to my delight , he accepted .
Haran integrated the inscription patch and cleaned up a lot of the uglier stretches of code .
Stone Soup kept growing , and Crawl players kept contributing to development .
We soon invited David P. to join the team and he did a lot of good work organising and rewriting the documentation and simplifying the knotted mess of .crawlrc options .
On a long weekend ’s Crawl - hacking , I came upon the monstrosity that was b26′s maps.cc .
All the special levels in Crawl were scrunched up in maps.cc , each in a function , described as arrays of string constants , a perfectly horrific mess to edit .
I ’d seen how NetHack handled special levels , with a special .des file format and a compiler that translated those into maps that the game could use , so I tried my hand at implementing something similar for Crawl .
I was handicapped by not knowing anything about lex and yacc , but eventually I beat them into submission and Crawl ’s level compiler was born .
I liked the existing vaults and special levels and wanted more , but after a few pathetic attempts at creating new levels , I gave up and asked the team if they would like to try .
Happily David and Erik were good at the vault - design thing . :-)
By December 2006 , Stone Soup development was warming up , and it looked like Stone Soup might actually be self - sustaining .
I was much prone to vanity Googling at this time , looking for kind mentions of Stone Soup on the internet that I could revel in .
One such search turned up a public telnet server for Stone Soup 0.1.5 , run by Rachel Elizabeth Dillon ( raxvulpine / rax on IRC ) .
I should mention here that I ’d never actually played a game on a public telnet server before .
Back in my NetHack days , I was aware of the existence of public telnet servers , but the average ping time to US servers from India in 2001 was around 800 ms , which made it impossibly painful to play games online .
5 years later , in 2006 , my ping time to rax ’s server ( now crawl.akrasiac.org , at that time yiff.
mit.edu ) was a very playable 300 ms .
I let out a whoop of joy and dived in .
Telnet play was intoxicating .
I could meet interesting ghosts , compete for high scores and watch other games .
I loved it and pretty soon , I could not play games offline at all .
( I have not played a non-wizmode Crawl game offline since akrasiac was launched ) .
CAO was the best technical change to happen to Stone Soup development .
It gave us great playtesting feedback , we could diagnose bugs easily by looking at ttyrecs , and Rachel gave us a lot of feedback on making Crawl play well with dgamelaunch .
One problem we still had , though , was testing Crawl before official releases .
The second major Stone Soup release ( 0.2 ) was a buggy disaster ( I was * really * not familiar with some of the code I messed with : P ) that needed several emergency point releases to fix bad crashes .
Happily , Marc Thoben expressed interest in running another public server to host development releases , and started the crawl.develz.org server .
Since CDO ’s arrival , new Crawl releases are much better tested , since CDO always runs the latest development code and players can find bugs much earlier in the development cycle .
Stone Soup has gone from strength to strength since its early days .
After the 0.3 release ( late 2007 ) , I joined a startup that gave me much less free time to spend on Crawl , and David P. aka dpeg took the helm .
Crawl has progressed hugely under dpeg ’s guidance , lots of good new developers have joined the team , and every new release has greatly improved on its predecessors .
Enne Walker , the author of the tiles port ( building on Mitsuhiro Itakura ’s tiles port for b26 ) joined the team in 2007 , bringing official tiles support to Stone Soup .
Now , in 2010 , I think Stone Soup is one of the best roguelikes available , and one of the all - round best games to play , period .
I still really enjoy my games of Crawl , nearly eight years after I started playing the game , and there are DCSS developers who started playing Crawl even before I did .
We have a great game in Stone Soup , probably the best development team and the most enthusiastic and involved player community in the roguelike world , and I ’m sure DCSS has great days ahead of it , with 0.6 and beyond .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - A computer security expert has uncovered what he says are flaws in widely used software from Oracle Corp that could let hackers remotely access sensitive information in corporate and government databases .
A bug in the design of the Oracle database -- the world ’s top - selling software for storing electronic information -- could allow hackers to break into private databases via the Internet , said David Litchfield , chief research scientist of NGSSoftware Ltd , a UK - based computer security company .
“ It allows an attacker without a user ID and password to take complete control .
All firewalls become irrelevant , ” Litchfield said on Wednesday after presenting his research at the Black Hat hacking conference in Washington .
Litchfield said that he warned Oracle of the problem in November , hoping that the company would fix the flaw when it issued a group of quarterly security patches in January .
He said that he decided to go public because Oracle failed to do so .
Officials with Oracle declined comment on the matter .
Litchfield said that he believes about nine out of every 10 Oracle databases are vulnerable to attack .
He said it is possible to change the default settings on Oracle ’s software to thwart potential hackers looking to exploit the vulnerability .
He added that it was impossible to say whether any hackers had actually exploited the flaw to illegally break into a database .
“ It ’s odd , and there is no technical explanation for it , ” the senior administration official said at a briefing .
“ There must be some other explanation . ”
He and other Obama administration officials declined to speculate why the Iranians would deliberately place their stockpile in a place where , with relatively little effort , Israel or another country could strike it .
The report also indicated that for the first time Iran told inspectors it was preparing to make its uranium into a metallic form  a step that can be explained by some civilian applications , but is widely viewed as necessary for making the core of an atom bomb .
The report does not say what explanation the Iranians offered , if any , for the activity , other than general research and development .
Mr. Amano ’s attitude toward Iran is being closely watched ; some officials were concerned that he would be unwilling to confront the Iranians directly in his first months in office .
But as one American official said Thursday , “ It ’s been clear to us that he recognizes the severity of what ’s going on . ”
In fact , the report detailed Iran ’s past commitments to stop enriching uranium , its decision to go ahead and its refusal to comply with a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding that it halt its work .
It also detailed questions Iran has refused to answer about evidence that it may have worked on the difficult problems of developing a warhead small enough to fit on a missile .
“ Since August 2008 , Iran has declined to discuss the above issues with the agency or to provide any further information and access ” to locations and scientists , the report said .
“ Altogether , ” it said , the accumulated evidence of weapons work and lack of explanatory cooperation “ raises concerns about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile . ”
A Washington ethics watchdog is asking President Obama and members of Congress not to attend a National Prayer Breakfast this week , saying the event is being organized by a “ shadowy ” Christian conservative group for the purposes of recruiting new members .
The event , to take place Thursday morning , is being organized by the Fellowship Foundation , also known as “ the Family , ” a group that has been linked to a proposed Ugandan anti-gay law that would see HIV - positive men face the death penalty .

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington says the meeting is being organized to look falsely like a government - sponsored event .
“ The breakfast , designed to appear as if government - sanctioned , actually serves as a meeting and recruiting event for the shadowy Fellowship Foundation , ” says a statement from CREW .
“ The Fellowship … is run by Doug Coe , a spiritual advisor to past government officials who uses the organization to push his unorthodox brand of Christianity within government circles . ”
Adele M. Stan at AlterNet reports that President Obama is scheduled to appear at this year ’s prayer breakfast .
The White House has not yet responded to CREW ’s request , reports Arthur Delaney at the Huffington Post .
The Fellowship Foundation ’s image suffered last year when no less than three Republican lawmakers were linked to its C Street House , a boarding house and meeting place for Christian conservative lawmakers that is run by Youth With A Mission , a group affiliated with the Fellowship .
Among the lawmakers with links to the C Street House are Sen. John Ensign ( R - NV ) , who is alleged to have had an affair with an aide of his ; South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , who last year admitted to absconding from the state to meet his Argentinian mistress ; and former House Rep. Chip Pickering ( R - MS ) , whose ex-wife has alleged infidelity on his part .
ADVERTISEMENT
But perhaps the largest hit to the group ’s reputation came last fall , when some of its members were linked to a proposed law in Uganda that would see HIV - positive homosexuals sentenced to death .
News reports indicate that the Ugandan authors and principal backers of that law are members of the Fellowship .
And it was reportedly at a Ugandan National Prayer Breakfast in 2008 that the law was first proposed .
News reports suggest Sen. James Inhofe ( R - OK ) , a member of the Fellowship , may have been present at that meeting .
Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington states :

The organization operates under an intense veil of secrecy , staying largely out of the public eye and hiding its donors ’ identities .
The Fellowship has used its government clout to facilitate backdoor meetings between U.S. and foreign officials , improperly claimed tax exempt status for the C Street House , and has persuaded members of Congress , including Sen. James Inhofe ( R - OK ) to conduct Fellowship - sanctioned evangelizing while traveling at taxpayer expense .
The National Prayer Breakfast has been an annual event in Washington since 1953 , but it rose to new prominence during the administration of George W. Bush , who built a political identity around his Christian conservatism .

Last week I discovered this website : http://www.skytopia.com/project/fractal/mandelbulb.html.
It describes a new way of rendering 3D Mandelbrot fractals using three components simplex numbers , instead of the traditional 4D Quaternion .
This new function produces a lot more interesting 3D fractal details and lead to very impresive renderings .
I have implemented this function as a GPU producer into GigaVoxels and I am able to render it in real - time as you can see on this video .
It is a work - in - progress , but it already works quite well !
( around 20FPS )
The fractal is computed on the GPU , not during the ray - casting as usually done , but as voxels stored into an Octree .
Voxels are produced on - the - fly and stored into a cache in video memory in order to be reused while they stay visible .
The octree is also subdivided on - the - fly and the subdivision is triggered directly by the ray - casting kernel .
That prevents to generate any occluded data .
I compute Ambient Occlusion very efficiently using filtered low resolution voxels and soft shadows are computed with secondary rays .
Better quality video files can be downloaded there : GigaBroccoli1.avi GigaBroccoli2.avi
But instead of the wrecking ball that Bruce Springsteen sang about , a crane with a claw is taking bites out of the stadium 's top sections .
Clouds of dust drifted in the air as concrete and steel fell to the ground .
About a dozen construction workers at the nearby new stadium watched the demolition .
The 34 - year - old venue has played host to the Giants , the Jets , the Cosmos , the MetroStars and the Red Bulls .
Everything from seats to pieces of turf are being sold .
The new stadium will seat 82,500 fans , including 9,500 club seats and 222 luxury suites .
It will be the NFL 's third - largest stadium .
A Bon Jovi concert in late May will officially open the stadium .

This “ Anomaly Map ” was produced for the most recent month at the NASA / GISS web site here :
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/maps/
You can create many maps , and many of them will not show The Bolivia Effect as well as this one ( while some may be better ) .
This map was not “ cherry picked ” , it is just the most recent month with data available .
It does , however , have a very nice example of The Bolivia Effect in it .
( At least 2 , in fact ) .
UPDATE : I ’ve made a comparison map that uses a 1881 - 1990 ‘ baseline ’ ( i.e. all but the most recent decade ) of data and that only uses a 250 km ‘ smoothing ’ .
I ’d have liked to have used a 0 km smoothing so you could see just how small an area is really covered , but GISS only let you do 250 km at the smallest .
Notice how much of this map is grey .
We just do n’t have the data .
Notice too that you can clearly see the Canadian warmth is in an arc around the population centers and down toward the warmer south .
The “ in fill ” has to come from somewhere …
And we still have “ the Bolivia Effect ” .
BTW , that arctic red is questionable at best ( they use interpolated estimates from ice estimates in the Arctic ) but at least we can see that Northern Canada is empty as is much of Africa and the heart of South America .
Oh , and notice all those yellow island spots ?
Those are the airports on each of those islands …
For comparison , here is the 1981 - 1990 baseline chart :
Alright Already , what is this Bolivia Effect ?
Notice that nice rosy red over the top of Bolivia ?
Bolivia is that country near , but not on , the coast just about half way up the Pacific Ocean side .
It has a patch of high cold Andes Mountains where most of the population live .
It ’s the patch of yellow / whitish mountains near the top in this picture :
South American Andes
We originally saw this picture , and this problem , in this posting :
https://chiefio.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/ghcn-south-america-andes-what-andes/
One Small Problem with the anomally map .
There has not been any thermometer data for Bolivia in GHCN since 1990 .
None . Nada . Zip. Zilch .
Nothing .
Empty Set .
So just how can it be so Hot Hot Hot ! in Bolivia if there is NO data from the last 20 years ?
Easy .
GIStemp “ makes it up ” from “ nearby ” thermometers up to 1200 km away .
So what is within 1200 km of Bolivia ?
The beaches of Chili , Peru and the Amazon Jungle .
Not exactly the same as snow capped peaks and high cold desert , but hey , you gotta make do with what you have , you know ?
( The official excuse given is that the data acceptance window closes on one day of the month and Bolivia does not report until after that date .
Oh , and they never ever would want to go back and add date into the past after a close date .
Yet they are happy to fiddle with , adjust , modify , and wholesale change and delete old data as they change their adjustment methods … )
The eastern side of Bolivia grades down into semi-tropical and eventually into the Amazon .
More details on the climate of Bolivia can be found on this link that has a nice graphic as well .
http://www.travel-bolivia.com/bolivia-climate.html
The description of the mountain portion includes :
The Altiplano Region typically has a chilly climate and is considered to have a semi-arid climate .
Since it is at a high altitude the thin air retains little heat and the air is typically dry , with cool temperatures and strong cold winds that can sweep over the region .
From the wiki page we have :
The geography of Bolivia is unique among the nations of South America .
Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries on the continent , and also has the highest average altitude .
The main features of Bolivia ’s geography include the Altiplano , a highland plateau of the Andes , and Lake Titicaca ( Lago Titicaca ) , the largest lake in South America and the highest commercially navigable lake on Earth ( which it shares with Peru ) .
and
Temperatures and rainfall amounts in mountain areas vary considerably .
The Yungas , where the moist northeast trade winds are pushed up by the mountains , is the cloudiest , most humid , and rainiest area , receiving up to 152 cm ( 60 in ) annually .
Sheltered valleys and basins throughout the Cordillera Oriental have mild temperatures and moderate rainfall amounts , averaging from 64 cm ( 25 in ) to 76 cm ( 30 in ) annually .
Temperatures drop with increasing elevation , however .
Snowfall is possible at elevations above 2,000 m ( 6,562 ft ) , and the permanent snow line is at 4,600 m ( 15,092 ft ) .
Areas over 5,500 m ( 18,045 ft ) have a polar climate , with glaciated zones .
The Cordillera Occidental is a high desert with cold , windswept peaks .
If you do not have thermometers in those high cold parts , you are not measuring correctly .
Though I am surpised that they did not keep a thermometer or two on the eastern side of the country with tropical exposure :
The eastern lowlands include all of Bolivia north and east of the Andes . [ … ] the region is sparsely populated and , until recently , has played a minor role in the economy .
Differences in topography and climate separate the lowlands into three areas .
The flat northern area , made up of Beni and Pando departments and the northern part of Cochabamba Department , consists of rainforest .
Because much of the topsoil is underlain by claypan , drainage is poor , and heavy rainfall periodically converts vast parts of the region to swamp .
Maybe it ’s that lack of people and swamp thing …
Canada
What about that other red spot in the middle of Canada ?
Yup , you guessed it .
No thermometers survive north of 65 degrees in recent GHCN data in Yukon and The Northwest Territories , and only one survives in Nunavut ( at the northern edge of Canada , but in a location called The Garden Spot of the Arctic due to the unusual warmth of the area allowing a variety of plants and animals to survive there that do not survive elsewhere .
In both these cases , there is real data in the baseline period , but the current temperatures must be created from somewhere else .
We took an in depth look at those thermometer deletions in this posting :
https://chiefio.wordpress.com/2009/10/27/ghcn-up-north-blame-canada-comrade/
Which included this description ( from the wiki page ) of the only surviving thermometer in Northern Canada , at the weather station in Eureka :
“ Eureka has been described as “ The Garden Spot of the Arctic ” due to the flora and fauna abundant around the Eureka area , more so than anywhere else in the High Arctic . ” …
Further down , under “ Climate ” it says :
“ Winters are frigid , but summers are slightly warmer than at other places in the Canadian Arctic . ”
The station is on the coast near water .
Water , as we know , serves to moderate extremes of temperature .
There is a nice picture of it , showing the ocean in the background , on the above link , if you wish to see it .
Arctic Red is What Again ?
How about all that Red in the Arctic ?
Well , no surprise , there are no thermometers up there .
Yes , all that red across the top is fiction .
It is called “ estimation ” based on ice estimates and “ interpolation ” and even “ the reference station method ” but in the end it all comes down to “ just made up ” .
So when you look at one of these Anomaly Maps , the “ highest and best use ” that I have found for those rosy red patches is to find those places where there have been abuses of the thermometers ( such as in Morocco where they move from the coast , near cool ocean currents , to the Atlas Mountains , on the edge of the Sahara Desert ) or where they have been deleted from High Cold Places ( such as Bolivia ) , or where there are simply none at all ( such as the Arctic ) .
Bolivian Data
This is a listing of the “ By Altitude ” report for Bolivia , so you can see for yourself that there are data in the “ baseline ” period used by GIStemp , but there is no data since 1990 .
Why does a “ by altitude ” report matter ?
Again , from the wiki page about Bolivia :
Climate : varies with altitude ; humid and tropical to cold and semiarid
Terrain : rugged Andes Mountains with a highland plateau ( Altiplano ) , hills , lowland plains of the Amazon Basin .
Change the altitude of the thermometers and you change the climate you are measuring .
Yes , that is “ man made climate change ” I can believe in . ;-)
This report shows the percentage of thermometers in any given altitude band ( in meters ) .
So we see that Bolivia began with 25 % of it ’s thermometers above 2000 meters ( in the snow zone ) and with 75 % between 500 and 1000 meters in the decade ending in 1919 .
It ended with 100 % of them at that 2000 meter + altitude in the last reported year of 1990 .
The GHCN " By Altitude " report for Bolivia , Country Code 302 : Year - MSL 20 50 100 200 300 400 500 1000 2000 Space DAltPct : 1919 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 75.0 0.0 25.0 0.0 DAltPct : 1929 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 50.0 0.0 50.0 0.0 DAltPct : 1939 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 9.1 0.0 90.9 0.0 DAltPct : 1949 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 27.6 0.0 0.0 72.4 0.0 DAltPct : 1959 0.0 0.0 0.0 18.5 23.9 0.0 20.8 10.0 0.0 26.6 0.0 DAltPct : 1969 0.0 0.0 0.0 20.5 21.8 0.0 16.2 13.0 2.6 26.0 0.0 DAltPct : 1979 0.0 0.0 0.0 23.1 15.7 0.0 14.0 12.5 6.2 28.4 0.0 DAltPct : 1989 0.0 0.0 0.0 23.3 17.3 0.0 16.4 12.4 3.6 27.0 0.0 DAltPct : 1990 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0100.0 0.0 For COUNTRY CODE : 302
Notice that while one thermometer level manages to straggle into 1990 , it gets shot that year ( or the “ decade ending ” would have had a later year – by default I end the decade counts in years ending in “ 9 ” so 0 - 9 end up in one decade average together ; unless you run out of records … )
It is very hard to have “ warming ” with no data , but somehow GIStemp , with GHCN , manages to do just that .
I guess Bolivia is somehow magical , so I just call it “ The Bolivia Effect ” … and it is warming the planet .
For now , sure you might be thinking of canceling your cable service for a steady diet of Netflix .
But Edward Jay Epstein explains why movie studio economics are crumpling the red envelope 's dreams of being the next HBO .
Netflix , through the simple device using the post office to bypass video stores , has become one of the great success stories of the new entertainment economy .
It now has 11.8 million subscribers who pay a monthly flat fee for an unlimited number of rentals .
It gets its DVDS from wholesalers and even retail stores .
It can then rent them because of a court - approved " first sale doctrine , " which says that once a person buys a DVD , he can re-sell it or rent it out .
Last year Netflix took in $ 1.67 billion in subscription fees , but because of the high cost of mailing some 2 million discs a day from 50 distribution centers , it only eked out a profit of $ 115 million .
So it is moving onto the Internet , substituting digital streamed movies for ones that are delivered by the postman .
Subscribers get them on their TV via a set top box or game console without any additional charge .
This " Watch Instantly " service effectively creates a virtual channel that directly compete with Pay - TV for the wallet and clock of viewers .
Such a challenge by Netflix could also result , as Frank Biondi the former head of HBO , terms it , " a terminal career decision if you get it wrong . "
The problem is that the first sales doctrine does not apply to streaming or downloading DVDS so Netflix must buy digital rights , which is exceedingly expensive for new titles .
In late 2008 , Netflix found a temporary way around this stumbling block by making a deal with Starz Entertainment , a subsidiary of John Malone 's Liberty Media , to sub-license the streaming rights of the titles it had obtained from Disney , Sony and smaller studios in output deals .
Starz held it could sub-license these rights because Netflix was merely a " content aggregator , " but the studios took a dimmer view of this loophole .
Disney , according to a top executive involved in the dispute , has warned Starz that it will not renew its output deal ( which expires in 2012 ) unless it either cuts Netflix out or pays Disney a rich premium .
Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos portrays the issue as merely a communication glitch , saying , " We have to fight against their fear that we~ll destroy the ecosystem . "
Despite this well - meaning new - age talk , what is really at stake here is old - fashioned money .
The most profitable part of Hollywood 's " ecosystem " is the output deals through which studios license movies to Pay TV channels , cable networks and broadcast stations .
According to the studios 's internal all - source revenue numbers , the six major studio took in $ 16.2 billion from pay - TV and television licensing of their movies in 2007 , which was almost all profit .
So the threat of sub - licensing for Internet circulation involves a good more than studio paranoia .
As for HBO , a subsidiary of Time Warner , it is the undisputed leviathan of Pay - TV .
It has over 40 million subscribers , $ 4 billion in revenues , and a cash flow of $ 1.3 billion .
And , unlike Netflix , it owns the digital rights to a large amount of exclusive material , much of which it produced .
Over the past decade it invested heavily in original programming , creating such series as The Sopranos ( which cost $ 2 million an episode ) to retain subscribers .
This made economic sense because cable systems paid it about $ 6 a month for each subscriber .
As a top Time Warner executive who had authorized much of this original production explained to me , the name of the game is subscriber retention .
So HBO is not about to cede cyberspace to Netflix .
It 's in the process of rolling out an Internet service called HBO
Go which will allow all HBO subscribers to get , as the executive puts it , " anything they want to see , anytime , anywhere , over their laptop , Iphone , tablet , Playstation . "
Bolstered by its exclusive content , HBO will initially offer some 800 hours a month of programming a month .
Its 40 million subscribers can get at no additional charge over the Internet the linenew titles HBO acquires through its output deals with Warner Bros , Fox , and Dreamworks , past and present original series , HBO boxing , and even so - called " late night " fare such as Alien Sex Files .
Netflix , on the other hand , has almost no exclusive content with which to compete with HBO .
Back in 2006 , it attempted to produce its own original content through a subsidiary called Red Envelope Entertainment , but closed it down in 2008 .
The brutal reality is that Netflix , with only one - eighth the cash flow of HBO , does not have the scale to produce its own material .
Of course , whether or not the Starz deal is renewed , Netflix can exclusively license programming through output deals .
But competing in this game , in which the licenses for a slate of two dozen movies can cost in excess of a quarter of a billion dollars , could prove prohibitively expensive .
Last year Netflix reportedly spent $ 100 million on licensing just non-exclusive rights to movies for streaming from Starz and studio libraries .
Although this saved postage , Netflix still has to pay the overhead for its distribution centers .
Adding hundreds of millions of dollars in output deals to this equation could wipe out much , if not all , of its profits .
Netflix has brilliantly carved out for itself a niche audience who largely enjoy the convenience of receiving older movies , which accounts for about two - thirds of its revenue .
It will no doubt continue to satisfy and expand this audience via mailing and streaming .
But what it lacks is the wherewithal to do is to replace HBO .
Edward Jay Epstein is the author of 14 books , including two examining the movie business : The Hollywood Economist : The Reality Behind The Movie Business will be published by Melville House later this month , which follows his 2005 book The Big Picture : Money and Power in Hollywood .

One of the more interesting knock - ons of the opportunistic IPCC reliance on WWF and similar “ authorities ” is that it may compromise the ability of the U.S. EPA to argue that IPCC peer review meets the statutory standards required of EPA peer review .
In this respect , I refer to the Climate Audit submission to EPA last June , which considered this specific issue in considerable detail .
See submission here , covering post here and first post on the topic here .
Here is an excerpt from the introduction to my submission :
2 . The EPA elected to rely “ heavily ” on “ existing ” scientific assessments carried out by external parties .
EPA guidelines and policies establish procedures which EPA is required to comply with , prior to utilizing scientific assessments carried out by external parties , including international bodies .
These procedures include the submission of the scientific assessment by the external party to EPA together with its peer review record and the evaluation of the submission by EPA officials to evaluate the scientific content and the external party ’s peer review process .
The TSD failed to state that EPA complied with these procedures and there is considerable evidence that EPA did not do so .
3 . Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) has a peer review process , their peer review process does not comply with the OMB and EPA policies for highly influential scientific assessments in many important respects , including , without limitation , non-compliance in the provision of data to reviewers and transparency .
Had the EPA actually carried out the examination of IPCC peer review policy that is required prior to EPA use , it would undoubtedly have identified these and other shortcomings .
In the submission , I reviewed relevant EPA policies on peer review and showed that IPCC peer review did not comply with statutory requirements for EPA peer review .
This was based on my knowledge of IPCC peer review at that time , which was primarily the handling of chapter 6 of WG1 .
The peer review process for WG2 appears to be even worse .
David Rose in yesterday ’s Daily Mail reported that IPCC Coordinating Lead Author Lal knew the glacier claim did not rest on peer - reviewed research , but put it in anyway to “ encourage ” governments to take “ concrete action ” :
Dr Murari Lal also said he was well aware the statement , in the 2007 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , did not rest on peer - reviewed scientific research .
In an interview with The Mail on Sunday , Dr Lal , the co-ordinating lead author of the report ’s chapter on Asia , said : ‘ It related to several countries in this region and their water sources .
We thought that if we can highlight it , it will impact policy - makers and politicians and encourage them to take some concrete action .
‘ It had importance for the region , so we thought we should put it in . ’
Not the sort of statement that provides much reassurance for EPA officials .
Rose goes on to describe incidents in which IPCC ignored review comments on the glaciers :
For example , Hayley Fowler of Newcastle University , suggested that their draft did not mention that Himalayan glaciers in the Karakoram range are growing rapidly , citing a paper published in the influential journal Nature .
In their response , the IPCC authors said , bizarrely , that they were ‘ unable to get hold of the suggested references ’ , but would ‘ consider ’ this in their final version .
They failed to do so .
The Japanese government commented that the draft did not clarify what it meant by stating that the likelihood of the glaciers disappearing by 2035 was ‘ very high ’ .
‘ What is the confidence level ? ’ it asked .
The authors ’ response said ‘ appropriate revisions and editing made ’ .
But the final version was identical to their draft .
Under IPCC procedures , it is the obligation of Review Editors to ensure that review comments are adequately responded to by authors .
The failure of IPCC Review Editors to discharge their obligations has been a long - standing issue at Climate Audit .
Although all review comments are supposed to be archived and although IPCC is supposed to have an “ open and transparent ” process , IPCC did not archive review comments from Review Editors and refused to provide review comments from WG1 chapter 6 Review Editor John Mitchell of the UK Met Office .
David Holland tried to obtain Mitchell ’s review comments through FOI , but his efforts have thus far been unsuccessful .
( The Met Office further soured matters by making untrue statements in their efforts to evade the FOI request . )
Some interesting comments from Mitchell turned up in the Climategate Letters .
The IPCC Review Editors for WG2 chapter 10 were Daniel Murdiyarso ( Indonesia ) and Shuzo Nishioka ( Japan ) .
It would be interesting to see how they discharged their responsibilities .
This lack of due diligence is not limited to IPCC .
Gerry North , chairman of the NRC Report on Surface Temperature Reconstructions , ( which is cited in the EPA Technical Support Document ) stated in a seminar at his university that they “ did n’t do any research ” , that they got 12 “ people around the table ” and “ just kind of winged it . ”
He said “ that ’s what you do in that kind of expert panel ” .
A clip of North ’s remarks is online here .
That an IPCC Coordinating Lead Author should describe their process in the terms reported in Rose ’s article should be of considerable concern to those EPA officials , who stated that IPCC peer review complies with statutory requirements for EPA peer review as the evidence mounts that it did n’t .

Among the many , many things we talk about when we discuss curriculum for the Computational Media degree is how to make learning programming facile and appealing all throughout a student ’s career .
Many sub-problems arise , for example , how can one help students learn new languages and environments after they ’ve become familiar with one or two ?
Just after having some of these very conversations I happened to fall upon a treasure trove of old Apple ads .
It reminded me of something we often mention on the Computational Media curriculum committee : many of us learned to program because that ’s what one did with a personal computer .
Looking at these ads really drives this point home .
Here ’s a two - page spread from 1977 , the first year of the Apple ] [ .
It ran in Scientific American , among other publications .
( Click any of these for larger images ) .
The text is a bit small even in the large version , so I ’ll reproduce some key passages :
But you do n’t even need to know a RAM from a ROM to use and enjoy Apple II .
It ’s the first personal computer with a fast version of BASIC — the English - like programming language — permanently built in .
That means you can begin running your Apple II the first evening , entering your own instructions and watching them work , even if you ’ve had no previous computer experience .
That ’s the second paragraph of the ad copy .
The implication is clear : you ’re going to bring home your new $ 1298 Apple ] [ , set it up on your kitchen table , and start writing some programs .
And not just because you ’re a dork who reads Scientific American ; no , the ad continues to explain that everyone in your house can learn to do it :
But the biggest benefit — no matter how you use Apple II — is that you and your family increase familiarity with the computer itself .
The more you experiment with it , the more you discover about its potential .
What ’s more , the ad suggests an organic oscillation between using the computer and programming it , the one influencing the other .
Start by plaing PONG .
Then invent your own games using the input keyboard , game paddles and built - in speaker .
As you experiment you ’ll acquire new programming skills which will open up new ways to use your Apple II .
You ’ll learn to “ paint ” dazzling color displays using the unique color graphics commands in Apple BASIC , and write programs to create beautiful kaleidoscopic designs .
As you master Apple BASIC , you ’ll be able to organize , index and store data on household finances , income tax , recipes , and record collections .
You can learn to chart your biorythms , balance your checking account , even control your home environment .
Finally , there ’s a clear implication that becoming more fluent in computing involves becoming a more agile and determined programmer , not merely a more adept user :
Best of all , Apple II is designed to grow with you .
As your skill and experience with computing increase , you may want to add new Apple peripherals .
For example , a refined , more sophisticated BASIC language is being developed for advanced scientific and mathematical applications .
And in addition to the built - in audio , video and game interfaces , there ’s room for eight plug - in options such as a prototyping board for experimenting with interfaces to other equipment .
Here ’s another one , although I have n’t been able to pinpoint its date .
It ’s an ad targeting educators , presumably for institutional purchases .
Here too we see programming listed as an inevitable rather than a possible use of the machine :
Apple engages student interest with sound and color video .
In fact , your students will be able to write programs and create high - resolution graphics .
And then later a sentiment that feels almost entirely alien from the perspective of Apple in the 21st century , one that reprises the 1977 ad ’s implication that programming is an inevitable consequence of owning a computer :
Once you ’ve unlocked the power of the desk - top computer , you ’ll be using Apple in ways you never dreamed of .
You do n’t want to be limited by the availability of pre-programmed cartridges .
You ’ll want a computer , like Apple , that you can also program yourself . …
The more you and your students learn about computers , the more your imagination will demand .
So you ’ll want a computer that can grow with you as your skills and experience grow .
The last sentence above is fundamental to the personal computer experience of the late 1970s and early 1980s .
Straight out of the box , anyone could make the computer do something .
And then , soon enough , anyone with a little patience and interest could make the computer do anything it was capable of .
One more .
This 1979 print ad promotes the availability of a Pascal development environment for the Apple ] [ .
It ’s is an amazing spread , partly because it includes an iron - on decal that would produce a t - shirt with the message “ Pascal Spoken Here . ”
But the ad also makes good on the promise made in the 1977 ad above , by offering more advanced tools to help improve an owner ’s ability to program the machine .
With Pascal , programs can be written , debugged and executed in just one - third the time required for equivalent BASIC programs .
With just one - third the memory .
On top of that , Pascal is easy to understand , elegant and able to handle advanced applications .
It allows one programmer to pick up where another left off with minimal chance of foul up .
The mention of foul ups conjures those lovely yet horrifying BASIC magazine listings , one of the standard ways to distribute and share programs at the time .
Pascal , as it happens , went on to become the native development environment for the Apple Lisa and the original Macintosh .
I remember programming System 6 and 7 in Object Pascal , and Apple supported the language up until the IBM PowerPC architecture switch in 1994 .
I point to this last example to underscore the good fortune that blessed those of us who started using computers in this era .
Learning a new language or environment was a far less frequent and more specific affair , and yet a far more familiar and comfortable one .
Why ?
Because it was possible to learn to program computers in time with their very evolution .
Today when we ask questions like those I posed at the top of the page , we may fail to remember that it ’s precisely these contexts we lack , rather than technical scaffolding or learning environments or what have you .
These vintage Apple ads should make clear how difficult it is , perhaps even impossible , to recuperate a situation in which a computer doles out its secrets in small , digestible bites rather than all at once through the tsunami of Google results .

The space shuttle Endeavour has landed at Kennedy Space Center in Florida , following its latest visit to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The two - week mission saw the virtual completion of the ISS .
The six - member crew of Endeavour installed the Tranquility Node , a spacious addition that includes the " cupola " observation deck .
The commissioning of Tranquility marks the last major component on the US side of the space station .
The $ 100 bn project , involving five space agencies , is nearly completed after more than a decade of construction 340 km ( 210 miles ) above the Earth .
NODE 3 - ' TRANQUILITY '
Key unit connects and helps manage other ISS modules Multiple docking ports for visiting vehicles or future modules 7 m by 4.6 m ; a mass of 14 tonnes , but will be fitted out in orbit Sophisticated life support systems will include air cleaning unit Cupola 's views ( above ) provide ideal control room for robotic arm Node named for Sea of Tranquility , the Apollo 11 landing site
As the Endeavour crew parted with colleagues on the ISS on Friday , space station commander Jeffrey Williams congratulated the shuttle astronauts on their successes in installing Tranquility .
" We are really going to enjoy the view .
I wish you guys could stay a little longer to partake in that view , " he said .
A further four shuttle missions will occur over the coming seven months , each of which will bring equipment and supplies to the station .
The space shuttle fleet will then be retired .
One of the last missions will launch a mini-module for the Russians .
Another will take up a big science experiment called the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer .
The final orbiter missions will also be packed with spares that are too big to be carried by the existing fleet of robotic cargo ships .
On retirement of the shuttle fleet , the job of launching astronauts to the station will become the sole responsibility of Russian Soyuz vehicles until the Americans can develop a new crew carrier of their own .

In the 1980s , painted movie ads were the norm in Thailand .
These exquisitely creepy collages did n't just divulge important plot points to audiences ... they were scarier than the movies themselves .

Like Ghana ,
Thailand is one of those nations where the painted movie poster was an art form unto itself .
Here are some of the best Thai horror posters from the decade .
They range from simply quirky to weapons - grade nightmare fuel .
Do n't gaze at these too long , lest your rods and cones atrophy in fright .

New York company makes biodiesel
Posted
Feb 1 - A New York entrepreneur and environmental activist collects millions of liters of used cooking oil from restaurants to make clean - burning biodiesel fuel .
Tara Cleary reports .
Hugh Hefner has been sued for living the good life and refusing to give it up for the sake of his company .
We 've obtained a class action lawsuit filed by a Playboy shareholder who claims the company is falling apart and Hugh has intentionally sabotaged two potential deals in the last 6 months to sell the company at a decent price .
In the lawsuit , an investment company that analyzed Playboy 's business sent a note stating " we think the wildcard here is Hugh Hefner . "
The note continues , " If you were Hugh Hefner , 81 , would you give up the parade of busty blonds , the fancy mansion and the reality TV show for a payout ? "
The suit goes on ...
" Hefner has continued to live the good life and make sure everyone knows it .
Hefner remains in the limelight , showing up at media events and at the Playboy mansion ... with his girlfriends by his side . "
The suit laments , " Today , the price of a Playboy magazine is far higher than the price of Playboy common stock . "
In 1999 , the stock sold for $ 36 a share .
Today Playboy closed at $ 3.14 .
The magazine sells for $ 5.99 ... because of the articles .
Remember when Sarah Palin went on Oprah and scoffed at Levi Johnston for getting paid for " pornography ? "
Well now she wants a piece of the action .
The Palins have subpoenaed Playgirl for Levi 's check stub .
The Levi Johnston / Bristol Palin custody battle is getting ugly .
The Palins are trying to get as much cash out of Levi as they can , which means discovering just how much money he made last year .
In their quest to uncover the total salary from his media appearances and disappointing " naked " photoshoot , Bristol has subpoenaed the magazine to find out what they paid him in the deal .
We 've been running under the assumption it 's around $ 25,000 and some revenue sharing , so based on how much the photos made , Levi might have scooped up even more ( hence the subpoena ) .
However , Playgirl also heard from Levi 's enabler / exploiter / lawyer Rex Butler telling them to keep mum about the sum .
Bristol is seeking $ 1750 a month in child support , but Levi is trying to pay less because his income is " erratic . "
Considering his income is built upon exploiting his Sarah Palin connections , which have been severed , no wonder it 's erratic .
And this public shaming is just the Palin 's latest attack to disgrace Levi , America 's stupid high school boyfriend , in the press and make themselves look better .
If , by doing so , they have to rub elbows ( and other parts ) with the filthy vermin they turn their noses up at , then so be it .
Is n't it great to have principles ?
Scientists have identified a novel antifreeze molecule in a freeze - tolerant Alaska beetle able to survive temperatures below minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit .
Unlike all previously described biological antifreezes that contain protein , this new molecule , called xylomannan , has little or no protein .
It is composed of a sugar and a fatty acid and may exist in new places within the cells of organisms .
" The most exciting part of this discovery is that this molecule is a whole new kind of antifreeze that may work in a different location of the cell and in a different way , " said zoophysiologist Brian Barnes , director of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Institute of Arctic Biology and one of five scientists who participated in the Alaska Upis ceramboides beetle project .
Just as ice crystals form over ice cream left too long in a freezer , ice crystals in an insect or other organism can draw so much water out of the organism 's cells that those cells die .
Antifreeze molecules function to keep small ice crystals small or to prevent ice crystals from forming at all .
They may help freeze - tolerant organisms survive by preventing freezing from penetrating into cells , a lethal condition .
Other insects use these molecules to resist freezing by supercooling when they lower their body temperature below the freezing point without becoming solid .
UAF graduate student and project collaborator Todd Sformo found that the Alaska Upis beetle , which has no common name , first freezes at about minus 18.5 degrees Fahrenheit in the lab and survives temperatures down to about 104 degrees below zero Fahrenheit .
" It seems paradoxical that we find an antifreeze molecule in an organism that wants to freeze and that 's adapted to freezing , " said Barnes , whose research group is involved in locating insects , determining their strategies of overwintering and identifying the mechanisms that help them get through the winter
A possible advantage of this novel molecule comes from it having the same fatty acid that cells membranes do .
This similarity , says Barnes , may allow the molecule to become part of a cell wall and protect the cell from internal ice crystal formation .
Antifreeze molecules made of proteins may not fit into cell membranes .
" There are many difficult studies ahead , " said Barnes .
" To find out how common this biologic antifreeze is and how it actually prevents freezing and where exactly it 's located . "
This project was led by Kent Walters at the University of Notre Dame with collaborators Anthony Serianni and John H. Duman of UND and Barnes and Sformo of UAF and was published in the Dec. 1 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
To welcome the launch of the new multitouch Android 2.1 devices named Legend and Desire , HTC announced an upgrade to its trademark Sense user interface today .
The upgrade includes a new view called Leap which is essentially a zoomed - out version of the phone 's home screens .
With a pinch - to - zoom gesture , the view backs out and shows seven thumbnails , one for each home screen .
This feature actually leaked out in a custom ROM for the HTC Hero in mid-January , so this should already be familiar to HTC Android fans .
But there are also some new applications and widgets available with the new UI .

Like Motorola 's BLUR interface , HTC has incorporated a new application and widget into Sense which are based on the user 's social networking activity .
Called Friend Stream , the application pulls updates from Facebook , Twitter , Flickr , and similar sites , displaying them in a single feed .
Sense has also gotten its own newsreader app and widget , a feature that has heretofore been something of a weak point in Android .
There are dozens of RSS reader applications that work suitably , as well as a number of Google Reader - integrated apps , but there have not been any integrated with the UI thus far .
The new Sense will be launched with Desire and Legend in Europe and Asia early in the second quarter of 2010 and will be available as an upgrade on the HTC Hero at that time .
HTC did not offer a launch date for the Americas or Oceania , but it did note that the Desire will be available exclusively through Telstra in Australia .
HTC also produces Sense UI for Windows Mobile 6.5 , and announced its intention to produce a version for Qualcomm 's BREW platform last month at CES .
I thought the strangest moment in “ The Substitute ” was when fake Locke ( aka Flocke , notLocke , unLocke , and the Locke- ness Monster ) chases after the blond kid .
Fake Locke falls ( not unlike the way that Real Sideways Locke falls ) , and the kid stands over him , and says “ You know the rules .
You ca n’t kill him . ”
Then fake Locke says , “ Do n’t tell me what I ca n ’t do . ”
The kid shakes his head and walks away .
Then fake Locke points his finger and yells , loudly : “ Dont tell me what I ca n ’t do ! ”
So why does fake Locke sound exactly like real Locke here ?
Why is he repeating real Locke ’s most famous signature line ?
We ’ve already seen leakage into the Sideways world .
Could there also be leakage into the Island world ?
Is that what we saw in this scene ?
Or is something else going on ?
I listed the possibilities that occurred to me in the poll below .
What do you think ?
Do you have any other ideas ?

Here ’s the clip :
Screencaps from lost - media.com .
For years , Mike Horelick and Nicolina Karlsson endured the cigarette smoke wafting into their tiny Santa Monica courtyard apartment from a neighbor ’s patio , even though it aggravated Karlsson ’s asthma .
FOR THE RECORD :
Apartment smoking : A story in the Feb .
3 LATExtra section about a push to ban smoking on apartment balconies and patios in Santa Monica said Belmont is in Santa Clara County .
It is in San Mateo County . —
But after the couple made several $ 100 trips to the emergency room because their infant daughter was gasping for air , they pleaded with the neighbor to stop smoking outdoors , to no avail .
Now , contending that secondhand smoke poses a health hazard , they have joined other activists who are pushing the city to snuff out smoking on private balconies and patios in multifamily dwellings .
It ’s an effort that puts Santa Monica in sync with a growing number of other California cities and counties that have hit smokers where they live .
Yet , in the liberal - leaning beach community , the debate takes on added freight because of the political clout of Santa Monica ’s tenants rights advocates , who contend that landlords would welcome an excuse to evict longtime tenants in rent - controlled units .
The fight might come down to whether such a sweeping smoking ban bumps up against the civil rights of renters .
Santa Monica has already outlawed lighting up in public spaces , including beaches and parks , outdoor dining areas , bus stops , ATM lines , farmers markets , the pier and the Third Street Promenade .
Last year , over the objections of many rent - control advocates , the city adopted an ordinance banning tobacco smoke in indoor and outdoor common areas of apartment and condo complexes .
But a prohibition on smoking on private patios and balconies marks a line that local politicians seem reluctant to cross for fear of offending the influential Santa Monicans for Renters ’
Rights group in an election year .
Even without an election , said Councilman Kevin McKeown , the issue is especially potent in Santa Monica , where about 70 % of residents are renters .
“ Do we even have the legal right to disallow smoking within someone ’s home ? ” McKeown said .
“ Can we legislate the breeze ? ”
Santa Monicans for Renters ’ Rights has been a political force for 30 years .
In the late 1970s , an era of rampant development , many elderly and low - and moderate - income tenants lost their homes as property owners converted apartments to condos .
Tenants and neighborhood groups joined forces to support a successful ballot measure to institute rent control and “ just cause ” evictions .
Further smoking restrictions , they say , would erode renters ’ rights .
“ You ca n’t just pull away rights , ” said Patricia Hoffman , chairwoman of the rights group .
“ You can ban smoking in new buildings .
You can ban smoking in leases with new tenants .
But if somebody is an existing tenant and has essentially the right to smoke , and smoking is a legal behavior , then it ’s pretty hard to take away a legal right from someone . ”
Santa Monica ’s website says the city “ is a leader in protecting its residents and visitors from the harms of secondhand smoke . ”
The American Lung Assn. recently gave the city an A for smoke - free outdoor air but a D for smoke - free housing .
Beth Miller , a renter in a coastal complex , said she moved in with a friend because her next - door neighbor ’s cigar smoke aggravated her asthma .
Now that it ’s winter and she can keep her doors and windows closed , she ’s back in her rent - controlled unit .
“ Once it warms up , the sun comes pouring in and I do n’t have air - conditioning , ” Miller said .
“ I do n’t want to be forced out .
If I move , the same thing could happen again . ”
Marty Shapiro , her cigar - smoking neighbor , spoke out against further restrictions at a December Rent Control Board meeting at which one member advocated banning smoking in all multifamily apartments and private patios and balconies .
“ You ’ve eliminated smoking in restaurant patios and my swimming pool area , and now you ’re going after [ the areas ] in my apartment , ” Shapiro said .
Councilwoman Gleam Davis said she hopes there ’s a way to balance the issues .
“ We have to be very careful when talking about circumscribing what people can do in their own homes , ” she said .
The movement to limit or ban smoking at multiple - unit residences has made the most headway in the Bay Area .
In 2007 , Oakland became the first California city to require landlords to designate units as smoking or nonsmoking , and landlords and condo sellers there must disclose the status of their units to prospective tenants or buyers .
Belmont in Santa Clara County went further last year , barring tobacco smoke in apartments .
Richmond , east of San Francisco , adopted a similar policy that will go into effect next year .
In Southern California , a Calabasas ordinance requires that by 2012 at least 80 % of all apartment units be designated permanently as nonsmoking .
Some landlords are requiring that new tenants agree not to smoke .
Bill Dawson , vice president of Sullivan - Dituri , a property management company , recently instituted that policy at the courtyard apartment building where Horelick and his family live .
Related Management in November launched a no-smoking program in a couple of its high - end properties in New York City and hopes to expand it to California .
“ I do not believe smokers are a protected class , ” said Jeff Brodsky , president of Related Management .
“ If secondhand smoke emanating from an apartment is compromising another apartment . . . the landlord has to take some steps to actively mitigate that . ”
Karlsson , an art teacher , said she enjoys letting her 3 - year - old daughter Meleja sit at an easel to paint on the narrow upstairs balcony of their rent - controlled apartment .
But if their neighbor is smoking , they are driven back indoors .
Karlsson and Horelick have sealed their windows and doors as well as they can , but Meleja must regularly take a steroid and use an inhaler to control her asthma .
“ They protect children [ from secondhand smoke ] at schools , the beach and the promenade , ” Karlsson said , “ but not where they sleep . ”

Advertisement An American Airlines plane has overshot the runway on landing in heavy rain in the Jamaican capital Kingston , injuring more than 40 people , officials say .
The fuselage of flight AA 331 , carrying 154 people from Miami , broke apart after the incident at Norman Manley International Airport .
Jamaican officials said 44 people had been taken to nearby hospitals for treatment .
Four were seriously hurt .
The plane came to a halt just 10 - 15 ft ( 3 - 5 m ) from the sea .
American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith said the fuselage of the Boeing 737-800 was cracked , the right engine had broken off and the main landing gear had collapsed .
' Panic '
The plane , which had originated in Washington DC , was carrying 148 passengers and six crew .
A team of US investigators is heading to Jamaica Passenger Pilar Abaurrea , from the US state of New Hampshire , told the Associated Press news agency of chaotic scenes as the plane hit the ground .
" All of a sudden ... the plane was kind of bouncing , someone said the plane was skidding and there was panic , " she said .
She said the pilot had warned of turbulence just before landing , but had said it probably would not be too serious .
Local journalist Roland Henry said survivors had thought the plane was landing normally before there was a series of jolts and luggage tumbled from overhead lockers .
One passenger told local media : " The plane did not seem to be slowing down when it landed .
There was a loud sound , then a huge thud and then we started to feel rain coming through the top . "
Another told Agence France - Presse news agency that the emergency services were too slow to respond : " We were there for about 20 minutes or more and there was no - one there .
What if there was a fire ?
We would 've all died . "
Most of the injuries were believed to be cuts , bruises and some broken bones .
None are thought to be life - threatening .
A team of investigators from the US National Transportation Safety Board is travelling to Jamaica to help with the investigation .
The airport was closed for a while but has now reopened , AP reported .
Are you in Jamaica ?

An email we received in the Serious Eats inbox today :
Have you ever written about " Pine Mouth " ... it happened to me and now I never want to eat anything that has pine nuts in it again !
- Chris
As no one in the Serious Eats office had heard of pine mouth before , I searched on Google and found out that the term describes the bitter / metallic taste in one 's mouth after eating pine nuts that makes it unpleasant to eat or drink anything else .
This Daily Mail article from last May has more to say about it , along with this earlier blog post from October 2008 and other afflicted bloggers .
While multiple studies have been done to learn more about pine mouth , this recent study in the Journal of Medical Toxicology does n't shed much light on the subject :
While there appears to be an association between pine nut ingestion and cacogeusia , little is known about this condition , nor can any specific mechanism of specific cause be identified .
It is not known if a specific species of pine nut can be implicated .
" Pine mouth " appears to be an emerging problem .
Have you ever experienced pine mouth ?

" It is a war for natural resources that is being fought secretly , " said Nur Hidayati , Greenpeace Indonesia spokesman .
" The situation has reached critical levels and the tropical islands of Nipah , the Karimun islands and many small islands off the coast of Riau are shrinking dramatically and on the brink of disappearing into the sea .
I am massively disappointed by this , and there is plenty of blame to go around here and I think people should avoid the chance to gloat and more than Fine Gael have lost out today .
I would suggest that George Lee is massively naive to leave like this as he should have known that politics is a long term project .
Yet , someone in the party should have noticed long before now that he was feeling ill at ease with his role , if FG were a private company that had hired in someone like him they would have assigned someone to act as his ‘ buddy ’ to ensure that he made a smooth transition to political life .
Yet the fact that George Lee , with all the access that comes with being part of RTÉ , should have been so unaware of how Irish political parties actually work is also astounding .
Politics is a lonely , solitary exercise , they might be called political parties but they are anything but parties .
They are a collection of individuals for that is how we elect them , individually .
I believe that he genuinely means this is about policy formation when he says it , but he simply appears not to have realised there are no formal structures in politics in Ireland for that occurring .
I can understand the feeling of frustration of not having any proper input into what policies the party even considers , not to mind adopts .
Irish political parties , by in large , do n’t have any internal structures for policy discussion .
I was FG constituency policy officer for a number of years as well as a local election candidate , and the position was meaningless with no role in even informing people about policy not to mind having a hand in creating it .
Being interested in policy in Ireland marks you as a crank and do n’t tell me FF , SF or Labour are any different .
Just look at cllr Killian Forde ’s departure from SF for the lack of openness about internal policy discussion there .
People forget that unlike football teams we choose to be members of a political party because of a combination of a coinciding of underlying principles , policies and the personnel to carry them through .
I think the Labour party is full of decent , sensible , honourable people but I ’m not a member because I do n’t believe in their approach and political worldview .
I ’m not married to FG and I ’m not going to be a member if the party decides to adopt policies I can’t identify with .
I ’m not saying that is the case at present but it shows that policies are important .
More generally we should have , as a party , spent the last two and half years investigating what it is that underpins our policies .
Instead we had an announcement about 4 policy areas in 2007 and then nothing , until last year with the report from Alan Dukes on health policy which is quite good but had no involvement of the members at any stage .
So what is the point of being a member ?
But the other 3 areas…nada .
I had suggested here and on p.ie long before now that FG should have changed the front bench to allow Leo , George and Richard tag team on Mary Coughlan and Lenihan .
And it would seem that this was what was in prospect but there was a failure to signal this to George .
That is a failure of man management , and were this the UK , someone would be roasting the whips office right now .
I think the party has to have a cold hard look at itself , this is part of the reason that it is so hard for younger people to get involved in party politics in Ireland where there is no formal structures for policy or idea based politics .
It ’s all about getting X elected instead of getting Y done .
I ’m sure that the initial focus in media commentary will be that this raises questions for Enda Kenny as leader , I do n’t think this really the key concern as how Enda has lead the party or his own qualities as leader have worked out well .
For me it raises questions of how Irish politics is organised more generally and more specifically how FG chooses how it does its business .
We need to involve more people and have the structures in place to do so transparent and honestly .
Just to give one example , over the weekend I was making some last notes to a doc I received about providing input into the structure of the upcoming national conference that is to take place on March 19 /20th .
Every member got one from what I ’m aware .
These have to be returned by tomorrow Feb 9th .
Now given the planning that goes into a conference does anyone really think that these contributions will all be read and processed in time to allow any changes of substance to the conference format ?
No…neither do I .
It ’s about appearing to involve people but not really involving them .
I had tried prior to the national conference in Wexford to make suggests about how we might modify the conference format , but again they got lost in the system and I never heard anything back .
I made , along with another person , a presentation to the national exec about new methods of campaigning in 2005 but it again elicited no decision on any action before it was raised with us again out of the blue a few years later , before foundered again for odd reasons of internal process and control .
Frankly speaking , political parties make the public service seem speedy and nimble .
FG is n’t unique , in Irish politics , in having these problems but it is to FG ’s own benefit that it would address those problems .
That must start right now .
In essence I believe he is doing the wrong thing for what it seems are the right reasons .
But it would also seem that by standing for election , he was doing the right thing for the wrong reasons .
I have to ask what was his plan when he went in ?
and I mean a detailed plan not merely his general intentions that ‘ something must be done ’ .
I am not suggesting the system is n’t broken , merely that you do n’t fix it from the outside and of all the people in the Oireachtas he could have taken the initiative himself and reached out to the public over the heads of party structures or lack of them to present new ideas .
Fine Gael and Irish politics have failed George Lee by not being able to integrate him but George Lee has failed Irish politics and himself by resigning in the way he has done and by not taking up the fight in public .
The Battle of the Titans : JPMorgan Vs. Goldman Sachs
We are witnessing an epic battle between two banking giants , JPMorgan Chase ( Paul Volcker ) and Goldman Sachs ( Rubin / Geithner ) .
The bodies left strewn on the battleground could include your pension fund and 401K .
The Battle of the Titans : JPMorgan Vs. Goldman Sachs
The late Libertarian economist Murray Rothbard wrote that U.S. politics since 1900 , when William Jennings Bryan narrowly lost the presidency , has been a struggle between two competing banking giants , the Morgans and the Rockefellers .
The parties would sometimes change hands , but the puppeteers pulling the strings were always one of these two big - money players .
No popular third party candidate had a real chance at winning , because the bankers had the exclusive power to create the national money supply and therefore held the winning cards .
In 2000 , the Rockefellers and the Morgans joined forces , when JPMorgan and Chase Manhattan merged to become JPMorgan Chase Co. Today the battling banking titans are JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs , an investment bank that gained notoriety for its speculative practices in the 1920s .
In 1928 , it launched the Goldman Sachs Trading Corp. , a closed - end fund similar to a Ponzi scheme .
The fund failed in the stock market crash of 1929 , marring the firm ’s reputation for years afterwards .
Former Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin came from Goldman , and current Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner rose through the ranks of government as a Rubin protégé .
One commentator called the U.S. Treasury “ Goldman Sachs South . ”
Goldman ’s superpower status comes from something more than just access to the money spigots of the banking system .
It actually has the ability to manipulate markets .
Formerly just an investment bank , in 2008 Goldman magically transformed into a bank holding company .
That gave it access to the Federal Reserve ’s lending window ; but at the same time it remained an investment bank , aggressively speculating in the markets .
The upshot was that it can now borrow massive amounts of money at virtually 0 % interest , and it can use this money not only to speculate for its own account but to bend markets to its will .
But Goldman
Sachs has been caught in this blatant market manipulation so often that the JPMorgan faction of the banking empire has finally had enough .
The voters too have evidently had enough , as demonstrated in the recent upset in Massachusetts that threw the late Senator Ted Kennedy ’s Democratic seat to a Republican .
That pivotal loss gave Paul Volcker , chairman of President Obama ’s newly formed Economic Recovery Advisory Board , an opportunity to step up to the plate with some proposals for serious banking reform .
Unlike the string of Treasury Secretaries who came to the government through the revolving door of Goldman Sachs , former Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker came up through Chase Manhattan Bank , where he was vice president before joining the Treasury .
On January 27 , market commentator Bob Chapman wrote in his weekly investment newsletter The International Forecaster :
“ A split has occurred between the paper forces of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase .
Mr. Volcker represents Morgan interests .
Both sides are Illuminists , but the Morgan side is tired of Goldman ’s greed and arrogance .
. . .
Not that JP Morgan Chase was blameless , they did their looting and damage to the system as well , but not in the high handed arrogant way the others did .
The recall of Volcker is an attempt to reverse the damage as much as possible .
That means the influence of Geithner , Summers , Rubin , et al will be put on the back shelf at least for now , as will be the Goldman influence .
It will be slowly and subtly phased out .
. . .
Washington needs a new face on Wall Street , not that of a criminal syndicate . ”
Goldman ’s crimes , says Chapman , were that it “ got caught stealing .
First in naked shorts , then front - running the market , both of which they are still doing , as the SEC looks the other way , and then selling MBS - CDOs to their best clients and simultaneously shorting them . ”
Volcker ’s proposal would rein in these abuses , either by ending the risky “ proprietary trading ” ( trading for their own accounts ) engaged in by the too - big - to - fail banks , or by forcing them to downsize by selling off those portions of their businesses engaging in it .
Until recently , President Obama has declined to support Volcker ’s plan , buton January 21 he finally endorsed it .
The immediate reaction of the market was to drop – and drop , day after day .
At least , that appeared to be the reaction of “ the market . ” Financial analyst Max Keiser suggests a more sinister possibility .
Goldman , which has the power to manipulate markets with its high - speed program trades , may be engaging in a Mexican standoff .
The veiled threat is , “ Back off on the banking reforms , or stand by and watch us continue to crash your markets . ”
The same manipulations were evident in the bank bailout forced on Congress by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson in September 2008 .
In Keiser ’s January 23 broadcast with co-host Stacy Herbert , he explains how Goldman ’s manipulations are done .
Keiser is a fast talker , so this transcription is not verbatim , but it is close .
He says :
“ High frequency trading accounts for 70 % of trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Ordinarily , a buyer and a seller show up on the floor , and a specialist determines theprice of a trade that would satisfy buyer and seller , and that ’s the market price .
If there are too many sellers and not enough buyers , the specialist lowers the price .
High frequency trading as conducted by Goldman means that before the specialist buys and sells and makes that market , Goldman will electronically flood the specialist with thousands and thousands of trades to totally disrupt that process and essentially commandeer that process , for the benefit of siphoning off nickels and dimes for themselves .
Not only are they siphoning cash from the New York Stock Exchange but they are also manipulating prices .
What I see as a possibility is that next week , if the bankers on Wall Street decide they do n’t want to be reformed in any way , they simply set the high frequency trading algorithm to sell , creating a huge negative bias for the direction of stocks .
And they ’ll basically crash the market , and it will be a standoff .
The market was down three days in a row , which it has n’t been since last summer .
It ’s a game of chicken , till Obama says , ‘ Okay , maybe we need to rethink this . ’”
But the President has n’t knuckled under yet .
In his State of the Union address on January 27 , he did not dwell long on the issue of bank reform , but he held to his position .
He said :
“ We ca n’t allow financial institutions , including those that take your deposits , to take risks that threaten the whole economy .
The House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes .
And the lobbyists are already trying to kill it .
Well , we can not let them win this fight .
And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform , I will send it back . ”
What this “ real reform ” would look like was left to conjecture , but Bob Chapman fills in some blanks and suggests what might be needed for an effective overhaul :
“ The attempt will be to bring the financial system back to brass tacks .
. . .
That would include little or no MBS and CDOs , the regulation of derivatives and hedge funds and the end of massive market manipulation , both by Treasury , Fed and Wall Street players .
Congress has to end the ‘ President ’s Working Group on Financial Markets , ’ or at least limit its use to real emergencies .
. . .
The Glass - Steagall
Act should be reintroduced into the system and lobbying and campaign contributions should end .
. . .
No more politics in lending and banks should be limited to a lending ratio of 10 to 1 . . . .
It is bad enough they have the leverage that they have .
State banks such as North Dakota ’s are a better idea . ”
On January 28 , the predictable reaction of “ the market ” was to fall for the seventh straight day .
The battle of the Titans was on .

SAN FRANCISCO 
A small plane crashed into a residential neighborhood in East Palo Alto Wednesday , killing three employees of Tesla Motors , the California electric car company , and causing widespread power disruptions , officials said .
The plane , a twin -engine Cessna 310 , crashed in foggy weather shortly after takeoff from Palo Alto Airport about 8 a.m. , said Ian Gregor , a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman .
It either struck or clipped three transmission lines , disabling a 100 - foot electrical tower , said Joe Molica , a spokesman for PG&E .
The crash set two homes and several vehicles on fire .
There were no reported injuries on the ground , said Doris Cohen , crime analyst at the East Palo Alto Police Department .
The plane was bound for Hawthorne Municipal Airport , which is near the Los Angeles International Airport .
One of the Tesla employees was piloting the plane , according to a source briefed on the incident who requested anonymity because Tesla had not yet publicly confirmed details of the crash .
The headquarters of SpaceX , Mr. Musk ’s spaceship company , is in Hawthorne , and Tesla , which is based in Palo Alto , uses space in the SpaceX building .
These collection is taken in one of the beautiful park on the world .
Location of the park is USA , Florida .
This park is really amazing .
It is decorated with a lot of different animal shapes and stone or wood statues .
For me , the most interesting statue of those is red fish made from hedge .
Hedge was painted and decorated .
They also put wooden mouth on that fish .
It looks really interesting .
The information on UFO sightings contains reports from across the country
Reports of " flying Toblerones " and objects travelling at 1,100 mph across the Scottish sky have been released by the Ministry of Defence .
The files detail how unidentified objects have been witnessed flying over a range of locations across Scotland .
Among them were one from a senior air traffic controller at Prestwick Airport who reported seeing a fast - moving UFO on the airport radar .
While four fishermen spotted a flat , shiny object hovering off the coast .
The Scottish accounts are among the thousands of reports made of close encounters with UFOs across the UK which have been released in a joint project between the MoD and the National Archives .
For five years the people both you and I represent have witnessed a phenomenon in the area that has been left unexplained
Councillor Billy Buchanan
The Prestwick airport incident in February 1999 led to an extensive investigation by RAF air defence staff who impounded radar tapes from a number of airports around the UK .
But the report concluded that no additional evidence could be found to corroborate what the air traffic controller had spotted .
In another file , a report reveals four members of the crew of a fishing trawler in the North Sea spotted a flat , shiny , round object hovering 19 miles north - east of Fraserburgh on 18 August 1997 .
They tracked the mysterious UFO on their surface radar for several seconds before it vanished .
' National security '
Also included in the previously top secret files is the testimony of a West Lothian electrician who spotted a " Toblerone - shaped " UFO hovering over a field .
A sketch of the craft is included in the report .
Other document describe a request submitted to former Prime Minister Tony Blair from a councillor for an inquiry into 600 alleged sightings in the so - called Bonnybridge Triangle , near Falkirk .
The files contain verbal and drawn accounts of UFO encounters
The area is renowned among enthusiasts as being among the best places in the world to see UFOs .
In October 1997 , Bonnybridge councillor Billy Buchanan , of Falkirk District Council , wrote to Mr Blair demanding the phenomena were investigated after five years of pursuing the matter .
He wrote : " For five years the people both you and I represent have witnessed a phenomenon in the area that has been left unexplained .
" I wrote to your predecessor John Major , I have also contacted our local MP Dennis Canavan who put me in contact with the MoD who told me quite strongly that nothing was happening in Bonnybridge that was a threat to national security . "
He continued : " I have tried to get an answer for the people and have been ridiculed for it .
" I appeal to you Mr Blair to get the phenomenon investigated . "
Every mystery has a solution somewhere , everything has a rational explanation
Stuart Campbell
' The UFO Mystery Solved '
An MoD response to the letter said there were no grounds to investigate the matter .
But Mr Buchanan did not give up and wrote to Mr Blair once again in 1998 demanding " the truth " .
Experts believe the records highlight how shapes of reported UFOs have changed over the last few decades , possibly explained by representations of UFOs in popular culture .
Many reports in this latest file describe aircraft as big , black and triangular in shape with lights along the edges , whereas the predominant form in the 1940s to 1950s was saucer or disc - shaped .
Stuart Campbell , the Edinburgh - based author of the book The UFO Mystery Solved , said : " UFO reports have all sorts of explanations - lights in the sky from aircraft to hot air balloons .
" Every mystery has a solution somewhere , everything has a rational explanation .
The alternative is that we do n't live in a rational universe .
" The job is to find an explanation and that can be hard work sometimes . "
The released files are available to download for free for a month from the National Archives website .

Giving epilepsy patients an electric jolt to shut off out - of - control neuron firing during seizures is being explored as a way to treat the chronic brain disorder .
New research from MIT now raises the possibility of silencing those seizures with light instead of electricity .
A team led by neuroengineer Edward Boyden has found a class of proteins that , when inserted into neurons , allow them to be turned off with rays of yellow - green light .
The silencing is near instantaneous and easily reversible .
This kind of selective brain silencing , reported in the Jan. 7 issue of Nature , could not only help treat brain disorders but also allows researchers to investigate the role of different types of neurons in normal brain circuits and how those circuits can go wrong .
“ We hope to enable a broad platform of molecular tools for controlling brain activity , thus enabling new general therapeutic tools , and new ways of studying brain function , ” says Boyden , the Benesse Career Development Professor in the MIT Media Lab and an associate member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT .
‘ Clean and digital ’
Boyden first demonstrated the use of light to reduce brain activity in 2007 .
However , the feat was performed in cells , not living animals , and the silencing was not as precise .
In the new study , the researchers used a different protein — one that inhibits neurons more strongly , silences more brain tissue and can be repeatedly activated because it returns to its original state within milliseconds of light activation .
With the new protein , called Arch , brain silencing is “ extremely clean and digital , ” says Boyden .
“ The other one was more like a volume knob turning up and down . ”
Boyden and his colleagues combined genetic and optical techniques to control neuron activity , a strategy that has come to be called “ optogenetic . ”
First , they engineered brain cells of living mice to express the gene for the Arch protein , which functions as a proton pump , moving protons across the cell membrane to alter the cell ’s voltage .
The proton pumps are light - sensitive , so they pump protons out of cells when activated by yellow - green light .
That lowers voltage inside the cells , silencing their firing .
In their previous work , the researchers used a light - sensitive chloride pump called halorhodopsin , which changes neurons ’ voltage by pumping chloride ions into the cell .
However , they were n’t satisfied with it and started looking for a better chloride pump , examining proteins from a range of bacteria , plants and fungi .
They could n’t find a chloride pump that offered the kind of control they were seeking , but discovered the new Arch proton pump in a strain of archaebacteria called Halorubrum sodomense that lives in the Dead Sea .
“ This is the result of mining the wealth of the natural world — genomic diversity and ecological variation — to discover new tools that can empower scientists to study complex systems like the brain , ” says Boyden .
“ We 're using natural tools isolated from the wild to help us understand how neural circuits work . ”
This strategy has long been used in molecular and cellular biology , resulting in tools like restriction enzymes , PCR and GFP , but Boyden 's work only recently has been applied to tackle complex systems - level biological problems .
One major advantage of the new pumps is that they can be used over and over again :
They recover their ability to be light - activated within seconds , rather than the minutes required for the old tool , halorhodopsin , to reprime itself .
That is critical to neuroscientists who want to study the role of particular cell types in different tasks , says Edward Callaway , professor of systems neurobiology at the Salk Institute , who was not involved in the research .
“ If you have to wait a long time to get recovery , you just ca n’t compare different conditions quickly , ” says Callaway , who studies vision - processing circuits in the brain .
The new channels offer a “ much more practical ” way to use optogenetics for animal studies such as testing which neurons are involved in different visual tasks , he says .
To achieve brain silencing in mice , the researchers implanted an externally controllable light source inside the mice ’s brains .
While the current device requires mice to be wired up to an external control , the researchers are designing a fully wireless system .
Boyden 's group , working with the Desimone lab at the McGovern Institute at MIT , is now performing pre-clinical testing of this approach in non-human primates , to assess its safety as a potential therapy for epilepsy , chronic pain and post - traumatic stress disorder .
The team has also developed , in collaboration with other groups at MIT , hardware for optical neural stimulation , which could be valuable for neural prosthetic purposes .
The MIT researchers have also discovered other proton pumps activated by different colors of light , combining these pumps with previously discovered tools allows researchers to selectively silence different brain regions using red and blue light .
“ One beautiful thing about this is we can inactivate different projections in the same brain , ” says Boyden .
In future studies , the researchers plan to use their neuron - silencing tools to examine the neural circuits of cognition and emotion , and to determine whether the new pumps are safe and effective in monkeys — a critical step toward potentially using optical control to treat human diseases .
Listen to Ed Boyden talk about this research with the National Science Foundation

Clip 2
Although I did n’t plan it , an emerging theme of posts this week seems to be the skillfulness of challenging of orthodoxy and mere conceptual thinking .
Whether we agree or disagree with them , iconoclast teachers make us think — or maybe in the case of these two teachers , not so much think , as pay attention and wake up !
“ True God , True Buddha ”
Reaction to Seung Sahn - the Buddha Laughed !
Krishnamurti — An Uncompromising Teacher
Krishnamurti — Freedom from the Known
Unorthodox teachers challenge us — and that ’s good !
What I love about unorthodox teachers is that they challenge our complacency and our easy assumptions that we “ know ” the truth .
I may not always agree with them , but at least I have considered their critique and examined my own views .
When it comes to spiritual practice , I think truth is more of a verb than a noun .
Truth is something we do .
Truth is not words or beliefs .
It is a reality to be discovered , explored , and lived .
If we are really open to truth , honest critiques and different perspectives should n’t really disturb us .
If they do , this could well mean we are just accepting our own self - created orthodoxy and have stopped being alive to truth as a living way , not a set of answers .
The value of criticism and self - examination
As the essay below that I ’m sharing below says :
I like to suggest that the person who says “ I ’ve made up my mind ; do n’t confuse me with the facts , ” is making me think the opposite of what they want me to think .
Do they have great faith ?
Instead , I ca n’t help but think that deep down , they already know the jig is up !
You do n’t lock up the barn that tight unless you know the horse wants out !
They must know their faith would never survive a close look at certain facts .
Trying to preserve the illusion , they are only making it more obvious that they know it is an illusion after all .
When I was a believing Christian , I read lots of critiques and criticisms of Buddhism by Christian theologians and academicians .
Now that I am a practicing Buddhist , I see how how incorrect and uninformed most of those critiques were .
Most of all , I saw that these criticisms were mainly intellectual and semantic arguments that missed the very core of Buddhism — practice .
Few critics had actually tried Buddhist meditation , tried mindfulness practice , tried metta ( loving - kindness ) practice .
At the same time , I ’ve come to value these criticisms .
Why ?
Because they challenged me to clarify my own articulation of Buddhism .
I can explain Buddhism better because I have had to look carefully at Christian misconceptions and objections to it .
The second value of these criticisms is that they helped see even more clearly where Christians and Buddhist fundamentally disagree and where we might share common ground .
A Critical Look at Buddhist Beliefs
So , continuing in the spirit of healthy iconoclasm and honest self - examination of our beliefs , I offer the following critical essay by Robert M. Price , a Professor of Theology and Scriptural Studies at Colemon Theological Seminary .
In academic circles , Price is probably best known as a Christian skeptic .
But in a way , that ’s exactly why I chose him — because he does n’t come from the typical place orthodox Christian critics of Buddhism do — i.e.
Buddhism denies Christ and is the work of the devil !
What is fascinating to me is that Price sees many of the same problems of Christian religious orthodoxy mirrored in some Buddhist philosophic systems and beliefs .
He also points out that many ex-Christians who have adopted Buddhism have a very selective reading of Buddhism and might be surprised to learn that millions of Buddhists believe things very similar to what they disliked in Christianity !
Are we honest and brave enough to challenge our own orthodoxies ?
There ’s no doubt that there ’s something in Price ’s essay to challenge or offend just about everybody , Buddhist or Christian !
Every school of Buddhism gets a sharp critique , and Christian orthodoxy fares little better .
If one is aligned with one of these schools , one ’s natural reaction will probably be : “ That ’s not true !
That ’s not fair !
That ’s a gross distortion or misunderstanding of what we believe ! ”
Well , maybe .
I ’m not saying everything this critique says is right , or that I agree with all Price ’s criticism !
I see his criticisms more as “ talking points ” in an ongoing dialog between people of very different traditions .
The courageous approach is to drop our defenses , have an open mind , consider what is factual and what is n’t , and then see if criticisms have any truth or merit to them .
Price ’s criticisms make us consider :
Have we chosen a Buddhist path and simply “ re-packaged ” our previous religious beliefs and prejudices ?
Or , on the other hand , have we accepted , without examination , ancient cultural beliefs about the nature of reality , personal saviors , and divinity simply because we grew up with them ?
And in some cases , do we already know deep down that “ the jig is up ? ”
I honestly do n’t think that ’s the goal of Price ’s essay is just to offend people or make them defensive .
It ’s helpful to see ourselves from an “ outsider ’s ” perspective .
See what you think .
You may disagree with some or all of the author ’s views or characterizations .
But maybe after reading this , you ’ll look at Buddhism , or at least , what millions of Buddhist ’s believe and practice , with a more critical eye .
So , take a look .
The article is somewhat long , but I think it ’s well worth the time and effort to read it .
If You Dislike Christianity , You ’ll Hate Buddhism !
by Robert M. Price
As a teacher of comparative Religion courses over many years , I have come to notice some surprising and even paradoxical things .
It is no surprise to me when certain students keep their minds as closed as a clenched fist because their fundamentalist upbringing demands it .
I know to expect it , especially since I felt that way myself when I was their age .
I try not to let it rest that way , though .
I have no trouble respecting various points of view , because I have no problem respecting individuals as persons , and their most intimate beliefs are a part of them .
I think Rousseau had the same thing in mind when he observed that one cannot live in harmony with one ’s neighbor so long as one really believes one ’s neighbor is damned to Hell .
But accepting their belief insofar as they cherish it is another thing than accepting it as on a par with other options when the belief has nothing going for it , no leg to stand on .
For instance a servant of truth simply cannot dignify Creationism by treating it as a scientific alternative deserving equal time in the class room .
Anyone who knows the first thing about scientific method and the nature of theorizing knows Creationism does not belong in the game .
You do n’t enter a horse in a dog race .
Thus as a teacher , your responsibility is to use Creationism as a foil to demonstrate what the scientific approach really is , and it is not a set of particular conclusions but rather a method of arriving at ( tentatively held ) conclusions .
“ I ’ve made up my mind ; do n’t confuse me with the facts ! “
In the same way , if education is your game , you cannot allow it to appear that you respect and thus appear to legitimate narrow - mindedness .
Like a good Zen Master , your business is to ask disturbing Socratic questions , to coax the truth out from within the student .
For instance , I like to suggest that the person who says “ I ’ve made up my mind ; do n’t confuse me with the facts , ” is making me think the opposite of what they want me to think .
Do they have great faith ?
Instead , I ca n’t help but think that deep down , they already know the jig is up !
You do n’t lock up the barn that tight unless you know the horse wants out !
They must know their faith would never survive a close look at certain facts .
Trying to preserve the illusion , they are only making it more obvious that they know it is an illusion after all .
I merely point this out .
“ there are plenty of fundamentalist nonbelievers ”
As I say , I am not too surprised to find this attitude prevalent among fundamentalist Christian students .
But it has surprised me on occasion to discover the same sort of mind set present in other quarters .
For instance , there are plenty of fundamentalist nonbelievers : people who have left fundamentalism behind in terms of doctrine , but who have only redoubled it as an attitude .
Just scan the letters pages of certain Rationalist and Free Thought periodicals .
Once I read a letter from an ex-fundamentalist boasting of his various efforts at propagating the lack of faith .
This poor fellow was making a spectacle of himself by passing out atheistic handbills on the street corner , printing up atheist bumper stickers , etc .
In short , he had given up religion only to preserve what most of us would consider its most odious and onerous aspects !
For such a person , the tag “ ex- fundamentalist ” denotes merely another sub - type of fundamentalism , like “ neo- fundamentalist ” or “ hyper- fundamentalist . ”
But , again , I can empathize with this one , pathetically ironic as it is , because I have succumbed to this one , too .
“ denoting more of a New Ager than any traditional sort of Buddhist ”
But we seem never to learn .
I can remember some fifteen years ago when my wife Carol and I dropped by to visit Maryanne , a classmate of my wife , and her husband .
Carol had told me she was a convert to Buddhism –which today may mean anything , often denoting more of a New Ager than any traditional sort of Buddhist .
After all , if you really believe Cyril Henry Hoskins , AKA Tuesday Lobsang Rampa , is a Buddhist , you may think you are , too , even if you are as far from the Dharma as he was .
As we opened a polite conversation , it rapidly developed that Maryanne took a rather non-Buddhistic stance toward Christianity .
That is to say , her third eye was somewhat jaundiced when it came to Christianity .
She proceeded to fulminate bitterly against its psychological and theological inadequacies .
You can imagine the usual line about the destructive self - hatred and guilt over the physical body that Christianity fosters .
Then she went on to denigrate the bloody superstition of the substitutionary atonement of Christ on the cross .
“ My chosen strategy was to show how she was reading Buddhism even more selectively than she was reading Christianity ”
Let ’s get one thing straight .
I agreed with these critiques .
At the time I still maintained some sort of vague Christian identity myself , albeit of a rather left - wing Tillichian brand .
My approach then was to try to “ purify ” Christian existence from these various phobias and superstitions , get to the philosophical / psychological meat of the thing .
I have since given up the enterprise .
But I felt the gauntlet had been thrown down and I made ready to reply .
I figured the best defense was a good offense .
Thus I sought not to defend Christianity ( I could n’t have defended those aspects in good faith anyway ) .
But neither did I consider attacking Buddhism , which then as now I revere as a true religion .
My chosen strategy was to show how she was reading Buddhism even more selectively than she was reading Christianity .
Surely , I ventured , she could not be unaware of the fact that the very doctrinal features she despised in their Christian avatars were not only present in but absolutely central to historic mainstream Buddhism !
I ’m not sure what she took Buddhism to mean , but it ’s a safe bet all the Buddhist faithful in China , Mongolia , Tibet , Sikkim , Bhutan , Nepal , Korea , and Japan ( to say nothing of that ancient stronghold of Oriental mysticism , Colorado ) would not agree with her .
For Mahayana Buddhism is solidly based on the Bodhisattva doctrine .
Southern Asian Buddhism , Theravada ( or Hinayana , as the Mahayana call it ) , is a spare and logically simpler scheme of attaining Nirvana through self - effort aimed at extinguishing the apparent self , or ego .
“ the Lords of the Mahayana rejected such a goal as selfish … ”
But the Lords of the Mahayana rejected such a goal as selfish in aim and in means .
Instead , they believed , all Buddhists ought to emulate Gautama Buddha himself who , after all , did not yield to the temptation of Mara that he should leave this poor world behind and pass forever into his own Nirvana at once .
For the sake of poor mortals , Samsara addicts , the Lord Buddha deferred his own rightful Nirvana .
And so should we !
And given the fact that all beings share the Buddha nature and are thus capable of eventual Buddhahood , it is finally nonsensical to suggest that I can be saved without you and everyone else being saved .
It ’s all or nothing .
This means , as the Buddha is made to reveal to his disciples in the Saddharma Pundarika ( The Lotus of the True Law ) , that even the 24 previous Buddhas ( including Dipankara , the one under whose tutelage Gautama Buddha first heard the Dharma preached many ages before ) are still active behind the scenes in the Sambogkhya , the penultimate realm of existence where the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas dwell like celestial gods , answering prayers and otherwise aiding poor mortals who need a hand up .
One ought to take the vow to embark on the path to Buddhahood , and once one does so , one counts as a Bodhisattva ( a Buddha - to - be ) .
This is a long and hard row to hoe , but you ’d be spending the time in pointless reincarnations anyway , so why not ?
Through countless lifetimes of toil and self - sacrifice for the good of others , the Bodhisattva earns good karma far in excess of that necessary to win his wings ( as Clarence does in It ’s a Wonderful Life ) .
He has to be in the business of doing good works to become worthy of Bodhisattvahood .
Now , who ’s the Bodhisattva to do these good works for ?
This works out rather well for the vast majority of Buddhist laity who have not the stamina to undertake the Greater Career .
They are doing their bit by financially supporting the earthly Bodhisattvas ( as they did the Theravadin monks down south ) and by praying to the heavenly ones , as their ancestors used to pray to the Vedic gods .
Eventually the store of supererogatory merit amassed by the Bodhisattvas was believed so great that they could grant not only worldly boons but actual salvation itself !
“ By hook and by crook , Mahayana Buddhism eventually evolved a salvation scheme ”
We think that the Buddha taught that there was no grace upon which to draw to gain Nirvana , since the whole idea was to change your own frame of mind , nullify the ego , which in the nature of the case only you can do .
But by hook and by crook , Mahayana Buddhism eventually evolved a salvation scheme by which certain virtuosos , like the Buddha himself , might in fact offer such saving grace to those calling upon them in faith .
By such an act of receptive faith the believer is allowed to draw upon the store of good Karma gained by the Bodhisattvas by their good works .
It will be transferred to the believers ’ accounts as if it had been their own achievement .
Does this sound familiar ?
It will sound even more so .
For some Bodhisattvas , in order to gain still more abundant good Karma , will voluntarily submit to the tortures of the numerous spectacular Hells of Buddhist eschatology .
Avalokiteshvara and his brethren are in this fashion undergoing expiatory suffering in your place and for your benefit .
In Pure Land Buddhism , fantastically popular in Japan where it spread from China and India , we witness the ultimate spinning out of the logic of this redemptive theology .
A long succession of Pure Land patriarchs , basing their teachings on the Longer and Shorter Sukhavati Sutras ( = Pure Land Scriptures ) , sought to refine the meaning of salvation by grace through faith alone .
Their Sutras have Gautama taking the role of John the Baptist , singing the greater glories of Amitabha Buddha , an ancient king who , hearing the preaching of a contemporary Buddha , renounced the throne and took up the discipline of the Bodhisattva .
“ … accumulated Karmic ‘ Green Stamps ’ … ”
His strategy was to put all of his accumulated Karmic “ Green Stamps ” toward the creation of a “ Pure Land , ” a world in which one need only be reborn to achieve the stage of non-returning , the seventh stage of the Bodhisattva path ( something that would otherwise take unthinkable eons of good works , as it did in the case of Amitabha himself ) .
At the end of one lifetime in the Sukhavati , one would infallibly attain Buddhahood .
And how was to one guarantee one ’s reservations ?
Aye , there ’s the rub .
The text said one need only call on Amitabha ’s name three times , and that would do it .
But the various patriarchs sought to determine , with all the introspective micro-scrutiny of a medieval penance manual , precisely what mental condition constituted saving faith .
What meditations and attitudes were required ?
As always happens with introspective pietism ( read Watchman Nee , Andrew Murray , etc. ) what looked easy turns out to be arduous and confusing–or is made to be so .
Each subsequent patriarch narrowed the range of activity required , recognizing that the more a successful faith hinges upon one fulfilling certain conditions , the more salvation after all depends on one ’s own works ( “ Self - Power ” ) .
And this is incompatible with the doctrine that one needs grace to be saved in the first place .
On the one hand , we are so crushed beneath a burden of bad Karma that we would have no hope of ever working it off ourselves .
On the other , we live in a degenerate age when the Dharma is but dimly understood .
Facing Scylla and Charybdis in this way , we must be saved by grace ( “ Other - Power ” ) , or we will not be saved at all .
Hence the Pure Land theologians tried to circumvent the clever subterfuges of the self - exalting ego by placing complete and utter reliance on the Other - Power of Amitabha Buddha .
“ … wound up recapitulating Martin Luther and John Calvin ”
In the end , the Japanese patriarch Shinran wound up recapitulating Martin Luther and John Calvin : he taught that the first inkling of an inclination one felt to call upon the name of the Buddha was itself proof of Amitabha ’s prevenient ( anticipatory ) grace .
One could never have even sought such salvation without already having been given it !
We cannot even seek to repent unless we have already been regenerated by the unilateral grace of God .
If we were still sinners , we would think of nothing but continuing to sin .
There is no question of subtle Christian missionary influence .
It is just that the logic of piety , taught not to believe in its own power , and yet having to do something , however minimal and passive , always issues in the same solution , as it did also in Visistadvaita Vedanta Hinduism , which divided into the monkey school ( believers must hang on to God ’s grace like a baby monkey carried by its mother ) and the cat school ( momma cat simply carries her kittens by the scruff of the neck , like it or not ) .
Is all this a betrayal of Buddhism with its doctrine of self - reliance ?
Is all this a betrayal of Buddhism with its doctrine of self - reliance ?
They say no , since a religion based on the negation of self can hardly rely for its success on Self - Power !
Interesting point .
So here we have a religion containing the features of crippling original sin , bankrupt and worthless selfhood , salvation by passive faith in the vicarious sufferings of a redeemer ( actually a whole stable of them , as in the Catholic calendar of saints ) , and all of this derived from an infallible scripture , not from one ’s own cherished intuitions .
What is this religion ?
Buddhism .
Christianity .
Take your pick
If you prefer something less complex , something more self - reliant , you can always find revamped , streamlined versions of either religion .
But , as they stand , neither is all that much different from the other in broad outline .
When Maryanne embraced what she called Buddhism as an alternative to Christianity , she had merely exchanged six of one for half a dozen of the other , though she did n’t know about at least three of them !
“ If it happened to the one [ religion ] it would be surprising if it had n’t happened to the other too . ”
One might contend that Mahayana is a corrupt form of Buddhism , one that has lost sight of the vision of its Founder , whereas Christianity ’s corresponding doctrines are in continuity with the central vision of its Founder .
But this is the worst kind of special pleading .
If it happened to the one , it would be surprising if it had n’t happened to the other , too .
Max Scheler thought that both religions inevitably suffered the same fate because of the ever - recurrent pattern of religions that exalt a charismatic founder .
The founder is first lionized because of his summons for all to follow him in the heroic path .
He dies , and the followers form a sectarian community , living out his heroic ethic , necessarily in alienation from the conventional world around them .
But time passes and no one finds it any more so easy to live at such a fever pitch of piety and social radicalism .
They come to assimilate themselves to the world again , rationalizing this by means of deifying the founder .
Now that the life style he taught seems so far beyond the reach of even believers , they conclude his own heroic life must have been the result of his being a superhuman god .
Thus no one can be expected to emulate him , and his heroism ceases to be a role - model .
“ Mediocrity , here we come ! ”
Instead , the believers come to regard it as an act done on their behalf so as to absolve them of the sin of not being able to do it !
Mediocrity , here we come !
And then Luther , Shinran , and the others start in trying to eliminate any vestige of self - effort as impious , even though at first it had been the very basis of the founder ’s teaching !
Such a decline , plainly recognized , at least on some level , in Buddhism , is more characteristic neither of Christianity nor of Buddhism .
Why had my wife ’s friend been oblivious of all this ?
My guess is that , like many today , she had really adopted some form of Western pop self - realization therapy and , ironically , called it Buddhism .
Harvey Cox foresaw this trivializing trend in his 1977 book Turning East .
Shirley MacLaine can call it Buddhism , like Jim Baker calls his religion Christianity , but neither is fooling me .
It might be better to do what Herman Hesse advocated in his novel Siddhartha : follow the Buddha ’s path not by slavishly aping him , but by striking out on your own authentic dharma just as he did .
How else are you to imitate a great non-conformist except by refusing to conform to him ?
Have the courage of your own convictions !
Do n’t hide behind supposed authorities by bottling your own product and putting the Buddhist ( or Christian ) label on it .

If there ’s one thing all library users should be doing more , it ’s peeling back the layer of abstraction and seeing what ’s really happening underneath .
This is the only way to gain a true understanding of what the library provides , and who knows , maybe you ’ll find some gems that you did n’t know existed .
Libraries like jQuery are n’t very small when uncompressed .
Traversing a long source file trying to look for a specific method ’s implementation is far from ideal .
I have frequently found myself in this situation with jQuery , so today I decided to do something about it , and the result is viewable at https://j11y.io/jquery.
It allows you to study specific parts of jQuery ’s source .
You can type in a method name and you ’ll see its implementation straight away , in all its syntax - highlighted glory !
It will also link ’ify all function names within the presented source :
You can link directly to a method using the following URL pattern :
https://j11y.io/jquery/[version/]methodName
E.g. https://j11y.io/jquery/css
https://j11y.io/jquery/1.3.2/attr
https://j11y.io/jquery/jQuery.proxy
- OR - https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=version&fn=methodName
If you do n’t specify a version then 1.4 is assumed .
The source that ’s shown wo n’t be identical to the actual source , since this source viewer only works by toString ( ) ‘ing the functions .
I might eventually implement something a little more robust , but it ’s going to take time — finding a specific function ’s declaration in a source file is tricky , especially when they ’re not all defined with the straightforward method : function ( ) {...} or function foo ( ) {...} .
I did n’t really intend it to be an accurate depiction of the real source anyway — just something I ( and others ) could use to see how certain things are implemented within jQuery .
I hope you find it useful …
I know I will !
Thanks for reading !
Please share your thoughts with me on Twitter .
Have a great day !
Points - blown refers to the number of points a team has frittered away by losing or " half - losing " ( OTL / SOLs ) .
The official standings do n't take games - in - hand into consideration ; and organizing by winning percentage -- while precise -- is frankly hard ( at least for me ) to conceptualize when comparing two teams ' percentages .
I do n't know how far a team with a win % of .478 is behind a team with a .540 .
I have to look at the losses and OTL / SOLs .
Then I can see it .
Also , it bugs me that , in the " official " standings , an OTL / SOL can cause a team to rise in the standings , when in reality , it causes the team 's record to be worse .
In points - blown standings , an OTL / SOL can only cause a team to fall in the standings , which is as it should be .
Two points " awarded " for every loss , one point for every OTL / SOL .
Lowest point total is best .
Number in parentheses is the official standings ( via ESPN ) .
Last number (+/-) is number of points ( in my system ) ahead or behind Los Angeles .
Because it 's a Kings - centric universe .
So , tonight 's games ...
The Good : Blues lost , Coyotes lost , Predators lost , Wild lost , Flames * lost .
The Bad : Stars won .
The Bad but less relevant : The Sharks * , Avs and Jackets won .
( * I 'm going to go out on a limb and call the Sharks / Flames game .
Sharks are up 7 - 0 in the middle of the 3rd . )
Kings are two points from 4th , two points from 9th .
Chicago 26 ( 1 ) +13 San Jose 28 ( 2 ) +11 Colorado 36 ( 3 ) +3 Nashville 37 ( 4 ) +2 Vancouver 38 ( 6 ) +1 Phoenix 39 ( 5 ) 0 Los Angeles 39 ( 8 ) -- Detroit 40 ( 9 ) - 1 Calgary 42 ( 7 ) - 3 Dallas 45 ( 10 ) - 6 Anaheim 47 ( 11 ) - 8 St. Louis 47 ( 13 ) - 8 Minnesota 49 ( 12 ) - 10 Columbus 55 ( 14 ) - 16 Edmonton 59 ( 15 ) - 20
Tie breaker is games - played , except that the winner of the tie breaker is the team who has played more games .
If this seems counter - intuitive , consider this : A team with a 10 - 2 record is better than a team with a 2 - 2 record , who is , in turn better than a team that 's 0 - 2 .

Global shortage of Rare Earth Elements coming ...
Demand outstrips supply
Can we mine it elsewhere ?
Some of the 17 rare earth elements
( Natural News )
It 's the bubble you 've probably never heard of : The .
And it 's due to pop in 2012 , potentially devastating the industries of western nations that depend on these rare elements .
What industries are those ?
The automobile industry uses tens of thousands of tons of rare earth elements each year , and advanced military technology depends on these elements , too .
Lots of " green " technologies depend on them , including wind turbines , low - energy light bulbs and hybrid car batteries .
In fact , much of western civilization depends on rare earth elements such asandSo what 's the problem with these rare elements ? , and China is prepared to simply stop exporting these strategic elements to the rest of the world by 2012 .
If that happens , by the collapse of available rare earth elements .
Manufacturing of everything from computers and electronics to farm machinery will grind to a halt .
Electronics will disappear from the shelves and prices for manufactured goods that depend on these rare elements will skyrocket .
These 17 rare earth elements ( REE ) -- all of which are metals -- areupon which entire nations are built .
In many ways , they are similar to -- a resource so valuable and important to the world that many experts call it the " fourth most important natural resource in the world , " right after water , steel and oil .
Without rubber , you could n't drive your car to work or water your lawn .
Many medical technologies would cease to work and virtually all commercial construction would grind to a halt .
Many of the strategic battles fought in World War II were fought , in fact , over control of , most of which now comes through Singapore and its surrounding regions ( Malaysia and Indonesia ) .
Now , by threatening to cut off the world 's supply of rare earth elements , China appears to be attempting to monopolize this extremely important strategic resource .
According to information received by , by 2012 China may cease all exports of rare earth elements , reserving them for its own economic expansion .
An article in that paper quotes REE expert Jack Lifton as saying , " A real crunch is coming .
In America , Britain and elsewhere we have not yet woken up to the fact that there is an urgent need to secure the supply of rare earths from sources outside China .
" And yet virtually no one has heard of this problem !
People are familiar with peak oil , global warming , ocean acidification , the national debt and the depletion of fossil water , but very few are aware of the looming crisis in rare metals ... upon which much of western civilization rests .
For those who still are n't convinced this is a big deal , consider this :
Without rare earth elements , .
Yeah , I know .
That 's a disaster , huh ?
We would have no fiber optic cables , either .
No X - ray machines , no car stereos and no high - tech missile guidance systems for the military .
And here 's the real kicker :
The problem with the supply of rare earth elements is that demand has skyrocketed over the last decade from 40,000 tons to 120,000 tons .
Meanwhile , China has been cutting its exports .
Now , it only exports about 30,000 tons a year -- only one - fourth of the demand the world needs .
In order to build more " green " technologies , the world will need 200,000 tons of rare earth elements by 2014 , predicts .
Yet China now threatens to drop exports to exactlyby 2012 .
It is n't hard to do the math on this : Without China 's exports , Kiss your " green " wind turbines good - bye .
And your Toyota Prius production lines , too .
No more iPhones and iPods either .
Without these rare earth elements , entire industries grind to a halt .
China is n't the only geographic region where these rare earth elements are found , but constructing mines to pull these elements out of the ground takes many years .
Some mines are under construction right now in other countries that could help fill the demand for REEs , but making them operational is " five to ten years away , " says Lifton .
That means these other mines wo n't really be operational until 2015 - 2020 .
Meanwhile , China could cut off its supply in 2012 .
That leaves a 3 - 7 year gap in which these rare earth elements will be in disastrously short supply .
This brings up a couple of very important realizations related to investments :
It is almost certain that the prices for rare earth elements will skyrocket over the next 2 - 5 years .
This creates a huge investment opportunity for people willing to take a risk and bet their money on rising prices of these metals .
There 's another big investment opportunity here , too : .
As prices leap higher , it will become more economically feasible to harvest rare earth elements out of garbage dumps and landfills where people are discarding electronics such as motors , computers , sound systems and other such items .
Some smart entrepreneur will no doubt make a fortune by setting up and operating a rare earth element reclamation operation of some kind .
These elements , after all , are n't destroyed when they 're thrown away .
They sit around in the trash for eons , just waiting to be reclaimed and re-used .
Lead , for example , is a metal that is successfully recycled today .
Something like 85 % of all the lead used in America today is reclaimed out of lead - acid batteries and other similar devices .
If similar programs could be initiated for the rare metals , we could go a long way towards meeting society 's demand for these elements without having to keep mining them out of the ground .
Because let 's face it : .
That 's part of the contradiction in " green " technologies , by the way :
To manufacture them , you need rare metals mined out of ecologically disastrous operations in China .
It 's the ( literal ) " dirty little secret " of the green industry .
All these wind turbines , solar panels , hybrid car batteries and fiber optics may seem green to the consumer , but behind them there 's a very dirty mining business that rapes the planet and pollutes the rivers in order to recover these " green " rare metals .
In any case , unless scientists find less - rare alternatives to many of these rare earth metals , we are looking at a serious global supply crunch for the years 2012 - 2020 .
Add the " rare earth elements bubble " to your list of other bubbles to watch out for in the years ahead .

What were they smoking ?
LOCKED in a vault within the North Carolina Department of Revenue is a lickable bit of Kafka : a government - issued stamp that is expected to remain unpurchased , but which users of illegal goods must , by law , affix to substances they are not allowed to possess .
North Carolina is one of about 20 states that tax illegal drugs .
The cost varies by state and weight , as does the stamps ' appearance ( Nebraska's , with a skull surmounting a syringe and joint , looks like Grateful Dead tribute art ) .
Penalties for non-payment also vary , from being classed as a misdemeanour in Georgia to 200 % of the tax plus $ 10,000 or five years in prison in Louisiana .
Few , if any , drug users actually buy the stamps .
Most of those sold in Kansas , for instance , go to collectors .
And according to a Mobile newspaper , the director of investigations for Alabama 's revenue department said the state never expected actually to sell stamps to drug users .
Instead , the tax exists to further punish those arrested for possession by making them liable to penalties for tax evasion if their drugs are stampless , as they almost invariably are .
And those penalties can be lucrative : over the past decade Kansas has collected $ 10.3 m .
If legislators feel that drug users get off too lightly , they could simply increase the criminal penalties , rather than creating a new class of crime that requires the involvement of another government agency .
As it is , these laws are not merely convoluted , but have often been found unconstitutional .
In 1994 the US Supreme Court ruled that because Montana 's illegal - drug tax was a second punishment for a single crime it amounted to double jeopardy .
Other states ' drug - tax schemes have also been challenged on constitutional grounds .
In response some states have scrapped or modified their schemes , usually by allowing buyers of the stamps to remain anonymous or by forbidding revenue departments from telling law enforcement when someone buys the stamps .
The concept of taxing illegal drugs punitively dates back to the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 .
This did not ban the drug outright ; it subjected anyone who dealt in it commercially to a nominal tax but an onerous array of regulations and criminal penalties for non-compliance .
Bureaucracy lives on .
Heavy Rain is the type of game that we claim to want more of : story - driven , high - concept , and emotionally affecting .
We have played a lengthy demo for a preview , and have the final copy in our office right now , but have yet to tackle the final code as we approach the title 's release on February 23 .
What we know about the game however , from interviews and our own hands - on time , leads us to believe that the title has a very rough time ahead of it both critically and at retail .
In many ways , Heavy Rain seems nearly designed to fail .
It 's also one of the games Sony is going to be able to point to for a long time as evidence of the company 's bravery in supporting new and unique intellectual property .
Will boutique appeal be enough of a return on investment , however ?
This is unexplored emotional territory
Gaming is used to taking complex ideas and boiling them down to something simple .
The Divine Comedy has been made into a God of War clone , after all .
Mass Effect 2 dealt with some serious issues , granted , but it did that by sandwiching them between action - heavy shooting sequences .
You had to think about the reproductive rights of an entire species , but you also knew you were just a few minutes away from blowing something up .
Heavy Rain deals with parenthood , and the tragedies that keep parents up at night .
In one heartbreaking scene , you sit next to your son and hope he says something to you .
A schedule for his visit is pasted on the wall .
Look at this scene in a certain way , and nothing happens .
From another perspective , this is one of the most mature moments in modern gaming .
The question is , do gamers want real maturity ?
As gamers , we play to escape .
We like being the good guy , and when we are n't , we like being able to go over the top in our badness .
Morality is a binary choice in gaming : do we rescue or harvest the Little Sisters ?
Gaming has n't had the freedom that books and movies enjoy to create a work that is hard to watch and leaves you feeling unsettled .
There will be no gaming version of Precious .
The story of Hotel Rwanda will never be experienced as a game .
It will be hard to make the gaming equivalent of Requiem for a Dream a hit .
The controls
Heavy Rain 's controls may seem like quick - time events at first , but they 're no different than the contextual button presses in other games ... dismissing the action scenes as quick - time events is easy , but also inaccurate .
In a game of choices , complaining that your reflexes need to be tested is somewhat disingenous ; arguing about how , visually , a cue to hit a button is displayed on screen when every game is simply hitting buttons to control actions is likewise a little lame .
Think of Heavy Rain as a graphically enhanced adventure title , perhaps , and you 'll do better .
Heavy Rain breaks the controls of your life down into discrete actions : you 'll have to shake your controller to brush your teeth , you need to dry yourself after taking a shower .
In an early scene in the demo you play swords with your children .
Starting a car may take multiple steps .
This is all done for a reason , to make you feel like you 're in the middle of an actual life , in a real place — but when gamers see screenshots with pictures of buttons overlaid on the action , they 're going to think quick - time events , a conceit that many — including us in the past — have very little patience for .
Gamers recoil from real consequences
It 's rare that a game asks you to make an actual decision , one that matters , and those that play games know that taking back an action is as easy as reloading a previous save .
Even games that appear to offer you a choice almost never do ; in the end , the two paths will meet up in the same place , or will reward or punish you by playing a different movie at the end of the game .
" I like the fact I can play the game I want to play , and not have a disadvantage compared to someone else who played a different way , " Carlos Cuello , the lead programmer on Bioshock 2 , told us when we asked about how harvesting or saving the Little Sisters made almost no difference to ADAM collected or the rest of the game play in the first title .
You can make whatever choice you want , but you wo n't be praised or punished for any of them .
In the demo of Heavy Rain given to the press , you could make bad decisions , and people will die .
They wo n't come back .
The game features four characters , and you can lead them to their death , or guide them safely through the game .
" There 's no such thing as failure or winning or losing ; you 're creating a story .
We have four characters , and any one of them can die at any point , and the story continues .
It 's just that character 's storyline has been removed from your story , " Petro Piaseckyj , Managing Producer for SCEA , told Ars .
If everyone in the game dies , that 's not a bad thing .
" You have n't failed .
You 've created a tragedy , " Piaseckyj explained .
To see everything in the game , you 'll need to play through multiple times .
The death of a character closes certain doors and opens others .
Every decision you make , every misstep and every near - failure creates a story .
Gamers are used to being able to reload and take back their decisions — and to some extent Heavy Rain will also allow that — but the game will be given a new gravity if you 're willing to allow yourself your failures and continue to play .
Will that be a trip gamers are willing to take ?
In conclusion
Heavy Rain is a unique and singular game , and it 's certainly something new .
Sony should be applauded by giving it the time and budget required to bring something this ambitious to market .
It could be destined for the world of cult favorites , but the challenges inherent in both the story and presentation give the mainstream almost too many excuses to check out .
We still have n't played the final version of the game , and this is one of the rare titles that leaves us not knowing exactly what will happen when we do .
No matter what the quality of the final version is — and we do wish Quantic Dream had hired American voice actors instead of what sounds like French men and women who speak English — it 's clear that the world of gaming is going to be made richer by its release .
For that , we 're glad Sony took the risk to try something new , no matter our skepticism at its ultimate fate .

The World from Berlin ' Germany Is Not Armed for War '
The scandal drags on over what exactly happened on that night in September when a German soldier called in a deadly air strike in Afghanistan .
The German press is scathing in its criticism of the government 's handling of the incident and most papers blame the debacle on Berlin 's reluctance to admit it is at war .
Taxpayers will foot the bill for big polluters under an opposition plan that will rely primarily on the government paying for measures to offset carbon emissions .
The coalition party room has been briefed this morning on an alternative to the government 's emissions trading scheme .
Sources have told smh.com.au that it relies heavily in reducing carbon by sequestering it in soil , and also includes tree planting .
It proposes that the government will spend about $ 1 billion a year buying carbon offsets to keep pollution levels down and meet the aim of reducing emissions by 5 per cent by 2020 .

I ’ve been thinking with increasing irritation about that perennial conundrum - within - an - enig ma - which - actually - is n ’t - that - difficult - at - all : the separation of church and state , this time in the context of gay marriage .
The issue becomes more annoying the more headspace I give it , and it ’s not the prejudice or the public protests or the proclamations of any group on either side .
The question that makes my brain twitch is this : why is this even an issue ?
I firmly believe that the followers of any given religion have the perfect right to include , exclude and / or vilify anyone they choose .
I further believe that their right to express their group disapproval stops absolutely short of causing their chosen bugaboo any actual harm … as in , breaking the laws enacted by the larger secular state in order to protect all its citizens .
Those laws , we hope , evolve in specificity and efficacy as our understanding of what constitutes demonstrable societal or individual harm evolves as well .
The American legal system has always possessed the power to control , modify or ban religious practices on these grounds : for example , in direct contradiction of Biblical precedent and many current religious beliefs , women are no longer owned by their husbands , twelve - year - old girls are off limits and public stoning for adultery has been replaced by Facebook flaming .
Another example : the general population , excluding certain Louisiana JOP ’s , has eventually come to understand that a union between two people of differing overall skin pigmentation does not lead to apocalyptic plagues or children with multiple heads ( also , that allowing humans to own other humans is a damaging economic construct , not to mention leading to some rather hard feelings in general ) .
Had the original Southern Baptist Conference ( and by “ original , ” I mean the SBC from 1845 until 1995 ) been able to retain a state - sanctioned grasp on the laws of the Southern states , slavery would still be legal , “ miscegenation ” would still be a crime and hundreds of thousands of lawn jockeys would still be on proud display across the land of Dixie .
The Southern Baptist Conference was created to support these ideas : in defiance of the views of other Baptist congregations , but with the full support of Messieurs Leviticus and Nehemiah , to name only two .
The Old Testament is all for concubines , slaves and massacres , but not intermarriage among tribes .
Is this our best authority on human relations ?
And what about the endless variations on marriage sanctioned by religions just as legitimate as Decent Christians Everywhere Inc ?
Why are n’t we respecting their traditions ?
Why are we letting widows remarry , those whores ( Hinduism ) ?
Why are n’t we letting Islamic American men who can afford it collect the four wives to whom they ’re entitled ?
Who ’s in charge here ?
The Founding Fathers , those whacked - out Deists , should have left us some instructions about which religion is right so we would know whose tenets to make law … oh .
Wait .
They did mention it .
NONE OF THEM .
In a democratically - based society , the general idea is that we do n’t let small groups dictate to everyone , in the belief that time , evolving understanding and the collective better judgment of a larger group of citizens usually works out better for everyone .
When small groups , or large groups , or individual states or Bible - beating rednecks do attempt to tar and feather someone , we can take their asses to courts which represent successively larger segments of the population and hope that somewhere along the line , better judgment and better education will prevail .
I do n’t give a damn what happens in anyone ’s church if the law is n’t being broken , if children are n’t being abused , if the Kool - Aid is untainted .
And if a particular religious sect decided that I was by nature a lesser human being , I think I ’d leave .
Wait , make that I know I ’d leave – that ’s essentially why I do n’t consider organized religion a tool that ’s safe for most people to play with .
Any system of thought which approves and allows the dehumanization of certain other humans is risky stuff .
No religion owns marriage : the concept , the reality or the word itself .
Religions have their own variations on the theme and every right to them .
Marry ( or do n’t ) anyone that you like ( or hate ( or sadly but firmly condemn ) ) .
Your religious definition , Ms. Christian or Mr. Sikh ( and you do NOT want to go to the dictionary on this ) , is yours to live by .
But please try to understand : pair - bonding predates religion ; stable , wealth - creating , ably - parenting households are the true and demonstrable societal benefit of such bonds ; and there ’s not one iota of real evidence that a pair of the same gender does n’t work just as well … and your talking shrubbery or flaming cow , while inspirational and possibly entirely real , is no excuse for ignoring science , history and simple justice .
Happy Valentine 's Day .
By the way , did you know your copy of Windows 7 is counterfeit ?
Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) is sending a belated valentine to Windows 7 users next week -- an update to its Windows Activation Technologies ( WAT ) .
" This update will detect more than 70 known and potentially dangerous activation exploits , " Joe Williams , general manager of Microsoft 's Genuine Windows program , said in a post on the Genuine Windows blog Thursday .
According to Microsoft , users running pirated copies of its software are at much higher risk of encountering all kinds of malware attacks -- malicious code embedded with the license key breaking software -- than users with legitimate copies .
That 's dangerous for users , and it damages the software maker through lost revenues .
The idea of WAT is to simply repeatedly notify users when the Microsoft software that they 're running has been pirated -- and not in the strong arm way that Microsoft did in earlier times .
The update , which users will be able to begin downloading on Tuesday , is voluntary .
It will initially be available via the Genuine Microsoft Software page on Microsoft 's site , followed the next day by the company 's downloads page .
Later in the month , the update , prosaically named the Windows Activation Technologies Update for Windows 7 , will be offered to users by Microsoft 's Windows Update site .
Unlike similar earlier updates , however -- when WAT was still known as Window Genuine Advantage , or WGA -- this update will be categorized as " important " rather than " critical . "
That is it will not force or trick users into downloading it .
The end of WGA - style harassment ?
That 's a significant change from WGA 's heyday .
In fact , WGA 's notifications that a copy of Windows was counterfeit were not only annoying , but would result in a PC that was running a suspect copy of Windows being all but shut down -- putting it into what Microsoft called " reduced functionality " mode .
WGA 's annoying behaviors , such as " checking in " with Microsoft frequently , and sometimes yielding false positives , resulted in a user lawsuit against the company in 2006 .
That lawsuit was dismissed just a week ago .
" The [ WAT ] update will determine whether Windows 7 installed on a PC is genuine and will better protect customers '
PCs by making sure that the integrity of key licensing components remains intact , " Williams ' blog post said .
If not , instead of shutting down Windows , it will inform and remind the user that the software is not " genuine . "
It will do so by turning off the wallpaper on the desktop , and by periodically popping up notices informing the user that the PC is not running a legitimate copy of Windows 7 and explaining how to get a valid copy .
One other thing , WAT still phones home every 90 days to pass along data about any illicit copies , though Microsoft claims it will not collect any personally identifiable information .

An Alameda County Superior Court judge Thursday ordered Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to halt thrice - monthly furloughs for tens of thousands of state workers , saying the administration overstepped its authority in approving the unpaid days off .
A spokesman for Schwarzenegger said the governor would appeal the decision of Judge Frank Roesch in favor of three state employee unions , including the Service Employees International Union Local 1000 .
The unions had filed suit after the governor began the furloughs in February , in response to a multibillion - dollar budget shortfall .
The judge ruled that the governor ’s use of the state Emergency Services
Act to furlough state workers because the state did not have a budget at the time had limits .
“ The emergency necessitating them was the failure of the Legislature to pass the budgets , though the reach of the orders extended long after those budgets were subsequently passed and signed into law , ” the judge wrote .
Roesch also ruled that furloughing state employees who are paid from special funds interferes illegally with the operation of specially funded agencies .
He said that the governor ’s use of furloughs was an “ abuse of discretion ” and that he “ violated a mandatory duty to take into account the agencies ’ varying needs before reducing workplace hours . ”
The governor plans to appeal Roesch ’s decision and noted that the order blocking the furloughs would be stayed until the appeal is ruled on , said Aaron McLear , a spokesman for Schwarzenegger .
“ Ultimately this will be decided by the state Supreme Court , ” McLear said .
“ The governor absolutely has the authority to issue furloughs , and we feel the state Supreme Court will rule in our favor . ”
The lawsuit was also filed by the California Attorneys , Administrative Law Judges and Hearing Officers in State Employment and the Union of American Physicians and Dentists .
The judge ordered the governor to “ cease and desist ” the furlough of specific employees .
The furloughs were pitched by the governor as a way to reduce the shortfall in the state general fund , but the judge noted that it affected workers paid by separate special funds , including those who handle Social Security disability claims and those in Department of Motor Vehicles offices funded with license fees .
The judge ’s order affects at least 52,000 state workers represented by SEIU , according to Yvonne Walker , the union ’s president .
“ I am ecstatic .
I ’m feeling vindicated , ” Walker said .
“ We said all along that the governor ’s actions were illegal . ”
The union had negotiated a contract with a 5 % pay reduction , while the furloughs had the affect of cutting pay by nearly 15 % , Walker said .
State Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) agreed with Walker that the governor should return to the bargaining table and negotiate an agreement with the unions .
“ The court ruling issues a clear directive to the governor :
Sit down and negotiate with state employees to develop a rational labor agreement , ” Steinberg said .
“ State employees can help find budget savings that wo n’t make hard - working people bear all of the sacrifice and deprive Californians of critically important public services . ”

How To Create Your Own Self - Hypnosis Audio – Then Listen To It !
26 SHARES Share Tweet
Here is a simple guideline that shows you how to make your own self - hypnosis audio that you can later listen to to help improve motivation , habit change , and other aspects of self improvement .
Materials needed
A microphone , MP3 recorder , or way of recording your voice .
Basic audio editing software ( Audacity is a popular free one .
There are probably some options that come with your computer too – I used Garageband . )
If you already have some talent with music feel free to incorporate that .
What is hypnosis ?
Think of hypnosis as nothing more than the power of suggestion .
Whether you are talking to a friend , listening to something on the radio , watching a movie , or just thinking a thought – you are being suggested some sort of idea , belief , or attitude .
Bad hypnosis is when the suggestion does n’t hook .
It goes in one ear and out the other and we remain unaffected .
Maybe we were just too bored or apathetic to really pay attention to what was being said or our critical mind found the suggestion to be bogus .
Good hypnosis is when a suggestion captivates you and creates a change .
It is like being moved by a really compelling movie .
Anything that peaks your interest and makes you tune in more intently can be considered a form of good hypnosis , such as a historic speech , watching a big sports event , or reading a fantastic book .
It concentrates your attention , keeps your mind engaged , and leaves an imprint on your brain .
How do affirmations relate to hypnosis ?
A popular form of hypnosis within the personal development niché is affirmations .
When the technique was first introduced as a tool for psychotherapy by Émile Coué in the late 19th century , when it was first called autosuggestion .
If you do n’t yet know what an affirmation is it is basically this : you create suggestions for yourself towards certain changes in feelings , thoughts , or behaviors .
For example :
“ I will be more friendly to people I do n’t know . ”
“ I will try not to overreact when I get angry . ”
“ I will spend more time at the gym . ”
“ I will pay better attention to my eating habits . ”
These are all affirmations but you can structure them in all kinds of different ways .
Different language patterns may be more or less effective depending on the suggestion and the person being suggested to .
Since you are writing your own suggestions , you should experiment and find what ways work best for you .
Writing your own script
What types of suggestions do you think will work best on you ?
This part takes a bit of experimentation and practice .
You wo n’t necessarily nail it your first shot .
Some people respond better to direct suggestions that often come off as a command : “ Be a better listener !
Study more !
Watch less TV ! ”
Other people respond better to indirect suggestions such as , “ Imagine what your grades would be like if you studied more … ”
This is called an indirect suggestion – because there is an implicit message that your grades would most likely be better if you studied more .
For your first script , I recommend trying out both direct and indirect suggestions .
Do n’t be afraid to also incorporate things to visualize by starting sentences with ,
“ Picture this … . ”
“ Visualize that … ”
“ Imagine if … ”
“ See what happens when … . ”
The more vivid you make your suggestions , the more captivating and effective they will be .
People who have a naturally tendency towards good story telling or a strong imagination will have a distinct advantages over those who do n’t – but it is a skill that we can all develop with practice .
When adding visuals to your hypnosis script , consider including powerful metaphors and symbols that hold meaning and significance to you .
Try to make your first script a good 2 - 3 pages , double spaced , 12 sized font .
This should make your hypnosis track about 5 - 7 minutes if you pace your delivery appropriately .
You can structure the script in different ways or you can make it more stream - of - conscious – it really depends on the message you want to get across .
Some hypnosis scripts are designed to drive home a single point or lesson ( change a specific habit ) , while others are designed to simply develop a general good sense of well - being and motivation ( boost motivation and happiness ) .
The voice and delivery
Voice and delivery can be important in how suggestible your message is , but again it depends on the type of suggestion and also the person being suggested to .
Your tone matters .
For example you would n’t want to screech out “ Relax !! ! ” when you want someone to be in a relaxed state .
Similarly you do n’t want to have a boring and apathetic voice when you say , “ Be sexy and fun around others ! ”
Experiment , experiment , experiment !
Sometimes listening to a slow and drone -y voice can heighten your trance , while other times it can put you to sleep .
You do n’t want to fall asleep .
You want to be engaged .
Hypnosis is most effective when it is an adventure .
Add different colors and dynamics to your voice to amplify the importance of the message and keep your attention fixated .
When you read the script ( or even if you are doing an impromptu script ) you want to role play the experience as you speak it .
You want to be there as you tell the story .
The more engaged you are when you deliver , the more engaged you will be when you listen back .
It is just a basic rule of all good communication .
Ways to improve your “ final product ”
Once you are done recording the main script , there are certain things you can do to make the listen even more attractive and enjoyable .
You could add music that compliments the message .
Good music for hypnosis should fit well in the background and not take away from the language of the track .
It should be designed to create a certain mood or feeling .
Sometimes a sense of inspiration or awe can make the strongest impression .

You can create another overlaying script .
Often practiced in the form of “ dual induction hypnosis , ” it is when two hypnotists are giving suggestions at the same time .
With the wonders of modern technology , you can create a dual induction all by yourself .
With some basic audio editing you can even pan one voice to the left and the other voice to the right .
So you will have a different exchange of suggestions going into each ear .
This can be used as a way to create stimulus overload , often resulting in confusion , which is a very great way to amplify trance states .

Add effects to the voices .
A little bit of echo and reverb never hurt anyone .
Sure , it may make your voice sound like some robot from a cheesy 80s scifi movie , but it can make your voice easier to listen to and be fixated on .
For “ edginess ” you can add some distortion or flanger .
Most basic audio-editing softwares ( including Audacity which I recommended above ) have some pre-packaged effects that you should be able to use .

Do panning and volume changes throughout the track .
This may be something that only experienced audiophiles can do , but by having your voice shifting between speakers and changing volumes is one really fantastic way to keep your track engaging .
My example
You can download my first attempt here ( not currently available , sorry ! ) .
My original intention was to do a dual induction : with self - improvement suggestions on one side and world - improvement suggestions on the other side .
I did n’t write a script for this one , just recorded each track individually , stream - of - consciousness .
Each recording was 10 minutes and then I just overlapped them and added some reverb , echo , and distortion ( only because I felt my voice sounded too dry and weak without the effects ) .
After the scripts were recorded I created a simple synthesizer sample using Reason ( it is a program for electronic music makers ) .
I basically improvised an organ / space -y synth sound to go with the suggestions .
What I learned to help improve future recordings :
I need to make my voice more animated .
The music is a bit cheesy and simple , but it does have an interesting drone / trance - inducing effect .
Because I did n’t write a script , the message of the audio is a bit scattered and incoherent .
Creating this kind of confusion is n’t necessarily bad for creating a hypnotic effect , but writing a script with something more coherent and structured is usually better .
There will always be room for improvement whether it be writing better scripts , stronger vocal delivery , or even becoming a more intent listener to the final product .
What I learned from the creative process in general :
Making your own self - hypnosis tracks can be really fun .
The act of putting together the project in - itself is a great exercise in personal development .
It is a great way to express yourself .
Listen to it with an open mind !
Once you finish your creation you will be eager to listen ( and re-listen ) to it .
I recommend doing this whenever you have time set aside to close your eyes , relax , and really immerse yourself in the experience .
It could be early in the morning before you get to work , or during a lunch break , or late at night before bed .
Try listening to it every other day for a week and then continue with it on a weekly basis .
Consider it your daily mantra or prayer , a healthy reminder of the things that matter to you in life and the things you want to improve .
Do n’t be afraid to also listen to it with a critical eye .
Jot down some ways you can improve your next recording .
Pay extra attention to which suggestions “ clicked ” with you and which ones just passed by .
Work on developing better language , better delivery , and more colorful and dynamic tracks .
Follow these principles and you will be the king of your world in no time .
I mean it .
Stay updated on new articles and resources in psychology and self improvement :
So , there we have all this oil , sitting in these nice thick oil shale beds out West and just waiting to turn some local in Colorado into the next " world 's richest person " .
All they have to do is to figure out how to get the oil out of the ground cheaply enough to make money from it .
( And if you remember from the last post on the subject there are over 2,000 patents on ways to do this - if it were that simple there would not be nearly that many ) .
Congress thinks so too , since the Energy Policy
Act of 2005 called oil shale a strategically important domestic resource ( pdf file ) .
More recently , there is currently a House bill in Committee governing oil shale development .
What 's the big deal ?
Drill a hole down there and it flows - is n't that how you get oil out of the ground ?
Well not in this case .
As I said last time the oil is really a waxy kerogen that does not want to flow at all .
And there is also a problem with the rock .
About 40 years ago a guy called Brace ( Ref 1 - sorry I ca n’t find these on the internet ) found that the cracks in a rock are related to the size of the grains of the material that make up the rock .
A rock with large grains has large cracks , and this gives it a permeability , which is the joining of these cracks to give a path through which oil ( or water or gas ) can flow through the rock .
It also gives the rock its porosity , which are the holes in the rock into which the oil can collect .
Unfortunately the grain size of the average particle in oil shale is around 5.8 microns .
This is about a tenth of the thickness of a human hair , medium human hair being about 60 - 90 microns wide .
As a result the typical oil shale has very poor porosity , and it is only when it has a high oil content ( above 50 gallons / ton ) that permeability can be easily measured ( Ref 2 ) , below 20 gal / ton it becomes very difficult , because it is so small .
The average grade is around 25 gal / ton .
The simple message from those numbers is that oil will not normally flow into any holes that are drilled into oil shale .
So where do we go from here ?
Well if you can't go to the mountain , then the mountain must come to you .
In other words , let 's mine the oil shale , bring it to the surface , and then get the oil out of it .
That ’s what they do in Canada with the oil sands , and these beds are thicker .
In fact the layers are thick enough so that they can be mined by a number of different ways , including surface mining , what we call room and pillar mining , and then by a third method that I will , for now , call sub - level stoping .
Remember that we need to break the rock down into pieces no bigger than 3 - inches in size for the retorts .
Union Oil ( now Unocal ) used the room and pillar method for their mine at Parachute Creek , where mining interest had , for a while , been growing again .
Room and pillar mining was also used for the Colony Mine , which was the largest project in hand back in the 1980's .
Since there have been a number of reasons suggested for the closing of that project , it might be appropriate to ask you to remember the words I quoted from Harold Carver last week .
What is needed is assurance that shale oil production will face a stable economic environment in which it can share in the spectrum of raw materials for our future energy needs .
And then read on :
Tosco 's interest in the Colony project was sold in 1979 , and again in 1980 , to Exxon Company for the Colony II development .
Exxon planned to invest up to $ 5 billion in a planned 47,000 bpd plant using a Tosco retort design .
After spending more than $ 1 billion , Exxon announced on May 2 , 1982 , that it was closing the project and laying off 2,200 workers .
. . . . .
The economic incentive for producing oil shale has long been tied to the price of crude oil .
The highest price that crude oil ever reached -- $ 87 / bbl ( 2005 dollars ) -- occurred in January 1981 .
Exxon 's decision to cancel its Colony oil shale project came a year and half later , after prices began to decline and newly discovered , less - costly - to - produce reserves came online .
. . . . oil had become plentiful , with about 8 to 10 million barrels per day in excess worldwide capacity , and the trend in rising oil prices had reversed after early 1981 .
The failure , in short , at that time became one due to economics , rather than technology .
Using a machine to mine the oil shale poses some problems , since it is much stronger than , for example , the tar sands of Alberta , that can be scooped up with a shovel .
Rather the rock has a strength that goes down as oil content goes up to a value of about 13,000 psi with an oil grade of 30 gal / ton , at which point it stabilizes even as the grade continues to increase .
This means that the openings for mining can be quite large , as they need to be to achieve the tonnages planned .
And there are ways to make them larger .
Rooms mined with the rock were some 55 - ft wide , with 58 - ft pillars .
It also means that the machines to grind the rock from the solid will need , either to be jet - assisted , or of relatively large size .
One of the first proposed ( for you EROI fans ) was designed to produce 17,500 tons per 2 - shift day , with an oil content of 40 gal / ton , and with 6.5 operating hours in a shift .
Machine power requirements would be 37,500 kwh per working day ( Ref. 3 ) .
The advantage of the large mining machines , over drill and blast methods , which remain the most common practice , is that the operation is continuous , with rock being carried away by conveyors , and production need not stop to ventilate away the products from the use of explosives .
On the other hand the use of explosives to fragment the rock does provide a relatively effective way to fracture it ( though with less size control ) .
One of the questions that I have always had , though , in doing EROI on explosive use is whether to count the energy input as that required to make the explosive , or that liberated when it is set off .
In the days when the industry was last planned , the throughput for single plants was considered to be on the order of 100,000 tons / day .
A ton occupies 16 cubic feet ( Ref 4 ) and so if the mine is 30 ft high , a cubic foot of floor space would have 2 tons of rock on it .
This would translate into having to mine 2.5 acres of rock per day .
The point has been made , however , that underground mining of layers of rock one slice at a time down through the deposit would be inefficient and energy intensive .
Further that it would be restricted only to mining the high grade layers .
The matter of mining , by underground methods , the rich , deep oil shale beds in the center of the basin probably needs little consideration because better methods of producing the resource appear to be at hand .
If our civilization has any conscience and if it has any regard for posterity it cannot give serious consideration to any method of production of shale oil from the center of the basin that does not result in substantially complete recovery .
Our civilization has passed the stage in which it can kill the whole buffalo merely to consume the tongue and liver as was done in this area less than a century ago .
What he is arguing against is the intent to set up the mine to mine out the rich layers , so that when our grand - children have to mine the rest they must work in the dangerous conditions of a partially mined volume , with only the poorest grades of shale as a reward .
In contrast he argues that the area should be strip - mined since even with a 1,000 ft cover , the thickness of the oil shale would justify the process as a means of recovering the entire volume of oil from the deposit .
Part of the problem comes , of course , not only from the fact that a hole a mile in diameter and 3,000 ft deep has been created , but that also all the material that has been mined , has to be stored before being returned .
And this is one of the significant problems that mining the deposit either by strip mining or by underground mining generates , that of the waste volumes and condition .
For a long time mining has used some of the waste rock that has been mined to pump back into the mine and fill the holes left .
By mixing a small amount of cement with the rock powder it can be made strong enough that the rest of the valuable ore can be mined , and the roof is held up by the newly placed columns .
However , when you mine and mill the rock it is broken into small pieces .
These bulk in volume by about 60 % on average , over the original volume of the rock , and so even with the use of the mine to put back some of the rock there will be about 40 % of it left for disposal somewhere else .
( Note that this does not include the thermal swelling that occurs when the rock is heated - I will get to that in a couple of posts ) .
But it should be pointed out that there is already some 50 - odd years of experience in dealing with this waste in the area , and while I am not familiar with the problems and their solution , the general mining practice with waste fills is ultimately to cover and seed them so that there is a binding vegetation - unfortunately this , as with some of the other parts of the extraction process , requires considerable water , and that is an issue that we have n't reached yet .
But , on the other hand , we do n't seem to hear much about the piles that already exist .
Again I am going to pause here , since the post may otherwise get too long , but next time I will talk a little bit about the nuclear option , which might otherwise be forgot .

Some Notes
I researched this subject in a very particular way .
I deliberately chose not speak directly to any climate experts or leading scientists in the field .
I used only publicly available web sources .
Why ?
Because I wanted to simulate what it ’s like for people trying to learn about climate change online .
My conclusion is “ what a nightmare ” .
I was generally shocked and appalled by how difficult it was to source counter arguments .
The data was often tucked away on extremely ancient or byzantine websites .
The key counter arguments I often found , 16 scrolls down , on comment 342 on a far flung realclimate.org post from three years ago .
And even when I found an answer , the answers were excessively jargonized or technical .
Most of the info for this image is sourced from Realclimate.org .
It ’s an amazing blog staffed tirelessly by some of the world ’s leading climatologists .
Unfortunately , the majority of the writing on there is so scientific and so technical , it makes the website nigh on useless to the casual , curious reader .
Runaway Feedback
This image was a mammoth undertaking , especially for someone like me , unschooled in climate science .
So I appreciate your understanding if any errors have crept into the process .
If you spot any , please get in touch and I ’ll will correct them on the double .
In every case , wherever possible , I went back the original data .
( I ’ve included a ZIP of all the data I ’ve collected plus a spreadsheet of all the sources ) .

Da ist also einem Kandidaten bei „ Deutschland sucht den Superstar “ ein Missgeschick passiert .
Als er vor der Jury stand , hatte er einen Urin -Fleck auf der Hose .
Dieter Bohlen zeigte mit dem Finger auf ihn und machte sich lustig , dass er sich „ in die Hose gepisst “ hätte .
RTL bearbeitete die Szene so nach , dass die peinliche Situation noch peinlicher wirkte und die Bloßstellung des 18 - Jährigen maximal war , und verwendete dafür auch Sätze Bohlens , die auf einen ganz anderen Kandidaten gemünzt waren .
Das hauseigene Videoportal „ Clipfish “ zeigte den Ausschnitt unter dem vollen Namen des Möchtegern - Superstars und der Beschreibung als „ Pipi- Kandidat “ ( inzwischen geändert ) .
Der Sender meint nicht , dass er den Kandidaten hätte schützen müssen und die Szene weglassen sollen .
„ Wir zeigen , was beim Casting passiert .
Wenn sich ein Kandidat mit nasser
Hose vor die Jury stellt , darf er sich nicht wundern , wenn er darauf angesprochen wird “ , zitiert der Branchendienst „ Meedia “ RTL - Sprecherin Anke Eickmeyer .
„ Wir sind jetzt in der siebten Staffel von DSDS .
Wer sich bewirbt , sollte wissen , wie die Sendung abläuft . “
· · ·
Vor gut zwei Jahren ist RTL - Geschäftsführerin Anke Schäferkordt ein Missgeschick passiert .
Nichts , was auch nur annähernd so peinlich gewesen wäre , aber sie hatte sich als Gastgeberin des Deutschen Fernsehpreises 2007 ein Kleid ausgesucht , das ihrem Dekolleté eine vermutlich eher nicht beabsichtigte Form gab , was auffiel , wenn die Kameras sie wieder einmal im Publikum einfingen .
Ich habe mir die Übertragung der Sendung auf RTL angesehen und live darüber gebloggt , und als eine Kommentatorin auf den unglücklich gepressten Busen hinwies , griff ich das auf und band zur Illustration auch einen Screenshot von der Szene ein , nichts Dramatisches , wie gesagt , nur eine etwas unvorteilhafte Situation .
Christian Körner , der Pressesprecher des Senders , war darüber nicht glücklich .
Er rief mich an , bat freundlich darum , das Bild zu entfernen , betonte aber , dass es auch juristische Folgen haben könne , wenn ich es nicht täte .
Ich erfüllte seinen Wunsch und ersetzte den Screenshot durch einen entsprechenden Hinweis .
Als ich in der vergangenen Woche las , warum RTL es für richtig hält , das Missgeschick eines Kandidaten groß auszustellen , habe ich meine Entscheidung bereut .
Wusste Frau Schäferkordt damals etwa nicht , dass der „ Deutsche Fernsehpreis “ im Fernsehen ausgestrahlt wird ?
Gilt für Frau Schäferkordt nicht :
Wenn sich jemand mit einem unglücklich sitzenden Kleid bei einer eigenen öffentlichen Veranstaltung zeigt , darf sie sich nicht wundern , wenn andere Leute das kommentieren ?
Aus welchem Grund muss man Frau Schäferkordt mit einer sehr viel harmloseren Panne schützen ( „ vor sich selbst “ , wie es immer so schön heißt ) , einen jungen „ DSDS “ - Kandidaten aber nicht ?
Wie kann jemand , der eine Sendung wie „ DSDS “ verantwortet , einen besonderen Schutz vor öffentlicher Zuschauerstellung für sich in Anspruch nehmen ?
Das fragte ich mich .
Und die Presseleute von RTL .
Christian Körner antwortete mir , er finde den Zusammenhang „ konstruiert “ .
Ihm sei schleierhaft , warum ich „ einzelne Casting - Auftritte einer Sendung mit der Garderobe der Geschäftsführerin der Sendergruppe / des Senders in unmittelbare Verbindung “ bringe .
Es sei — auch juristisch — ein Unterschied , ob man zu einem TV - Casting gehe , „ das wenig überraschend auch im TV gezeigt wird “ , oder „ ein Gast von vielen einer Veranstaltung im Publikum , dem vielleicht mal was verrutscht “ .
Er fügte hinzu : „ Auch die Empörung kann ich nur bedingt nachvollziehen , weil Sie — anders als andere — vorzugsweise davon ausgehen , dass die Menschen , die zB zu einem Casting kommen , vor sich selbst und der Welt geschützt werden müssen . “
Nun wies ich darauf hin , dass Frau Schäferkordt keineswegs Gast , sondern Gastgeberin war , und fügte hinzu , dass ich — anders als er mir unterstellte — gar nicht wisse , ob die Menschen vor sich selbst und der Welt geschützt werden müssen .
Ich fragte mich nur , warum Frau Schäferkordt nicht selbst aushalten muss , was sie anderen zumutet .
Es kam darauf keine wirkliche Antwort .
Nur , dass die Geschäftsführerin ja „ in der Regel nicht persönlich die Sendung schneidet “ .
Und ich doch machen solle , was ich wolle , denn : „ Empörung rund um DSDS kommt sicher nicht nur in Ihrer Redaktion oder Ihrem Blog gut an — und der Beifall ist Ihnen sicher . “
Aber meine Frage ist unbeantwortet : Warum stellen die RTL - Leute andere Menschen auf eine Art und Weise bloß , die sie bei sich selbst schon in viel harmloserer Form unerträglich finden ?
The saint who inspired the legend of Santa Claus is believed to have been buried in an abbey in Kilkenny , according to local historians .
The remains of St Nicholas of Myra , the philanthropist who lived in the 4th century and was the bishop of Lycia , are thought to have been moved to Jerpoint Abbey some 800 years ago .
During his life , St Nicholas left anonymous gifts for the poor and his well - known generosity propelled him to sainthood shortly after his death in 346 , inspiring the legend of the jolly man in the red suit .
One story attributed to St Nicholas was that of a a poor man with three daughters who did n’t have the money to buy their dowries and thus save his children from slavery .
As the girls came of age and the man ’s angst increased , bags of gold were tossed through a window or down a chimney over three nights - providing him with the funds he needed to save his girls .
It is thought that the man who inspired the tradition of leaving presents under a Christmas tree , came from a wealthy family and he is believed to have given much of his fortune away .
Early pilgrims visited the cathedral in Myra to pay their respects to the bishop .
The bishop was originally buried at a local church in Myra , in modern day Turkey , when he died .
Historians now believe his body was later moved to the abbey in Ireland by early crusaders .
Chairman of Callan Heritage Society Philip Lynch said that the remains were twice transferred across Europe in the 12th century .
Mr Lynch claims a French family called the de Frainets moved the saint ’s remains from Myra to Italy in 1169 .
A relative called Nicholas de Frainet then took the remains to Ireland when his family relocated there and built a dedicated Cistercian abbey to the saint at Jerpoint .
“ St Nicholas Church is still standing and there is a slab on the ground which marks St Nicholas 's grave , ” he said .
Few locals know of the much - loved figure ’s link with Kilkenny .
“ It is an amazing story and yet very few people in Ireland know about St Nicholas 's connection with this country , ” he said .
“ Every year now we get visitors to the site , but still not that many . ”

The Vancouver Olympics begin February 12th .
And scientists are on high alert .
Not just for well - known ways to gain an advantage , like steroids or blood doping .
The researchers are also worried about what ’s called genetic doping .
It ’s the latest in elite athletic cheating .
Researchers writing in the journal Science point to a few different types of gene therapy that could get hijacked for athletics instead of medical uses , like the treatment of obesity , diabetes or muscle disease .
For example , genes for insulin - like growth factor could enhance muscle mass .
And molecules that regulate the expression of genes may make athletes more energy efficient , or help create more slow - twitch muscle fibers .
It ’s known that in the past few years , a coach in Germany and a lab in China have tried to get these kinds of therapies into the hands of competitors .
So the scientific community wants to get ahead of this by figuring out what molecular signatures might be left in cheaters ’ bodies after genetic doping .
The researchers do point out that these treatments have so far only been able to produce “ faster or stronger mice . ”
But that does n’t mean somebody getting an Olympic medal is n’t a rat .

Is genetic juicing set to replace steroids ?
I really had to brainstorm on exactly which question I would ask .
I made a short list , and finally honed it down to one that I think is fair , but tough .
But I had a number that I decided not to ask , either because I already knew how it would be answered ( even if I disgreed with the expected answer ) or the questions / answer to the question was so complex that it could n't be answered in a short video clip .
I have been asked to submit a video question on ethanol policy that will be potentially answered in a video blog by someone who is very well - known in the energy business .
I will keep the details quiet for now , including the question I did submit .
Here I discuss what I did n't ask , but it really gets to the heart of the issues I have with U.S. ethanol policy .
First , a bit of framework .
I believe that I am , and have always been objective , and a realist .
I do n't believe that we are ever going to have a moment where government leaders say " Let 's abandon this ethanol pathway . "
We had an example of that with MTBE , but there was clear evidence that MTBE was getting into groundwater and lingering .
The issues around ethanol are more complex .
Corn ethanol has been U.S. policy for the past 30 years , and it will be policy for the next 30 years .
It is too embedded in agriculture policy , and I think it would be devastating for Midwestern economies if we changed direction on corn ethanol .
Thus , I think we continue down that path , for better or worse .
I am not pro-ethanol nor am I anti-ethanol .
In one of my earliest essays on my blog , over 3.5 years ago , I talked about some of the things I would like to see happen in the grain ethanol industry , mostly aimed at improving the energy balance .
I came out in favor of the approach of E3 Biofuels , who were trying to build a highly integrated ethanol complex that minimized fossil fuel inputs .
I have endorsed such approaches on multiple occasions .
My concerns are , and have always been :
What are the long - term consequences ?
I do n't limit this to ethanol ; this is a question that I ask of all energy options .
Dependence on oil has some significant long - term consequences .
The most serious of which , for me , is the potential for building a world that is only sustainable as long as oil production continues to expand .
I see significant risk there , so it has always been my position that we need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in general .
With respect to ethanol , consider this thought experiment that I posed following one of my previous essays :
Would you consume 2 BTUs of natural gas to produce 1 BTU of ethanol ?
I think most people would conclude that this would be foolish ; that your natural gas supplies would stretch much further if instead you simply use the natural gas in CNG vehicles ( acknowledging of course that there are lots of things you have to evaluate in that scenario ) .
For those who would answer " Yes " to that question , I would argue that your view of ethanol is entirely one - dimensional .
You probably only care that it is homegrown , and you do n't worry much about the long - term consequences .
( The person I asked responded to the question " Of course .
The goal is to get off imported oil . " )
Of course the truth is more complicated than the example above .
It does n't take 2 BTUs of natural gas to produce 1 BTU of ethanol .
Estimates vary , but it is still safe to say that most ethanol operations in the U.S. continue to have substantial fossil fuel inputs .
That is the way they were built , and that is the way they will continue to operate .
Over the long - term , there is potential to change that equation by using biomass boilers , but those are more expensive to operate than a standard natural gas boiler .
So on average the ethanol industry does still have a heavy fossil fuel dependence , albeit largely domestic coal ( for electricity ) and domestic natural gas - with some petroleum inputs for trucks , tractors , etc .
( One thing to note is that more than 50 % of our fertilizer supplies - derived from natural gas - are in fact imported ) .
So what if the question was " Would you spend 1 BTU of natural gas to make 2 BTUs of ethanol ? "
If you are doing a holistic analysis , the answer should be " It depends .
What are the other impacts ? "
There are those who wrap U.S. ethanol policy in patriotism and the American flag , and who would rather not get into those questions .
These questions are hand - waved away with clichés like " I would rather support American farmers than Saudi sheiks . "
I try to look at it from the perspective of an engineer , a scientist , and an environmentalist .
I want to stack the columns up and figure out what is really happening as a result of our ethanol policy and subsequent rapid expansion of corn production .
I want to look at it from the perspective of " What is going to be the impact on the world my children will inherit ? "
Just a few of the key questions for me are the following :
Are we depleting fossil aquifers as a result of the expansion of corn in areas requiring irrigation - putting future food supplies at risk ?
Are we at risk of contaminating water supplies with herbicides , pesticides , and fertilizer run-off ?
What has been the measurable impact on our oil imports - the generally stated reason for our ethanol policy ?
What is the long - term impact on soil as a result of erosion and pesticide usage ?
What is the risk of major weather events impacting the corn crop , and subsequently causing a shortage of corn for ethanol and driving food prices much higher ?
What are the other risks of closely linking together food supplies with fuel supplies ?
In a nutshell , I want to know if we are compromising the future relative to other options , and / or relative to the status quo .
These sorts of issues are generally ignored by most advocates .
They believe our ethanol policy is the right thing to do , and then nothing else matters .
I have debated people like this before , and they are simply not interested in the holistic picture .
Often , it is because they are vested interests .
Chief ethanol lobbyist Bob Dineen is n't going to be at the forefront , trying to determine the answers to these questions .
His job is to promote ethanol , period .
He will get involved when one of these questions becomes persistent enough and loud enough , and his position will typically be that of defense attorney :
Deflect the question if you can , and try to raise doubts that the question even matters .
But I am not a vested interest dug into a bunker .
If our ethanol policy is better than the status quo , then I am all for it .
But you can't know that unless you take a really comprehensive look .
I would like to see an independent analysis of all of these issues , now that we are some 11 billion gallons per year into this experiment .
The problem is finding an independent agency to do such an analysis .
The ethanol lobby hires their consultants , who conclude , " It 's all good . "
Big surprise there .
( By the way that is the same guy who wrote a paper stating that ethanol with the energy value of 64 million barrels of oil displaced 206 million barrels of oil ) .
Energy policy in general is a complicated issue , and it is wrapped up deeply in politics .
I doubt we will ever get the independent review I would like to see - and even if we did the lobbyists would immediately go to work trying to discredit the study .
But I hope you can see why I decided not to get into that with the question I submitted .
It might take 10 minutes to ask it , and then an hour to answer it - and I do n't think the answer would really get into the fine details that I am interested in .
You will have to stay tuned to see the question I did ask .
The face of the U.S. military is radically changing .
Technology is evolving faster today than ever before , and the U.S. military is determined to be at the cutting edge of applying futuristic technology .
A lot of things that once were only in the world of science fiction are quickly making their way into the U.S. military .
In fact , there are some projects in development that are so bizarre that it is kind of hard to believe that they are real .
After all , creating soldiers with superhuman strength and endurance using pharmaceutical drugs , outfitting soldiers with exotic prosthetics and mechanical exoskeletons , implanting microchips directly into the brains of soldiers to give them an advantage in battle and editing the DNA of soldiers to make them the ultimate killing machines all seem more like something out of a really bad summer movie than real goals that the U.S. military should be pursuing .
But they are .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , or Darpa , recently released its budget for the upcoming year .
DARPA has a reputation for bizarre research projects , and this year they definitely are not disappointing us .
DARPA ’s new budget includes money for “ super soldiers ” with “ edited DNA ” and implantable microchips .
DARPA explains one application for these new technologies this way ….
On the other end of the size scale , a primary goal is to apply microsystem techniques to soldier - protective biomedical systems .
One example is an in - canal hearing protection device that will provide enhanced hearing capabilities in some settings , but be able to instantly muffle loud sounds of weapons fire .
This one example will improve inter-personnel communications and at the same time drastically reduce the incidence of hearing loss in combat situations .
For these examples and many more , the goal is to bring exceptionally potent technical approaches to bear on biological and biomedical applications where their capabilities will be significant force multipliers for the DoD .
But DARPA is not alone in pursuing these bizarre new technologies .
According to the U.S. Army ’s Future Soldier Initiative , the soldiers of the future might boost their brains with drugs and prosthetics , augment their strength with mechanical exoskeletons , and have artificially intelligent “ digital buddies ” at their beck and call .

At Utah ’s West Jordan High School , the halls have swirled lately with debate over the merits of 12th grade :
Is it a waste of time ?
Are students ready for the real world at 17 ?
For student body president J.D. Williams , 18 , the answer to both questions is a resounding no .
“ I need this year , ” he said , adding that most of his classmates felt the same way .
The sudden buzz over the relative value of senior year stems from a recent proposal by state Sen.
Chris Buttars that Utah make a dent in its budget gap by eliminating the 12th grade .
The notion quickly gained some traction among supporters who agreed with the Republican ’s assessment that many seniors frittered away their final year of high school , but faced vehement opposition from other quarters , including in his hometown of West Jordan .
“ My parents are against it , ” Williams said .
“ All the teachers at the school are against it .
I ’m against it . ”
Buttars has since toned down the idea , suggesting instead that senior year become optional for students who complete their required credits early .
He estimated the move could save up to $ 60 million , the Salt Lake Tribune reported .
The proposal comes as the state faces a $ 700 - million shortfall and reflects the creativity -- or desperation -- of lawmakers .
“ You ’re looking at these budget gaps where lawmakers have to use everything and anything to try to resolve them , ” said Todd Haggerty , a policy associate with the National Conference of State Legislatures .
“ It ’s left lawmakers with very unpopular decisions . ”
In Utah , the opt - out proposal could prove more politically feasible .
“ The bottom line is saving taxpayer dollars while improving options for students , ” said state Sen .
Howard A. Stephenson , a Republican and co-chairman of the Public Education Appropriations Subcommittee .
“ The more options we give to students to accelerate , the more beneficial it is to students and taxpayers . ”
But some education officials say they do n’t think the plan represents a change .
“ We ’ve always had an option in place for early graduation , ” said Debra Roberts , chairwoman of the Utah Board of Education , adding that it was OK to give students the choice to graduate early , but that they should n’t be pushed to leave .
About 200 students a year take advantage of early graduation , said Brenda Hales , state associate superintendent .
Buttars , who did not respond to calls for comment , has said he would offer incentives to encourage students to graduate early .
Last week , his proposal met with approval from some who praised his efforts to cut costs , if not the plan itself .
“ In a really hard economic time , we have to think of new options , ” said Aleta Taylor , a South Jordan mother of seven , adding that she needed more specifics before supporting the plan .
Whether the plan proves viable , it does raise a valid point about “ senioritis , ” said William Sederburg , the state commissioner of higher education .
“ The thing that Sen .
Buttars tapped into is that too many seniors take the senior year off , ” he said .
As far as high school senior Williams is concerned , 12th grade is as rewarding as a student wants to make it .
“ Senior year has n’t been a waste for me , ” said Williams , who writes for his school paper , plays lacrosse , sings in two choirs and takes college - level courses .
“ If you ’re the type of kid who will slack off , you ’d find a way to do that in sophomore or junior year anyway . ”

ALBUQUERQUE , N.M. —
Meadow the yearling Black Angus calf spends her days frolicking in northeastern New Mexico 's cattle country , all with her prosthetic hind legs .
The bucolic scene seemed impossible just a few months ago , when rancher Nancy Dickenson and her stepdaughter , Martha , found Meadow on a neighbor 's property .
The 11 - month - old calf had lost her back hooves and half of her ears to severe frostbite .
The Dickensons have rescued dozens of animals and wanted to give Meadow a chance to walk normally again .
They located the calf 's owner and bought Meadow , and convinced veterinarians and students at Colorado State University to help her .
Doctors amputated a portion of Meadow 's hind legs in August and fitted her with the prosthetics , a rare procedure done on livestock typically destined for the food supply .
Meadow is believed to be the first bovine calf fitted with double prosthetics , Colorado State veterinarian Dr. Robert Callan said .
He based his claim on discussions with other veterinarian clinics and schools .
Nancy Dickenson said the family decided to pay what she expects will cost " thousands of dollars " for the procedures because Meadow has become another family pet .
Meadow , named for the spot she was found , returned home to New Mexico last month .
Dickenson said she does n't want any visitors at Twin Willows Ranch near Ocate while Meadow recuperates .
These days , Meadow is running and grazing , and making friends with goats in a nearby pen , Dickenson said .
" She 's just so precious , " she said .
" A few people have asked ' Is she going to be beef ? ' and I said ' Are you kidding ?
This is my newest baby . " '
The answer is you have to do some very , very dramatic things .
We reduced the growth of Social Security to the level of benefits that could be financed by the payroll tax structure and moved the full retirement age by five years .
We dramatically reduced replacement rates -- benefits to earnings late in life , although we did n't reduce anybody 's benefits below the purchasing power [ inflation index ] except for the most affluent .
On health we chose to slow the rate of growth of health costs ...
Not speaking for the committee I think the only way to do it is to put Medicare and Medicaid on a fixed budget .
That would require vouchers based on income for Medicare that could vary by geography and health .
In any case we 're talking about something very severe .
Then with all other speding , we squeezed defense so that they could n't invest in new weapon systems but could retain their personnel .
You could have minor foreign interventions but nothing on the scale of Iraq and Iran .
On infrastructure and reserach we also clamped down on .
These are the draconian changes on the spending side if you keep taxes where they are .
A lot of Republicans -- and some Democrats -- are calling for even more tax cuts across the board for extended periods of time .
But this budget picture is dismal enough already .
Did you consider what it would look like with even fewer taxes ?
The thought of actually cutting the tax burden is really quite implausible .
Now tell me what a reformed budget would look like if politicians decided to keep spending stable and make all the reforms on the tax side .
At the other end of the spectrum , we said let 's keep our promises to Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security while keeping the 60 percent debt - to - GDP figure .
The tax increases are quite extraordinary .
We had two strategies for financing the package .
We increased all rates proportionally -- including capital gains and the AMT -- until the top [ marginal income tax ] rate rose to 50 percent [ from 35 percent , where it is today ] .
We did that for around 2020 .
At that point we introduce a VAT [ value added tax , or consumption tax ] , first at one percent and growing to 8 percent by 2040 .
It had to grow fairly rapidly .
For Social Security , we had to increase payroll taxes from 12.4 to almost 15 percent .
And then we needed a surtax on top of all that .
All this would take us from a total tax burden including state and local from below OECD average today to where by mid century we'd be considerably above average .
Spun out to 2060 we'd be one of the highest tax burdens in the world right alongside Denmark and Sweden .
The other approach was to radically reform the tax system , getting rid of all tax expenditures [ such as tax exclusions for employer health care and pension contributions ... see more here ] like capping the employer health exclusion .
It 's really , really remarkable how much money you get back from tax expenditures , especially from capping the health exclusion .
We could actually lower rates over time with that solution to the situation , while keeping the overall tax burden the same .
Water
The Epic Struggle for Wealth , Power and Civilization
Steven Solomon
Harper : 596 pp. , $ 27.99
It ’s not news to residents of Southern California that the management of water resources has far - reaching economic and political ramifications , but even they may be surprised by the pivotal role journalist Steven Solomon assigns to water throughout human history .
It is “ Earth ’s most potent agent of change , ” Solomon asserts in his sweeping book , which begins with the birth of civilization , is midwifed by large - scale , irrigated agriculture , and closes in our current “ age of water scarcity , [ when ] water ’s always paramount , but usually discreet role in world history is visibly taking its place at center stage . ”
Solomon ’s intelligent , well - informed assessment of the challenges we face today grows naturally from the comprehensive analysis that precedes it in the first three sections : “ Water in Ancient History , ” “ Water and the Ascendancy of the West , ” “ Water and the Making of the Modern Industrial Society . ”
The author astutely synthesizes a vast amount of scholarship to spotlight recurring patterns .
One is the enduring tension between two forms of political and economic organization that manage water resources quite differently .
The world ’s earliest empires , in Mesopotamia and Egypt , were what Solomon calls “ hydraulic states ” : land - oriented , focused on river irrigation and canals , run by centralized , authoritarian governments .
The upstart Greeks by contrast were a “ seafaring culture . ”
When the smaller , nimbler Athenian fleet decimated the Persian navy in history ’s first major sea battle , at Salamis in 480 BC , it not only demonstrated that sea power would henceforth be a key component in empire - building ; it announced the arrival of “ a new model of society , ” Solomon avers .
Seafaring culture , he argues , fostered “ representative , liberal market democracy . ”
Foreign trade across the open seas empowered private enterprise and loosened the government ’s grip on the economy ; societies driven by the profit motive responded more imaginatively to change .
A hydraulic state like imperial China excelled in the construction of water infrastructure , such as the 1,100 - mile Grand Canal that linked the Yangtze and Yellow rivers in the 7th century , but was inherently inward - looking and conservative :
In 1433 , for example , an emperor fearful of destabilizing foreign contacts terminated three decades of long - distance sea voyages , squandering China ’s “ clear naval superiority ” at the dawn of the Age of Exploration .
Seafaring Europe seized the initiative .
Its weak Christian kingdoms had barely survived the onslaught of Muslim armies in the 8th century , but Islam ’s brilliant civilization in Solomon ’s view ultimately failed to transcend its origins in the “ water - fragile ” Arabian peninsula to fully embrace the trans - oceanic sailing that cemented Europe ’s domination of global commerce in the 16th century .
This dominance only increased in the 18th and 19th centuries , when the steam engine enormously enhanced water ’s power - generating abilities and put the British Isles at the heart of the Industrial Revolution .
In the 20th century , the world eagerly followed the United States ’ lead in building huge , multipurpose dams that provided both hydroelectric power and irrigation that turned deserts into farmland .
It seemed that humanity ’s potential to control water for its own purposes was virtually unlimited .
Time and again , however , Solomon ’s narrative shows that each advance in using water more productively and making it available to more people brings with it explosive increases in population and water consumption .
These spark economic growth and a generally higher standard of living , but at some point , often brought on by climate change or “ water shocks ” like floods , societies find that their ability to exploit water no longer matches the demand they ’ve created .
Irrigated farmland becomes salinized and unproductive ; dams silt up ; the supply of drinkable water is no longer sufficient .
From the Indus Valley civilization of the second millennium BC to the Mayans 2,000 years later , societies that failed to meet these water challenges have stagnated and collapsed .
The good news is that those that find innovative solutions rise and thrive .
Despite an onslaught of sobering statistics in Part 4 , “ The Age of Scarcity , ” Solomon ’s overall tone is cautiously optimistic .
A grim catalog of the environmental consequences of the Aswan High Dam , warning that “ Egypt and its [ Nile ] basin neighbors are sitting atop a growing demographic and hydrological time bomb , ” is placed in counterpoint to an account of Israel ’s experiments with high - efficiency drip irrigation and large - scale desalinization of seawater as well as pragmatic back - channel talks with Arab neighbors despite both sides ’ confrontational public posturing .
As he has throughout , the author puts his faith in market forces to prompt flexible , appropriate responses .
( He is careful to assign a supervisory role to government regulation , provided it ’s “ clear and predictable . ” )
Solomon blames artificially low water prices for American agribusinesses ’ wasteful irrigation practices , and he approvingly chronicles strong - arm tactics by the U.S. government , which in 2003 literally turned down the tap of Colorado River water that was going to California ’s Imperial Valley .
That action was done to force the region ’s growers to relinquish some of their taxpayer - subsidized water to coastal cities that would pay market rates for it .
The Western world can maintain the preeminence it has gained over centuries of innovative water use , Solomon maintains , if it recognizes and adjusts to the new reality :
The global ecosystem cannot be plundered indefinitely , and any new gains in water productivity must be environmentally sustainable .
In addition , it must ensure equitable access to water for the world ’s poor or face the political consequences likely to be inflicted by a generation of “ freshwater Have - Nots , ” most living in areas of the world highly susceptible to fundamentalist extremism .
Ranging across several millenniums and dozens of cultures , Solomon offers thought - provoking material on nearly every page , leavening the abundant facts and figures with a judicious sprinkling of colorful anecdotes .
His ambitious thematic framework , though , inevitably leads to some oversimplification and a touch of monomania :
He seems determined to shoehorn every single thing he knows about water into his hefty text , which is serviceably rather than gracefully written .
Compared to the richness of his canvas and the acuity of his insights , however , these are small faults .
“ Water ” enlarges our understanding of how this vital element has shaped our past , providing enough evidence of humanity ’s ingenuity in the face of its challenges to offer reasonable hope that we will find ways to use it sanely .
Smith is the author of “ Real Life Drama : The Group Theatre and America , 1931 - 1940 . ”
Center frame above is a " II " flag in a sea of " III " flags , which was an independent effort at least as populous on the National Mall as our 50 III flags .
As I was scrambling to the field after being both the team 's medevac and admin puke / gear honcho , I carried one of our III flags .
I was cutting through the crowd and ran into two gents carrying a II flag .
" What 's ' II ' ? " , says I .
" What 's ' III ' ? " , says they .
Several iterations ensued before either side budged .
Eventually , amidst much chuckling at our banner - version of the old Mexican standoff , the IIs said they were calling for a Second Revolution .
I explained that 3 % in arms in the field had been enough to prevail in RevWar I .
We all agreed before proceeding to our respective destinations that our messages , dark as they were , were mutually supporting .
Not coincidentally , II plus III equals V .
Forward .
China is planning to launch their own space station , named Tiangong , by the end of 2010 or beginning of 2011 .
There have been a few instances where information about the station surfaces briefly over the past few years about the development of the space station .
Specific details on the program are not being release in large doses by the Chinese National Space Administration ( CNSA ) , so the development of the station is somewhat shrouded in mystery .
Qi Faren , one of the designers of the Shenzhou - 5 spacecraft , said in an interview on CCTV last month of the upcoming launch , “ Quality is the key to technology .
We must guarantee a successful launch .
We will launch it whenever we are ready .
It will be the end of 2010 , or the beginning of 2011 . ”
Here ’s what is known about the program : the Tiangong – which means “ Heavenly Palace ” – station will start out much as the ISS and Mir did , with a small module to house taikonauts .
This component , named Tiangong - 1 , and shown above , is estimated to be an 8.5 - ton module that will have life - support and solar energy production facilities .
It ’s a rather small module , with not much more room than the Shenzou spacecraft that will later carry taikonauts to the station .
The CNSA unveiled a model of the station during TV special celebrating the New Year in January 2009 , but not much more has been said until the most recent statements regarding its potential launch dates .
Shenzhou - 7 was the last manned Chinese spacecraft to launch , and it brought astronaut and former fighter pilot Zhai Zhigang into space for China ’s first spacewalk .
The next launch of a Shenzhou spacecraft , Shenzou - 8 , will be unmanned and is planned to dock with Tiangong - 1 , reminiscent of the ESA ’s Automatic Transfer Vehicle .
Of course , details about the date of this launch will be forthcoming pending the launch of the station itself .
This docking mission could last a few weeks to a few months , and will carry a payload of scientific experiments .
After that , Shenzhou - 9 and - 10 will likely carry taikonauts up to the station .
It is n’t really clear whether Shenzhou - 9 will be another unmanned docking mission , or will carry the first of the taikonauts to board the station .
The success of Shenzhou - 8 will have a lot to do with whether the following launch will be manned or not .
Any of the missions to the station containing humans would be shorter than the unmanned docking missions for the logistical problems raised by bringing humans into space .
According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences , scientific and support modules will eventually be added to the station , named Tiangong II and Tiangong III .
Further down the road , China plans to build a larger , more long - term space facility .
Zhang Jianqi , Deputy Commander - in - Chief of China ’s Manned Space Engineering Program , told the Xinhua News Agency last March , “ … We will go all out to build a long - term manned space station by 2020 . ”
This fits in well with China ’s plans to take humans to the Moon after 2020 , as it could provide a support platform for such a venture .
As the launch of the newest addition to human outposts in space approaches , we ’ll hopefully get more information as to the details of Tiangong .

BOARD DECISIONS Appellant : Stanley J. Miller
Agency : Department of Homeland Security
Decision Number : 2009 MSPB 75 [ now dead link ]
Docket Number : DC-1221-08-0274-W-1
Issuance Date : May 4 , 2009
Appeal Type : Individual Right of Action ( IRA ) Whistleblower Protection Act - Protected Disclosure  Substantial and Specific Danger to Public Safety
The appellant petitioned for review of an initial decision that denied his request for corrective action in this IRA appeal .
As a Transportation Security Specialist with the Transportation Security Administration , the appellant is tasked with covert testing of baggage and passenger security systems at U.S. airports and with overseeing a team that conducts testing that involves attempts to pass simulated bombs and bags tainted with explosive contaminants through screening .
He claimed that the agency proposed to suspend him for 14 days and removed some of his team leader duties in retaliation for making protected whistleblowing disclosures .
Specifically , he alleged that these actions were taken because he criticized changes in standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) that he believed could have catastrophic results by making it easier for an explosive device to be placed on board an aircraft .
The administrative judge ( AJ ) determined that the appellant established jurisdiction by making nonfrivolous allegations that he disclosed information that he reasonably believed evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety , and that the disclosures were a contributing factor in the personnel actions at issue .
The AJ further found , however , that the appellant did not prove by preponderant evidence that he made protected disclosures , because he did not show he had a reasonable belief that implementation of the new SOPs would pose a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety .
The AJ found in this regard that the appellant did not have the education , training , or expertise to support his claims , and did not provide objective evidence or data that the proposed SOPs presented a danger to the public .
Holdings :
The Board vacated the initial decision , finding that the appellant had made protected disclosures , and remanded the appeal for further adjudication : 1 . The appellant proved by preponderant evidence that he disclosed information that he reasonably believed evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety .
a .
Whether one has a reasonable belief is determined by an objective test : whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably conclude that the matters disclosed show one of the categories of wrongdoing set out in the statute .
b. Disclosures regarding danger to the public must be both substantial and specific to be protected .
Factors to be considered include the likelihood of harm , when the alleged harm may occur , and the potential consequences of the harm .
c. Because the AJs findings were not based on the witnesses  demeanor , with one exception that does not make a material difference , the Board may make its own factual judgments .
d.
The AJs findings that the appellants claims were not credible because they were based on his work experience rather than particular education or training with explosives or related technology , and because of the lack of objective evidence supporting his assertions that Explosives Detection Test ( EDT ) machines have a 10 % failure rate , are inconsistent with the applicable legal standard that the reasonableness of an individuals belief is based on facts known to or readily ascertainable by him .
The appellants 4 years of experience in conducting tests using EDT machines , which was the basis for his conclusion about a 10 % failure rate , is more than sufficient to support a reasonable belief in the fallibility of the machines .
e.
It was also error to judge the reasonableness of the appellants beliefs by the opinion of a chemical engineer with extensive experience working with ETDs , because the appellant was not required to prove the truth of his assertion regarding a safety issue ; he was only required to prove that a reasonable person in his position would believe there was such an issue .
f.
It was also error to determine that the appellants belief was not reasonable simply because management officials involved in the review process did not agree with him .
Although the appellants disclosures can be seen as a policy disagreement , a disclosure of information reasonably believed to evidence a danger to public safety may be protected even if the alleged danger was created by a policy decision .
g.
The 3 factors identified by the Boards reviewing court have been satisfied .
The potential consequences placement of an explosive device on a commercial airlinerobviously would be catastrophic .
The extensive screening measures that have been put in place to prevent such an occurrence are a reflection of how likely and imminent the threat may be .
h .
In holding that the appellant reasonably believed that the changes he identified in the agencys SOPs constituted disclosure of substantial and specific dangers to the public safety , the Board is not required to , and expressly does not , make any finding as to whether the SOP changes actually resulted in any threat to public health or safety .
2 . The case must be remanded for determinations on whether the appellant established that his protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the personnel actions at issue and , if so , whether the agency would have taken them in the absence of the disclosures .
Washington Redskins head coach Jim Zorn looks on during the closing minutes of their loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in their NFL football game in Landover , Maryland October 26 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Molly Riley
BALTIMORE ( Reuters ) - The Baltimore Ravens have hired Jim Zorn as quarterback coach just weeks after he lost his job as head coach with the Washington Redskins , his new team said Saturday .
“ Jim played successfully in the NFL for a long time , ” Ravens coach John Harbaugh told the team ’s website ( www.baltimoreravens.com).
“ He knows what quarterbacks go through in this league .
He has been a quarterbacks coach and a head coach , and he is familiar with our offense . ”
Zorn was a quarterback with the Seattle Seahawks from 1976 to 1987 , throwing for more than 20,000 yards .
He had a 12 - 20 record in two seasons as Redskins coach after serving as a quarterbacks coach in the NFL for 11 years .
He replaces Hue Jackson , who became the Oakland Raiders ’ offensive coordinator last week .

Just when you though you might not want another reality show about making it big in the fashion world , along comes Boss Ladies .
Billed as “ an exciting hybrid of ‘ The Real Housewives ’ and ‘ Project Runway ’ ” ( yay ? ) viewers follow five transgendered women from Atlanta to Los Angeles as they try to launch a clothing line and open a boutique .
Race
Wire is skeptical over another reality show ’s attempt to truly document reality–and it ’s clear this show will not be documenting the reality of most trans women .
But it ’s interesting that the promo - bio clips are n’t your average “ I ’m not here to make friends ” soundbites , but feature the women of the show speaking about their personal experiences of being transgendered .
Here ’s Londyn :
My opinion of myself is that I am transgender I do n’t want to neglect my reality .
I think that me embracing that I ’m transgendered is my ultimate cure .
Being trangendered to me is about love .
And it ’s about not only loving yourself , but loving you differences .
So I just really want to bring that compassion to our struggle and our journey .
And Nadia :
Realistically me being a women is all up here ( points to head ) .
I ’m not gonna go in a club and say “ Hi , my name is Nadia and I ’m a transsexual . ”
Some girls do n’t like their identity to be out there and everyone to know , but it ’s important , as far as for me , to let men know about you .
Society is n’t really open to it , they ’re kind of close - minded about it .
Do n’t get me wrong not everyone ’s gonna love us but you ’re gonna end up eventually seeing that there ’s a different side to each and every one of us that you ’re going to most likely love .
So while the show will no doubt have your average dose of reality drama , it ’s exciting that these women get their own show , and based on the promo clips , hopefully not be presented as mere spectacles for cis viewership .
Plus from what I understand about the show , the women will be working together and not competing against one another , which is refreshing .
From the only official - looking site I could find of the show , the women are being introduced one by one , and so far no news yet on when or which channel the show will be premiering .

Not in the way you might mean .
In the way Monsanto and other Gene Giants mean .
In Europe there is a strong movement to avoid genetically engineered food .
The reluctance in the population to avoid it is strong enough that many countries here have legislation so food has to be specially labeled if it contains genetically engineered substances .
This was , by the way , reason enough for the George W. Bush administration to accuse Europe of blocking the way to feed the hungry of this world .
Robert B. Zoellick , the United States trade representative , indicated the European position toward GMO was thought of as “ immoral ” since it could lead to starvation in the developing world or wars , as seen in some famine - threatened African countries ( eg , Zambia , Zimbabwe , and Mozambique ) that refuse to accept US aid because it contains GM food .
As far as I know even labeling food as made from GE crop is banned in the US .
As this is an Open Thread , you ’re welcome to correct me .
Scientists have very early on become the target of the GE industry , if they would n’t get the results desired .
Arpad Pustai is one of them .
He was sacked from his post after he said in a BBC interview that he would n’t eat genetically engineered food .
The farmers who use GE seeds are subjected to contracts that are ensuring that no part of the crop is used for reseeding .
Monsanto even employs detectives to protect their interests .
The Mayfield brothers are telling the tale .
Lately “ terminator genes ” have been inserted into seeds , so seeds from their crops wo n’t grow anymore .
This puts and end to thousands of years of farming culture and will kick small farmerss out of business especially in poorer countries .
So go to another seed merchant ?
No , Monsanto buys them up .
Genetically modified food is patented , the Gene Giants own it all .
If they can control the food supply , they have absolute control over mankind ( and it ’s money ) .
That ’s the gist of it all .
12 years on in 2022 Soylent Green is People .
Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted Wayne Rooney 's willingness to play out of position resulted in him not being used properly last season .
Rooney took his outstanding domestic performances on to the European stage on Tuesday with his two - goal contribution to United 's 3 - 2 victory over Milan in San Siro .
But it is perhaps no surprise Rooney is blossoming in his preferred attacking role following Cristiano Ronaldo 's exit for Real Madrid last summer .
" We probably did n't use him [ Rooney ] properly last season , " Ferguson told the US - based radio station Sirius .
" We probably exploited his eagerness and enthusiasm to play anywhere .
But we know his strengths , we know where he 's best and that 's where we 're using him this season .
" We talk about world - class players and I think that 's a misused quote a lot of the time but , when you see his performances of late , you know you 're talking about a really world - class player .
He is now on 25 goals and there are still 14 or 15 matches to go , maybe more depending on how we do in Europe . "
Peter Gutiérrez , board member of Reading With Pictures , has just posted the first in an series of blog posts about " The Case for Adding Graphic Texts to Your Read - Alouds . "
Upcoming posts will offer some specific strategies , but here 's the key part of his pitch :
To kids , reading comics ( which are still not widely used in schools ) is something more akin to spending time on a PlayStation than to doing anything " educational . "
As with the best kidlit , reading graphic stories comes across as a leisure activity , pure and simple .
Which is why reading such texts aloud is so effective as a literacy enhancer : children wo n't notice that you 're reinforcing - and that they 're practicing - a wide range of skills , that you 're being a reading teacher rather than just a performer .
Furthermore , as with any read - aloud , if your act of guiding kids through the text is done effectively , it will enhance their enjoyment of it and promote comprehension as well .
It 's an interactive process that brings out humor , subtlety , and artistry that might otherwise go unnoticed .
You can switch your focus from the print to the images and demonstrate how each supports , or even scaffolds , the reading of the other .
Gutiérrez explains that , stereotypes aside , comics books are neither picture books with smaller print , nor obstacles to " real " literacy with print - only , or print - centered , texts .
My six - year - old likes for me to read comics aloud to him–especially if he 's talked his mother into buying one that 's slightly too old for him .
That way , if I silently edit the language , he knows exactly what the inappropriate parts are –which , of course , he promptly commits to memory !*
But reading comics aloud has been good , because we can talk about the way the picture and the text work together , instead of just gazing at the pictures or skimming the words .
We 'll sometimes read the giant collection of silver - age comics , such as Showcase Presents : Justice League of America , because it 's an easy way to learn about conventions , story arcs , and how we learn to expect certain things as readers .
( Although I should 've thought better about introducing the boy to Snapper Carr . . . snapping his fingers when he 's happy is n't a habit I meant to encourage ! )
Do you read graphic texts aloud to your kids ?
Have recommendations ?
Let us know in comments !
* It only took me a couple of tries to figure that out –although Byron had that sorted long ago :
Juan was taught from out the best edition ,
Expurgated by learned men , who place
Judiciously , from out the schoolboy 's vision ,
The grosser parts ; but , fearful to deface
Too much their modest bard by this omission ,
And pitying sore his mutilated case ,
They only add them all in an appendix ,
Which saves , in fact , the trouble of an index ;
For there we have them all 'at one fell swoop , '
Instead of being scatter 'd through the Pages ;
They stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop ,
To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages ,
Till some less rigid editor shall stoop
To call them back into their separate cages ,
Instead of standing staring all together ,
Like garden gods - and not so decent either .
Have some comics !
I took the mean looking cowboy from this cartoon by Anton which I love .
And I have some sketches for you !
And some more !
I like the look of sketches , I wish I could do whole comics in that look .

Not since the 1930s , when Congress passed neutrality acts while Europe and Asia were girding for World War II , has Capitol Hill been so insular in its outlook toward the world .
By being hyper - responsive to advocacy groups at home , members of Congress are becoming tone deaf to the requirements of global leadership .
If current trends continue , there will not be enough legislators with the expertise , temperament and vision to permit the United States to play a constructive role in world affairs .
Nearly two - thirds of Congress has turned over since 1987 .
New legislators tend to know less about the world than their predecessors .
The National Security Caucus Foundation calculates that one in three members do not hold a passport .
In the past , service abroad in the U.S. armed forces helped shape the world view of most legislators , but this , too , is changing .
During the 1970s , more than 70 % of House and Senate members were veterans ; today , only 35 % are .
In the absence of the Soviet Union as an ideological adversary and the policy of containment as a central organizing principle , members of Congress increasingly view foreign policy as an extension of domestic politics .
To paraphrase former House Speaker Thomas P. ‘ Tip ” O’Neill Jr. , all politics , including international politics , has become local .
Of course , the demand for U.S. leadership abroad is as strong as ever , but congressional actions are making it harder for the executive branch to recruit followers .
In 1997 , one of every eight members of the House of Representatives voted for the United States to withdraw from the United Nations , while one in four House members -- including almost half the GOP caucus -- support the United Nations ’ relocation .
The chairmen of the Senate Foreign Relations and House International Affairs committees , Sen. Jesse Helms ( R - N.C. ) and Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman ( R - N.Y. ) , drag their feet when it comes to repaying U.S. debts to the United Nations , supporting international inspections under the Chemical Weapons Convention , setting up an international monitoring network for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and implementing the agreement freezing North Korea ’s nuclear program .

The PC , fax machine , 30 - minute news cycle and cell phone have imposed burdens upon current members of Congress that earlier generations of politicians never knew .
Elected officials such as Sen. Richard G. Lugar ( R - Ind. ) , Rep. Howard L. Berman ( D - Calif. ) and Rep. Tom Lantos ( D - Calif. ) , who do serious work abroad , are an increasingly rare breed .
The most ardent isolationist members of Congress during the 1930s , like the former Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman William E. Borah , did not travel abroad .
Another key isolationist senator , Arthur H. Vandenberg , visited London in 1942 , where he experienced a German air raid .
Later he became the key GOP architect of the Marshall Plan to reconstruct war - torn Europe .
Like Borah before him , Helms dislikes foreign travel , having taken one official trip abroad during this decade .
The second - and third - ranking House Republican leaders , Dick Armey ( R - Tex ) and Tom DeLay ( R - Tex . ) , travel the U.S. widely , but not abroad .
Other members largely confine their foreign travel to trips paid by private interests , facilitating the public labeling of any foreign travel , no matter how substantive , as junkets .
In recent weeks , the Washington Post lambasted members of Congress for planning a trip to Ethiopia , Uganda , Zimbabwe and Mozambique , while the New York Times took senators to task for staying at too nice a resort during a useful trip to Panama , Honduras , Guatemala and Mexico .
If members of Congress get hammered for visiting these countries , why not stay home ?
The internationalist wing of the GOP , once the bulwark of U.S. engagement abroad and the fulcrum for bipartisan initiatives on Capitol Hill , is now barely represented in Congress .
Foreign affairs - related support has declined from 4 % of the federal budget in the 1960s to 1 % today , and at the insistence of the GOP caucus , the percentage is slated to drop to .05 % in 2002 .

The changing perspective of the Republican caucus was clearly on display during Senate debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention ’s ratification .
By a slim margin of 29 to 26 , GOP senators barely supported a treaty originally negotiated by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush .
Skeptics conditioned their support to provisions weakening internationally accepted rules for inspections .
Many Republican legislators seem locked into Cold War mind - sets : Despite Russia ’s steep decline , GOP legislative initiatives call for the continued deployment of no less than 6,000 strategic nuclear weapons , half on hair - trigger alert .
Meanwhile , Democratic members of Congress are turning inward on foreign - trade issues .
Fearing job losses despite low national unemployment rates , only 20 % of Democrats in the House of Representatives were prepared to support “ fast track ” authority last November , down from 40 % during the 1993 vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement .
Even with scant support from his fellow Democrats , President Bill Clinton could have won had it not been for 25 Republicans who conditioned their approval on the elimination of family - planning funds for Third World countries in a pending foreign - assistance bill .
As long as members of Congress are hypersensitive to parochial concerns and powerful single - issue advocacy groups , they cannot be expected to speak with authority for a broad conception of the national interest .
Meanwhile , as the Congress has become more narrowly focused , argumentative and knotted , the exodus of contemplative and pragmatic legislators increases .
Many Americans are now reacting to special - interest politics and mean - spirited campaigns by tuning out Washington ’s talking heads .
But the more Americans seek insularity from “ politics as usual , ” the more insular U.S. foreign policy will become .
While opinion polls indicate that most Americans support foreign assistance , international trade , the United Nations , nuclear arms reductions and global environmental protection , the political marketplace on Capitol Hill places greater value on intense partisanship than broad - but - shallow support .
Constructive engagement abroad is not possible without greater political engagement at home .
Advertisement
The problem of congressional insularity is reaching pre-World War II proportions .
Legislators are losing sight of the difference between the United States being an exceptional country , and demanding exceptional treatment by others on our terms .
Unless concerned members of Congress find ways to soften and reverse the dual trends of Republican deconstructionism and Democratic protectionism , Capitol Hill will flunk future tests of constructive international engagement , short - changing the voting public and the national interest .
Citizens either can blame Congress for political recidivism or reintroduce themselves to their representatives on Capitol Hill .

Warner artists like REM may no longer be available to stream for free Record label Warner Music has said it will stop licensing its songs to free music streaming services .
Companies like Spotify , We7 and Last.fm give free , legal and instant access to millions of songs , funded by adverts .
Warner , one of the four major labels , whose artists include REM and Michael Buble , said such services were " clearly not positive for the industry " .
That raises questions over the future of free streaming , which is popular with fans but not lucrative for labels .
Spotify has seven million users in six European countries and is in negotiations to launch in the US .
Ninety - five per cent of those fans use its free service , hearing adverts between songs , while 250,000 pay a monthly fee to get it on a mobile and with no ads .
[ It ] is not the kind of approach to business that we will be supporting in the future
Edgar Bronfman Jr , Warner Music
Two - and - a- half million people use We7's free offering , while Last.fm is also free in the US and UK .
Other popular audio services include Deezer , Pandora and Grooveshark .
Warner chief executive Edgar Bronfman
Jr said : " Free streaming services are clearly not net positive for the industry and as far as Warner Music is concerned will not be licensed .
" The ' get all your music you want for free , and then maybe with a few bells and whistles we can move you to a premium price ' strategy is not the kind of approach to business that we will be supporting in the future . "
It is not clear whether Warner will remove its music from existing services or decline to do deals with new outlets .
He said the focus would be on promoting streaming services that require payment , which he said could appeal beyond those who currently pay for downloads in stores such as Apple 's iTunes .
Spotify is free with ads , or fans can pay £ 9.99 a month in the UK " The number of potential subscribers dwarfs the number of people who are actually purchasing music on iTunes , " Mr Bronfman said .
Fans could pay a monthly fee direct to a streaming service , as with Spotify , or get access to the music as part of a deal for a mobile phone , broadband connection or another gadget .
Such subscriptions could be taken up by " hundreds of millions if not billions of people , most of whom are not today either buyers or certainly heavy buyers of music " , Mr Bronfman said .
And they would be much more profitable than per-track downloads in the long term , he added .
The main legal streaming services have deals with most major and independent record labels and pay royalties for each song played .
But the amount is far less than a label would earn if that song was downloaded or if they got a slice of a listener 's monthly subscription .
It would definitely be a tremendous blow to a service like Spotify if Warner were to withdraw their catalogue from the free service
Paul Brindley , Music Ally Mr Bronfman 's comments come just weeks after another major label , Universal , said Spotify was well on the way to proving its commercial viability .
" Spotify is a very sustainable financial model - full stop , " Rob Wells , senior vice president of Universal Music Group International , said in January .
Paul Brindley of digital music consultants Music
Ally said the other major labels were unlikely to follow Warners ' lead .
" There 's a fairly widespread suspicion that free streaming services just are n't ever going to make enough money , " he said .
" But it does seem to be that Warner is taking a firmer stand than the other major labels in terms of opposing a free ad - funded model .
" It would be an absolute tragedy if they were to adhere to that to such a degree that in their renegotiations with Spotify , they withdrew their content without even giving them a chance to see how well they could convert their users to the premium version .
The consumer is in a world where they want things right here , right now , and if you do n't give it to them they 'll steal it
Jon Webster , Music Managers ' Forum
" It would definitely be a tremendous blow to a service like Spotify if Warner were to withdraw their catalogue from the free service . "
A Spotify spokesman told the BBC : " We would like to make it very clear that WMG is not pulling out of its current agreement with Spotify in Europe " .
We7 chief executive Steve Purdham said Warner and the other major labels had always been " consistent in their concerns " about ad - funded and free services .
" But they have also been very supportive of us .
I think Edgar 's comments are more a reflection that subscription services is currently the key focus for the industry and I strongly support that view , especially in the mobile arenas . "
Jon Webster , chief executive of the UK's Music Managers ' Forum , which represents artist managers , said the industry must support services that tempt fans away from piracy .
" Anything that 's going backwards is denying where the world 's going , " he said .
" New media has to give the consumer what they want and the consumer is in a world where they want things right here , right now - and if you do n't give it to them , they 'll steal it .
" There are new business models out there and they are beginning to work and we are in a transition phase . "

The anti-vaccine movement lost steam Tuesday after the world ’s leading medical journal officially retracted a controversial autism study that has caused millions of parents around the world to fear childhood vaccines .
The study , published in 1998 in the British journal the The Lancet was the first to report a purported link between a vaccine for measles , mumps and rubella and the onset of autism .
That reported association , which has since been discredited , formed the crux for the argument that MMR vaccines can cause autism and many in the anti-vaccine movement used the paper as proof of their claims .
Experts say the rare move by the Lancet to pull a published paper should help to correct the public record , though many added that more work is needed to remove the publication ’s harmful legacy .
“ This sends a very strong signal this research is not to be believed , ” said Paul Hebert , editor - in - chief of the Canadian Medical Association Journal .
“ For something that is published , taking it out of the public record is effectively saying it never existed . ”
The published research , led by Dr. Andrew Wakefield of London ’s Royal Free Hospital and School of Medicine , had far - reaching public health consequences after fearful parents questioned the safety of vaccines .
“ That caused a drop in vaccination rates , which has caused harm to children who have got measles and mumps as a result , ” said autism expert Dr. Peter Szatmari and Chedoke Health Chair in child psychiatry at McMaster University ’s Offord Centre for Child Studies .
“ And it has caused enormous suffering and anxiety to parents of children with autism , particularly those who have a younger child and are wondering about whether to vaccinate them or not . ”
Szatmari , whose work is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , said he hopes the retraction will be another piece of reassuring evidence that it is safe for parents to vaccinate their kids .
“ And that it ’s important to do so , not only for their health , but for the health of the population of all children , with or without autism , ” he said .
While the paper ’s withdrawal was lauded by the scientific community , the same experts say the retraction will likely do little to sway the opinion of parents who are convinced the MMR vaccine causes autism .
Dr. Joanne Embree , section head of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba and past president of the Canadian Paediatric Society , said the autism community should consider the retraction good news since it means they can move on to fund other , more promising , areas of autism research .
“ What I suspect will happen , is those individuals who truly believe that this was the case will not change their mind based on this action , ” she said .
Autism Canada , a charitable organization that provides “ uncensored resources to parents and caregivers , ” released a statement Tuesday that urged journalists to read Wakefield ’s 1998 study and to understand he never stated parents should not vaccinate their children .
However , the statement released by the organization ’s executive director Laurie Mawlan , said Autism Canada believes “ no stone should be left unturned in understanding this disorder , which is affecting more children , youths and adults yearly . ”
In his 1998 study , Wakefield said he and his colleagues investigated 12 children with chronic enterocolitis ( inflammation of the colon and small intestine ) and regressive developmental disorder , and found “ in most cases , onset of symptoms was after measles , mumps , and rubella immunisation . ”
After its publication , many experts in the autism field were concerned about the quality of science Wakefield reported in the paper .
Other scientists outside the Royal Free Hospital and School of Medicine were unable to replicate the study .
And epidemiological studies from multiple countries have shown no association between the MMR vaccine and autism , with some even showing children who receive the vaccine are less likely to be diagnosed with the disorder , said Dr. Evdokia Anagnostou , a child neurologist and scientist at Bloorview Kids Rehab .
The retraction is the third strike for the controversial paper :
Ten of the 13 authors later renounced the study in a statement to the Lancet .
It was found out that Wakefield received funds from lawyers hired by parents who believed their children were harmed by the MMR vaccine .
And last month , the UK General Medical Council ’s Fitness to Practice Panel ruled Wakefield broke research rules and acted unethically , which prompted the Lancet to withdraw the paper .

Debugging Memory Leaks in a GTK +
House of Cards .
Recently I 've been hacking on Conrad Parker 's sound editing , audio mangling and DJing tool Sweep .
As part of my bug fixing and clean up work I ran Sweep under the Linux world 's favourite memory debugging tool Valgrind .
Even after running valgrind with the officially sanctioned environment variables and gtk suppressions file , the resulting 500 k gzipped output file was a little shocking .
Now I 'm pretty sure a number of those leaks are in Sweep , but a significant number of them seem to be in GTK + and Glib .
Since trying to differentiate the leaks in Sweep from the leaks in GTK + was proving to be a very difficult and frustrating task I decided to look at the behaviour of a simple GTK + program under Valgrind .
The program I chose was the helloworld example from the GTK + tutorial .
Compiling that on Ubuntu 9.10 and running it under valgrind using the following commands :
export G_SLICE=always - malloc export G_DEBUG=gc-friendly valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --leak-resolution=high \ --num-callers=50 --show-reachable=yes --suppressions=gtk.suppression \ helloworld > helloworld-vg.txt 2>&1
resulted in a memcheck summary of :
==22566== LEAK SUMMARY : ==22566== definitely lost : 1,449 bytes in 8 blocks ==22566== indirectly lost : 3,716 bytes in 189 blocks ==22566== possibly lost : 4,428 bytes in 107 blocks ==22566= = still reachable : 380,505 bytes in 7,898 blocks ==22566= = suppressed : 35,873 bytes in 182 blocks
The full memcheck report is available here .
The simplest GTK + hello world program is 100 lines of code and results in a leak report of over 8000 leaked blocks even when using the recommended valgrind suppressions file and GTK + debugging environment variables .
If someone modifies that code and adds another leak , trying to find that leak needle in the GTK + leak haystack is going to be a needlessly difficult task .
Researching this some more I find that GTK + is known to do a large number of allocations that are done once per program run and are never released .
Furthermore the GTK + developers seem to think this is ok and from the point of view of a user running a GTK + program this is true .
However for developers coding against GTK + and hoping to use Valgrind to find leaks in their own code , this is a royal PITA .
Leaks in the developer 's code can easily be swamped and hidden by GTK + leaks .
My guess is that most people do n't even bother checking unless their program 's memory footprint grows over time for no good reason .
Obviously , I 'm not the first to realise how hard it is too debug memory leaks in a program when the library it links against throws up so many warnings .
In fact , back in 2001 a bug was raised in the GTK + bug tracker requesting the addition of a call to be used only during debugging that would release all memory so that client programs are easier to debug .
That bug has remained open and without action for over 8 years .
As far as I am concerned , this is completely unacceptable .
If this was my code , I would be too ashamed to put my name on it .
Edit : Being able to valgrind GTK + client code is worth the effort and cost of changing the otherwise perfectly reasonable behaviour of not accounting for lifetime - of - the - app data structures ( thanks Andrew ) .

Photographing things that happen in a split second — like a drop of water hitting a puddle — is difficult enough , but when the subject of the photo is in motion , like a flitting honey bee , it requires laser - triggered precision .
Advertisement
The photo above was captured by a Belgian photographer that has fused his enthusiasm for photography and electronic wizardry into one hobby .
His photography rig is a technological sight to behold , the camera is flanked by flashes and two arms that have infrared lasers which act as a trigger for the shutter .
Check out the picture below to see him at work in the field with the rig :

For those of you who are unfamiliar with macro photography , especially that of insects , a bit of explanation on just how awesome his franken - camera is .
In my personal collection ( I am a professional photographer ) I have at most a dozen photos that come even remotely close to the awesomeness of his insect macros .
When you 're trying to photograph a bee in flight using a powerful macro lens , you 're entirely at the mercy of the bee .
You have to set up your camera , get it incredibly steady , and hope that a bee will come into the tiny field of focus you have .
If you get a perfectly crisp shot of a bee in flight about to alight on a flower , that means you managed to luck out and have a bee fly into the tiny business - card thin depth of field window your macro lens provides and you snapped the picture at the exact 1/100th of a second that was occurring .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
The beauty of his rig is that the lasers which trigger the shutter of the camera are aligned perfectly in the exact sweet spot of the lens .
Using the rig you can't miss a shot because the shot only occurs when the action is occurring in the frame and in focus .
( I am so envious of this amazing setup ! )

You can visit the link below to see his technical schematics and diagrams , along with photos of him constructing the rig .
If you have no intention of building such an elaborate rig , we 'd still suggest taking a peek at his galleries .
His work is amazing and the type of ten - thousandth - of - a - second exposures he captures like a mosquito — a mosquito !— in flight are incredible .
You can view his insect gallery here and his water droplets gallery here .

As shown in the video below , the system can convert any car , from an SUV to a Lada , into a tracked monster .
This conversion comes from the city of Chelyabinsk , which once hosted so many T - 34 manufacturing plants that the city got the nickname " Tankograd " .
And , since a disaster in 1957 at the nearby Mayak nuclear reprocessing plant turned Chelyabinsk into one of the world 's most contaminated cities , these tank treads also come in handy for running over any roving mobs of radiation mutants one might encounter .
That 's right -- in his directive to Republicans telling them they should put a personal face on small businesses and specifically feature " grand opening " photos , he used a picture of my very own member of Congress , Mark Schauer .
To make matters worse he stole the picture from Schauer 's campaign website .
Funny thing is , Congressman Mark Schauer is in strong support of the financial reforms that the Obama administration is pushing .
Here 's the most - perfect comment from Doug Thornell , aide to DCCC Chairman Chris Van Hollen regarding the matter :
" Luntz is as careless with his clip art as he is with his twisted use of language .
Note to the word maestro , Rep .
Schauer is a small business owner who voted for Wall Street reform because the policies Luntz and his party championed drove this economy into a ditch . "
Priceless .
The fun never stops .
[ Hat tip Michigan Liberal . ]
I 'm just sayin ' ...
UPDATE : If you do a Google image search of the phrase " small business grand opening " ( w/o the quotes ) , there 's a picture of Christine Schauer 's grand opening on Page # 1 .
If you then add " My Style " ( w/ quotes ) to the search ( based on the name of her store which you can see in the first photo ) , viola !
The picture Luntz used is the second image .
UPDATE 2 : Here ’s a screenshot of the page where Luntz uses the photo from Rep.

The $ 200 touchscreen tablet known as the CrunchPad has morphed into a $ 500 device called JooJoo .
Designed and developed by a Singapore - based company , Fusion Garage , JooJoo is tablet - like device made for internet surfing and little else .
Wired.com got some hands - on time with the JooJoo .
At 2.4 lbs , JooJoo is a lightweight , slim tablet with a vivid , crisp 12.1 - inch touchscreen display .
Beautiful Hardware , Fast Boot - up — — — — — — — —
——
–
__
__JooJoo has a capacitive touchscreen , which means it is about as responsive as an iPhone touchscreen and as much of a delight to use .
There 's also an LCD screen that supports high - definition content .
Overall , it measures about 13.3 - inches deep , but has a slimmer profile than Apple 's Macbook Air .
JooJoo runs a custom operating system built by Fusion Garage and boots in just under nine seconds directly to a homepage screen .
It 's fast and takes the user directly to services that they may use .
The homepage screen is divided vertically into three sections :
Be connected , Be informed , and More apps .
Under the ' Be connected ' tab , there are web services such as Twitter , LinkedIn , Flickr , Facebook and YouTube among others .
The ' Be Informed ' tab features sites such as The New York Times , Reuters , AOL and CNN .
More apps has icons that link , for instance , to Google docs , Yahoo and Hulu .
Now here 's the weird part , a default option on the device called ' Paint me a new background ' changes the homepage screen color to a new one every time you come back to it .
And screen colors include red , violet , green and yellow – all of which seem rather bright and a tad harsh .
The good news , says Fusion Garage , is that users can always uncheck the option and set it to plain white .
Still , it 's rather puzzling to us why Fusion Garage would offer this feature .
JooJoo is also thin in the number of ports it offers .
There 's just one USB port .
It also has a standard headphone and microphone jack .
User Experience — — — ——
__
__
__
__Fusion Garage has designed the user experience on the JooJoo .
It 's elegant in that it 's simple and easy to use .
The pre-loaded icons let users click on them to get to the homepage of popular sites such as Flickr , Linkedin , Gmail or Facebook .
To surf the web , there 's a URL tab at the top of the screen .
Click on it and a virtual keyboard pops up where you can type in the address of the web page .
The URL tab also has shortcuts for Google , Google Maps , YouTube and Wikipedia .
For instance , type in an address into the URL tab and you can click directly on the Google Maps to pull up directions .
The two - finger zoom out gesture lets you switch between different tabs .
The pinch to zoom - in gesture takes you back to the homepage screen .
Users will also be able to bookmark pages they like and check their browsing history , although both those features were not available in the pre-production units we saw .
JooJoo supports
Flash so you can play HD video off sites like YouTube .
But it only has Wi -Fi connectivity .
That means unless you are in a hotspot with blazing fast Wi - Fi , the tablet can seem terribly slow .
The accelerometer means you can display web pages in both landscape and portrait mode , and it automatically reorients the display when you rotate .
Fusion Garage has n't revealed details about the kind of processor the device uses .
But there were moments when JooJoo felt slow to respond and just a little buggy –the device had to be restarted twice during the time we played with it .
Too Much for Too Little — — — — — ——
–
__ __JooJoo is an interesting gadget only if you buy into the premise of a completely web - oriented lifestyle .
That means using just the internet and what it offers .
There 's no way to save documents locally or access .pdf files or create documents and presentations locally .
You can't play offline games , either .
JooJoo runs a custom OS created by Fusion Garage , which means it 's unlikely to have the cool apps from independent developers that made the iPhone a hit or juiced the PC ecosystem .
For now , though JooJoo seems to have the hardware design and form factor right , the list of what it can't do outweighs what it can .
Pre-orders for JooJoo will start Dec. 11 .

Rotterdam police are trying to develop a portable scanner which will allow them to see through people ’s clothing and look for concealed weapons , the NRC reports on Friday .
The force has been given a € 500,000 government grant to develop the mobile weapons detector , which would use similar technology to the scanners being introduced at Amsterdam ’s Schiphol airport , the paper says .
The aim is to develop a prototype ready for production within three years .
The paper bases its claim on a confidential document which suggests the scanner could first be used as an alternative to random body searches in high risk areas .
The mobile detector would enable the search to be carried out more quickly and would only be used on people suspected of carrying concealed weapons , police spokesman Paul De Kruijf told the paper .
The document also mentions the possibility of carrying out long - distance scans and mass scans on crowds at events such as football matches .
In addition , the scan could be combined with a sniffer detector which would analyse an ‘ air sample ’ from a suspect for traces of drugs or explosives , the paper says .
Giampiero Gerini , a professor at Eindhoven University of Technology told the paper the technology to develop such scans is now mature .
‘ The biggest challenge is making it portable and ensuring it can carry out a scan in seconds , ’ the NRC quotes him as saying .
Scientists at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University have found that a " longevity gene " helps to slow age - related decline in brain function in older adults .
Drugs that mimic the gene 's effect are now under development , the researchers note , and could help protect against Alzheimer 's disease .
The paper describing the Einstein study is published in the January 13 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
" Most work on the genetics of Alzheimer 's disease has focused on factors that increase the danger , " said Richard B. Lipton , M.D. , the Lotti and Bernard Benson Faculty Scholar in Alzheimer 's Disease and professor and vice chair in the Saul R. Korey Department of Neurology at Einstein and senior author of the paper .
As an example , he cites APOE ε4 , a gene variant involved in cholesterol metabolism that is known to increase the risk of Alzheimer 's among those who carry it .
" We reversed this approach , " says Dr. Lipton , " and instead focused on a genetic factor that protects against age - related illnesses , including both memory decline and Alzheimer 's disease . "
In a 2003 study , Dr. Lipton and his colleagues identified the cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) gene variant as a " longevity gene " in a population of Ashkenazi Jews .
The favorable CETP gene variant increases blood levels of high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) -- the so - called good cholesterol -- and also results in larger - than - average HDL and low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) particles .
The researchers of the current study hypothesized that the CETP longevity gene might also be associated with less cognitive decline as people grow older .
To find out , they examined data from 523 participants from the Einstein Aging Study , an ongoing federally funded project that has followed a racially and ethnically diverse population of elderly Bronx residents for 25 years .
At the beginning of the study , the 523 participants -- all of them 70 or over -- were cognitively healthy , and their blood samples were analyzed to determine which CETP gene variant they carried .
They were then followed for an average of four years and tested annually to assess their rates of cognitive decline , the incidence of Alzheimer 's disease and other changes .
" We found that people with two copies of the longevity variant of CETP had slower memory decline and a lower risk for developing dementia and Alzheimer 's disease , " says Amy E. Sanders , M.D. , assistant professor in the Saul R. Korey Department of Neurology at Einstein and lead author of the paper .
" More specifically , those participants who carried two copies of the favorable CETP variant had a 70 percent reduction in their risk for developing Alzheimer 's disease compared with participants who carried no copies of this gene variant . "
The favorable gene variant alters CETP so that the protein functions less well than usual .
Dr. Lipton notes that drugs are now being developed that duplicate this effect on the CETP protein .
" These agents should be tested for their ability to promote successful aging and prevent Alzheimer 's disease , " he recommends .
The research was funded by the National Institute on Aging , one of the 27 institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health .

The late - shifting at NBC may send Jay Leno back to 11:35 and push Conan to midnight ( or another network ) but at least Jimmy Fallon is n’t pissed about doing his show a half hour later .
“ I ’ll do my show at 3 in the morning , ” Fallon told New York Times reporter Bill Carter during a talk at the Times ’ Arts & Leisure Weekend last night .
“ I ’m just happy I have a job . ”
Fallon pointed out that his younger , DVR - loving audience does n’t watch him play beer pong with Betty White in real time anyway .
“ Time does n’t really matter to me , ” he said .
“ We ’re in a different age .
Time is like …
I do n’t even know what time ‘ Jersey Shore ’ is on .
It does n’t matter - I ’ll see it . ”
Unlike the rest of America , Fallon claimed he was actually rooting for the The Jay Leno Show .
“ I wanted it to work .
Obviously there are problems … too many talk shows ?
There might be too many . ”
Fallon said he does n’t know any more than we do about what ’s going to happen to NBC ’s lineup - but he did get a phone call from Leno yesterday / Friday .
“ Jay said , ‘ Hey , just checking in . ’
He ’s always been great to me and he ’s a classy guy . ”
Conan , on the other hand , has not called - and Fallon understands .
“ It ’s just a lot going on with the whole half hour thing and a lot of it is just messy stuff I ’m so happy I ’m not involved with . ”
" Question with boldness even the existence of a God ; because , if there be one , he must more approve of the homage of reason , than that of blind - folded fear . "

There ’s a certain type of person who , upon seeing a new language , feels compelled to write a game with it .
Functional languages represent a unique challenge in this respect , as has been written about at some length elsewhere .
Clojure adds an interesting wrinkle to this problem , in the form of its Java interop .
If a game consists of a thin layer of Clojure wrapped around a full - featured Java game engine , is it actually “ written in Clojure ” ?
Without getting bogged down in semantics , I suggest that a Clojure application ( such as the game discussed in this post ) is something that can be easily extended using Clojure ’s data structures and concurrency primitives .
This may or may not be true of the hypothetical Clojure - wrapped game engine ; it depends on the design and implementation details .
To explore what goes into making a game in Clojure , we ’ll look at an implementation of Asteroids that uses Penumbra , an idiomatic wrapper for OpenGL .
Penumbra was written to streamline doing interesting things with the graphics card , which includes small - scale game development .
The issues I encountered while developing this game informed a number of design decisions I later made .
a description of the game
The game of Asteroids has three major elements : the spaceship , the bullets , and the eponymous asteroids .
Optional elements include explosion effects for when an asteroid is split or the spaceship is destroyed , and exhaust effects to indicate thrust from the spaceship .
When implementing the game , we should first consider how each of these elements behave , as well as how they interact .
Some of these details will vary between implementations , but for simplicity ’s sake we will assume the following :
Bullets travel a straight , predictable path .
If they come into contact with an asteroid , they blow up the asteroid and disappear .
If they do n’t encounter an asteroid , they will eventually disappear .
Asteroids travel a straight , predictable path .
Asteroids come in three sizes : large , medium , and small .
Asteroids explode when they come into contact with a bullet or the spaceship .
When a large or medium asteroid explodes , it emits four smaller , faster asteroids in random directions .
Small asteroids disappear altogether .
The spaceship travels an unpredictable path dictated by user input .
When the spaceship comes into contact with an asteroid , it explodes .
The spaceship has a position and velocity .
The position is constantly updated w.r.t. the velocity and elapsed time since the last update .
When the engine is off , the velocity remains constant .
When the engine is engaged , the velocity is constantly updated w.r.t. the orientation of the ship and the elapsed time since the last update .
Exhaust particles travel a straight , predictable path .
They are emitted whenever the ship ’s engine is engaged .
They travel the opposite direction of the ship , adjusted for the ship ’s velocity ( this is important ; things will look very strange otherwise ) .
They are purely for show , and do n’t interact with anything .
After a while , they disappear .
Explosion particles travel a straight , predictable path .
They are emitted in random directions from the explosion ’s center .
They are purely for show , and do n’t interact with anything .
After a while , they disappear .
Looking at this list , we can see that four out of the five elements have paths that are predestined ; their position at any given moment is determined the moment they are created .
This means that while we could store their position in memory and update that position each frame , we do n’t have to .
Instead , we have the option of defining a function which takes the game time as a parameter , and returns the current position .
This approach has two benefits .
First , it ’s much less taxing to the garbage collector ; while a perfect garbage collector would be able to handle constant , predictable churn by just allocating over the previous frame ’s state , reality is a little less kind .
Updating too many things too often will lead to noticeable GC pauses , which any real - time application should strive to avoid .
Second , it lets us treat the game as a constantly changing system which is sampled by the renderer , rather than a succession of snapshots whose frequency is arbitrarily dictated by the game ’s frame rate .
Specific reasons for why this is desirable will be discussed later .
It ’s also obvious that the only difference between the exhaust and explosion particles are their initial conditions .
As long as we make our generation method flexible enough , there ’s no reason to deal with these elements separately .
So to create the game , we need methods for collision testing , generation , physics ( for the spaceship ) , and finally rendering .
Below , we ’ll look at a few of the more interesting aspects .
The complete source can be found here .
collision
We need to be able to test collisions between asteroids and ships , and asteroids and bullets .
Bullets are perfectly circular , but asteroids and the ship are irregular shapes , so doing this accurately could be pretty complicated .
But if we just assume everything ’s a circle , it ’s easy :
( defn radius [ x ] ( if ( number ? ( : radius x ) ) ( : radius x ) ( ( : radius x ) ) ) ) ( defn position [ x ] ( if ( sequential ? ( : position x ) ) ( : position x ) ( ( : position x ) ) ) ) ( defn intersects ?
[ a b ] ( let [ min-dist ( + ( radius a ) ( radius b ) ) dist ( map - ( position a ) ( position b ) ) ]
( > ( * min-dist min-dist ) ( length - squared dist ) ) ) )
Notice that this code makes a number of assumptions about how the program will be structured : all of our game elements will be hashes , all of them will have : position and : radius keys , and those keys will either return static values or functions .
Nowhere do we define an interface that explicitly states this , nor can we tell at compile time whether the game elements actually satisfy these requirements .
It ’s easy to see how this approach could cause issues in larger scale development , but it does give us a certain flexibility , and for a program this size , the complexity is manageable .
generating asteroids
All of the elements exist on a 2 - D plane , but that does n’t mean we ca n’t render them as 3 - D objects .
We want our asteroids to be spherical , but irregular .
We could randomly perturb the vertices , but that would just give us a spiky ball .
The position of one vertex ca n’t be independent of its neighbors .
In other words , we want to generate a fractal asteroid .
There are a number of different ways to accomplish this , but one of the simplest is the fault line algorithm :
Split the asteroid into equal halves .
Expand everything in one half , and shrink everything in the other .
Repeat .
The resulting asteroid is n’t too distinctive , so we can just generate a few asteroid templates , and choose one at random whenever we create a new asteroid .
generating particles
Particles are soft - edged circles which , in large numbers , can be used to represent amorphous shapes .
To create a texture , we define a texture which is perfectly white , but with varying transparency .
Towards the middle , it is perfectly opaque , but falls off towards the edges per a Gaussian function .
( defn textured - quad [ ] ( draw - quads ( texture 0 0 ) ( vertex - 1 - 1 ) ( texture 1 0 ) ( vertex 1 - 1 ) ( texture 1 1 ) ( vertex 1 1 ) ( texture 0 1 ) ( vertex - 1 1 ) ) ) ( defn init - particles [ ] ( def particle - tex ( let [ tex ( create - byte - texture 128 128 ) ] ( draw - to - texture ! tex ( fn [ _ pos ] ( let [ opacity ( Math / exp ( * - 16 ( length - squared ( map - pos [ 0.5 0.5 ] ) ) ) ) ) ] [ 1 1 1 opacity ] ) ) ) tex ) ) ( def particle - quad ( create - display - list ( textured - quad ) ) ) )
which yields
Notice that we ’ve wrapped the definitions of particle - tex and particle - quad inside a function .
This is because we need to have both of these executed inside an OpenGL context .
This allows us to freely reference these vars in the rest of the code , as long as we make sure init - particles is executed within an OpenGL context , and before any code that references the internal definitions .
Particles can fill a number of roles .
Individual particles can represent bullets , and large quantities can be used to represent both explosions and the flame from the ship .
updating the game
Every frame , we need to determine the position of the various game elements , and draw them .
We also need to update these elements - testing for collisions , generating particles when necessary - but this is a completely orthogonal concern to the rendering .
Most games are single - threaded , and therefore the sequence of events is something like this :
Test for user input , and change any related values .
Update all the elements in the game , taking into consideration the elapsed time since we last updated the elements .
Render the newly updated elements .
Repeat .
This artificially conflates the act of updating and rendering , but with Clojure , we ’re not nearly as constrained .
In Penumbra , an application is defined as a series of callbacks , such as : init , : mouse - down and : display .
With the exception of : display , which cannot affect the game state , these are pure functions , which take the current state of the game , and return an altered version of that state .
As a result , each function is independent of the others ; as long as they do n’t execute at the same time , it does n’t matter what thread it ’s executing on .
These callbacks are called in response to user input ( : key - press , : mouse - up ) or a frame being rendered ( : update , : display ) .
However , how often we test for collisions should n’t have to be coupled to how often we render , nor should how often we emit particles for the spaceship ’s exhaust .
In fact , in the latter case this would only make things look strange : if our frame rate stutters , so would the exhaust .
Our rendering should just be a periodic glance into the world of the game , not something that dictates its appearance .
Penumbra supports periodic updates , which are defined as pure functions which alter the state at regular intervals .
We can test for collisions 10 times a second , and emit exhaust particles 50 times a second , regardless of the game ’s frame rate .
This is used somewhat trivially in this game , but it ’s worth noting that this can be an extremely powerful capability : we can reason about the game as a collection of independent , asynchronous processes , without concern for the underlying implementation .
In the Tetris example , for instance , the descent of the blocks is controlled by a periodic update which alters its own frequency based on whether the down arrow is pressed .
Brian Carper recently posted about his difficulties using Clojure ’s concurrency primitives during his implementation of an RPG .
While I do n’t think the approach used by Penumbra is the only way forward , at the very least it demonstrates that it is quite possible to leverage Clojure ’s unique capabilities towards the develop of games or other real - time graphical applications .
I have recently released version 0.5.0 of Penumbra to clojars , which should greatly simplify its use in a separate project .
If anyone has any questions regarding how they could use it for their project , I ’d be happy to help .
Reporting from Milan --
I 've noticed a pattern over the last eight seasons covering the men's runway collections :
The quality of the opening laser light show is inversely proportional to that of the collection that immediately follows it .
And , on Monday , Versace put on one hell of a light show .
Explicitly drawing inspiration from " Tron " ( yes , the 1982 Walt Disney film " Tron , " why do you ask ? ) , and William Gibson 's 1984 novel " Neuromancer , " ( which popularized a now - familiar word of Gibson 's coinage -- " cyberspace " ) , it seemed to be just as heavily influenced by " Terminator " and the dispersive prism album cover art of Pink Floyd 's " Dark Side of the Moon . "
Clearly there had been no small amount of technical fiddling to get the fashions of the future off the ground ; one jacket looked like it had been shaped out of crumpled aluminum foil , which might have made it a wacky , cool concept piece if that 's what the designers used .
Instead it required ( as the show notes explained ) " fur dipped in a proprietary dye to resemble silver foil . "
And , also according to the notes , luminescent fiberglass played a supporting role -- something about adding brilliance to the chalk stripes .
There were folded , darted leather jackets , leather bags and jackets that looked as if they had been studded with ball bearings , and wool felt trousers and jacket lapels coated to a mirror - like finish with polyurethane ( which basically made it look like ... you guessed it , patent leather ) .
Perhaps this was Versace 's " Tron " collection -- only in reverse .
In 28 years we could look back and laud this as the collection that employed all kinds of cutting - edge innovation to change the game forever .
But on Monday , it looked a lot more like Bruce Boxleitner zipping around on a light cycle wearing head - to - toe CGI neon .

Update at bottom : Paul tells CNBC he ’s “ leaning to being undecided ”
Remember the big conservative conference Fox News has been hyping over the past 10 days ?
The Conservative Political Action Conference ’s presidential straw poll , a key marker of the mood among conservative voters , apparently did n’t mean anything to the network .
And if it did mean something , the only real result is bragging rights for the individual candidates who were so well exposed .
And hey , even Dick Cheney showed up .
ADVERTISEMENT
Or , at least that ’s how Fox News characterized the poll , after it was reported that Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) had won it by a wide margin .
CPAC participants voted for Paul as their favored candidate by some 31 percent , giving him the largest margin of victory in recent years .
Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney , who has won the vote over the last three years , was the runner up with 22 percent .
Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was third with seven percent .
Over 10,000 people attended CPAC this year .
Among them , 2,395 voted in the straw poll .
“ It is way early , it is unscientific , ” said a Fox News host , even as the split - screen showed Glenn Beck on stage at the conference .
“ Perhaps it offers nothing more than bragging rights , uh , through the course of this year .
But , it is quite a , uh , enthusiastic crowd .
What a difference a year makes . ”
What a difference a year makes , indeed .
Paul himself said something quite similar a day prior , when he spoke before the largest , loudest audience of any other presenter .
ADVERTISEMENT
He asked if the crowd remembered when he was the guy “ off in the corner ” predicting doom , and none in the media paid him any serious mind .
“ All the sudden , the crash that I had predicting all along : it came , ” Paul said .
“ And now , Fox News TV has had me on about 60 times since the campaign was over . ”
On its Web site , Fox News said that the vote is “ not necessarily a good forecaster ” of conservatives ’ leanings nation wide .
ADVERTISEMENT
Jake Gibson , micro-blogging for Fox News ’s Live Shots , wrote that Paul ’s win was “ surprising ” and caused very audible booing throughout the crowd .
Meanwhile , Live Shots writer Kelley Beaucar Vlahos characterized the poll as an annual competition between the Republicans ’ “ bright lights . ”
Paul is now , apparently , counted among them .
Or is he ?
National Review praised him , jeering “ Feel the ‘ Ronmentum , ' ” thus triggering a sharp response from Robert Costa .

“ Some older CPAC attendees do n’t seem to care much for the Texas congressman , sure , but many young activists seem to regard him as a hero of sorts , ” he wrote .
“ When he talks about the debt , like he did on Friday , calling it a ‘ monster ’ that will ‘ eat up ’ our future , it was with a passion that you ca n’t fake in politics .
He also did n’t mind challenging many of the room ’s security hawks on foreign policy . ”
Indeed , Costa touched on a key undercurrent at this year ’s CPAC : youth .
According to the straw poll ’s detailed breakdown [ PDF link ] , 48 percent of the participants were students .
A full 80 percent of respondents said their number one issue is “ to promote individual liberty ” and “ reduce the size of government . ”
Sixty - four percent of participants were male .
Conservative blog
Hot Air questioned whether the poll could be taken seriously , adding : “ 53 percent say they wish the GOP had a better field of presidential candidates .
Is that an outlier produced by the Paulnut contingent too , or genuine proof that there ’s room for a dark horse ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Huckabee , now a paid Fox News contributor , joined other conservatives in kicking sand on Paul ’s victory , telling one of his coworkers that he abstained from CPAC because it had been taken over by libertarian activists .
“ CPAC has becoming increasingly more libertarian and less Republican over the last years , one of the reasons I did n’t go this year , ” he said , according to Politico .
He also knocked the conference ’s relevance this year in particular , with so much activity around the tea parties .
“ Because of the way that it solicits sponsors , it ’s almost becomes a pay - for - play , ” he said , taking a shot at the group ’s credibility as a whole .
“ It ’s kind of like , who will pay money to be able to be a sponsor and get time in the program .
That ’s one of the things that has hurt its credibility in the last couple of years . ”

FireDogLake noted that even Ann Coulter told a CPAC crowd that she agrees with Paul on everything , except his foreign policy .
“ Or , put another way , ” wrote FDL user Blue Texan , “ Coulter and the neoconservatives that have taken over the Republican Party want Ron Paul ’s pre-WWI , pre-Fed , pre-Social Security , pre-IRS federal government — to go with LBJ ’s Great Society military . ”
Among the poll ’s participants , 98 percent said they disapproved of the job President Obama is doing .
Sixty - eight percent said they approved of congressional Republicans ’ actions .
In 2009 , CPAC was arguably the biggest event in conservative politics all year , featuring right - wing all - stars like Rush Limbaugh , Newt Gingrich , Sarah Palin , Ann Coulter and many more .
In 2008 , pollsters were shocked when Romney beat Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) by just one percent of the vote , even after announcing the suspension of his presidential campaign .
That year , Paul tied for third with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee with 12 percent of the vote .
In the same poll for 2009 , Ron Paul again came in third place , this time with 13 percent of the vote .
He was bested by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , at 14 percent , and Mitt Romney , with 20 .

“ I believe we are on the verge of something very significant , ” Paul told CPAC in 2010 .
Strangely , in The Washington Post ‘s Monday coverage of the GOP ’s 2012 presidential contenders , the congressman from Texas was not mentioned once .
Staff writer Chris Cillizza instead plugged Romney as the party ’s “ nominal front - runner . ”

Paul tells CNBC he ’s “ leaning to being undecided ”
Monday morning , Paul revealed his 2012 plans on CNBC ’s Squawk Box .
Or lack thereof .
“ You do n’t know and I do n’t know , ” Paul told CNBC ’s Joe Kernan , “ so I do n’t have any plans made .
I take one day at a time and that keeps me kind of busy . ”
Noting “ the numbers ” he received in the poll , the CNBC host prodded Paul , “ Are you leaning towards doing it again ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ No , I ’m leaning to being undecided , ” Paul joked .
But Paul admitted that “ it is significant and it does get me excited . ”
Paul suggested that “ maybe the sentiments about me are changing . ”
“ I think there ’s definitely been a shift in attitude , ” he said .
“ It ’s not the conventional wisdom of the old Republican Party conservatism .
I think something new is coming along . ”

The rumors were true , Constellation is cancelled .
No Ares 1 crew vehicle , no Ares V heavy lifter , no Altair lander .
No bases on the Moon , and no human exploration of Mars .
NASA is canceling the human return to the Moon .
Good .
Obviously I ’m a huge fan of human space exploration .
I ’ve dedicated my life to it .
I ’ve raised my children in the certainty that they ’re going to be the first humans to set foot on the surface of Mars , and I mourn the end of the Apollo program .
Where ’s my flying car ?
But I ’ve also felt deeply unsettled about the Constellation program .
Maybe it was the best way to reach the Moon 40 years ago , but things are different now .
As some of you know , my background is in software , where the competition is fierce .
And half of this is a mental game ; you win the information war in the minds of customers through FUD – Fear , Uncertainty and Doubt .
Make your nervous customers wait , and hope that your next great solution is going to solve all their problems .
Although we ’re talking space exploration here , I see a parallel .
Why work our tails off to go to the Moon or Mars if NASA is going to just make it happen for us ?
Well they are n’t , and I ’d argue that they never were .
It was just a matter of time before the political parties changed , budgets tightened , and priorities shifted .
It was inevitable that this would happen , and if it did n’t happen this time around , it would happen with the next shift in government .
No long term goal could ever survive .
And time spent waiting for NASA to make it happen was wasted time .
As the guy watching stats at Universe Today ( 2 million readers in January , 2009 ) , I can guarantee that interest in space and astronomy is continuing to rise .
The demand and interest is there , and thanks to the Internet , thousands of flowers are blooming as space advocacy groups are coming together to get things done – like the Mars Society , and the Planetary Society .
Private companies are making human space tourism a reality , with Virgin Galactic , Space Adventures , and Bigelow Aerospace .
There are privately funded prizes available for the completion of technical accomplishments , like the Google Lunar X Prize .
But with NASA handling that “ back to the Moon ” thing , space advocates probably thought they could relax a little .
I think that NASA has an enormous role to play in human space exploration .
They have the ability to solve problems that private enterprise just does n’t have the funds for .
Sure , NASA put a man on the Moon , but it ’s the trickle down technologies that we appreciate every day .
Like velcro !
NASA needs create the tools and technology that will enable a vibrant and healthy private space industry .
What ’s the best way to extract fuel from an asteroid ?
How can ion engines cut down flight times ?
Is there a better way to make a spacesuit ?
What are some good materials for space elevators ?
What are some safer rocket fuels ?
How can we make rocket launches better for the environment ?
Is there a way to make velcro better ?
They can do this through pure research , competitions , university grants , prizes , and private / government partnerships .
They can team up with other governments to cut costs on the really big challenges .
And you know what ’s strange ?
They already do this with science .
NASA listens to scientists to hear their greatest challenges .
“ We need to see through gas and dust to see star formation and protoplanetary disks ” – here ’s Spitzer .
“ We need to see high energy regions around supermassive black holes ” – that ’s Fermi .
“ We need to know if there ’s evidence of water on the surface of Mars ” – that ’s Spirit and Opportunity .
NASA does this so well with science ?
Why do n’t they answer questions and solve problems in the same way for space exploration ?
There are so many questions , and NASA can help point us in the right directions .
NASA can help me build my flying car , but I still want to choose the destination .
Do n’t worry , the Moon is still there , and Mars is n’t going anywhere .
And my daughter is still going to be first person to squish the sands of Mars between her toes ( thanks to remote toe - sensing technology developed by NASA ) .
Here ’s an article about the 1st man on the Moon .
WASHINGTON — US officials unveiled pay packages for top executives at bailed - out housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac worth as much as six million dollars in a new step back from a clampdown on executive compensation .
Documents filed by the regulator for the two firms showed Fannie Mae chief executive Michael Williams and Freddie Mac CEO Charles Haldeman could each earn up to six million dollars per year , although some of that may depend on the performance of the companies and a portion will be deferred compensation .

Six other high - level executives at Fannie Mae and four others at Freddie Mac could earn over one million dollars , depending on performance , .
The regulator for the firms , which were seized by the government amid a meltdown in the housing market , said that even with the new pay levels , compensation for the top is executives is down 40 percent from before the firms were placed in government “ conservatorship . ”
Edward DeMarco , acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency , said these firms need competent executives since they play a role in funding three - fourths of all new residential mortgages .
“ Policymakers ultimately will need to determine the future of the enterprises and the future structure of our housing finance system , ” DeMarco said .
“ As this debate progresses , it will be essential that the enterprises continue to perform their current role .
The enterprises must attract and retain the talent needed to accomplish these objectives . ”

The two firms are not subject to the limits on firms bailed out under the Troubled Asset Relief Program , which was passed by Congress after Fannie and Freddie were seized .
Firms receiving “ exceptional ” aid under TARP will see their executive salaries limited to 500,000 dollars annually in most cases , but some exemptions have been announced .
FHFA said it consulted with the TARP “ pay czar ” to come up with packages that include a base salary as well as a performance - based incentive and deferred salary .
From the Alps to the Andes , the world 's glaciers are retreating at an accelerated pace - despite the recent controversy over claims by the United Nations ' body of experts , leading climate scientists said today .
Lonnie Thompson , a glaciologist at Ohio State University , said there is strong evidence from a variety of sources of significant melting of glaciers - from the area around Kilimanjaro in Africa to the Alps , the Andes , and the icefields of Antarctica because of a warming climate .
Ice is also disappearing at a faster rate in recent decades , he said .
" It is not any single glacier , " he said .
" It is very clear that these glaciers are behaving in a similar fashion . "
The United Nations ' climate science experts admitted today that it did not have the evidence to support the claim in its 2007 report that Himalayan glaciers could melt away by 2035 .
Thompson , in a conference call with reporters , would not be drawn into making specific predictions on the future of the Himalayan glaciers .
He said only about 800 of the 46,000 glaciers in the Himalayas are being monitored by scientists .
Data from those under observation suggests that 95 % of glaciers are in retreat , but it is still unclear how much mass the glaciers are losing without knowing the depth of the affected places .
Scientists still do not have enough of that data , he said .
It was also unclear that Himalayan glaciers were thinning at a faster pace than in other parts of the world .
But there was evidence gathered from a variety of sources that there has been significant melting of glaciers - from the area around Kilimanjaro in Africa to the Alps , the Andes and the icefields of Antarctica - and that the rate of ice loss was accelerating .
" Those changes - the acceleration of the retreat of the glaciers and the fact that it is a global response - is the concerning part of all this .
It is not any single glacier , " he said
Scientists now had evidence collected over a long period of that decline from samples of the ice core and even collections of plants from mountains that were left ice - free for the first time in more than 5,000 years , Thompson said .
The World Glacier Monitoring Service shows a similar picture .
In a 2005 survey of 442 glaciers , 398 - or 90 % - were retreating , 18 were stationary and 26 were advancing .
There was also , until recently , no full understanding of how glacier melt was influencing sea level rise .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) left out the effect of melting glaciers and ice sheets in its projections on sea level rise in the 2007 report .
But the Union of Concerned Scientists said new analyses suggested that such meltwater from land - based ice could lead to a sea level rise of 0.8 metre ( 2.6 ft ) by the end of the century - and possibly as much as two metres .
Glacier melt is also threatening water supplies , the UCS said , pointing to a 2008 study in the Himalayas which showed less water flowing from the glaciers to the great rivers such as the Indus , Ganges and Brahmaputra that sustain the Indian subcontinent .
Thompson , who has been studying glaciers in the Andes for more than 30 years , said he had watched the loss in his own lifetime .
A number of the region 's glaciers have disappeared .
Venezuela , which had six glaciers when he first began as a graduate student in the early 1970s , now has only two small ice masses which Thompson thought would be gone within ten years .
An Andean glacier that had been melting at a pace of six metres a year 40 years ago is now disappearing at a rate of 60 metres a year , he said .
" I find it striking how fast the glaciers are responding " to the warming climate , he said .
" Certainly in the 1970s when you talked about the speed of a glacier that was something very very slow .
But that is no longer the case . "
He added : " These glaciers are dynamic and they are responding rapidly . "
( CNN ) -- John
Terry has made his first public comments since being stripped of his role as England 's football captain , thanking the fans of his club Chelsea for their support .
The defender has been replaced as England skipper by Manchester United 's Rio Ferdinand following a media storm over his alleged marital infidelities .
The 29 - year - old , who has twins with his wife Toni , failed with a court injunction to prevent newspapers from printing allegations that he had an affair with the former partner of his England and former Chelsea teammate Wayne Bridge .
Terry has remained playing for his club since his liaison with Vanessa Perroncel -- who had a child with Bridge -- was first revealed and he helped the London club to return to the top of the Premier League with a 2 - 0 victory over title rivals Arsenal on Sunday .
" On a personal note I would like to thank every single fan .
It 's been an emotional day for myself and how the fans have been with me over the last two weeks has been quite incredible , " he told Chelsea 's television channel .
" I did n't expect that today and I would like to thank every single individual fan for the way they treated me .
It was a great performance and , I mean it from my heart , I would like to thank everyone . "
Terry did not talk about his meeting with England coach Fabio Capello , who took the captaincy from him on Friday .
Meanwhile , Bolton defender Gary Cahill , who had been widely tipped to appear alongside Terry in England 's squad for the World Cup finals , has been ruled out for the rest of the season after doctors found a blood clot in his arm .
The 24 - year - old missed Saturday 's 0 - 0 Premier League draw against Fulham after his arm swelled up , and was taken to hospital .
He will need to be treated with blood thinners to dissipate the clot , making it impossible for him to play and risk internal bleeding .

The high - tech stealth boat Ady Gil was cut in half and sunk by a Japanese security vessel in Antarctic waters today , dramatically upping the stakes in the annual struggle between whalers and protesters .
Sea Shepherd group leader Paul Watson told Fairfax Media the $ 1.5 million Ady Gil was sinking , but its six - man crew had been rescued and was uninjured .
Captain Watson said the Ady Gil was idling in waters near Commonwealth Bay , south of Hobart , when it was suddenly approached and rammed by the Japanese ship Shonan Maru , which has been detailed to provide security to the fleet .
Earlier today , the fleet was contacted for the first time by the Ady Gil and Sea Shepherd 's " secret " third vessel , the Bob Barker .
New Year 's
Eve celebrations turned violent in regions across France as youths burned more than 1,000 cars overnight and police arrested nearly 400 people .
Car burnings have become a regular occurrence in the poor , immigrant - heavy suburbs that ring France 's biggest cities , but the incidents of arson are especially prevalent on New Year 's Eve .
The Interior Ministry mobilized 45,000 police during the night , 10,000 more than last year .
The ministry said 398 people were taken into police custody — nearly twice the figure of a year ago .
Such vandalism mirrors events in the fall of 2005 , when a three - week wave of riots and other violence shocked the country .
The violence flared again two years later in neighbourhoods outside Paris , following the deaths of two teens who were killed in a crash with a police patrol car in November 2007 .

A secret army interrogation unit accused of being responsible for the widespread abuse of Iraqi prisoners is being investigated by the Ministry of Defence .
Fourteen fresh claims of torture against the British Army include detailed accounts of a shadowy team of military and MI5 interrogators who are alleged to have authorised the physical and sexual abuse of Iraqi detainees .
The new allegations bring the total number of cases being investigated by the Government to 47 .

Many of the Iraqis allege they were abused after they were sent to a unit called the Joint Forward Intelligence Team ( JFIT ) based at the Army 's Shaibah Logistics Base , 13 miles from Basra , between 2004 and 2007 .
Nearly all the men say they were beaten , denied sleep and then dragged around the prison compound before facing multiple interrogations .
In one account the interrogators are accused of creating an image superimposing a suspect 's head on the body of a man who is sexually abusing a child , and then threatening to disseminate the image throughout Basra .
In another , a detainee , held in solitary confinement for 36 days , alleges that interrogators threatened to rape his wife and kill his children .
Many of the detainees ' witness statements appear to corroborate each other by referring to named soldiers responsible for their alleged torture .
According to the Iraqis ' solicitors , Public Interest Law ( PIL ) , the men were all held in solitary confinement in a " compound within a compound " guarded by a specialist detachment of soldiers .
The lawyers claim that the JFIT interrogators were a mix of members of the military , MI5 and civilian staff and that they took their orders directly from London .
In 2003 the Americans raised concerns that the British were failing to secure intelligence from Iraqi prisoners held at the UK / US Camp Bucca in southern Iraq who were suspected of having close links with extremist militias .
They urged their British counterparts to take a tougher line .
Lawyers and human rights groups now believe the British heeded the Americans ' concerns by allowing personnel attached to JFIT to conduct coercive and unlawful interrogations .
The Americans were later found to have tortured prisoners held at the Abu Ghraib prison , which has since been renamed the Baghdad Central Prison .
Between 2004 and 2007 hundreds of prisoners were held at the Divisional Temporary Detention Facility compound run by JFIT at the Shaibah base .
When the JFIT interrogators had finished with them , the prisoners were released into the camp 's main prison halls , where they claim their abuse continued .

Many of these detainees complain of being subjected to sexual and physical abuse by male and female soldiers .
Last year The Independent reported that the Ministry of Defence was investigating 33 separate allegations of abuse .
Phil Shiner , a human rights lawyer who is representing all the detainees , said that the Government must come clean about the role of the JFIT interrogators in the alleged unlawful detention and abuse of Iraqi prisoners .
In a legal letter , setting out the men's claims and sent to the Defence Secretary , Bob Ainsworth , Mr Shiner said : " The forms of ill - treatment suffered by the claimants include physical beatings , deprivation of food , exposure to the cold and excessive heat , threats of rape and violence , sexual humiliation and solitary confinement .
It is manifestly clear that the extent and culmination of the above amount to a clear and egregious breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights .
" In particular , the allegations evidence a return to the use of coercive interrogation techniques declared unlawful by the European Court of Human Rights ( ECtHR ) in Ireland vUK ( 1978 ) 2 EHRR 25 .
" It must also be said that the marked similarity of the claimants ' allegations with so many other cases lends a great weight of credibility to the allegations . "
He added : " Much of the ill - treatment suffered by the men was clearly intended to break their will for the purpose of interrogation .
This is in clear breach of international provisions and in clear breach of ECtHR jurisprudence . "
A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said that while she could not comment on any individual cases she was able to confirm that all 47 were or will be investigated .
She also confirmed that JFIT is part of the Army 's intelligence corps and that , as for any other military personnel , the allegations made against them will be investigated but " remain allegations until they are proven " .
The Armed Forces minister , Bill Rammell , said : " We must never forget that over 120,000 British troops have served in Iraq and the vast , vast majority have conducted themselves to the highest standards of behaviour , displaying integrity and selfless commitment .
Only a tiny number have ever fallen short of our high standards , but even a tiny number is unacceptable .
All allegations of abuse are taken very seriously .
However , allegations must not be taken as fact , and formal investigations must be allowed to take their course without judgements being made prematurely . "
Case study : ' A soldier hit me again and again with a hammer for at least three minutes '
In one of the most disturbing cases Hussain Ghazi Shihab , 35 , claims he was badly beaten by soldiers before being handed over to specialist interrogators at Shaibah .
He recalls : " The officer showed me another photograph of a man ... [ and ] insisted that I knew where he lived .
I told him I did not know , otherwise I would take him there .
The more I told them I could n't help , the more the officer instructed the soldiers to beat me further .
The soldiers were hitting me with their fists , kicking me and bringing their rifle butts down on to my head and body .
I was hit hard in the stomach by a soldier who had picked up a hammer .
" The pain was horrendous and I fell forward grabbing my stomach in agony .
He hit me again and again with the hammer for at least three minutes on different parts of my body , but mainly concentrating on my stomach ...
I vomited later when I was in the tank and there was blood in the vomit . "
The injuries were so serious he claims members of the Joint Forward Intelligence Team were forced to break off the interrogations so he could receive hospital treatment .
Mr Shihab , a policeman employed by Iraq 's Ministry of Transport in Basra , said the lead interrogator who threatened and abused him during his detention in 2006 was dressed in civilian clothes .
In one of the most shocking allegations made against British soldiers , Mr Shihab alleges the interrogators superimposed his head on the photograph of a man sexually abusing a child .
" The photographs were of Western faces and the people looked to be around 15 to 16 years old , " he said .
" The sheet of paper was about A4 size and there were around 10 photographs on it .
The interrogator told me that I should admit to raping the children in the pictures .
He said that if did n't confess he would send information to Basra to say that I was part of a sex gang which kidnapped and raped young girls and then threw them on to the street .
" He said they were just about to send the picture to the police unless I gave them the information they required .
They even said they would distribute it on the streets in my area to my neighbours and friends . "
Case study : Sleep deprived , kept in the dark , blindfolded
Sajjad Naji Nassir , 40 , was arrested at his home by British forces on 18 September 2005 when he claims he was shot in the foot and fell unconscious .
On arrival at Shaibah he was forced into a kneeling stress position on pebbled ground .
In a letter to the Ministry of Defence his lawyers allege that he was barefoot and was dressed only in his underwear .
If he moved or rested from the stress position a soldier kicked him in the back , he says .
Mr Nassir was in this position for three hours before being taken to an interrogation .
He estimates that over an eight - hour period he was interrogated eight times before returning to his permanently dark prison cell .
He was held in these conditions for two - and - a - half months , during which time he was interrogated frequently , he says .
When Mr Nassir was taken out of his cell he was blindfolded and ear muffed and walked in a disorienting zigzag .
He was deprived of sleep by soldiers making noise and kicking the doors of the cells .
Soldiers also allegedly played pornographic movies at high volume , including during Ramadan .
He could only eat bread and fruit because the soldiers could not confirm the meat was halal .
OK , OK , Glenn , we get it .
The progressive movement is the root of all evil in America and must be purged by any means necessary to save the Republic .
Really , we get that .
You 've been saying it for a long time now .
And you 've been repeating it a lot lately .
And yesterday 's show was really just a continuation .
We learned that the " coming civil war " for " the soul of the Democratic Party " will be fought as " progressives vs. Democrats -- it 's blue vs. gray . "
We also learned that when progressives lose , " all bets are off .
They will cheat , they will lie , they will steal -- and they have in the past blown things up if it helps them win . "
But really , do you think that progressives will try to assassinate Obama if he decides to move to the political center in the coming months ?
Because that sure as hell was what you were getting at yesterday on your show .
You fretted in the opening monologue , talking about that looming internal " civil war " among Democrats :
Beck : I believe it could get ugly -- so ugly , not only do I think the Republic is in danger , I think that we need to pay real attention -- I think this president could be in real danger as well -- something I have said for awhile .
However , he never fully explained what he meant by this remark -- mostly dropping further intimations , including the remark about progressives ' supposedly violent tendencies , and then explaining " why the president is in danger " by running through one of his chalkboard talks showing Obama 's connections to such nefarious progressive entities as SEIU and ACORN .
Later , he added that these " radical revolutionaries " running the White House were planning to " deal a final death blow to the Constitution if they can . "
Beck may have been a little oblique about this on his Fox News show , but earlier yesterday on his radio show he explained his thinking in more detail ( via Media Matters ) :
Beck :
The most dangerous time in any regime , especially a radicalized regime , is when it is in collapse .
Watch the uber - Left .
Pray that Obama moves to the center .
If he does , pray that the Secret Service care for that man .
That that man is never left alone .
He has invited 9 - 11 Truthers into the White House and into his administration !
If they believe that he 's ' just another one of these guys , ' he is in danger .
Actually , Glenn , a far more likely scenario under which President Obama would be endangered were if he were to move away from the failed center where he 's been operating and tack left , especially in a populist sense , by tackling issues like banking reform and immigration .
Because then we can be certain the dogs of the TeaPartying GlennBeckian Right will not merely be howling at full bay , as they have for the past year , but literally frothing at the mouth .
Then , I would have even more concern for his well - being than I do now -- which is plenty .
TAMPA , Fla .
 President Obama sought to rekindle the fire of his presidential campaign on Thursday as he left behind his political challenges in Washington and began a series of trips around the nation to show that his administration is striving to rebuild the economy and accelerate sluggish job growth .
A day after delivering his State of the Union address , Mr. Obama came to Florida to announce the investment of $ 8 billion in high - speed rail projects in 13 major corridors , which he said would provide a down payment for the most significant advance in transportation since the Interstate highway system was built more than a half - century ago .
On Friday , the president plans to head to Baltimore where , aides said , he will urge small businesses to increase their hiring with tax credits for new employees .
Each of the stops is intended to tie Mr. Obama to programs that may be more popular locally , like a railway from Tampa to Orlando , than the economic stimulus plan has been over all .
“ The worst of the storm has passed , but I think all of you understand , the devastation remains , ” Mr. Obama told an audience at the University of Tampa .
“ One in 10 Americans still ca n’t find work .
That ’s why creating jobs has to be our No. 1 priority in 2010 . ”
In front of a packed courtroom , lawyers for eight defendants arrested during the 2008 Republican National Convention argued more than a dozen pre-trial motions before Ramsey County Judge Teresa R. Warner .
The RNC 8 defendants ( Luce Guillen - Givins , Max Specktor , Nathanael Secor , Eryn Trimmer , Monica Bicking , Erik Oseland , Robert Czernik and Garrett Fitzgerald ) were charged with conspiracy to commit criminal damage and conspiracy to commit riot .
In December , Judge Warner granted the defendants a joint trial as opposed to eight separate trials .
That decision laid the ground work for Tuesday ’s marathon session .
With more than 30 supporters in the gallery , and an appearance by Sheriff Bob Fletcher , the mood was quite jovial and relaxed at the beginning .
As motion after motion was debated between the two sides , tensions grew .
At one point Judge Warner issued a stern reprimand to one of the defense lawyers for talking over the prosecution , An outburst of laughter and talking from some of the defendants during a particularly harsh exchange between the two sides led to Judge Warner reminding the defendants and their counsel that such actions would not be tolerated during the trial , set for October 2010 .
Lawyers for the RNC 8 had submitted a range of motions , most dealing with the suppression of evidence .
Additional motions alleged that prosecutors had violated the defendants ’
First Amendment rights , and asked for dismissal of the case based upon discriminatory investigation and prosecution .
Following an hour - long closed door discussion with counsell , Judge Warner decided that the majority of the motions would be postponed .
She set aside six days ( May 3 - 6 , and May 13 - 14 ) when witnesses could be called to testify on the motions .
Witnesses had not been available to testify at Tuesday ’s hearing because the motions had been filed too close to the date .
A number of the postponed motions were motions to suppress evidence found during the execution of a search warrant on the Smith Avenue “ Convergence Center ” in Saint Paul on August 29 , 2008 .
In the motion , lawyers for the defendants argued that the raid was in violation of Minnesota statutes that require law enforcement to execute warrants between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. “ unless the court determines on the basis of facts stated in the affidavits that a nighttime search outside those hours is necessary to prevent the loss , destruction , or removal of the objects of the search or to protect the searchers or the public . ”
The defense claimed that the Ramsey County Sheriff ’s Department made a “ generalized claim that a nighttime search was requested because ‘ a search outside these hours and under the cover of darkness provides the best approach for the safety of the officers executing the warrant . ’”
The defense pointed out in the motion that the search warrant received by the Sheriff ’s Department did not make any findings that a nighttime search was required , and provided no authorization to be executed outside the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. – yet despite this , the warrant was executed at 9:15 p.m. and , for this reason , all evidence collected should be excluded from trial .
In a separate motion , also postponed to May , the defense sought to suppress evidence found in a search of a second home on East 6th Street in Saint Paul , claiming law enforcement officers failed to obtain a warrant for the search .
The defense stated in their motion that the home was under surveillance , and at the time of the search , five defendants were believed to be on the premises by law enforcement prompting the raid .
One defendant , Luce Guillen - Givins , also sought to suppress additional evidence collected during two separate incidents in 2007 , an arrest by Minneapolis police and a traffic stop by Ramsey County sheriff deputies , as well as a stop and search while crossing the Canadian border in 2008 .
Guillen - Givins ’s attorney , Jordan Kushner , argued that in each instance , police and law endorsement agents violated her rights , claiming they “ specifically and discriminatorily singled her out due to her expressed political beliefs , political activities , and political associations . ”
Guillen - Givins ’s attorney argued to have the motion postponed until May to allow for witnesses to be called .
Prosecutors objected to the motion , and Judge Warner took the request under advisement .
In a second motion , Kushner requested that all charges against Guillen - Givins be dismissed , based on “ discriminatory investigation and prosecution . ”
Guillen - Givins claimed that , based solely on her political writings and activities , the Ramsey County Sheriff ’s office singled her out for an intensive undercover investigation which led to her criminal charges .
Prosecutors pointed out that Guillen - Givins was not being singled out , and was in fact on trial facing the same charges as seven other defendants .
Kushner said he was happy with the outcome of the day , and that the trial would show that his clients were being prosecuted for being politically active .
Mr. Kushner said that the prosecution ’s case was very vague and their case was weak .
The Ramsey Country Attorney ’s office was approached for comment but declined pointing out they are limited in what they can say regarding cases pending before the court .
A new genetic analysis of Antarctic minke whales concludes that population of these smaller baleen whales have not increased as a result of the intensive hunting of other larger whales -- countering arguments by advocates of commercial whaling who want to " cull " minke whales .
Antarctic minke whales are among the few species of baleen whales not decimated by commercial whaling during the 20th century , and some scientists have hypothesized that their large numbers are hampering the recovery of deleted species , such as blue , fin and humpback , which may compete for krill .
This " Krill Surplus Hypothesis " postulates that the killing of some two million whales in the Southern Ocean during the early - and mid-20th century resulted in an enormous surplus of krill , benefiting the remaining predators , including Antarctic minke whales .
But the new analysis , published in the journal Molecular Ecology , estimates that contemporary populations of minke whales are not " unusually abundant " in comparison with their historic numbers .
Using a novel genomic approach , the scientists were able to calculate the long - term population size of Antarctic minkes as roughly 670,000 individuals -- which is similar to estimates of current population size from sighting surveys .
" Some scientists involved in the International Whaling Commission have suggested that Antarctic minke whales have increased three - fold to eight - fold over the last century because of the lack of competition for krill , " said Scott Baker , a whale geneticist at Oregon State University and associate director of the Marine Mammal Institute at OSU .
" But until now , there has been little evidence to help judge what historic populations of minke whales actually were .
" Our study clearly shows that minke whales today have a great deal of genetic diversity , which reflects a long history of large and relatively stable population size , " he added .

Along with Kristen Ruegg and Steve Palumbi of Stanford University , Baker and OSU postdoctoral fellow Jennifer Jackson analyzed genomic DNA from 52 samples of minke whale meat purchased in Japanese markets .
The whales had been killed during Japan 's controversial " scientific whaling " program in the Antarctic .
By amplifying and sequencing a large number of genes , the scientists were able to estimate the historic range of population sizes necessary to produce and maintain the levels of genetic diversity found in the individual minke whales they tested .
" This genomic approach is a significant advance over most previous studies , which have examined diversity using only a handful of genetic markers , " Baker said .
Funding for the research was provided by a grant from the Lenfest Ocean Program and the Marsden Fund of the New Zealand Royal Society .
The Southern Ocean is one of the world 's largest and most productive ecosystems and in the 20th century went through what Baker called " one of the most dramatic ' experiments ' in ecosystem modification ever conducted . "
The elimination of nearly all of the largest whales -- such as the blue , fin and humpback -- removed a huge portion of the biomass of predators in the ecosystem and changed the dynamics of predator - prey relationships .
Blue whales were reduced to about 1 - 2 percent of their previous numbers ; fin whales to about 2 - 3 percent ; and humpbacks to less than 5 percent .
" The overall loss of large whales was staggering , " Baker said .
" It is possible that the removal of the larger whales would have meant more food for minkes , " Baker said , " but we do n't know much about the historic abundance of krill and whether the different whale species competed for it in the same places , or at the same time .
It is possible that there might have been enough krill for all species prior to whaling . "
The scientists also say that current minke whale populations may be limited by other factors , including changes in sea ice cover .
" The bottom line is that the Krill Surplus Hypothesis does not appear to be valid in relation to minke whales and increasing hunting based solely on the assumption that minke whales are out - competing other large whale species would be a dubious strategy , " Baker said .
What should you do if your dog dies at home ?
Losing your beloved dog is difficult in any situation .
If your pet dies or is put to sleep at the veterinarian 's office , they will handle the remains for you .
However , if your dog dies suddenly at home , you will need to take immediate steps and make some decisions right away .
This can be hard to do when emotions are high .
Assess the Situation
Are you sure your dog has passed away ?
If you have any doubt , it 's best to take your dog to the nearest open veterinarian for help .
Try to feel your dog 's heartbeat to find out if he has a pulse , or if a cardiac arrest has occurred .
You may wish to try to perform CPR or administer another type of first aid if you think your dog may still be alive .
If you are certain that your dog has passed away , the easiest scenario is typically to take your dog 's body to the veterinarian for assistance .
Contact Your Veterinarian
If it is during normal business hours , your vet 's office can help talk you through the steps .
They may also have a way of getting you in touch with someone who can pick up your pet 's body ( like a pet crematory or mobile vet service ) .
In some cases , your vet 's office may be able to store your pet 's body for a day or two while you make a decision about aftercare arrangements , such as cremation or burial .
Your vet 's office should also be able to put you in contact with a local company to handle cremation or burial .
Fortunately , most vets have a relationship with at least one local business that offers these services .
Call for Help
This is a difficult time , so it might be best if you do n't have to be alone .
If possible , call a close friend or family member who can offer emotional support and help you handle your pet 's remains in a practical yet compassionate manner .
If you do not think you will physically and / or emotionally be able to handle your pet 's body , choose someone who you know can do this .
Handling the Body
It is not pretty to talk about , but you may need to handle your pet 's body .
If you plan to bury your pet yourself but cannot do it right away , then the body must be stored properly .
If you wish to have your pet cremated or have the burial handled by a company that cannot take your pet 's remains right away , you will also need to properly store the remains .
This may be the case if your pet dies in the middle of the night or over a holiday .
However , some pet crematories have 24/7 phone service for these kinds of situations .
The most important thing to know is that the remains of the deceased pet must be handled as soon as possible .
The brutal fact is that an animal 's body begins to decompose immediately after death .
The body will soon begin to give off a foul odor and attract insects .
The hotter the temperature , the faster the rate of decomposition .
Rigor mortis , the stiffening of the joints , typically begins within 10 minutes to three hours after death and can last as long as 72 hours .
Again , the temperature will affect this process .
Ideally , the remains will be properly handled before the onset of rigor mortis .
How to Handle and Prepare Pet Remains
Wear gloves while handling the body .
Upon death , bodily fluids are often released .
You may wish to clean the areas around your dog's mouth , genitals , and anus if you notice fluid or waste .
Additional bodily fluid and / or waste might be released when the body is moved .
Obtain a blanket , towel or bed sheet that is large enough to wrap around the body .
Also , get a heavy - duty plastic trash bag ( double them up if the body is very large or if the bags are thin ) .
Arrange the body on the blanket , towel or sheet .
Place the body on its side in a curled - up position , as if sleeping .
This may offer a sense of peace and also make it easier to handle the body .
Tightly wrap the body in the blanket , towel or sheet .
Then , slide the body into the plastic bag(s ) .
This will be a two - person job if the dog is large .
If possible , tie the bag into a secure knot or tape it closed .
You may wish to double up on bags .
If the remains will be going elsewhere , be sure to attach a label or tag with your name and your dog 's name .
Remains should be kept in a freezer or refrigerator until burial , cremation , or another arrangement takes place .
If you are unable to store the remains in this manner and cannot get the body to your vet or a local pet aftercare company , a garage or basement may need to suffice .
This should be for no longer than 4 to 6 hours as the odor will become severe and permeate your home .
Use of additional plastic bags is recommended if freezer or refrigerator storage is not possible .
Burying Your Dog's Body
If you wish to bury your dog on your property , see if local laws allow this .
Certain areas prohibit the burial of pets , especially in cities .
Before burial , remove the body from any non-biodegradable materials ( such as plastic ) before burial .
The body can be placed in a wooden or cardboard casket if desired .
The grave should be at least 3 feet deep .
Choose a location that is not likely to erode or be accidentally dug up again .
You may wish to place a headstone or other marker at your pet 's grave to memorialize your beloved pet .

In the film The King and I , three musical numbers were filmed and then deleted from the movie .
They were : “ My Lord and Master ” ( a ballad sung by Tuptim shortly after her arrival in the palace ) – “ Shall I Tell You What I Think of You ? ” ( a soliloquy for Anna , in which she comically expresses her anger towards the King ) – “ I Have Dreamed ” ( another duet for Tuptim and Lun Tha ) –
It was felt that “ My Lord and Master ” and “ I Have Dreamed ” did n’t do much to advance the plot , and the number “ Shall I Tell You What I Think of You ? ” would make Anna sound too whiny and nagging .

In preparation for his role as The Joker , Heath Ledger hid away in a hotel room for about six weeks .
Ledger delved deep into the psychology of the character .
Ledger ’s interpretation of The Joker ’s appearance was primarily based off of the look of punk rocker Sid Vicious combined with the psychotic mannerisms of Malcolm McDowell ’s character , Alex De Large , from A Clockwork Orange .

4 Female Best Director
Achievement : Four Woman Nominated for Best Director
I found this hard to believe because there have been so many talented woman directors over the years .
No woman has won an Oscar for Best Director and only four have been nominated .
1. Lina Wertmuller for Seven Beauties ( 1976 )
2. Jane Campion for The Piano ( 1993 )
3. Sofia Coppola for Lost in Translation ( 2003 )
4. Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker ( 2008 )
Note : The Hurt Locker was first released theatrically in Italy in 2008 .
It was then released in the United States in 2009 and will be eligible for the upcoming Academy Awards .
So Kathryn Bigelow could be the first woman to win an Oscar for Directing .
Interesting Fact : Lina Wertmüller ’s films are highly reflective of her own political commitments , with the main characters either dedicated anarchists , communists , feminists ( or all ) .
3 The Big Five
Achievement : Three films winning for Best Picture , Director , Actor , Actress and Writing
In the Biz this is known as “ The Big Five ” or the “ Oscar Grand Slam ” .
1. It Happened One Night ( 1934 ) Director : Frank Capra Actor : Clark Gable Actress : Claudette Colbert Writing Adaptation : Robert Riskin
2. One Flew Over the Cuckoo ’s Nest ( 1975 ) Director : Miloš Forman Actor : Jack Nicholson Actress : Louise Fletcher Writing Adapted Screenplay : Laurence Hauben and Bo Goldman
3 . The Silence of the Lambs ( 1991 ) Director : Jonathan Demme , Actor : Anthony Hopkins Actress : Jodie Foster , Writing Adapted Screenplay : Ted Tally
Interesting Fact : Clark Gable gave his Oscar for It Happened One Night to a child who admired it , telling him it was the winning of the statue that had mattered , not owning it .
The child returned the Oscar to the Gable family after Clark ’s death in 1960 .
2 Self - Directing
Achievement : Two Directors that Directed Themselves to an Acting Oscar
1. Laurence Olivier , Director of and Best Actor for Hamlet ( 1948 )
2. Roberto Benigni , Director of and Best Actor for Life Is Beautiful ( 1998 )
Neither Olivier or Benigni were awarded the Oscar for Best Director
Interesting Fact :
In the film Hamlet , Olivier played the voice of Hamlet ’s father ’s ghost himself by recording the dialog and playing it back at a reduced speed , giving it a macabre quality .
You can hear the voice at 2 minutes and 49 second into this clip .

1 Four Oscars
Achievement : One Actor Winning 4 Oscars
Katharine Hepburn holds the current record for the most acting Academy Awards won by an individual .
The movies are : Morning Glory ( 1933 ) Guess Who ’s Coming to Dinner ( 1967 ) The Lion in Winter ( 1968 ) On Golden Pond ( 1981 ) All 4 Oscars are for best actress .
You can see all four of her Oscars here .
Interesting Fact : Another one and only achievement is the only actor to win an Oscar for playing a real - life actor who has received an Oscar .
Ironically it is Cate Blanchett for winning Best Supporting actress in the 2004 film The Aviator , in which she played Katharine Hepburn .
0 Science Fiction
Achievement : Zero Science Fiction Films Winning Best Picture
Sci -fi movies have never been a big favorite for the Academy .
District 9 and Avatar are both up for best Picture for this year ’s academy awards and a win from one of the two would mark the first best picture Oscar for a science fiction film .
There have only been a few nominated science - fiction films for best picture in the past , including A Clockwork Orange ( 1971 ) , Star Wars ( 1977 ) and E.T. : The Extra-Terrestrial ( 1982 ) .
Interesting Fact :
There are several legends attributed to the “ Oscar ” nickname .
Betty Davis claimed to have dubbed the statue with the name because its backside reminded her of Harmon Oscar Nelson , her husband .
Another story claims the Academy ’s first librarian , Margaret Herrick , named the award because it reminded her of her uncle Oscar .
Columnist Sidney Skolsky lays claims to making a vaudeville reference when he coined the name in the press .
The Academy began officially calling the award Oscar in 1939 .
KABUL , Afghanistan 
The NATO general in charge of training the Afghan police has some tongue - in - cheek career advice for the country ’s recruits .
“ It ’s better to join the Taliban ; they pay more money , ” said Brig .
Gen. Carmelo Burgio , from Italy ’s paramilitary Carabinieri force .
That sardonic view reflects a sobering reality .
The attempts to build a credible Afghan police force are faltering badly even as officials acknowledge that the force will be a crucial piece of the effort to have Afghans manage their own security so American forces can begin leaving next year .
Though they have revamped the program recently and put it under new leadership , Afghan , NATO and American officials involved in the training effort list a daunting array of challenges , as familiar as they are intractable .
MIAMI —
In her 88 years , Florence Siegel has learned how to relax : A glass of red wine .
A crisp copy of The New York Times , if she can wrest it from her husband .
Some classical music , preferably Bach .
And every night like clockwork , she lifts a pipe to her lips and smokes marijuana .
Long a fixture among young people , use of the country ’s most popular illicit drug is now growing among the AARP set , as the massive generation of baby boomers who came of age in the 1960s and ‘ 70s grows older .
The number of people aged 50 and older reporting marijuana use in the prior year went up from 1.9 percent to 2.9 percent from 2002 to 2008 , according to surveys from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration .
The rise was most dramatic among 55 - to 59 - year - olds , whose reported marijuana use more than tripled from 1.6 percent in 2002 to 5.1 percent .
Observers expect further increases as 78 million boomers born between 1945 and 1964 age .
For many boomers , the drug never held the stigma it did for previous generations , and they tried it decades ago .
Some have used it ever since , while others are revisiting the habit in retirement , either for recreation or as a way to cope with the aches and pains of aging .
Siegel walks with a cane and has arthritis in her back and legs .
She finds marijuana has helped her sleep better than pills ever did .
And she ca n’t figure out why everyone her age is n’t sharing a joint , too .
“ They ’re missing a lot of fun and a lot of relief , ” she said .
Politically , advocates for legalizing marijuana say the number of older users could represent an important shift in their decades - long push to change the laws .
“ For the longest time , our political opponents were older Americans who were not familiar with marijuana and had lived through the ‘ Reefer Madness ’ mentality and they considered marijuana a very dangerous drug , ” said Keith Stroup , the founder and lawyer of NORML , a marijuana advocacy group .
“ Now , whether they resume the habit of smoking or whether they simply understand that it ’s no big deal and that it should n’t be a crime , in large numbers they ’re on our side of the issue . ”
Each night , 66 - year - old Stroup says he sits down to the evening news , pours himself a glass of wine and rolls a joint .
He ’s used the drug since he was a freshman at Georgetown , but many older adults are revisiting marijuana after years away .
“ The kids are grown , they ’re out of school , you ’ve got time on your hands and frankly it ’s a time when you can really enjoy marijuana , ” Stroup said .
“ Food tastes better , music sounds better , sex is more enjoyable . ”
The drug is credited with relieving many problems of aging : aches and pains , glaucoma , macular degeneration , and so on .
Patients in 14 states enjoy medical marijuana laws , but those elsewhere buy or grow the drug illegally to ease their conditions .
Among them is Perry Parks , 67 , of Rockingham , N.C. , a retired Army pilot who suffered crippling pain from degenerative disc disease and arthritis .
He had tried all sorts of drugs , from Vioxx to epidural steroids , but found little success .
About two years ago he turned to marijuana , which he first had tried in college , and was amazed how well it worked for the pain .
“ I realized I could get by without the narcotics , ” Parks said , referring to prescription painkillers .
“ I am essentially pain free . ”
But there ’s also the risk that health problems already faced by older people can be exacerbated by regular marijuana use .
Older users could be at risk for falls if they become dizzy , smoking it increases the risk of heart disease and it can cause cognitive impairment , said Dr. William Dale , chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the University of Chicago Medical Center .
He said he ’d caution against using it even if a patient cites benefits .
“ There are other better ways to achieve the same effects , ” he said .
Pete Delany , director of applied studies at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , said boomers ’ drug use defied stereotypes , but is important to address .
“ When you think about people who are 50 and older you do n’t generally think of them as using illicit drugs — the occasional Hunter Thompson or the kind of hippie dippie guy that gets a lot of press maybe , ” he said .
“ As a nation , it ’s important to us to say , ‘ It ’s not just young people using drugs it ’s older people using drugs . ’ ”
In conversations , older marijuana users often say they smoke in less social settings than when they were younger , frequently preferring to enjoy the drug privately .
They say the quality ( and price ) of the drug has increased substantially since their youth and they are n’t as paranoid about using it .
Dennis Day , a 61 - year - old attorney in Columbus , Ohio , said when he used to get high , he wore dark glasses to disguise his red eyes , feared talking to people on the street and worried about encountering police .
With age , he says , any drawbacks to the drug have disappeared .
“ My eyes no longer turn red , I no longer get the munchies , ” Day said .
“ The primary drawbacks to me now are legal . ”
Siegel bucks the trend as someone who was well into her 50s before she tried pot for the first time .
She can muster only one frustration with the drug .
“ I never learned how to roll a joint , ” she said .
“ It ’s just a big nuisance .
It ’s much easier to fill a pipe . ”

Dying , for stars , has just gotten more complicated .
For some stellar objects , the final phase before or instead of collapsing into a black hole may be what a group of physicists is calling an electroweak star .
Glenn Starkman , a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve University , together with former graduate students and post - docs De-Chang Dai and Dejan Stojkovic , now at the State University of New York in Buffalo , and Arthur Lue , at MIT 's Lincoln Lab , offer a description of the structure of an electroweak star in a paper submitted to Physical Review Letters .
Ordinary stars are powered by the fusion of light nuclei into heavier ones -- such as hydrogen into helium in the center of our sun .
Electroweak stars , they theorize , would be powered by the total conversion of quarks -- the particles that make up the proton and neutron building blocks of those nuclei -- into much lighter particles called leptons .
These leptons include electrons , but especially elusive -- and nearly massless -- neutrinos .
" This is a process predicted by the well - tested Standard Model of particle physics , " Starkman said .
At ordinary temperatures it is so incredibly rare that it probably has n't happened within the visible universe anytime in the last 10 billion years , except perhaps in the core of these electroweak stars and in the laboratories of some advanced alien civilizations , he said .
In their dying days , stars smaller than 2.1 times our sun 's mass die and collapse into neutron stars -- objects dense enough that the neutrons and protons push against each other .
More massive stars are thought to head toward collapse into a black hole .
But at the extreme temperatures and densities that might be reached when a star begins to collapse into a black hole , electroweak conversion of quarks into leptons should proceed at a rapid rate , the scientists say .
The energy generated could halt the collapse , much as the energy generated by nuclear fusion prevents ordinary stars like the Sun from collapsing .
In other words , an electroweak star is the possible next step before total collapse into a black hole .
If the electroweak burning is efficient , it could consume enough mass to prevent what 's left from ever becoming a black hole .
Most of the energy eventually emitted from electroweak stars is in the form of neutrinos , which are hard to detect .
A small fraction comes out as light and this is where the electroweak star 's signature will likely be found , Starkman , said .
But , " To understand that small fraction , we have to understand the star better than we do . "
And until they do , it 's hard to know how we can tell electroweak stars from other stars .
There 's time , however , to learn .
The theorists have calculated that this phase of a star 's life can last more than 10 million years -- a long time for us , though just an instant in the life of a star .

Tick - tock , trivia buffs : Monday is the deadline for doing your side any good in an online Trivial Pursuit contest - men vs. women -- that right now is so close it needs a breath mint .
As I type , the contest has generated more than 8 million correct answers - wrong ones are not counted - and women hold an advantage over men that can best be described as hanging by a chad : 11,638 , down slightly since yesterday .
That 's 50.07 percent for the women versus 49.93 percent for the men .
( See updates below . )
The lead has changed hands several times since this game - Hasbro cheekily calls it an " experiment " -- began back on Oct. 7 .
When I first wrote about it Oct. 27 , women held a commanding 58 % to 42 % lead .
However , that post quickly gained attention on social media sites such as Digg , Fark and Reddit , which resulted in a less - than - 24 - hour turnaround that left the men ahead 54 % to 46 % ( although at that juncture the total number of questions answered correctly numbered fewer than a million ) .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
Fast - forward six weeks and the female trivia brigade had erased that Buzzblog - fueled lead and fashioned a small beachhead of an advantage , which they have managed to more or less maintain ( ca n't say I 've been watching daily ) ever since .
The contest proved so popular that Hasbro extended the original Dec. 31 finish line to Monday , Feb .
22 - I 'm still trying to get an exact time - at which point the company says the score counting will stop and a winner will be declared .
The contest rules are simple enough :
You go to Hasbro 's special Trivial Pursuit Web site , announce your gender , and start answering questions in the familiar categories -- art / literature , sports / leisure , science / nature , geography , history and entertainment .
Yes , people can lie about their gender .
However , since only correct answers count -- there 's no penalty assessed for a wrong answer -- it 's not possible that anyone is sabotaging their opposite sex by intentionally tanking questions .
You get only 20 seconds to give your answer , so you either know , do n't know , or are mighty fast with a search engine .
You say this contest is nothing but a marketing gimmick and it's probably been rigged by Hasbro to provide maximum drama ?
Well , you 're absolutely right on the first score - Hasbro is quite open about the fact that it is promoting a new game called Trivial Pursuit Team .
As for stacking the deck ?
There 's nothing that I 'm aware of to support the suspicion , once you get by the obvious fact that marketers have been known to do dastardly deeds .
Commercial interests and conspiracy theories aside , the contest has engendered a wide variety of reactions , both good - natured and decidedly negative .
This advertising / marketing blog thinks it 's a hoot - and effective .
A Fark reader commented : " Really Hasbro ?
As if the new Risk - but - with - extra - testosterone - EXTREME were n't enough , now this ?
Keep your Barbie / G.I. Joe divisiveness out of my board games . "
The London press took notice .
And , there even have been arguments over grammar , witness this point / counterpoint about Hasbro 's question : " Who 's smarter than who ? "
( After risking math earlier in this post , I feel no need to get involved in this one . )
Everyone is entitled to their opinion about the game , of course , but this much is known for certain :
Time is running out and it's clear that the outcome -- and whatever bragging rights may be at stake -- could go either way .
( By the way , the earlier hanging chad reference had me scurrying to find the actual official tally from Bush / Gore / Florida / 2000 and turns out it was even closer than this weighty trivia contest , not to mention closer than I had remembered : 537 votes , or roughly one one - thousandth of one percent of the 5.8 million votes tabulated . )
( Update , 1:30 p.m. :
Have checked a few times today and that lead of 11,638 that the women enjoyed earlier this morning has been dwindling .
Now stands at 7,079 . )
( Update , 3:45 : Not trending well for the women .
Lead down to 4,647 . )
( Update , 6:50 : Meltdown continues .
Lead at 1,599 . )
( Update , 8:45 : Men lead by 1,601 .
Has seemed inevitable all day . )
( Update , Fri , Feb.19 , 5:40 a.m. : Lead for men has inched up to 2,167 overnight .
Based on what I 've seen of the pendulum swings in this contest , I 'd say it 's definitely still too close to call with the better part of four days left . )
( Update , Fri , 4:40 p.m. : Lead for men now 4,055 . )
( Update , Sat , Feb. 20 , 6:15 a.m. : Women regain momentum overnight ; men 's lead slips to 3,338 .
Game on ... still . )
After last week 's Pokemon Sunday show in Japan showed off a silhouette teaser of an upcoming Pokemon , and CoroCoro magazine teased the announcement for their upcoming issue , Poke fanatics got to work , and tracked down and leaked the first images of the newest additions to the pocket monster family .
Meet Zorua and his bigger evolution , Zoroark , two Dark type Pokemon set to appear in the upcoming 5th Generation of Pokemon role playing games .
While it 's certainly no surprise to see Nintendo teasing new Pokemon , or announcing a new game , it 's still pretty exciting for the fans .
Zoroark was the silhouette teased on the show , and will be a character in the upcoming 13th Pokemon film .
Obviously the smaller , cuter one evolves into the bigger , tougher one .
Rumor is that the Pokemon may be a Legendary , but the fact that it evolves seems to negate that point .
What we know is that they 're Dark types , and Zorua is described as an " evil fox Pokemon . "
Nintendo has teased new Pokemon in the past , and many times the critters have been some of the less important monsters ( Snubbull , Maril , Donphan ) .
The CoroCoro article hints at a possible new method of evolution for these Pokemon .
Now that the information is out , expect Nintendo to hype the new characters , especially since they seem to be the antagonists of the upcoming movie .
( CNN ) -- Despite calls from President Obama to beef up the program designed to provide security aboard U.S. flights , the Federal Air Marshal Service is in disarray , a CNN investigation has found .
In more than a dozen interviews across the country , air marshals said the agency is rife with cronyism ; age , gender and racial discrimination ; and attempts by managers to make the agency appear more efficient than it is by padding numbers .
Air marshals describe an agency in chaos , where bored and frustrated marshals focus more on internal squabbles than watching for bad guys .
The marshals refused to let their identities be known , for fear of retaliation in an agency that is driven , they say , by intimidation and favoritism .
After a Nigerian 's attempt to blow up an airliner preparing to land in Detroit , Michigan , on Christmas Day , a growing number of critics have called for either the elimination or a total overhaul of the agency .
Last week , President Obama asked Congress for an additional $ 85 million to boost the air marshals program , known by its acronym FAMS , after the foiled attack aboard the jet coming from the Netherlands .
U.S. officials have charged Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab with attempting to blow up the airliner .
He was subdued by passengers and crew .
No air marshals were on the flight , generating additional criticism of the service .
Despite efforts by Obama and assurances by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano that FAMS will become more effective , one air marshal told CNN , " Nothing 's particularly changed for me since Christmas Day , or ( for ) a big percentage of people that I work with .
Everything is pretty much the same . "
In January , Napolitano testified before a Senate committee , where she vowed , " We will strengthen the capacity of aviation law enforcement , including the Federal Air Marshal Service . "
International flights are considered to have the highest risk .
However , air marshals from a half dozen FAMS field offices said the agency continues to assign marshals to short , regional routes on small jets .
The marshals told CNN that lots of short - haul flights make the agency look more productive on paper .
The marshals said if someone dares criticize a manager , he or she can be banished to what they call " Team America , " referring to the regional trips .
Managers and favored employees receive the perk of traveling international routes , they said .
Repeatedly , air marshals reported that the decision on who flies on what flights are driven by extra pay for managers , and office politics -- not security .
Despite repeated requests , FAMS and its parent agency , the Transportation Security Administration , declined to give CNN an interview .
However , TSA spokesman Nelson Minerly provided a statement , saying , " The Transportation Security Administration 's Federal Air Marshals are strategically deployed aboard U.S. flagged air carriers to ensure the safety and security of the traveling public .
" The Federal Air Marshal Service is currently training and deploying fellow federal law enforcement officers to support the administration 's enhancement in aviation security .
Federal Air Marshals and these additional highly trained officers are being deployed aboard an increasing number of flights worldwide to keep air travel safe , " Minerly wrote .
Rep. John Duncan , R - Tennessee , is one of FAMS ' harshest critics .
" It 's just a total waste of money , " he told CNN in a recent interview .
" I know that any time you create a federal bureaucracy , it just grows and grows , and the appropriation just goes up and up , but ... look at the record .
They have n't done anything . "
" I had the statistic from last year , " the Republican said .
" They made four arrests for an appropriation of $ 800 million .
It came out to more than $ 200 million per arrest .
It 's just ridiculous . "
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , D - Texas , does n't want FAMS eliminated , she wants it revamped .
" If we 've got those kinds of problems , we need to get a ready broom and sweep , " she said .
" The only way we are going to ensure the security and safety of the American people is that we have staff par excellence , and I know they are out there . "
Although the actual number of air marshals is classified , it has been widely reported that the number of air marshals covering 28,000 flights per day is fewer than 4,000 .
Even with a generous calculation , the marshals only cover 5 percent of flights , according to CNN assessments .
CNN has been studying FAMS for three years , and during that time , air marshals have accused managers of using creative accounting to pad the numbers given to Congress .
They describe an agency in chaos that , in some cases , promotes discrimination against minorities .
" We do n't have managers who provide training or provide leadership or do anything other than produce conflict , " one said .
John Mueller , a political science professor at Ohio State University , has completed a cost - benefit analysis of U.S. aviation security .
He concluded many measures such as FAMS are little more than a waste of taxpayer dollars .
" We have seen with the underwear bomber ( AbdulMutallab ) , the passengers are n't going to sit around waiting for someone else to do something .
Because their lives are at stake , they are going to jump in .
So essentially from a hijackers ' standpoint , this idea of replicating 9/11 is close to impossible as far as I can see , " Mueller said .
The air marshal program was set up in 1970 , after a rash of airline hijackings , and it was expanded significantly after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
Specially trained to safeguard passengers and crew aboard crowded aircraft , air marshals were seen as a critical component in the overall effort to secure America 's commercial aviation system .

If the question is allowing people to experiment with all pharmaceutical products , I see a few possible arguments ( I 'm not necessarily endorsing them ) against doing that :
1 . There will be more successes but also a greater number of bad events .
This will possibly cause people to lose confidence in pharmaceuticals , just as many crazy theories circulate about vaccines and many people refuse them or refuse them for their children .
2 . Our courts are not up to handling a greater number of liability suits , whether in terms of the quality of those courts or their ability to handle the case load .
See Andrei Shleifer 's recent paper on regulation as a substitute for an imperfect court system .
3 . I am a fan of Robin Hanson 's paper " Warning Labels as Cheap Talk : Why Regulators Ban Products . "
This was the piece Robin presented when we hired him , and it later appeared in JPubEc .
The main point is that a verbal governmental warning : " We 're really not sure this is safe , caveat emptor ! " is not usually credible and people will regard the product as safe , thinking the government would not have otherwise let it come to market .
4. Parents cannot be trusted with their children .
Still , I think there is a good case for greater freedom for choice when it comes to pharmaceuticals .
Want to know what freshly developed apps for the iPad are going to feel like ?
Looking through Apple 's iPad User Experience Guidelines is surprisingly revealing .

Some of the key points Apple 's pushing on app developers for the iPad , and how Apple thinks their apps should behave :
• They want apps to work no matter how you hold the iPad : " Your application should encourage people to interact with iPad from any side by providing a great experience in all orientations . "
Advertisement
• They do n't want applications to just be bigger : " The best iPad applications give people innovative ways to interact with content while they perform a clearly defined , finite task .
Resist the temptation to fill the large screen with features that are not directly related to the main task .
In particular , you should not view the large iPad screen as an invitation to bring back all the functionality you pruned from your iPhone application . "
That 's some straight talk .
• They 're super into the sharing thing : " Think of ways people might want to use your application with others .
Expand your thinking to include both the physical sharing of a single device and the virtual sharing of data . "

• The oddly " realistic " bookshelf in iBooks is n't a fluke : " Consider a more real - world vision of your application .
For example , on iPhone , Contacts is a streamlined list , but on iPad , Contacts is an address book with a beautifully tangible look and feel . "
• Multi -finger gestures will abound : " The large iPad screen provides great scope for multifinger gestures , including gestures made by more than one person . "

• It should n't feel like a computer , even if the iPad lets you do computer -y things with files now : " Although iPad applications can allow people to create and manipulate files and share them with a computer ( when the device is docked ) , this does not mean that people should have a sense of the file system on iPad .

The Lessons of Easter Island
By Clive Ponting
Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited places on earth .
Only some 150 square miles in area , it lies in the Pacific Ocean , 2,000 miles off the west coast of South America and 1250 miles from the nearest inhabitable land of Pitcairn Island .
At its peak the population was only about 7,000 .
Yet despite its superficial insignificance , the history of Easter Island is a grim warning to the world .
The Dutch Admiral Roggeveen , on board the Arena was the first European to visit the island on Easter Sunday 1722 .
He found a society in a primitive state with about 3,000 people living in squalid reed huts or caves , engaged in almost perpetual warfare and resorting to cannibalism in a desperate attempt to supplement the meagre food supplies available on the island .
During the next European visit in 1770 the Spanish nominally annexed the island but it was so remote , underpopulated and lacking in resources that no formal colonial occupation ever took place .
There were a few more brief visits in the late eighteenth century , including one by Captain Cook in 1774 .
An American ship stayed long enough to carry off twenty - two inhabitants to work as slaves killing seals on Masafuera Island off the Chilean coast .
The population continued to decline and conditions on the island worsened : in 1877 the Peruvians removed and enslaved all but 110 old people and children .
Eventually the island was taken over by Chile and turned into a giant ranch for 40,000 sheep run by a British company , with the few remaining inhabitants confined to one small village .
What amazed and intrigued the first European visitors was the evidence , amongst all the squalor and barbarism , of a once flourishing and advanced society .
Scattered across the island were over 6 oo massive stone statues , on average over twenty feet high .
When anthropologists began to consider the history and culture of Easter Island early in the twentieth century they agreed on one thing .
The primitive people living in such poverty - stricken and backward conditions when the Europeans first visited the island could not have been responsible for such a socially advanced and technologically complex task as carving , transporting and erecting the statues .
Easter Island therefore became a `mystery ' and a wide variety of theories were advanced to explain its history .
Some of the more fantastic ideas involved visits by spacemen or lost civilisations on continents that had sunk into the Pacific leaving Easter Island as a remnant .
The Norwegian archaeologist Thor Heyerdahl , in his popular book ' Aku - Aku ' written in the 1950s , emphasises the strange aspects of the island and the mysteries that lay hidden in its history .
He argued that the island was first settled from South America and that from there the people inherited a tradition of monumental sculpture and stone work ( similar to the great Inca achievements ) .
To account for the decline he introduced the idea that at a late stage other settlers arrived from the west and began a series of wars between the so - called `long - ears ' and the `short - ears ' that destroyed the complex society on the island .
While this theory is less extravagant than some of the others that have been put forward it has never been generally accepted by other archaeologists .
The history of Easter Island is not one of lost civilisations and esoteric knowledge .
Rather it is a striking example of the dependence of human societies on their environment and of the consequences of irreversibly damaging that environment .
It is the story of a people who , starting from an extremely limited resource base , constructed one of the most advanced societies in the world for the technology they had available .
However , the demands placed on the environment of the island by this development were immense .
When it could no longer withstand the pressure , the society that had been painfully built up over the previous thousand years fell with it .
The colonisation of Easter Island belongs to the last phase in the long - drawn - out movement of human settlement across the globe .
The first people arrived sometime in the fifth century at a period when the Roman empire was collapsing in western Europe , China was still in chaos following the fall of the Han empire two hundred years earlier , India saw the end of the shortlived Gupta empire and the great city of Teotihuacan dominated most of Mesoamerica .
They were Polynesians and part of a great process of exploration and settlement across the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean .
The original Polynesians came from south - east Asia and they reached the islands of Tonga and Samoa about 1000 BC .
From there they moved further east to the Marquesas Islands about 300 AD and then in two directions , south - east to Easter Island and north to Hawaii in the fifth century .
The last phases of the movement were to the Society Islands about 600 and from there to New Zealand about 800 .
When this settlement was complete , the Polynesians were the most widely spread people on earth encompassing a huge triangle from Hawaii in the north to New Zealand in the south - west and Easter Island in the south - east - an area twice the size of the present continental United States .
Their long voyages were made in double canoes , joined together by a broad central platform to transport and shelter people , plants , animals and food .
These were deliberate colonisation missions and they represented considerable feats of navigation and seamanship since the prevailing currents and winds in the Pacific are against west to east travel .
When the first people found Easter Island , they discovered a world with few resources .
The island was volcanic in origin , but its three volcanoes had been extinct for at least 400 years before the Polynesian settlers arrived .
Both temperatures and humidity were high and , although the soil was adequate , drainage was very bad and there were no permanent streams on the island ; the only fresh water available was from lakes inside the extinct volcanoes .
Because of its remoteness the island had only a few species of plants and animals .
There were thirty indigenous species of flora , no mammals , a few insects and two types of small lizard .
The waters around the island contained very few fish .
The arrival of the first humans did little to improve the situation .
The Polynesians in their home islands depended on a very limited range of plants and animals for subsistence : their only domesticated animals were chickens , pigs , dogs and the Polynesian rat and the main crops were yam , taro , breadfruit , banana , coconut and sweet potato .
The settlers on Easter Island brought only chickens and rats with them and they soon found that the climate was too severe for semi-tropical plants such as breadfruit and coconut and extremely marginal for the usual mainstays of their diet , taro and yam .
The inhabitants were , therefore , restricted to a diet based mainly on sweet potatoes and chickens .
The only advantage of this monotonous , though nutritionally adequate , diet was that cultivation of the sweet potato was not very demanding and left plenty of time for other activities .
It is not known how many settlers arrived in the fifth century but they probably numbered no more than twenty or thirty at most .
As the population slowly increased the forms of social organisation familiar in the rest of Polynesia were adopted .
The basic social unit was the extended family , which jointly owned and cultivated the land .
Closely related households formed lineages and clans , each of which had its own centre for religious and ceremonial activity .
Each clan was headed by a chief who was able to organise and direct activities and act as a focal point for the redistribution of food and other essentials within the clan .
It was this form of organisation and the competition ( and probably conflict ) between the clans that produced both the major achievements of Easter Island society and ultimately its collapse .
Settlements were scattered across the island in small clusters of peasant huts with crops grown in open fields .
Social activities were centred around separate ceremonial centres , which were occupied for part of the year .
The chief monuments were large stone platforms , similar to those found in other parts of Polynesia and known as ahu , which were used for burials , ancestor worship and to commemorate past clan chiefs .
What made Easter Island different was that crop production took very little effort and therefore there was plenty of free time which the clan chiefs were able to direct into ceremonial activities .
The result was the creation of the most advanced of all the Polynesian societies and one of the most complex in the world for its limited resource base .
The Easter Islanders engaged in elaborate rituals and monument construction .
Some of the ceremonies involved recitation from the only known Polynesian form of writing called rongorongo , which was probably less a true script and more a series of mnemonic devices .
One set of elaborate rituals was based on the bird cult at Orongo , where there are the remains of forty - seven special houses together with numerous platforms and a series of high - relief rock carvings .
The crucial centres of ceremonial activity were the ahu .
Over 300 of these platforms were constructed on the island , mainly near the coast .
The level of intellectual achievement of at least some parts of Easter Island society can be judged by the fact that a number of these ahu have sophisticated astronomical alignments , usually towards one of the solstices or the equinox .
At each site they erected between one and fifteen of the huge stone statues that survive today as a unique memorial to the vanished Easter Island society .
It is these statues which took up immense amounts of peasant labour .
The statues were carved , using only obsidian stone tools , at the quarry at Rano Raraku .
They were fashioned to represent in a highly stylised form a male head and torso .
On top of the head was placed a `topknot ' of red stone weighing about ten tons from another quarry .
The carving was a time - consuming rather than a complex task .
The most challenging problem was to transport the statues , each some twenty feet in length and weighing several tens of tons , across the island and the then erect them on top of the ahu
The Easter Islanders ' solution to the problem of transport provides the key to the subsequent fate of their whole society .
Lacking any draught animals they had to rely on human power to drag the statues across the island using tree trunks as rollers .
The population of the island grew steadily from the original small group in the fifth century to about 7,000 at its peak in 1550 .
Over time the number of clan groups would have increased and also the competition between them .
By the sixteenth century hundreds of ahu had been constructed and with them over 600 of the huge stone statues .
Then , when the society was at its peak , it suddenly collapsed leaving over half the statues only partially completed around Rano Raraku quarry .
The cause of the collapse and the key to understanding the `mysteries ' of Easter Island was massive environmental degradation brought on by deforestation of the whole island .
When the first Europeans visited the island in the eighteenth century it was completely treeless apart from a handful of isolated specimens at the bottom of the deepest extinct volcano crater of Rano Kao .
However , recent scientific work , involving the analysis of pollen types , has shown that at the time of the initial settlement Easter Island had a dense vegetation cover including extensive woods .
As the population slowly increased , trees would have been cut down to provide clearings for agriculture , fuel for heating and cooking , construction material for household goods , pole and thatch houses and canoes for fishing .
The most demanding requirement of all was the need to move the large number of enormously heavy statues to ceremonial sites around the island .
The only way this could have been done was by large numbers of people guiding and sliding them along a form of flexible tracking made up of tree trunks spread on the ground between the quarry and the ahu .
Prodigious quantities of timber would have been required and in increasing amounts as the competition between the clans to erect statues grew :
As a result by 1600 the island was almost completely deforested and statue erection was brought to a halt leaving many stranded at the quarry .
The deforestation of the island was not only the death knell for the elaborate social and ceremonial life it also had other drastic effects on every day life for the population generally .
From 1500 the shortage of trees was forcing many people to abandon building houses from timber and live in caves , and when the wood eventually ran out altogether about a century later everyone had to use the only materials left .
They resorted to stone shelters dug into the hillsides or flimsy reed huts cut from the vegetation that grew round the edges of the crater lakes .
Canoes could no longer be built and only reed boats incapable of long voyages could be made .
Fishing was also more difficult because nets had previously been made from the paper mulberry tree ( which could also be made into cloth ) and that was no longer available .
Removal of the tree cover also badly affected the soil of the island , which would have already suffered from a lack of suitable animal manure to replace nutrients taken up by the crops .
Increased exposure caused soil erosion and the leaching out of essential nutrients .
As a result crop yields declined .
The only source of food on the island unaffected by these problems was the chickens .
As they became ever more important , they had to be protected from theft and the introduction of stone - built defensive chicken houses can be dated to this phase of the island 's history .
It became impossible to support 7,000 people on this diminish ing resource base and numbers fell rapidly
After 1600 Easter Island society went into decline and regressed to ever more primitive conditions .
Without trees , and so without canoes , the islanders were trapped in their remote home , unable to escape the consequences of their self - inflicted , environmental collapse .
The social and cultural impact of deforestation was equally important .
The inability to erect any more statues must have had a devastating effect on the belief systems and social organisation and called into question the foundations on which that complex society had been built .
There were increasing conflicts over diminishing resources resulting in a state of almost permanent warfare .
Slavery became common and as the amount of protein available fell the population turned to cannibalism .
One of the main aims of warfare was to destroy the ahu of opposing clans .
A few survived as burial places but most were abandoned .
The magnificent stone statues , too massive to destroy , were pulled down .
The first Europeans found only a few still standing when they arrived in the eighteenth century and all had been toppled by the 1830s .
When they were asked by the visitors how the statues had been moved from the quarry , the primitive islanders could no longer remember what their ancestors had achieved and could only say that the huge figures had `walked ' across the island .
The Europeans , seeing a treeless landscape , could think of no logical explanation either and were equally mystified .

Against great odds the islanders painstakingly constructed , over many centuries , one of the most advanced societies of its type in the world .
For a thousand years they sustained a way of life in accordance with an elaborate set of social and religious customs that enabled them not only to survive but to flourish .
It was in many ways a triumph of human ingenuity and an apparent victory over a difficult environment .
But in the end the increasing numbers and cultural ambitions of the islanders proved too great for the limited resources available to them .
When the environment was ruined by the pressure , the society very quickly collapsed with it leading to a state of near barbarism .
The Easter Islanders , aware that they were almost completely isolated from the rest of the world , must surely have realised that their very existence depended on the limited resources of a small island .
After all it was small enough for them to walk round the entire island in a day or so and see for themselves what was happening to the forests .
Yet they were unable to devise a system that allowed them to find the right balance with their environment .
Instead vital resources were steadily consumed until finally none were left .
Indeed , at the very time when the limitations of the island must have become starkly apparent the competition between the clans for the available timber seems to have intensified as more and more statues were carved and moved across the island in an attempt to secure prestige and status .
The fact that so many were left unfinished or stranded near the quarry suggests that no account was taken of how few trees were left on the island .
The fate of Easter Island has wider implications too .
Like Easter Island the earth has only limited resources to support human society and all its demands .
Like the islanders , the human population of the earth has no practical means of escape .
How has the environment of the world shaped human history and how have people shaped and altered the world in which they live ?
Have other societies fallen into the same trap as the islanders ?
For the last two million years humans have succeeded in obtaining more food and extracting more resources on which to sustain increasing numbers of people and increasingly complex and technologically advanced societies .
But have they been any more successful than the islanders in finding a way of life that does not fatally deplete the resources that are available to them and irreversibly damage their life support system ?

Mike Pence gives a speech on Capitol Hill .
Pence : Open GOP meetings to press
House Republicans emerged from a closed - door session Wednesday to announce that they ’d love to open those doors to the press in the future .
“ We have entertained and may well act before the end of the year on allowing the media to attend a House Republican Conference meeting , ” GOP Conference Chairman Mike Pence told reporters .

Whether that actually happens remains to be seen , but Pence ’s apparent gesture of sunlight had a larger point —
Republicans are still bashing Democrats about not opening up the final health care negotiations to be shown on C - SPAN , one of President Barack Obama ’s campaign promises .
So Pence is thinking about letting the media see what Republicans say behind closed doors .
Meanwhile , Rep. Vern Buchanan ( R - Fla . ) is pushing a resolution that would provide more transparency to negotiation sessions on Capitol Hill .
He has filed a petition that would expedite the resolution to the floor .
In Wednesday ’s closed - door meeting , GOP lawmakers discussed pressuring 37 Democratic lawmakers in swing districts who voted yes on the original legislation to oppose final passage .
A House Republican aide called Rep. Eric Cantor ’s whipping a “ full - court press . ”
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) told his members that " the American people are with " Republicans and he believes " we can beat this bill , " according to a leadership aide .

So .
I 've returned to Thomas Jefferson St. after taking a few months off for a book leave .
Why does it take such effort to write a book ?
Consider this cautionary tale : the story of The Greatest Newspaper Lead Ever Written .
When I embarked on the task of writing a biography of Clarence Darrow a few years back , I looked forward to passing on a story about the death of Richard Loeb .
Along with his gay lover , Nathan Leopold , Loeb killed a 14 - year - old boy in Chicago in 1924 for the thrill of it .
The public clamored for the death penalty , but with an eloquent plea for mercy , Darrow saved the two teen - aged killers from the gallows .
The " boys , " as Darrow called them , were geniuses from wealthy Chicago families .
Loeb was , at the time , the youngest student to ever graduate from the University of Michigan .
Leopold lived to a ripe old age in prison , and won parole .
But Loeb died one day in 1936 .
Folks who spent time in the newspaper racket in the late 20th century , as I did , heard how Edwin Lahey of the Chicago Daily News had hammered out , on deadline that afternoon , what must have been the greatest lead ever written .
In the late - night newsrooms or newspaper row bars , grizzled veterans liked to tell how Loeb approached the wrong man for sex in a prison shower room and was subsequently knifed to death .
Then , reverently , grinning , they would recite Lahey 's lead from memory : Richard Loeb , a brilliant college student and master of the English language , today ended a sentence with a proposition .
Sometimes the story was told with a flourish .
A numb skulled editor had objected to Lahey 's creation , the storyteller would insist , until other reporters threatened to quit if it was not published .
But when the time came to track down Lahey 's lead I ran into difficulty .
I discovered there were different versions in various books about the Leopold and Loeb case , in memoirs about Chicago newspaper days , and on Wikipedia and other web sites .
All had the famous pun , but with different set -ups .
Richard Loeb , who graduated with honors from college at the age of 15 and who was a master of the English language , today ended his sentence with a proposition .
Or ...
Richard Loeb , despite his erudition , today ended his sentence with a proposition .
Or ...
Richard Loeb , the well known student of English , yesterday ended his sentence with a proposition .
The discrepancies planted doubt : Might Lahey 's lead be an urban legend ?
Since I was already spending a lot of time at the Library of Congress , reading old Chicago newspapers on microfilm , I knew where I could find the Daily News .
And here is the lead from that day in January , 1936 :
Richard Loeb , one of the slayers of 14 - year - old Bobby Franks nearly 12 years ago , was slashed to death this afternoon by another convict in a fight at Statesville prison .
In fact , research reveals that Loeb 's alleged sexual " proposition " was a matter of considerable controversy .
He may well have been murdered because he spurned the other inmate 's advances , or in a quarrel over money .
See for yourself .
A blogger named Dr. Atlantis has posted a link to the images of the relevant Daily News stories on his blog .
There you can read this second - day lead from Ed Lahey :
James Day , 23 - year - old Chicago thief , who is otherwise normal , told today how and why he cut Richard Loeb , brilliant young moral anarchist , to a fringe in the Statesville penitentiary yesterday .
Not bad .
But not the best lead ever .
Which leaves us with two possibilities .
The first is that the story of the " proposition " lead was concocted by Lahey and his pals , and subsequent generations of journalists simply loved it too much to check out .
The other possibility , suggested by a book I found with a Google search , is that Lahey did write the lead , but that it only made it into one of the several editions of the Daily News that day , before his editors killed it .
Even the book 's authors , however , gave this theory half - hearted support .
" The edition in which it ran has not survived , but according to legend it went like this , " they wrote , and then opted for the " Richard Loeb , despite his erudition ... " version of the phantom lead .
So , maybe a journalism junkie somewhere in America has a copy of that singular edition in their files .
Or perhaps there 's a front page from the famous copy of the Daily News , varnished and hanging on the wall of a tavern in downtown Chicago .
If so , call me .
Until then , it 's not going in the book .

President Barack Obama will issue an executive order creating a bipartisan debt - reduction panel " very shortly , " White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday .
Obama and other members of his economic team are still " working on some of the specifics " of that commission , Gibbs told reporters during his daily press briefing .
The White House is also " making phone calls to Republican leaders , " in the hope that some GOP members will join the president 's forthcoming effort .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ultimately , the press secretary did not say whether any Republican lawmakers had already consented to serve on the new panel .
" But Gibbs nonetheless took a pre-emptive shot at the party , which he suggested was responsibile for the bipartisan commission 's defeat in the Senate last month .
" I have not noticed in the intervening weeks anything less than pretty voiceferous comments about our fiscal situation , " Gibbs said , adding seven Senate Republicans who once supported the bill to create the commission inexplicably voted against it in January .
" I can't imagine that Republicans would at one minute say this is such an important issue , and in the next minute say , ' We cant participate in a commission that will help solve what I said a minute ago was an important issue . ' "
The debt - reduction commission has become a serious talking point for Democrats , who blame Republicans for its month - long delay .
A proposal to create a stronger version of the panel once had considerable support among both parties in the Senate -- as well as the president , who endorsed the idea -- but the bill ultimately failed by a few votes .
The White House has since taken up the commission 's banner , seeking to establish it by fiat .
But the panel would be markedly less strict than its congressional predecessor , as it could not legally force Congress to vote on its recommendations , as the Senate 's bill would .
While some Republicans have lamented that condition , and others have opposed the executive order because of it , Gibbs said he hoped they would join the effort anyway .
" It 's our strong hope that Republicans world agree to participate in a committee that many of their members strongly advocate , " he said .

Some simple rules of thumb for optimal experimental design
John List , Sally Sadoff , Mathis Wagner
Experimental economics represents a strong growth industry .
In the past several decades the method has expanded beyond intellectual curiosity , meriting consideration alongside the other more traditional empirical approaches used in economics .
Accompanying this growth is an influx of new experimenters who are in need of straightforward direction to make their designs more powerful .
This column provides several simple rules of thumb that researchers can apply to improve the efficiency of their experimental designs .
Within economics , measurement approaches can be divided into two main categories : estimation of models that make use of naturally - occurring data and approaches wherein the analyst herself governs the data generation process .
A handful of popular empirical approaches are typically used when the analyst is dealing with naturally - occurring data , but the literature is replete with criticisms of their identifying assumptions , many times based on restrictiveness or implausibility ( see Blundell and Costas - Dias ( 2002 ) for a useful review ) .
In the cases where the analyst generates her own data , such as within the area of experimental economics , identification assumptions are much less severe .
To obtain the effect of treatment in the particular domain of study , the only major assumption necessary is appropriate randomisation ( with appropriate sample sizes ) .
In this manner , when running an experiment , the analyst is using randomisation as an instrumental variable ( see List 2006 ) .
But with the chore of data generation comes other , less discussed , obligations of the researcher .
In this article , we consider one such feature more carefully : the optimal number and arrangement of subjects into experimental cells .
A casual look at the literature presents a striking consistency concerning sample sizes and their arrangement .
Most studies uniformly distribute at least 30 subjects into each cell .
This approach holds whether the analyst is making use of a purely dichotomous treatment ( such as pill or no pill ) as well as when the analyst is exploring levels of treatment ( such as , various dosage levels ) .
However , allocating 30 subjects in each experimental treatment cell has little basis in terms of power unless the researcher believes that he wants to detect an approximately 0.70 standard deviation change in the outcome variable ( under conventional significance and power levels of 0.05 and 0.80 respectively ) .
Discussion of whether such a sample arrangement is efficient is more mature in other literatures , but it has not been properly vetted in the experimental economics community .
Our study attempts to fill this gap .
In doing so , we do not claim originality in any of the derivations , rather this article should be viewed as a compilation of insights from other literatures that might help experimenters in economics and related fields design more efficient experiments .
The overarching idea revolves around first implementing an experimental design that maximises the variance of the treatment variable , and second adjusting the samples to account for heterogeneity in treatment effects or costs , if necessary .
Several simple rules of thumb then follow .
In List et al ( 2010 ) , we expand on these rules of thumb , including formulas for optimal sample size calculations and empirical examples from the literature .
Simple rules of thumb for optimal experimental design
With a continuous outcome measure one should only allocate subjects equally across treatment and control if the sample variances of the outcome means are expected to be equal in the treatment and control groups .
Under the assumption of homogenous treatment effects , one would need n = 16 ( 64 ) observations in each treatment cell to detect a one ( one - half ) standard deviation change in the outcome variable ( following the standards in the literature of a significance level of 0.05 , and setting power to 0.80 ) .
To detect a one - tenth standard deviation change , 1,568 subjects are needed in each treatment cell .
In those cases where the sample variances are not equal , the ratio of the sample sizes should be set equal to the ratio of the standard deviations .
If the cost of sampling subjects varies across experimental cells , then the ratio of the sample sizes is inversely proportional to the square root of the relative costs .
When the unit of randomisation is different from the unit of analysis , special considerations must be paid to correlated outcomes .
In the presence of intracluster correlation , it is important to randomise over as small clusters as possible so as to maximise the efficiency of the experiment .
For example , a sample size of 1,000 subjects allocated to 20 clusters with 50 subjects each or , alternatively , to 50 clusters with 20 subjects each will yield power levels of 45 % and 75 % respectively .
( The example assumes a significance level of 0.05 , standardised treatment effect size of 0.2 and intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.01 . )
When the treatment variable itself is continuous , the optimal design requires that the number of treatment cells used should be equal to the highest polynomial order plus one .
The primary goal of the experimental design in this case is to maximise the variance of the treatment variable ( while still providing enough points to determine the polynomial ) .
For instance , if the analyst is interested in estimating the effect of treatment and has strong priors that the treatment has a linear effect , then the sample should be equally divided on the endpoints of the feasible treatment range , with no intermediate points sampled .
Despite the strong growth in experimental economics , several prominent discussions remain .
These include generalisability of results across domains ( but , see Levitt and List , 2007 , and subsequent studies ) , use of the strategy method , one - shot versus repeated observations , elicitation of beliefs , “ within ” versus “ between ” subject experimental designs , using experiments to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects ; and in the design area more specifically , optimal design with multiple priors and Bayesian and frequentist sample size determination are but just a few areas not yet properly vetted in the experimental economics community .
Clearly , this article represents only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to discussing optimal experimental design .
For instance , we can imagine that an entire set of papers could be produced to describe how to design experiments based on power testing and confidence intervals .
More generally , we hope that methodological discussion eventually sheds its perceived inferiority in experimental economics and begins to , at least , ride shotgun in our drive to a deeper understanding of economic science .

Search and Seizure
“ It is assumed under the law that the taking of personal property without a warrant is unconstitutional , ” said Martin J. Mayer , a founding partner in the Fullerton law firm Jones & Mayer , who represents numerous law - enforcement associations .
Mr. Mayer was referring to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which restricts law enforcement ’s authority to seize private property without a court order .
That , he said , protects everyone , whether they are in the country legally or not .
He communicated his opinion in a memorandum to his clients , California ’s police chief and sheriffs , in 2005 after a ruling by the Ninth Circuit in an Oregon case .
In that decision the court held that law enforcement could not impound a vehicle if the only offense was unlicensed driving .
The only exception permitted the police to impound a car was if it posed a threat to public safety , was parked illegally or would soon be vandalized if left in place .
The ruling sharply altered the legal status of vehicle impoundments .
In response , in 2007 the legislative counsel of California called on the state ’s police departments to cease what had become a standard practice .
“ If a peace officer lawfully stops a motor vehicle on the highway and the driver of the motor vehicle is an unlicensed driver , that alone is not sufficient justification for the peace officer to cause the impoundment of the motor vehicle , ” the counsel , who advises lawmakers , said in a report .
But the counsel has no authority over police departments .
In 2008 , in a separate case in Federal District Court case , a judge arrived at a different conclusion , agreeing with the State of California and several cities , who were defendants and argued that the impoundments were penalties for a criminal offense , and that therefore car owners were not subject to Fourth Amendment protections .
The plaintiffs ’ appeal is pending .
A 3,000 year old Bronze Age trading vessel – the oldest shipwreck ever found in British waters – has been located off the coast of Devon in South West England .
It went down around 900 BC carrying a precious cargo of tin and copper ingots from the continent , and has lain undetected on the seabed in just eight to ten metres of water in a bay near Salcombe ever since .
Experts have hailed the discovery – one of only four Bronze Age vessels found in British waters – as “ extremely important , ” and “ genuinely exciting . ”
Investigation and recovery work on the boat ’s cargo was carried out by archaeologists from South West Maritime Archaeological Group ( SWMAG ) between February and November 2009 , but the find was only made public this month at the annual International Shipwreck Conference in Plymouth .
295 artefacts – with a combined weight of 84 kilograms – have been retrieved so far , including weapons and jewellery , alongside abundant raw metal .
This cargo points to a healthy and sophisticated trade network that existed between Britain and Europe during the Bronze Age .
The find as a whole is testimony to the incredible seafaring capabilities of prehistoric Britons .
A Bronze Age settlement is known to have existed on the coast near Wash Gully where the wreck was found – the boat was probably attempting to land there when it came a cropper just 300 yards from the shore .
The waters around this stretch of the Devonshire coast are notoriously treacherous .
A nearby reef hints at the most obvious reason for the vessel ’s demise .
Sadly none of the ship ’s structure remains – most likely it has rotted away over the centuries .
But experts have speculated that it was probably a “ bulk carrier ” about 12 metres long by almost two metres wide , and made out of long timber planks or a wooden frame with animal hide stretched across it .
It would have been crewed by about 15 men and powered by paddle .
A narrow row boat might sound like an exposed and treacherous way of crossing the English Channel , but it ’s thought that intrepid Bronze
Age mariners would have used vessels like this to criss - cross the waterway with some frequency .
And directly between Devon and France too , rather than skirting the coast up to the narrower stretch between Dover and Calais , as some people have suggested they did .
The large quantity of copper and tin found aboard the ship – which appears to have come from scattered locations as far afield as the Iberian Peninsula , Switzerland , France or Austria via a wide and complex trade network – would have been used to make bronze , which was the key product of the period .
The bronze would in turn have been used to fashion all from tools to weapons and jewellery .
Among other artefacts in the boat ’s cargo were a bronze leaf sword , two stone objects that might have been slingshots , and three gold wrist torcs .
Four golden Iron
Age wrist torcs of European origin were found last year by a metal detectorist in Scotland – these new finds hint at how far back trade in luxury items with the continent stretches .
Academics from Oxford University have taken charge of investigating the discoveries , to see if their exact origins can be determined .
It ’s hoped that more artefacts will be raised from the seabed yet .
In the history of black aviation , it is Bessie Coleman , the first black woman to earn a pilot ’s license , who is usually remembered as the one who opened the skies to African - American aviators .
Less well known is Cornelius Coffey , who , with much the same vision and fighting the same obstructions , changed a corn patch in south Chicago into an airport that housed the nation ’s first large group of young , talented , and black aviators .
In the years just before and after World War I , some 180,000 black Southerners immigrated to Chicago , settling on the city ’s rough south side .
It was there that Coleman , a Texas transplant who wanted to fly , learned that aviation schools did n’t accept African - American applicants .
She had to sail to France to earn a pilot ’s license .
“ Queen Bess ” subsequently became the toast of the black newspaper Chicago Defender , and when she died in a fall from her airplane in 1926 , some 10,000 black Chicago mourners filed past her coffin .
Coffey never met Coleman .
The Arkansas native quietly mapped his own route to the sky .
Young Coffey possessed a great gift for mech­anical work .
He was the top graduate in a south Chicago auto engineering class in 1925 , quickly earning the allegiance of Emil Mack , the white Chevrolet dealer who employed him .
Coffey later found a spot at the dealership for a mechanic friend named John Robinson .
The two young men wanted to fly , but no one would teach them , so they taught themselves .
Later , in 1929 , they enrolled in an aviation mechanics program at Chicago ’s Curtiss - Wright School of Aviation .
When they showed up for class , they were turned away because they were black , even though they had already paid their tuition .
Mack threatened to sue on their behalf , and the school reluctantly admitted the pair .
In 1931 , the 28 - year - old Coffey finished first in his graduating class and Robinson second .
Two weeks later , Coffey took the exam to earn his mechanic ’s license from the U.S. government .
The school must have been impressed , because it changed its policy , inviting the men to return and teach all - black classes .
They did .
The aviation mechanic ’s degrees did n’t open many doors , however .
Coffey and Robinson were still unwelcome at airstrips except Akers Airport , near where they worked , so when Akers closed , they were grounded .
The men joined with several other local black aviation enthusiasts to form the Challenger Air Pilots Association ( the name referred to the Curtiss Challenger engine ) .
The new group looked for a place to fly from .
In 1931 , the group , joined by one or two white pilots from Akers , bought a half - mile - wide tract of land in Robbins , an all - black town southwest of Chicago .
There they buried boulders , dropped trees , roughly leveled the terrain , and cobbled together a hangar from second - hand lumber .
When they finished , their small fleet of disparate craft — a Church Mid-Wing , an International F - 17 , and a WACO 9 — was parked under the roof at what historians consider the first black - owned airport in the United States .
The achievement is mostly a historical footnote :
About a year later , a violent thunderstorm roared through Robbins , demolishing the hangar , flipping airplanes , and scattering hopes .
But a few miles north , at the intersection of 87th Street and Harlem Avenue in Oak Lawn , William Schumacher had purchased 140 acres of farmland with an airport in mind .
His brother Fred would manage it .
Before Robbins ’ devastating storm , Fred Schumacher visited Robbins and , probably sensing a good tenant , invited the group to come use his brother ’s airport .
After the storm , while Coffey was on a trip to Detroit , Robinson and two other Challenger members — pilot Dale Lawrence White and Curtiss - Wright school graduate Harold Hurd — approached Fred Schumacher to take him up on his offer .
The facility was taking shape .
Grass had sprouted where cornstalks had been plowed under , and a hangar and office sprang up along Harlem Avenue .
Schumacher readily agreed to rent the lower end of the airport to the Challenger group , but in an interview recorded for the Smithsonian Video History Program on black aviators , Hurd said that Schumacher initially insisted on segregation .
He was already running an all - white school .
“ Look , fellas , ” he said , “ I ’m going to put you at the end of the field to save you from having any trouble with the other guys . ”
Black and white pilots parked their airplanes in separate hangars , but they shared Harlem ’s four sod runways , the longest of which was 2,000 feet .
The rural area soon echoed with the thundering exhausts of Curtiss engines ; the sky above the corn and wheat fields of Worth Township teemed with WACOs , Travel Airs , and Taylor Cubs .
A new study into the aggressive behaviour of fruit flies has helped shed light on human aggression .
The study led by biologist David Anderso showed that Drosophila produces a pheromone - a chemical messenger - that promotes aggression , and directly linked it to specific neurons in the fly 's antenna .
Most of the genes in the fruit fly are also in humans , including neurons that produce brain chemicals associated with several psychiatric disorders .
The researchers hope that the new findings may help explain relationship between the neurotransmitter dopamine and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
During the study , researchers created an experiment modelled after the traditional " bees - at - the - picnic - table ' ' scenario using Drosophila , the common fruit fly ( or more accurately , the vinegar fly ) .
" We developed the ' puff - o - mat ' apparatus , with the idea of putting some fly food at one end , and then blowing the flies away from the food with a gentle puff of air every time they got close to it , '' Live Science quoted Anderson as saying
" Then we measured whether the flies became more agitated and approached the food more aggressively after experiencing this frustrating experience several times , '' he added .
As it turned out , they did n't even need the food .
" To our surprise , simply blowing the flies off their feet several times in a row was sufficient to get them riled up , " he added .
The research team then focussed on the agitation response and found that they produce pheromone that promotes aggression .
The study appears in journal Nature .
The British Library has no sound recordings of computer pioneer Alan Turing The British Library has begun a project to create a vast , online oral history and archive of British science .
The three - year project will see 200 British scientists interviewed and their recollections recorded for the audio library .
An advisory board will help the project pick key technological innovators and scientists for the archive .
The interviews will be put online to form a permanent record of the way British science has been practiced .
Eureka moment " We have long been painfully aware that there 's a marked absence of significant recordings of scientists , " said Dr Rob Perks , curator of oral history at the British Library .
For instance , said Dr Perks , in the current sound archives there are only two recordings of Ernest Rutherford , none of computer pioneer Alan Turing , hovercraft inventor Christopher Cockerell or AV Hill , a physiologist and Nobel laureate .
A study carried out prior to the project being started found that in the last ten years , 30 leading British scientists including 9 Nobel winners have died leaving little or no archive of their work .
The oral history project will try to stem this loss of information , said Dr Perks , and encourage working scientists to consider how to preserve their work .
The project will look into what was behind the key breakthroughs but would not solely focus on the " eureka moments " , he added .
The first interview is with Geoff Tootill who co-created the Manchester Mark I As well , subjects will be asked about their childhood , education , influences , relationships and frustrations to build up a picture of how science has been practised .
" It 's about building up the profile of 20th Century British science from the ground up , " said Dr Katrina Dean , curator of the history of science at the British Library .
The oral history project will be run by the British Library , charity National Life Stories and the science museum .
The first scientist to be interviewed is Geoff Tootill , one of the creators of the world 's first programmable computer - the Manchester Small Scale Experimental machine , first turned on in 1948 .
" This project is the largest , the most ambitious , the most exciting and arguably the most important project we have undertaken , " said Sir Nicholas Goodison , chairman of National Life Stories .
" This is going to be enormously valuable to future historians because people no longer write letters or prepare archives , " he said .
" E- mail is very difficult to archive and is mostly deleted by the people that write them . "
The archive will be arranged around four themes that look at British inventions , climate change , biomedicine and cosmology .
Cash to fund interviews for two themes has been secured and money for the rest is being sought .
Said science writer Georgina Ferry : " It 's fantastic to have the oral history but they are not enough on their own .
" What you want to do as a biographer it to put together and synthesise what you get out of the oral history with material produced at the time . "
Comparing and contrasting memories with notes and letters was necessary to build a " rounded " picture of the scientist concerned , she said .

A team of mechanical engineering students at California Polytechnic State University is prepping an ultra high - mileage , three - wheeled car for the upcoming Shell Eco-Marathon student competition .
If all goes well , they 'll take first place with fuel economy more than 13 times higher than the 230 mpg General Motors claims the Chevrolet Volt will deliver – and Cal Poly car does n't even need batteries .
The Cal Poly Supermileage Team , launched in the late ' 80s and resurrected in 2005 , combines students from a senior project team and a department club to work on vehicles that deliver numbers that make hypermilers and plug - in hybrid enthusiasts weep .
The team is working on two cars : the Black Widow ( shown above ) , which took first place in the 2007 Eco - Marathon and second place in 2008 and 2009 , and a new three - wheeler for the competition 's Urban Concept category .
" In the past , the competition has been held on closed race tracks , but this year , it is in downtown Houston , " said team president Verent Chan .
" Road conditions will be worse , which may negatively affect our fuel economy , but we still are aiming for the No. 1 spot . "
While the Urban Concept vehicle is still under construction , the team has continuously improved the Black Widow since its creation in 2005 , slowly ratcheting up fuel economy from 861 mpg to the current 2752.3 mpg .
They 've done it by shedding pounds like a Triple Crown jockey on a celery diet in a steam room .
At a mere 96 pounds , the car weighs slightly more than a Lagerfeld model , has a rock - bottom drag coefficient of 0.12 and can reach a blistering 30 mph with a modified 3 horsepower Honda 50 cc four - stroke engine .
That 's right – three horsepower .
And , Colin Chapman be praised , it can go faster .
" The car is capable of higher speeds , but the fastest we ’ve ever taken it is somewhere around 35 mph , " Chan said .
" This is because we are trying to maximize the fuel efficiency for the competition .
If we wanted to reach higher speeds , the engine has enough power .
We would just need to set up our gear ratios differently . "
The fuel and weight savings are tremendous , but Chan says we should n't expect to see cars like the Black Widow outside of competitions .
This baby , as cool as it is , is purely academic .
" By no means are we developing cutting edge technology that will be used in future vehicles , " he said .
" More than anything , our club is training engineers to push the boundaries of efficiency so when they enter the working world , it will be no different in how they approach other designs . "
This year 's Eco-Marathon runs March 26 - 28 .
We 'll be sure to root for the Black Widow .

A DECLINE in the number of male teachers is being blamed for rising youth violence .
Just 28 per cent of state schoolteachers are men , down from 32 per cent 10 years ago .
Youth crime has soared in that time .
Sex attacks , robberies , assaults and weapon offences have increased significantly , and psychologists and family groups told the Herald Sun the loss of male role models was an important factor .
Has the male teacher drought had an impact on your school ?
Have your say in the comments below .
Low pay , a perception that teaching is " women 's work ' ' , and fears of being labelled a pedophile have been blamed for the reluctance of young men to teach .
There are almost 1900 more secondary teachers than 10 years ago , but there are 350 fewer men among them .
Male teacher numbers in primary schools have remained steady , but they account for less than 25 per cent of the total .
Adolescent psychologist Michael Carr - Gregg said the lack of male teachers was a major problem .
" We know males give something different to the developing boy than what female teachers give .
To some extent we have lost that male narrative and left it to Hollywood to teach boys about masculinity , '' he said .
Assaults by 10 - 14 - year - olds almost doubled in the past decade , to 1162 in 2008 - 09 .
Assaults by 15 - 19 - year - olds jumped by more than 70 per cent to 6500 .
Property damage by 15 - 19 - year - olds jumped almost five - fold , from 1217 to 5681 .
Among 10 - 14 - year - olds the number of those offences rose by more than 60 per cent to 1962 .
In November , Education Minister Bronwyn Pike announced four schools would run anti-violence pilot programs this year .
Opposition education spokesman Martin Dixon said Victoria had the lowest education funding per person of any state , making it harder to recruit male teachers .
Ms Pike 's spokesman disputed the presence of a link between youth crime and male teacher numbers .
" Promoting respectful behaviour through our ' Respect in Schools ' program is designed to address these issues , '' he said .
Association of State Secondary School Principals president Brian Burgess blamed a lack of career opportunities and a lack of respect for the role of teachers .

Chris Taylor of Gas Powered Games , the team behind Supreme Commander and Dragon Siege , believes it 's become more difficult for developers to remain independent .
He said with the increasingly competitive market , larger indie studios rely more on publishers for marketing and investment to survive .
“ We kind of fell into a rut these past 10 to 15 years , in that even though we were independent , we were so dependent on these publishers that we were basically outsourcing studios , ” Taylor told Gamasutra .
“ That ’s not being independent . "
During a trade panel , Epic Games president Mike Capps agreed .
He said “ It ’s getting harder and harder to be independent , especially at our size .
Knowing what you know well is important .
It ’s all about picking a battle .
For us it ’s about tech and making a good game , and knowing what we do n’t do well ... somebody ’s got to put up a billboard in Hong Kong , and it ’s not going to be me . ”
Epic Games worked with Microsoft on its Gears of War franchise , and that extra cushion helped Gears become a huge commercial success .
“ We walk a very fine line because we ca n’t say bad things about anyone , but our customer walks into Best Buy or Fry ’s , and they do n’t know we ’re an independent company .
They think we ’re huge , ” Taylor said about Gas Powered Games .
“ We went three years without upgrading our hardware because we could n’t make it a priority to pay for that . ”
“ There are some really difficult financial situations in this industry , ” Capps agreed .
“ You can make a game like Shadow Complex , be a 10 - to 12 - man team for a year , get to be a best - selling game on [ XBLA ] , and then still have money be tight . ”
Programmers write a lot of code that is never used .
There are numerous reasons for this .
In Peter Seibel ’s book Coders at Work , Peter Norvig gives his take on why this happens .
Seibel :
Why is it so tempting to solve a problem we do n’t really have ?
Norvig :
You want to be clever and you want closure ; you want to complete something and move on to something else .
I think people are built to only handle a certain amount of stuff and you want to say “ This is completely done ; I can put it out of my mind and then I can move on . ”
Sometimes software developers believe there ’s a high probability that some unrequested feature will be needed in the future .
In general , they over - estimate such probabilities .
The acronym YAGNI — you are n’t gonna need it — is meant to remind developers of this tendency .
It ’s a great feeling to say “ I ’ve already done that ” when someone asks for a new feature .
Then you ’re the hero , the sage who anticipated what needed to be developed .
When you write code that ’s not needed , perhaps nobody notices , and you can comfort yourself that the time is still coming when the world will want your feature .
The times when you guessed correctly are more vivid in your mind than the times when you ’ve been wrong and so you over - estimate just how often you ’ve been right .
But sometimes it ’s worthwhile to solve a bigger problem than you have to .
It may make sense to create a more complete solution than is currently necessary while the problem is fresh on your mind ; it will be harder to pick the problem back up in the future , so if you ’re ever going to write it , now ’s the time .
Norvig rightfully points out the down - side of seeking closure .
Maybe the last 2 % is intellectually satisfying but horribly difficult and not worth the effort .
I ’ve erred on both sides .
Years ago I often erred on the side of developing functionality that was never used .
Then reading Kent Beck convinced me that YAGNI is usually true .
Since then I ’ve erred on the side of wishing I ’d done more while a project was fresh on my mind .

As a threat to our nation 's security , allowing imported drugs into our pharmacies ranks just below terrorism .
Yet this idea refuses to die .
Why is drug importation ( and its twin the reimportation of American drugs from foreign countries ) a bad idea ?
Are n't cheaper drugs good for low - income Americans ?
The Food and Drug Administration 's response — reasserted last month by FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg — is that imported and reimported drugs can't be guaranteed to be safe .
Studies have shown that a significant percentage of drugs thought to be American - made and reimported are actually counterfeit , ineffective or even toxic .
In one sting in 2003 , for example , FDA and Customs officials found that 88 % of the imported drug packages they inspected did not meet FDA safety standards .
But there is an even more important reason why importing drugs is dangerous .
Importing foreign drugs or reimporting American - made drugs is a back - door way of introducing price controls in America .
Many foreign countries , including Canada , impose price controls on drugs , which is why reimporting American - made drugs is cheaper than simply buying drugs that have n't left the country .
And allowing price controls into this country is a sure path to destroying our drug industry , which is now a prime driver in developing new and innovative pharmaceuticals .
The drug industries in countries with price controls lag behind our drug industry in developing new , important drugs .
It is unfair that Americans underwrite the cost of developing new drugs for much of the rest of the world .
But the solution to that disparity is n't to destroy our innovative drug industry .
It would be much better to find ways to make the rest of the world pays its fair share .

This question was posed in an Astronomy Cast episode a while back .
It offers an interesting thought experiment , although a reasonably definitive answer to the question can be arrived at .
Imagine a scenario where a spacecraft gains relativistic mass as it approaches the speed of light , while at the same time its volume is reduced via relativistic length contraction .
If these changes can continue towards infinite values ( which they can ) – it seems you have the perfect recipe for a black hole .
Of course , the key word here is relativistic .
Back on Earth , it can appear that a spacecraft which is approaching the speed of light , is indeed both gaining mass and shrinking in volume .
Also , light from the spacecraft will become increasingly red-shifted – potentially into almost - blackness .
This can be partly Doppler effect for a receding spacecraft , but is also partly a time dilation effect where the sub-atomic particles of the spacecraft seem to oscillate slower and hence emit light at lower frequencies .
So , back on Earth , ongoing measurements may indicate the spacecraft is becoming more massive , more dense and much darker as its velocity increases .
But of course , that ’s just back on Earth .
If we sent out two such spacecraft flying in formation – they could look across at each other and see that everything was quite normal .
The captain might call a red alert when they look back towards Earth and see that it is starting to turn into a black hole – but hopefully the future captains of our starships will have enough knowledge of relativistic physics not to be too concerned .
So , one answer to the Astronomy Cast question is that yes , a very fast spacecraft can appear to be almost indistinguishable from a black hole – from a particular frame ( or frames ) of reference .
But it ’s never really a black hole .
Special relativity allows you to calculate transformations from your proper mass ( as well as proper length , proper volume , proper density etc ) as your relative velocity changes .
So , it is certainly possible to find a point of reference from which your relativistic mass ( length , volume , density etc ) will seem to mimic the parameters of a black hole .
But a real black hole is a different story .
Its proper mass and other parameters are already those of a black hole – indeed you wo n’t be able to find a point of reference where they are n’t .
A real black hole is a real black hole – from any frame of reference .

What 's better than an artificial nose ?
Why , an artificial foot , of course !
University of Michigan researchers have developed a new prosthetic foot that could one day make it much easier for amputees to walk .
Put simply , this new prototype drastically cuts the energy spent per step , as it harnesses the energy exerted when taking a step and enhances the power of ankle push - off .
The device is able to capture dissipated energy , and an inbuilt microcontroller tells the foot to return the energy to the system at precisely the right time .
Tests have shown that those using this here foot spent just 14 percent more energy to walk than one would spend when walking naturally , which is a rather significant decrease from the 23 percent uptick experienced with conventional prostheses .
If you 're still baffled , there 's a pretty wicked video demonstration waiting for you after the break .

Personal injury legal claims affect Nebraska citizens on a daily basis .
Under our laws , you are entitled to bring a claim against a person whose negligence or wrongful conduct led to your injuries .
Every personal injury claim is unique , and the attorneys at Knowles Law Firm will be able to best handle your claim .
They will explain the applicable laws , how they apply to your specific case , and answer any questions you may have concerning your rights and the legal process .
Recovery After Personal Injury Cases Nebraska is a “ comparative negligence ” state .
Essentially , that means that even if you were partially at fault for an accident , you are still able to bring an injury claim against the other party so long as your negligence was less than 50 percent .
In those instances , your damages are then reduced by the percentage of negligence applicable to you .
Other states may have a different type of comparative negligence statute .
It is important that you consult with an experienced personal injury attorney concerning the application of Nebraska ’s comparative negligence statute to your claim .
State laws also impose time limits for filing personal injury lawsuits .
This is called the Statute of Limitations , or the deadline by which a personal injury claim must be filed after an accident occurs .
In the state of Nebraska , the Statute of Limitations for most personal injury claims is four years from the date of the injury or accident .
However , certain claims , such as wrongful death , work injury , and medical malpractice claims all have a shorter period of two years .
Be sure to consult with one of our Omaha personal injury attorneys right away to make sure that you are still eligible to file a claim

A dreaded day turned jubilant Friday , when the suffering Gunn High School community fought Westboro Baptist Church ’s brimstone with fire , muting an ugly message with song , flag - waving and raucous celebration .
United against the small cadre of Kansas - based outsiders who targeted the Palo Alto campus because of its recent suicides , Gunn altered its lesson plans this week to teach a tough lesson in tolerance — and test its commitment to the freedoms of speech , assembly and religion .
By the time the five visitors arrived on the public sidewalk across from campus , the school was ready — countering “ God Hates You ” placards with the equally powerful : “ Love Thy Neighbor As Thyself , ” “ There Is Nothing Love Cannot Face , ” “ Gay ? Fine By Me , ” and “ Gunn Stands Together ! ”
“ It ’s been a rough year here , but today was a good day , ” said Faith Hilal , who teaches world history and U.S. government .
“ The kids felt a sense of unity — they were uplifted , ” she said .
“ It is not what we were expecting .
It was inspiring . ”
Members of the Westboro Church , a traveling theater of religious extremists , gathered on Arastradero Road to flay the most unlikely victims : school children already traumatized by the five recent suicides of Gunn - associated students .
“ You ’ll be in front of the train next !
God laughs at your calamity ! ” shouted Margie Phelps , the daughter of Westboro Church founder Fred Phelps , a disbarred lawyer with a craving for publicity and a fixation on hatred of homosexuality .
Courageous reaction
Phelps and her small tribe of apocalyptic followers travel across the land they call a “ modern Sodom , ” making brief appearances at places that , in their view , have committed the ultimate transgression — acceptance of homosexuality .
To the tune of America The Beautiful , they sang : “ Oh Sodomites , your kids are killed by trains .
Your moral compasses are broken , your teachers are to blame . ”
In response to the students ’ signs , Phelps , an attorney , explained : — ‰’ Love thy neighbor ’ ” is not meant in this context . ”
The Gunn community — joined by dozens of students from Menlo Park , Fremont and other nearby schools — responded to the protesters by playing guitars , pounding drums , hugging and singing “ Let It Be . ”
“ After what we ’ve been through , it ’s wrong for them to be here , ” said Gunn student Katerina Ermolin , 14 .
“ It really helped to pull us together , ” said Souleymane Sarr , 15 , a Gunn student .
“ We ’ve got good solidarity in our school . ”
Even the school ’s giant digital sign participated .
It trumpeted quotes by German philosopher Johann von Goethe ( “ There is nothing more frightening than active ignorance ” ) ; physician William Osler ( “ The greater the ignorance , the greater the dogmatism ” ) and a Bay Area creed ( “ Celebrating diversity ” ) .
“ I ’m so proud of our young people , ” said Krishnamachar Sreenivansan , a retired Hewlett - Packard mechanical engineer with a grandchild at Gunn .
“ We have the finest students . ”
Stanford also ready
Hilal said news that the Westboro members were arriving created some anxiety among students this week .
But teachers and counselors used the unsettling occasion to stimulate vigorous discussion and debate using the real - world example to illustrate the abstractions of the U.S. Constitution .
In her classes , Hilal taught students : “ The same freedom that allows us to express ourselves , allows the people who disagree with us to express their points .
It ’s there for all of us . ”
And she added : “ But the courts have confined that freedom , so that once someone steps on campus , there are limits to what they can say .
That ’s why you ’re safe — and they ’re across the street , on public property . ”
School administrators distributed “ Talking Points ” to create a united message of reassurance .
They postponed the school ’s start time Friday morning so students could avoid the protesters .
They held a rally at lunchtime .
Police were called .
And they instructed students to stay on campus .
The Topeka - based group then traveled to Stanford University ’s Taube Hillel House , where they were greeted by the dancing Stanford Tree mascot , the Stanford Band , several hundred students and a bagpipe player performing a haunting rendition of “ Amazing Grace . ”
It was only 8 a.m. , an hour when most college students are still asleep .
But word had spread across campus through e-mails from student groups and conversation , and a bold crowd awaited the far - outnumbered church members .
Some students posed for pictures with the visitors , holding signs like one that read “ Gay for Fred Phelps . ”
“ I just wanted to come out and show them that being a Christian is n’t about hate , it ’s about love , ” said Monica Alcazar , a Stanford freshman and Gunn graduate .

Smart coating opens door to safer hip , knee and dental implants
( Nanowerk News ) Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed a " smart coating " that helps surgical implants bond more closely with bone and ward off infection .
When patients have hip , knee or dental replacement surgery , they run the risk of having their bodies reject the implant .
But the smart coating developed at NC State mitigates that risk by fostering bone growth into the implant .
The coating creates a crystalline layer next to the implant , and a mostly amorphous outer layer that touches the surrounding bone .
The amorphous layer dissolves over time , releasing calcium and phosphate , which encourages bone growth .
Cross-sectional transmission electron microscope image of the functionally graded smart coating with nano - silver particles distributed throughout the entire thickness of the coating .
The crystalline nano - grains can be seen near the interface with the titanium implant and mostly amorphous layer on the top portion of the coating .
( Image : Dr. Afsaneh Rabiei , North Carolina State University )
" The bone grows into the coating as the amorphous layer dissolves , resulting in improved bonding , or osseointegration , " says Dr. Afsaneh Rabiei , an NC State associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering , associate faculty member of biomedical engineering and co-author of a paper describing the research .
This bonding also makes the implant more functional , because the bonding helps ensure that the bone and the implant do a better job of sharing the load .
" We call it a smart coating because we can tailor the rate at which the amorphous layer dissolves to match the bone growth rate of each patient , " Rabiei says .
This is important because people have very different rates of bone growth .
For example , young people 's bones tend to grow far faster than the bones of older adults .
The researchers have also incorporated silver nanoparticles throughout the coating to ward off infections .
Currently , implant patients are subjected to an intense regimen of antibiotics to prevent infection immediately following surgery .
However , the site of the implant will always remain vulnerable to infection .
But by incorporating silver into the coating , the silver particles will act as antimicrobial agents as the amorphous layer dissolves , Rabiei says .
This will not only limit the amount of antibiotics patients will need following surgery , but will provide protection from infection at the implant site for the life of the implant .
Moreover , the silver is released more quickly right after surgery , when there is more risk of infection , due to the faster dissolution of the amorphous layer of the coating .
Silver release will slow down while the patient is healing .
" That is another reason why we call it smart coating , " Rabiei says .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation , and was accomplished with assistance from the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences and Shared Research Equipment User Facilities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory .
Since crash bugs are a top priority within Adobe , there is one relatively simple step Adobe should take which would make it much easier for everyone else to help Adobe track and diagnose crashes : implement a symbol server .
A symbol server is a public web server from which developers can fetch debugging information ( PDB files ) for released binaries .
The Microsoft debuggers have excellent support for automatically pulling down symbols as they are needed in the debugger .
Mozilla runs a symbol server for Firefox nightlies and releases , which is invaluable for people debugging and profiling Firefox without having to do a custom build .
Microsoft runs a symbol server which contains debug information for Windows and many other Microsoft products , including the Silverlight plugin .
Debug information is not simply a way to get symbolic information from Flash .
It is necessary in order to get any useful stack trace of the Mozilla code which is calling Flash .
A common compiler optimization called frame pointer omission ( FPO ) avoids storing the frame pointer in the x86 EBP register , freeing that register up for general use .
In order to walk the stack of this optimized code , the debugger has to query the frame size and frame pointer information from the PDB file .
When debug information is not available , stack walking does n’t produce usable results .
As an example , take the current # 3 topcrash for nightly builds of Firefox ( mozilla - central ) .
The signature for this crash is NPSWF32.dll@0x1e7fe4 .
The stack traces from Mozilla ’s crash reporting system are completely opaque :
Frame Signature 0 NPSWF32.dll@0x1e7fe4 1 NPSWF32.dll@0x1ff471 2 NPSWF32.dll@0x2005bd 3 NPSWF32.dll@0x1fb195 4 NPSWF32.dll@0x1e02d1 5 NPSWF32.dll@0x17c22a 6 NPSWF32.dll@0x2959d 7 NPSWF32.dll@0x30386 8 @0x63aa15f 9 NPSWF32.dll@0x5bdef
Even worse , the crash signature depends on the particular version of Flash that is installed on the user ’s computer .
We ca n’t tell if a particular crash signature is fixed by a new revision of flash because without symbols we can’t correlate crashes between different versions .
As part of developing multi-process plugins for Firefox , we are constantly dealing with unexpected plugin behaviors .
Whenever we encounter a problem which can be reproduced in both Silverlight and Flash , we ’ll always test with silverlight , simply because Microsoft makes Silverlight symbols available through their symbol server and therefore we can actually step through their code and ours in a debugger .
Adobe should set up a symbol server for their three main plugins , Flash , Shockwave , and Acrobat .
By implementing this simple tool , Adobe could help all browser vendors and interested hackers to help identify and fix bugs .
If Adobe is concerned about using full debug information to reverse - engineer details of their code , there is a way to strip the PDB files so that only frame - pointer information and function names .
Cindy McCain Joins NOH8 Silent Protest PHOTO Project
The NOH8 gay rights campaign has picked up another high profile Republican supporter .
Cindy McCain has agreed to lend her face to the silent protest photo project against California Proposition 8 .
The group has worked with Meghan McCain in the past .
To say that they were pleasantly shocked when her mother offered to be photographed for the campaign is an understatement .
NOH8 founder Adam Bouska said , " In the year since we 've started the NOH8 campaign , we 've often been surprised at some of the different individuals who have approached us showing their support .
Few , though , have surprised us more than Cindy McCain . "
The wife of John McCain wanted to send the message that marriage equality is n't a Republican issue any more than it is a Democratic issue .
It 's about human rights and everybody being treated equally .
Arizona Senator John McCain has not , however , changed his position on the subject .
His spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan reports that his " opposition to gay marriage remains the same . "
She added , " Senator McCain believes that the sanctity of marriage is defined as between one man and one woman . "

The Obama administration on Wednesday sought to bolster support for its plan to overhaul student lending , attacking banks that oppose it for enjoying “ a free ride from taxpayers for too long . ”
In a telephone conference with reporters , Secretary of Education Arne Duncan repeated the administration ’s assertion that the direct offering of student loans by the federal government , and an end to subsidies to private lenders , would save taxpayers $ 87 billion over 10 years .
The savings would be used to aid early - childhood education , community colleges and needy college students .
The administration plan passed the House of Representatives last year but has stalled in the Senate .
Mr. Duncan said he remained confident that the Senate would pass the measure , which President Obama has called a “ no - brainer . ”
But the banks that have offered the most loans , with federal subsidies and guarantees , have hired lobbyists and mounted advertising campaigns , saying the plan would cost jobs and reduce consumer choice .
Congressional aides say passage is in peril .
In Britain 's Independent , Howard Jacobson makes a very good point about how a little fun could defuse a lot of the terrorist threat .
Terrorist groups , he writes , look for " partially educated , preferably pampered , but certainly crestfallen young men for whom the usual safety valves of dissoluteness have for some reason failed to open . "
He goes on ,
We should remember this when we rail against the morals of the young .
Next time we are honked at by a stretch - limoload of vomiting adolescents we should give a little prayer of thanks .
As long as they 're out on the town pissed they 're not in their rooms drawing up plans to blow up aeroplanes .
Ditto sex .
Here 's hoping they 're getting as much of that as they can handle , too .
It 's not a 100 per cent proof , but , in the main , intercourse is a great solvent of ideology .
Whatever you think of the pure in mind , beware , reader , the pure in body .
Sounds like he 's joking , but there 's plenty of evidence to support his point .
Any will confirm that the great bulk of crime in America is committed by unmarried young men .
The best way to turn a criminal away from crime is for him to get hitched to a woman and become a father ( though there 's surely a strong cause / effect conflation in that one ) .
The underwear bomber appears to have been just another , horny , frustrated young man feeling bitter and disconnected -- the perfect victim for an ideology that promises to make him a hero with all the admiring female he could want .
If young men are designed by evolution to be obsessed with sex , like dogs in heat , you 've got to wonder what kinds of destructive energies are created and compounded by ideologies telling them these feelings are shameful -- feelings common to both Islamic and Christian fundamentalism .
If our distorted relationship with human is the source of much of this frustration , confusion , and ignorance , societies with less conflicted views should confirm the causal connection .
Developmental neuropsychologist James Prescott found that bodily pleasure and violence seem to have an either / or relationship — the presence of one inhibits development of the other .
In 1975 , Prescott published a paper in which he argued that “ certain sensory experiences during the formative periods of development will create a neuropsychological predisposition for either violence - seeking or pleasure - seeking behaviors later in life . ”
On the level of individual development , this finding seems obvious : adults who abuse children were almost always victims of abuse themselves , and every junkyard owner knows that if you want a mean dog , beat the puppy .
Prescott applied this logic on a cross-cultural level .
He performed a meta- analysis of previously gathered data on the amount of physical affection shown to infants ( years of breastfeeding , percentage of time in direct physical contact with mother , being fondled and played with by other adults ) and overall tolerance for adolescent sexual behavior .
After comparing these data with levels of violence within and between societies , Prescott concluded that in all but one of the cultures for which these data were available ( forty - eight of forty - nine ) , “ deprivation of body pleasure throughout life — but particularly during the formative periods of infancy , childhood , and — is very closely related to the amount of warfare and interpersonal violence . ”
Cultures that do n’t interfere in the physical between mother and child or prohibit the expression of adolescent sexuality show far lower levels of violence — both between individuals and between societies .
A world full of angry , frustrated , isolated young men with nothing and no one to live for is a very dangerous place .
CPI ( M ) West Bengal leader Jyoti Basu .
By Dipankar Bhattacharya
February 2010 -- Jyoti Basu , arguably the most familiar face of the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) -- CPI ( M ) -- in India and the last surviving member of the party ’s founding polit bureau , passed away in Kolkata on January 17 .
In the course of his marathon political journey spanning nearly seven decades , he served for an unprecedented 23 consecutive years as the chief minister of the Indian state of West Bengal .
Basu is also famously remembered as the only left leader who had been offered the prime ministership of the country , in 1996 , an offer that was declined by his party even as Basu openly differed with the CPI ( M ) , calling its decision an " historic blunder " .
Basu stepped down from power in November 2000 when his health started failing , a graceful act which never really received the popular recognition it deserved .
Yet , even as he relinquished his official responsibility as chief minister , he did not " retired " from his role as a leader of his party .
“ Communists never retire ” , was his famous statement and he really lived it .
Beginning as a trade union organiser in the early 1940s , he was elected to the central committee of the undivided Communist Party of India ( CPI ) in 1951 .
[ The CPI ( M ) was formed after a split in the pro-Moscow CPI in 1964 . ]
From 1953 to 1961 , he was secretary of the West Bengal provincial unit of the CPI and remained a polit bureau member of the CPI ( M ) 2008 .
In 2008 , he stepped down from the polit bureau , but the CPI ( M ) central committee chose to retain him as a permanent invitee to the polit bureau .
Even though Basu never became the general secretary of the CPI ( M ) , along with EMS Namboodiripad and HKS Surjeet , he left a defining imprint on the political evolution of the CPI ( M ) until perhaps the decisive hour of 1996 , when the party differed from and prevailed over his political judgement ( it was another matter that four years later , the CPI ( M ) " updated " its party program to include the possibility of participating in a bourgeois government at the centre ) .
Centrist paradigm
In their own ways EMS , Surjeet and Jyoti Basu personified three key strands in the centrist paradigm of the CPI ( M ) - – EMS as the party ’s principal ideologue , Basu as the party ’s chief parliamentary administrator and Surjeet as the party ’s ultimate negotiator in bourgeois politics .
Jyoti Basu belonged to the generation of early Indian communists who got their first lessons in communist politics under the tutelage of the Communist Party of Great Britain .
Returning to the country after finishing his study of law in London , he soon became a close confidant of the underground core of the CPI leadership in Bengal .
In 1944 , he became the founding secretary of the Bengal Assam Railroad Workers ’ Union and it was from the railway workers ’ constituency that he won his first election to enter the pre-independence Bengal Provincial Assembly in 1946 .
All through the 1950s and until 1967 , Basu remained the leader of the opposition in West Bengal Assembly .
In 1967 and 1969 , he became deputy chief minister in two short - lived UF governments .
In 1972 , the Congress party regained power in West Bengal through a widely rigged election .
That was the only occasion when Basu lost , and the CPI ( M ) boycotted the assembly until 1977 when the party surprisingly won a clear and emphatic majority and went on to form government together with its Left Front allies ( the CPI was still in alliance with the Congress and not part of the Left Front ) under Basu 's stewardship .
Most of the early leaders who had entered the communist movement in India through the CPGB route had inherited the notions that prevailed among communists in Britain and Western Europe .
They had little knowledge of , or interest in , the onward revolutionary march of the Chinese communists , and in any case they did not see the relevance of the Chinese experience in the Indian context .
Even when peasant uprisings like Tebhaga and Telanagana clearly indicated the revolutionary potential of a profound rural awakening , and the situation was pregnant with possibilities of a radical popular advance , this leadership failed to recognise or grab this opportunity and subjected the entire movement to the constitutionalist orientation and parliamentary perspective they had absorbed from their CPGB schooling .
All through his marathon political innings , Basu remained a typical representative of this breed , the only aberration being his decision to side with the CPI ( M ) at the time of the split in 1964 , even as almost all his comrades from his London days remained with the CPI .
Pragmatic
As subsequent years proved time and again , for him , this decision to part ways with the CPI was more a practical political move and in no way did it mean any rethinking of , let alone rupture with , the reformist parliamentary perspective of the CPI .
The growing popular support for communists in opposition to the ruling Congress party in West Bengal must have convinced Basu , the pragmatic political leader of the masses , of the possibility of the left successfully challenging the Congress party hegemony in state politics .
His assessment proved right as the CPI suffered its maximum marginalisation in West Bengal , overtaken not only by the CPI ( M ) but also by parties like the Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party ( RSP ) .
It was only by returning to the CPI ( M ) - led fold after 1977 that the CPI could subsequently save itself from becoming totally extinct .
But the same Basu remained a most vocal proponent of strategic partnership with the capitalist Congress party in national politics , hoping that this would reinforce the CPI ( M ) 's electoral edge over Congress in West Bengal .
Asked about the possibility of a Congress - led coalition coming to power at the centre , in the midst of the May 2004 election campaign , Basu 's candid and precise answer to a TV interviewer was : “ That ’s what we are hoping for , that 's what we are working for .
” ( Walk the Talk , Shekhar Gupta in conversation with Jyoti Basu , NDTV 24X7 ) .
In their condolence messages , Congress party leaders have rightly recalled Basu as a key architect of the Congress - led United Progressive Alliance coalition which now rule India 's central government .
When the CPI ( M ) eventually withdrew support from the UPA in the wake of the Indo - US nuclear deal , Jyoti Basu had made it abundantly clear that he did not approve of this course .
Independent Lok Sabha MP
Somnath Chatterjee has now gone on record saying Basu had advised him not to tender his resignation from the post of the speaker .
Another Basu protégé , Subhas Chakravarty , has ridiculed the very idea of countering the Congress on an anti-imperialist plank , arguing that anti-imperialist unity in India was unthinkable without the Congress party .
Incidentally , like the Basu interview in May 2004 , this interview , which turned out to be Chakravarty ’s last TV interview before his rather premature death a few weeks later , was also televised in the middle of the May 2009 [ national ]
Lok Sabha elections .
Wishful thinking
Most Basu admirers tend to attribute the current slide of the CPI ( M ) in West Bengal , as well as in national politics , to the party 's " growing deviation " from the Basu legacy .
Many of them believe that the rot started with the party preventing Basu from accepting the offer to be prime ministers .
Basu himself also believed that had he become the prime minister of a Congress - supported United Front ( UF ) government in 1996 , history would have taken a different course .
Basu admirers believe that with his record of leading a coalition government for decades , he would have given a stable coalition at the centre too , thus preventing the [ right - wing Hindu- chauvinist ] Bharatiya Janata Party from usurping power in 1998 .
And some even argue that under Basu 's leadership the united front government could also have moderated the neoliberal economic agenda with an aam aadmi ( " common man " ) flavour , thereby denying the Congress party the chance to invent the UPA and recover its lost ground with the help of its renewed pro-poor rhetoric .
These wishful thinkers forget that however quirky history may prove at times , the balance of class forces does not take long to reassert .
Jyoti Basu leading a relatively cohesive Left Front government in West Bengal under the absolute domination of the CPI ( M ) and Jyoti Basu heading a disparate coalition at the centre with the backing of the Congress party would have been two utterly different propositions .
Instead of announcing the arrival of the CPI ( M ) as a leading player on the national political stage , such a government was more likely to have put the party in an awkward predicament even in its established strongholds and perhaps hastened its slide that was triggered a decade later .
Record in West Bengal
Instead of speculating about what might have happened in national politics , it is perhaps more in order to focus on what has actually been happening in Basu 's own West Bengal .
Is the CPI ( M ) in West Bengal today paying the price for moving away from Basu 's legacy ?
In West Bengal , the CPI ( M ) never really deviated from the course charted by Basu and whatever is happening today in the state must be seen in the logical context of Basu 's legacy , which always privileged the stability of power over popular struggles for social change .
In the late 1970s , Basu may well have begun with Operation Barga [ land reform program ] and Panchayati Raj [ creation of locally elected panchayats ( councils ) ] , but when the choice came to move on to the next step of giving ownership to sharecroppers and introducing collective / cooperative farming , Basu simply allowed the momentum to peter out and by the end of the 1980s the reversal of land reforms had begun in West Bengal .
Likewise , the issue of federal restructuring of the Indian polity through a bigger devolution of power and resources to the states , a pet theme of the CPI ( M ) articulated consistently by Basu in the early 1980s , was also abandoned midway .
The backlash of " national unity " that gave the Congress party its highest ever majority following the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi might have politically pushed Basu temporarily on the back foot , but perhaps what really drove him away from his one - time favourite mission of federal restructuring was the 1991 paradigm shift in economic policies engineered by the governments of prime ministers Narsimha Rao and Manmohan Singh .
With the licensing era coming to an end , Basu argued that it no longer made sense to fight with the central government over more economic powers ; what now had to be done was to woo private capital to come and invest in West Bengal .
For Basu too , it was time for the state to retreat in matters economic and industrial , leaving the initiative primarily with big private capital , Indian as well as foreign .
Within three years of the centre announcing the new economic policies , the Left Front under Basu adopted its own version of new industrial policy .
Basu 's new discourse stressed " industrial peace " and discouraged " militant trade unionism " –- yet Bengal did not see any rise in investment , all it saw was deepening of the problem of industrial sickness , massive looting of employees ’ provident fund and rampant violation of wage legislation .
Buddhadeb has only sought to render this discourse more profound - – while Basu took three years to adapt to the new policy paradigm of the centre , Buddhadeb did better by anticipating the Special Economic Zone
Act two years before parliament passed it !
Basu and state repression
It was this new - found obsession with state - sponsored corporate - led " industrialisation " that led to [ the eviction of peasants from their land and subsequent resistance ] at Singur and Nandigram .
When Singur happened , Basu never questioned the state government ’s decision to acquire the land , he only asked why the CPI ( M ) - led Kisan Sabha had not been pressed into service to prepare the ground for the government and the conglomerate Tata Group to move in .
There was also no intervention on the part of Basu in response to the huge public outcry against the serial massacres in Nandigram -– if he at all intervened it was primarily to silence the debates within the Left Front .
Perhaps one could not expect any different response from Basu , whose own tenure had been marked by a series of police shootings and major massacres even though they never created the kind of impact that Singur , Nandigram or Lalgarh did in a changed situation , thanks , in no small measure to the new media environment of 24 - hour TV coverage .
It is important to remember that , in May 1967 , when the historic Naxalbari peasant uprising broke out in Darjeeling district of north Bengal , Basu was the home minister in the state cabinet and he promptly responded with a one - track repressive policy , rushing paramilitary forces to crush the revolt .
Along with Pramod Dasgupta , then secretary of the CPI ( M ) ’s West Bengal unit , Basu was instrumental in unleashing unmitigated state repression on communist revolutionaries .
The UF government was however soon to be replaced by the infamous Congress regime of Siddharth Shankar Ray , which went on to subject large sections of the left , sections of the CPI ( M ) included , to a brutal reign of semi- fascist terror .
If in 1977 , the CPI ( M ) - led Left Front won a clear majority in spite of its still relatively limited organisational strength and political reach , a major reason was West Bengal 's ardent desire to put an emphatic end to Ray 's repressive reign and a quest for justice and democracy .
But apart from promising non-intervention of the police in democratic struggles , a promise which was soon to be violated , Basu never bothered to bring the perpetrators of massacres and countless cases of custodial killing , torture and rape to justice , instead granting them impunity and even rewards !
Two years into power , Basu 's government bared its fangs against the hapless refugees who were trying to settle down at Morichjhanpi , one of the northern - most forested islands of the Sundarbans .
Some 4000 families reportedly perished in the forcible evacuation drive unleashed by the government , succumbing to starvation and exhaustion , as well as indiscriminate killing and rape .
History will always remember Morichjhanpi as one of the cruelest instances of state - sponsored crime against humanity , even though it never had the kind of impact that Nandigram generated three decades later .
Towards the end of the 1990s , Jyoti Basu ’s popular rating had started declining quite rapidly .
His victory margin in the 1996 state assembly elections had already dropped considerably .
If at one stage the CPI ( M ) had benefited from Basus 's charismatic leadership , ironically in November 2000 it was his act of stepping down which really saved the CPI ( M ) in the 2001 elections .
This masterstroke left the state opposition rather clueless for quite some time , robbing it of the very target that it had grown up against .
But behind the CPI ( M ) 's impressive electoral showing -– in May 2004 it led a 60 - plus contingent of left MPs in the national Lok Sabha and in May 2006 it returned to power for the seventh successive term with an 80 % majority –- the policy crisis of the CPI ( M ) and the Left Front government had been growing all along and it eventually exploded at Singur and Nandigram .
From his secluded residence at Indira Bhawan -– it is ironic that Jyoti Basu lived in this Urban Development Department bungalow in Salt Lake that Indira Gandhi had inaugurated and used for her stay during the 1972 AICC session in Kolkata , and the department now proposes to turn it into Basu Museum – Basu could do little but to silently witness the growing collapse of the government he had built and led for years and decades .
In a desperate last - ditch attempt to arrest the alarming electoral downslide , Basu finally appealed to Congress party voters in the state to vote for the CPI ( M ) for the sake of " peace and stability " in the state , just as the CPI ( M ) had supported the Congress party at every hour of national crisis .
But the electoral tide in the state had already turned inexorably against the CPI ( M ) and predictably enough , Basu 's appeal fell on deaf ears .
The CPI ( M ) failed to win any of the 10 seats for which by - elections were held in August 2009 .
Time had already overtaken the political trajectory of Jyoti Basu .
Yet , for a long time to come Basu will surely be remembered by history as the chief architect of the most enduring social - democratic rule in a Third World parliamentary set -up .

Harry Potter star Emma Watson has come up with a wizard idea to alleviate poverty - by creating her own ethical clothing and jewellery range .
The actress , 19 - Hermione Granger in the movies - already has modelling contracts with Burberry and Chanel .
Now she has designed a new teenage line for fair - trade brand People Tree .
Emma , who describes her clothes as " all very strawberries and cream and tennis " , says : " It 's a great way to empower people .
" Rather than just giving to charity you can help by buying the clothes they make and supporting things they take pride in .
" Fair - trade fashion costs a bit more but allows those who make it to earn a decent living , take care of their families and live with dignity . "
Emma 's caring collection , made in Bangladesh , India and Nepal , is due to hit the shops later this month .
Slime design mimics
Tokyo's rail system

What could human engineers possibly learn from the lowly slime mold ?
Reliable , cost - efficient network construction , apparently : a recent experiment suggests that Physarum polycephalum , a gelatinous fungus - like mold , might actually lead the way to improved technological systems , such as more robust computer and mobile communication networks .
This revelation comes after a team of Japanese and British researchers observed that the slime mold connected itself to scattered food sources in a design that was nearly identical to Tokyo's rail system .
The related report will be published by the journal Science on Friday , 22 January .
Science is the journal of AAAS , the nonprofit science society .
Atsushi Tero from Hokkaido University in Japan , along with colleagues elsewhere in Japan and the United Kingdom , placed oat flakes on a wet surface in locations that corresponded to the cities surrounding Tokyo , and allowed the Physarum polycephalum mold to grow outwards from the center .
They watched the slime mold self - organize , spread out , and form a network that was comparable in efficiency , reliability , and cost to the real - world infrastructure of Tokyo 's train network .
" Some organisms grow in the form of an interconnected network as part of their normal foraging strategy to discover and exploit new resources , " Tero writes in the report .
" Physarum is a large , single - celled amoeboid organism that forages for patchily distributed food sources ... [ It ] can find the shortest path through a maze or connect different arrays of food sources in an efficient manner with low total length yet short average minimum distance between pairs of food sources , with a high degree of fault tolerance to accidental disconnection . "
The researchers knew that capturing the essence of this biological system in simple rules could be useful to inform the construction of self - organizing and cost - efficient networks in the real world .
They captured the core mechanisms needed by the slime mold to connect its food sources in an efficient manner and incorporated them into a mathematical model .
Since the slime mold has been subjected to countless rounds of evolutionary selection , this formula based on its feeding habits might provide a route to more efficient and adaptive network designs for transportation and communication .
In a related Perspective , Wolfgang Marwan of Otto von Guericke University in Germany writes , " The model captures the basic dynamics of network adaptability through interaction of local rules , and produces networks with properties comparable to or better than those of real - world infrastructure networks ...
The work of Tero and colleagues provides a fascinating and convincing example that biologically inspired pure mathematical models can lead to completely new , highly efficient algorithms able to provide technical systems with essential features of living systems , for applications in such areas as computer science . "
Tero and the other researchers say that their model provides a starting point for improving efficiency and decreasing costs for self - organized networks without centralized control , like remote sensor arrays , mobile ad hoc networks , and wireless mesh networks .
The slime mold just did what came naturally .
The settlement of the landmark Wiwa v Shell lawsuit in June 2009 marked a small but significant step forward for the dozen plaintiffs involved .
They charged Shell with complicity in human rights abuses , including crimes against humanity , summary execution , torture and arbitrary detention .
The abuses occurred during military crackdowns in the 1990s , when 300,000 of the minority Ogoni people mobilised under the leadership of writer and activist Ken Saro - Wiwa , to protest at the environmental and social devastation caused by Shell , Chevron and other companies in the oil rich Niger Delta .
These were some of the largest protests against an oil company ever seen .
In response , Shell collaborated with the Nigerian military in a campaign of indiscriminate violence in Ogoniland , culminating in the execution of Saro - Wiwa and eight other activists on 10 November 1995 .
For the next twelve years , a legal battle was waged in the New York District Court .
The plaintiff ’s lawyers assembled a substantial dossier of exhibits , including confidential company memos , emails and witness testimony , illuminating the Shell ’s complicit role in human rights abuses committed in Ogoniland .
Detailed evidence of Shell ’s close relationship with the military was finally made public in the wake of the settlement , in which Shell agreed to pay US $ 15.5 million to the plaintiffs .
Behind the scenes was Osamede Okhomina , an oil executive who does not fit the stereotype .
He is from the Niger Delta and holds a Masters in Philosophy from Cambridge University .
His company , Energy Equity Resources based in London ’s leafy Marble Arch and Victoria Island , Lagos , participated in brokering the settlement of the Wiwa case .
EER helped both parties to fashion the Kiisi Trust , a US $ 5 million fund created by the settlement funds , which ‘ will allow for initiatives in Ogoni for educational endowments , skills development , agricultural development , women ’s programs , small enterprise support , and adult literacy ’ .
A short statement from EER released on the day of the settlement reads :
‘ Mr Okhomina emphasized … the importance EER places on the creation of trust funds in allowing local communities to directly share in the benefits of oil production … EER believes this approach offers a brighter future for all concerned and it hopes its contribution to the resolution of this case will be seen in this light . ’
It probably came as some relief that EER ’s contribution quickly disappeared in the media storm that engulfed Shell .
Yet the stance of EER , a much smaller oil and gas exploration company , is worth considering .
The use of ‘ trust funds ’ in the Niger Delta is a newly emerging response to what the UNDP calls the ‘ appalling ’ development situation , which although limited in scale may hold more potential than the scores of abandoned community development projects started by Shell and other oil companies .
For over a decade , companies have used ‘ strategic philanthropy ’ to effectively buy the consent of communities where they extract oil and gas .
Following the execution of Saro - Wiwa , and the sinking of Brent Spar , Shell realised the need to repair its global image , which led to the invention of ‘ corporate social responsibility ’ ( CSR ) .
Today , the failure of CSR in the Niger Delta is an open secret .
In 2001 , a study of Shell ’s community projects showed that out of 81 , 20 did n’t exist , 36 were partly successful and only 25 were working effectively .
Despite this , Alice Ajeh , Shell ’s international relations manager for Nigeria , based in The Hague , believes that CSR has the answer .
When faced with a flood of emails protesting at Shell Nigeria ’s practices , she emphasises that Shell spent US $ 242 million last year on community development – ‘ the largest single investment in communities that Shell companies make anywhere in the world . ’
During her time at Shell in Port Harcourt , a leaked confidential report for Shell by WAC Global Services found that these payments were ‘ divisive ’ , increasing conflict and violence , rather than benefiting communities .
Assuming that a portion of Shell ’s community development projects actually exist and work , they cannot compensate for the illegal environmental and social devastation caused by the company ’s routine oil spills , gas flaring and their over - reliance on the Nigerian security forces .
Whilst not all of the regions problems can be attributed to the company , Shell ’s activities clearly exacerbate insecurity , corruption and poverty .
Government security forces are routinely on the payroll of international oil companies , and the same forces are responsible for an unknown number of summary executions , killings , torture and detainment .
According to local rights monitor the Centre for Environment , Human Rights and Development ( CEHRD ) , as recently as December 2009 , armed soldiers securing a Shell manifold in K - Dere in Ogoni tortured a man and his wife , beating them severely with gun butts and horsewhips till they vomited blood .
These incidents are routinely carried out by security forces paid , fed and housed by Shell .
The Niger Delta is by no means a ‘ poor ’ economy .
Staggering profits are pumped out of the creeks by Shell , Chevron and other companies on a daily basis .
The IMF estimates that Nigeria earned US $ 75 billion in oil revenue between 2004 - 7 .
Yet the Delta region is impoverished by decades of record - breaking graft at all levels of the Nigerian political elite , an ongoing theft that is assisted by multinational oil companies and Western banks .
This week , the Metropolitan Police are charging the associates of former governor of Rivers State James Ibori with helping him launder US $ 30 million between 2005 - 7 .
Among his frozen assets are funds from a lucrative deal by Ibori ’s company , MEX engineering , to supply houseboats to Shell and Chevron .
Scotland Yard suspects corruption in the deal , but the companies deny any wrongdoing .
Despite political opposition and an attempt by Conservative MP Tony Baldry to obstruct the prosecution in the UK , the trial is due to take place at Southwark Crown Court in London and could disclose damaging facts about the deal .
With oil companies and all echelons of the Nigerian government largely believed to be mired in corruption , there is a need for more transparent , independent mechanisms to control and trace oil revenues .
Trust funds like the Kiisi Trust could provide a pragmatic , temporary means of ensuring that village communities benefit from their resources .
What trusts cannot address is the central injustice of the Wiwa case – the human rights impacts of oil companies .
Oil production is still intimately linked to gross violations of human rights .
As Saro - Wiwa stated to the panel that sentenced him to death : ‘ The military do not act alone .
They are supported by a gaggle of politicians , lawyers , judges , academics , and businessmen , all of them hiding … ’
The Wiwa case demonstrated the ‘ power of memory against forgetting ’.
As long as companies continue do business at the expense of human rights , they will eventually be exposed , held accountable and forced to make amends .

Whatever else Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is – privileged young Nigerian , pious introvert and all the other details in those journey - to - jihad profiles – he is also a graduate in mechanical engineering from University College London .
That slots the Detroit plane bomber into a gruesome tradition : Islamist terrorists who trained as engineers .
There are plenty more .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Mohamed Atta , 9/11 mastermind and ringleader respectively : both engineers .
Imam Samudra , plotter of the Bali nightclub bombings : an engineer .
Kafeel Ahmed , who tried to bomb Glasgow Airport in 2007 : an MPhil in aeronautical engineering from Belfast .
That link is more than coincidental .
Analysing data on 284 jihadis from across the Muslim world , Diego Gambetta and Steffen Hertog found that 69 % had been to university – which , if borne out generally , suggests al - Qaida is better educated than the British workforce .
And 44 % went into engineering , with Islamic studies a distant second at 19 % .
Put another way , engineers in Muslim countries were between three and four times more likely to become violent extremists than other graduates .
Why ?
It 's not just a case of being handy with explosives – sadly , terrorist bombs are relatively easy to make .
And it is n't simply because engineering is a very popular degree in developing countries – nearly 60 % of graduate Islamic radicals in the west are also engineers .
The link has something to do with economics .
A good student in Cairo , say , might expect to go on to a well - paid job – yet graduate employment across the Middle East is hard to find .
Frustrated ambition is often a catalyst for radicalisation – just ask Jean - Paul Marat .
But that would n't explain why leftwing extremists tend to be trained lawyers instead .
Gambetta and Hertog point to a huge US survey in which nearly half of engineering students described themselves as both rightwing and religious – a higher proportion than any other faculty .
Being a God-fearing conservative means something different in Kansas than Karachi , of course , but even so , it 's a striking finding .
And in a week when politicians are raising the old spectre of ethnic profiling , a little questioning must be a good thing .
My colleagues just put together a neat slideshow of all the cool things you can do with Gmail if you 're inclined to check out a little tab called " Labs " .
There are things like :
Forgotten attachment detector , and
Did you get the wrong " Bob " ? , and
YouTube previews in emails
And that 's cool .
I guess .
If I ever want to watch a YouTube preview in email or feel the need to install a " forgotten attachment detector " -- and I figure out that " Labs " is code for " settings " -- maybe I 'll experiment with it .
But between now and then I am going to continue to curse Google every minute of every day that they force me to view my email as a series of " Conversations . "
As I 've explained before , I understand that some people like the " Conversations " format .
I 'm happy for them .
I , personally , ca n't stand " Conversations . "
For me , they are confusing , cause me to miss important emails , and never work properly .
For me , moreover , " Conversations " symbolizes everything that is wrong with Google .
It symbolizes why the company has a much smaller chance than it should of dethroning Microsoft in the enterprise .
It symbolizes why Apple will always have a big leg up when it comes to winning consumers ' hearts and minds .
Why does " Conversations " symbolize all this for me ?
Because it would be so simple for Google to create a " Normal email view " for people like me .
But Google refuses to do it .
Google would rather let its engineers fiddle around with " Labs " and " YouTube previews " and " forgotten attachment detectors " than do something so mundane and boring as let me view my email the normal way .
Google has concluded that the " Conversations " format is better .
So Google will be damned if they 're going to build inferior old - way features for the likes of me .
In the mid-1990s , when Bob Pittman arrived at AOL , most people had written AOL off for dead .
AOL was " the Internet on training wheels , " everyone said .
AOL did n't get that the Internet was about " technology . "
And , yes , five years later , AOL crashed and burned , having failed to make the jump to broadband .
But before that its market capitalization increased nearly 100 - fold , from about $ 2 billion to over $ 200 billion , and its subscriber base soared from 3 million to 20 + million .
Why did AOL kill everyone in the 1990s ?
Because Bob Pittman understood what Google does not :
When it comes to consumer products , it 's not about " technology . "
It 's about consumer behavior and brands .
Consumers do n't like to customize .
They do n't like to be forced to learn new ways of doing things .
They actually do n't like " technology " -- at least not for technology 's sake .
Consumers like to keep things simple and easy .
Google does n't understand that yet , at least not the folks who make Gmail .
( Google 's Search , meanwhile , is as simple as can be -- which is why everyone loves it ) .
With Gmail , Google is still infatuated with the idea that it can do everything " better . "
Google can't be bothered to do things the old way because the old way is boring .
Well , here 's what I 'm hoping .
I 'm hoping that the equivalent to Patrick Pichette -- Google 's new CFO who has finally brought financial and spending discipline to the company -- will soon arrive on the product side .
I 'm hoping this person will understand that , for the mainstream Gmail user , it 's not about " technology . "
I 'm hoping that that person will understand that every day that Google makes me view my email as " Conversations " is a day that it is alienating millions of folks who would otherwise be big champions of the company .
Adding a " Normal email view " would be so easy .
Until Google understands this -- and adds it -- it will never have a chance against Apple at becoming a beloved mainstream consumer company .

Jim Rogers is sounding the alarm -- buy agricultural commodities ahead of the riots .
The financial crisis has cut off investment in agriculture , with many farmers unable to get loans for fertilizer according to Mr. Rogers .
Of course , this means agricultural commodities will make a killing :
CNBC : " Sometimes in the next few years we 're going to have very serious shortages of food everywhere in the world and prices are going to go through the roof . "
Cotton and coffee are good buys because they are very distressed , while sugar , despite the fact that it has gone up a lot , is still down 70 percent from its all - time high , according to Rogers .
" I do n't think that the problems of the world are behind us yet , " he said .

Advertisement Lava from a volcano in a sparsely populated area of the Democratic Republic of Congo is threatening rare chimpanzees , wildlife officials say .
Mount Nyamulagira , 25 km ( 16 miles ) from the eastern city of Goma , erupted at dawn on Saturday , sending lava into the surrounding Virunga National Park .
About 40 endangered chimpanzees and other animals live in the area .
But the country 's famous critically endangered mountain gorillas are said to be safe as they live further east .
I was woken at 0345 [ 0145 GMT ] by a loud bang , which I first thought was the sound of war
Innocent Mburanumwe
Warden for Virunga 's southern sector Emmanuel de Merode , Virunga 's director , said that park staff were working with the civilian and military authorities to assess the risk and take appropriate action .
Rangers were deployed to the area to monitor the flow of lava and were due to report back hourly , he added .
A government official , Feller Lutahichirwa , said observers were monitoring the situation with help from UN helicopters , the Associated Press reports .
' Mountain on fire '
While few people live in the area immediately affected , officials said their primary concern was to protect human settlements .
Innocent Mburanumwe , warden for Virunga 's southern sector , said that lava was flowing towards an area to the south of the volcano , where " many people " live .
" I was woken at 0345 [ 0145 GMT ] by a loud bang , which I first thought was the sound of war , " he added .
" I thought there was fighting again near our park station , " he said , referring to the conflicts which have wracked eastern DR Congo .
" Then I saw the mountain was on fire with sparks flying . "
Mount Nyamulagira ( also spelled Nyamuragira ) , which stands at 3,058 m ( 10,033 ft ) , is one of the most active volcanoes in Africa , according to officials in Virunga .
It has registered more than 35 eruptions since 1882 , with the most recent before this weekend being in 2006 .
Virunga , a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1979 , is home to 200 of the world 's 720 remaining mountain gorillas but they live on the flanks of the Mikeno volcano further east from Nyamulagira .
Previous eruptions of the volcano have threatened the city of Goma , which has a population of at least 200,000 as well as tens of thousands of refugees .

Every week , sort of , features editor ( Reverend ) Anthony Burch discusses games and gamer culture in his " Rev Rant " video series .
This video includes SPOILERS for the Modern Warfare 2 " No Russian " level .
Not so much for the rest of the game .
And I realize that the preview frame for the video may be sort of spoilery , but you 'll live .
This week 's rant is , yes , about the controversial MW2 airport massacre level , but hopefully not in a way you 've heard it discussed yet -- I tried to focus less on the arguments of propriety or controversy and more on how the scene does and does not work on basic interactive and narrative levels .
Watch it above , comment below .
If you 're interested in hearing the discussion in this video taken further , you may also enjoy this week 's episode of Podtoid .
[ A note : the actual video in the rant is taken from Brad Nicholson 's capture of the No Russian level , which I used for convenience 's sake .
I went through the level without killing any civilians -- do n't read too much into the fact that Brad did not . ]

Today , David Barstow of the Times begins to touch on one of the most underreported aspects of Tea Party populism :
Its deep ideological and organizational ties to 2008 ’s Ron Paul Revolution .
The press has tended to treat the Tea Party movement as a sui generis outpouring of rage against a black president and an expanding government .
But the grassroots network that Barstow examines , Friends of Liberty , has “ been shaped by the growing popularity in eastern Washington of Ron Paul , the libertairan congressman from Texas , ” he writes .
There ’s good reason to believe that Friends of Liberty is less the exception than the rule .
My 2008 Mother Jones piece , The Apostles of Ron Paul , noted that his GOP presidential bid mobilized an outpouring of grassroots support and online activism unlike anything ever seen on the political Right .
Paul trumped his competitors in both parties on just about every metric of online organizing , including support on Meetup.com , where his backers outnumbered those of the leading candidates combined .
Though his campaign ultimately failed to win a single state primary , I pointed out the parallels between his formidable netroots machine and that built in 2004 by Howard Dean , which ultimately became a major factor in the Democratic victories of 2006 and 2008 .
“ Whichever way the Paulites go , candidates would be smart to study their movement ’s trajectory , ” I wrote .
“ It , not Paul , is the real revolution . ”
Flash forward to 2010 , and a close look at local Tea Party chapters reveals strong ties with Paul supporters .
Barstow reports that the head of Friends of Liberty was first politicized by watching Paul ’s speeches on YouTube .
The Bay Area rEVOLution , the Paul Meetup group that I profiled in 2008 , is now campaigning for “ Tea Party ” Republican congressional candidate John Dennis and holding a “ Tea Bomb ” for him modeled on the “ Money Bombs ” that raked in millions for Paul .
Across the country , 180 Meetup groups now mention both the Tea Party and Ron Paul on their websites .
The overlap makes perfect political sense .
Paul was the only GOP presidential candidate who was legitimately fiscally conservative and pro-civil liberties ( not to mention anti-government ) .
Conservative populists ’ fear of what a black president might do with the Patriot Act and their rage over the Wall Street bailouts finds a perfect outlet in Paul ’s desire to slash taxes , abolish the federal reserve , and reinstate a commodity - backed currency similar to the gold standard , as well as his tolerance of extremist backers such as 9 - 11 truthers and neo -Nazis .
It ’s the reason why Michelle Bachman recently held a town hall meeting with Paul in Minnestota .
And why both liberals and conservatives need to pay more attention to libertarians .
My folks live in England , and — like most people in Western Europe — they ’ve spent the past few weeks buried under snow and ice in the most vicious winter for decades .
Which led me to thinking about all the motorcycles locked up in garages and sheds , waiting for the roads to clear and tires to find grip .
So when I happened across this extraordinary machine from TGS in Germany , I had to feature it .
The bike was built by TGS ’ owner Tobias Guckel for Sepp Schmidt , hence the name ‘ Seppster ’ .
And those huge Avon Cobra tires each have 120 spikes for maximum purchase on ice …
Of course , it ’s not an entirely practical bike , unlike the hugely popular ice speedway racers of Europe , but it ’s a very interesting alternative to the usual ‘ Hot Wheels ’ style choppers .
Power comes from a turbocharged S&S 93 - ci motor , but virtually every other part of this machine was built in - house by TGS , from the radical single - sided front fork to the rigid frame and wheels .
This bike came third at the 2008 World Championship of Bike Building ; like Hot Dock ’s StG Nautilus , it was overshadowed by Roger Goldammer ’s paradigm - shifting ‘ Goldmember . ’
In any other year , this ice racer would have grabbed the spotlight , and rightly so .
BAGHDAD  Iraq ’s independent electoral commission on Thursday barred about 500 candidates from running in parliamentary elections in March , among them an influential Sunni Muslim politician , in a decision that could stoke sectarian tensions here and deprive the vote of crucial legitimacy in the eyes of part of the electorate .
The decision could undermine what many viewed as a key accomplishment of the political process here : agreement by nearly all Iraqi factions to take part in the vote , unlike previous elections that were boycotted out of fear of insurgent violence or in protest of American involvement .
Among those barred were the defense minister , Abdul - Kader Jassem al - Obeidi , and Saleh al - Mutlaq , a Sunni who is the head of the National Dialogue Front .
Mr. Mutlaq ’s group , in alliance with Ayad Allawi , a former prime minister , had emerged as a leading force in predominantly Sunni provinces , which were underrepresented in the last parliamentary vote , in 2005 .
Depending on how many seats they secured in Parliament , the alliance could have had a say in choosing Iraq ’s new prime minister .
Just when I am feeling like some people in the copyright industry are getting their act together , there are news that make me rethink my patient and measured approach to the issue of global intellectual property .
The International Intellectual Property Alliance ( IIPA ) has submitted this year ’s Special 301 recommendation list to the United States Trade Representative .
For those unfamiliar with this figure , the Special 301 status is the biggest stick in the USTR arsenal , it is the equivalent of being placed in the trading naughty list .
One of the most infamous features of the list is that it allows various industry organisations to submit their recommendations on who should be named and shamed this year .
I am neither surprised nor upset by the addition of Costa Rica to the list , to be fair our enforcement is atrocious .
Similarly , I am not surprised by most of the other recommendations , which seems like a rehash of past offenders .
What I found rather surprising is that the IIPA seems to be using their Special 301 submission to attack open source software .
According to Digital Copyright Canada , several countries are being included in the Special 301 watchlist because they have open source - friendly policies , or in their words , the IIPA would rather people “ pirate ” than switch to legal competitors .
This is quite a claim , so I have been going through the reports to verify it myself .
The country reports for Brazil , India , Philippines , Vietnam and Thailand certainly contain some comments about open source software .
Particularly , the IIPA seems to be concerned that these countries have enacted or are in the process of enacting legislation that will make it obligatory for public entities to choose open source software over its proprietary counterparts .
I have to admit that I somewhat share the IIPA ’s concerns in this regard .
I have never believed in open source procurement legislation , I think that forcing institutions to use a specific technical solution is wrong .
Open source is an organic , bottom - up movement , and making it state policy seems not only counter - productive , but contrary to the very same principles of openness .
Open source should not be imposed , it should win on its own merits .
Nonetheless , the country report for Indonesia is a different matter altogether .
The IIPA comments :
“ The government of Indonesia , under its Ministry of Administrative Reform ( MenPAN ) , officially sent to all central and provincial government offices , including state - owned enterprises in Indonesia , Circular Letter No. 1 of 2009 issued on March 30 , 2009 , endorsing the use and adoption of open source software within government organizations .
More specifically , the MenPAN letter , concerning the “ Utilization of Legal Software and Open Source Software ( OSS ) , ” encourages government agencies to use “ FOSS ” ( Free Open Source Software ) with a view toward implementation by the end of 2011 , which the Circular states will result in the use of legitimate open source and FOSS software and a reduction in overall costs of software . ”
Wait a second , this is not making any imposition , it is making a recommendation that the adoption of open source software will decrease piracy and reduce costs .
This surely is a good thing ?
Not according to the IIPA , they equate promotion and endorsement with anti-competitive practices that will stifle market entry by proprietary software .
The IIPS explains why this is not a good thing :
“ While IIPA has no issue with one of the stated goals of the circular , namely , “ reducing software copyright violation , ” the Indonesian government ’s policy as indicated in the circular letter instead simply weakens the software industry and undermines its long - term competitiveness by creating an artificial preference for companies offering open source software and related services , even as it denies many legitimate companies access to the government market .
Rather than fostering a system that will allow users to benefit from the best solution available in the market , irrespective of the development model , it encourages a mindset that does not give due consideration to the value to intellectual creations .
As such , it fails to build respect for intellectual property rights and also limits the ability of government or public - sector customers ( e.g. , State - owned enterprise ) to choose the best solutions to meet the needs of their organizations and the Indonesian people .
It also amounts to a significant market access barrier for the software industry . ”
So , reducing costs and piracy translates into denying companies access to the market and affects innovation .
Read here , Microsoft and others will have to compete with Open Office .
I am baffledby the mindset that believes encouraging public institutions to use legitimate and free open source software solutions “ does not give due consideration to the value to intellectual creations ” .
Chew on that phrase for a moment .
Open source software has no value because it is free , so anything that encourages open source has the opposite effect , namely , it “ fails to build respect for intellectual property rights ” .
It is nice to know where the IIPA stands .
Only commercial intellectual property is worthy of protection , everything else is as bad as piracy .
So it was with a certain relish that I approached the
SHEIKH JARRAH , Jerusalem –
As the grandson of anarchists , I ’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for fanatics .
Expressions of extremism , and passionately reasoned , exquisitely twisted world views make me feel , how shall I put this , at home .
It was beyond my understanding why an Israeli government which views the idea of a Palestinian Right of Return as tantamount to annihilation of the Jewish state , would set a legal precedent that
It was hard to fathom why Israeli police in this quiet hollow of the Arab half of Jerusalem , would choose to openly flout and violate the rulings of an Israeli court .
I was unable to grasp why they would manhandle and arrest non-violent demonstrators – among them the executive director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel – for protesting the official expulsion from their homes of more than two dozen Palestinian families here , driven out and into the street , so that subsidized and sheltered settlers could move in .
The essay has the seamless , compellingly elegant , hyper - lucid , parallel universe logic of a hallucination – or a settlement rooted in the craw of the West Bank .
Until I read it , it was difficult for me to comprehend the current runaway - freight recklessness of Israeli authorities and a certain segment of the hard right , bolstered by shady funding from abroad .
“ The answer is unpleasant to contemplate , but the mounting evidence makes it inescapable , ” she writes .
“ It was Israel ’s very willingness to make concessions for the sake of peace that has produced its current near - pariah status . ”
The thrust of the piece , which Commentary Editor John Podhoretz understandably calls “ groundbreaking , ” is that Israel ’s international standing has plummeted to an unprecedented low – and the number of Palestinians killed by Israel has concurrently soared – specifically because of Israel ’s having done much too much for peace .
of a recent issue of Commentary , “ The Deadly Price of Pursuing Peace , ” written as it was by a talented colleague and friend , Evelyn Gordon .
for just such a right .
Just as I was clueless as to why the Knesset was to vote Wednesday on a bill that would make aiding asylum seekers fleeing African genocide , granting them shelter , medical care , food , a crime subject to up to 20 years in prison .
Or why there were vigorous new campaigns to increase gender segregation at the Western Wall and on public buses , and why women have been arrested and interrogated on suspicion of having worn prayer shawls while praying on their side of a barrier raised so that they would no longer be able to watch their sons ’ bar mitzvah on the mens ’ side .
Or why a sudden and ferocious campaign against human rights organizations and charity work agencies in Israel is coinciding with new human rights outrages against Palestinians and foreigners , some of them unable to leave , others forced to .
It was not until I saw the title of the Commentary piece that it all made sense .
The right is terrified of peace .
And , in the end , the right ’s fear of peace will be the death of Israel .
They are afraid of peace , in part , because it threatens the core of what has come to replace other values as the goal of Judaism : permanent settlement of the West Bank .
But that is only a part of it .
They are afraid of peace because they are afraid of the world .
They dismiss fellow Jews who want to see a two - state solution – a majority of Israelis – as unrealistic , as living in a bubble .
The name of the bubble these moderates live in , however , is planet Earth .
The right , meanwhile , wants to wall off Israel as the world ’s last remaining legally mandated Jewish ghetto .
A place where all the rules are different , exit and entry , citizenship and human rights , because the residents within are Jews .
A place where non-Jews , dehumanized as congenital Jew - haters , are rendered invisible .
A place which , if suffocating and insufferable , still seems safer than the scary world outside .
A place which , because of its walls and its politics and its cowardice , is losing its ability to function as a part of the world , reveling in cheap - shot humiliations of key foreign ambassadors , deliriously proud of its sense that of all the world , including most of its Jews and Israelis – only the right sees the real truth .
This braid of thought was venomously endorsed this week both by an uncharacteristically Kahane - sounding Alan Dershowitz , and the obscenely infantile Im Tirtzu movement .
According to them , where Cast Lead was concerned , the real war criminals are Richard Goldstone and Naomi Chazan – two people who are open about their love of Israel , and who have worked their whole adult lives for its well - being .
The fears of the right are not mere devices of rhetoric .
The risks of making peace are real .
Every bit as real as the risks of failing to make peace .
It all comes down to belief .
It comes down to the kind of country the believer wants Israel to be .
And for that reason , there is a civil war going on for Israel ’s soul .
It will not be weaponry that decides this war , but courage .
People who care about the direction that Israel is moving , and whose watchword is moderation , would do well to choose one facet of the fight , and join .
One place to start , is to support the New Israel Fund and the groups it supports .
Another place to start is this one .
At the weekend , challenging the threats of rightist thugs and law - scorning police , the weekly demonstration on behalf of the Palestinian residents of Sheikh Jarrah doubled in size .
The police backed down on their vow to break up the protest , and the Kahanists barely showed .
If non-violent peace activism scares the right to this extent , there must be a great deal of power in it .
After all , most Israelis can sense that if peace is to be the enemy , more dangerous even than the threat of war , this is one doomed ghetto .
Things have reached such a devastating point , that for the first time in recent memory , even Ehud Barak is beginning to get it : “ The simple truth is , if there is one state ” including Israel , the West Bank and Gaza , “ it will have to be either binational or undemocratic , ” Barak told the Herzliya Conference Tuesday .
“ If this bloc of millions of Palestinians cannot vote , that will be an apartheid state . ”
The fear of peace has left Israel as a country which is prepared for nuclear warfare but not for non-violent protest on behalf of Palestinians .
The fear of peace , and the blackmail of the right on behalf of settlement , has contorted Israel into a body which , unable to countenance the perils of treating the sickness of occupation , will eventually be killed by it .
Israel ’s defense minister , for one , is

I can foresee that a common criticism against my explanation of how an anarchist society would look like , will be to compare it to social Darwinism .
That I ’m suggesting that we let society run along and let natural selection choose who gets to live and prosper .
One might bring forth the counter example of the “ Free Markets ” and how letting them run unmanaged and unhindered ( as their proponents suggest ) has ended up with disastrous results .
But I ’m not suggesting anything like that .
I have made it very clear that I put far more weight to the utilitarian result of the simple rules we choose for the basis of our society .
In short , the end result needs to be the maximization of all human happiness and the society we try to create is simply the means to this .
This is very far from the idea that we should choose a set of rules and stick to them , come what may .
In fact this is why the free markets fail so miserably .
The central idea of the “ free market ” is similar to mine in the sense that they suggest that we should stick to some simple rules and let the rest fall in place around them .
Those rules are a combination of respect for private property , respect for contractual agreements , and non-aggression .
Proponents of such combinations claim follow two kind of argumentative paths .
Either that the principles of a free market are a natural law or that they bring a utilitarian result in regards to more freedom ( which we assume would make people happier ) .
But none of these can be sufficiently proven .
It ’s impossible to display the existence of this “ Natural Law ” as it ’s usually based either on religious underpinnings or personal delusions and it ’s impossible to display the utilitarian results of free market principles because of the chaos theory .
The best one can predict about a future free market society is that it will have those principles .
It will respect PP , contracts and non-aggression .
But such a society could range from a human paradise of countless small farmers / artisans in an egalitarian formation , to a dystopia of mega- corporations controlling all the resource and 99 % of humans being subsistence wage - slaves with no rights except the right to serve a boss .
This is more problematic when seen through an utilitarian perspective ( for freedom ) because some of the principles can easily lead to the antithesis of freedom , such as the loss of freedom one has while working for a boss or the capacity to engage in slave - contracts .
The fact that whenever a laissez - faire conception was attempted it ended up in huge human misery only serves to question their capacity to achieve their ideal goal .
However , what I am proposing is not simply to choose some rules that I claim will lead to a better result but rather to choose rules that tautologically will lead to that result .
A society based on democratic values will be democratic .
A society based on possessive ownership will be possessive and so on .
What this means is that if there is a value that we believe should exist in a future society , we should be making that value a core rule to be espoused , promoted and defended by itself .
Not as a possible result of some other value .
For example : to suggest we all follow “ sticky ” ownership rules because it will lead to freedom of speech is misguided .
It will serve us far better to follow freedom of speech itself because only then will we be sure that it will lead to a society which values freedom of speech .
Furthermore , I ’m not even suggesting we select some concepts monolithically .
I do not say we should choose those values and also a value to never change them .
As I explained in my previous post , it might well be the case that at some indefinite point in the future , Anarchism will be sub-optimal itself .
I cannot even imagine such a scenario but I can accept the possibility .
Therefore , we should always be open to changing our core ruleset when the situation requires it and this should be done in the same way as before :
Directly embrace the value that we would like to have in the future .
This is another way by which anarchism differs from social Darwinism and free markets , which say that the values themselves should never be changed and we should simply let societal evolution and natural selection to take their toll .
But this is simply giving up one of the most basic and useful features of humans :
Our ability to change our environment ( which includes societal rules ) as a means of adaptation .
Therefore it ’s not surprising that social Darwinism is such an utter failure in regards to human happiness .
In short , Anarchism or at least the Chaotic conception of Anarchism ( Chaos Anarchism ?
Chanarchism ? ) that I promote , is not a form of social Darwinism because we control our environment instead of us being controlled by it .
I can foresee that a common criticism against my explanation of how an anarchist society would look like , will be to compare it to social Darwinism .
That I ’m suggesting that we let society run along and let natural selection choose who gets to live and prosper .
One might bring forth the counter example of the “ Free Markets ” and how letting them run unmanaged and unhindered ( as their proponents suggest ) has ended up with disastrous results .

Islamist militants have attacked a village in the southern Philippines , killing at least 11 people , military officials have said .
About 70 members of Abu Sayyaf , a group linked to al - Qaeda , raided Tubigan village on the southern island of Basilan , an army spokeswoman said .
Lt Steffani Cacho said homes had been raked with gunfire and set ablaze in a pre-dawn attack .
Philippines army reinforcements have been sent to the area , she added .
The militants were believed to have been avenging the death of a senior leader on nearby Jolo island , an Abu Sayyaf stronghold , Lt Cacho said .
However , Basilan police chief Antonio Mendoza said the attack had been motivated by a personal grudge with the village chairman .
' Victims asleep '
Seventeen people were wounded in the attack with nine in a critical condition , four of them children , said regional health chief Dr Kadil Jojo Sinolinding .
" Most of the victims were still asleep when they were strafed and then their houses were torched , " he said .
Abu Sayyaf is the smallest and most radical of the Islamic separatist groups in the southern Philippines .
Last weekend , Abu Sayyaf commander Albader Parad was killed in an attack by Philippines troops on a rebel camp on Jolo .
While I would like to see Tim Burton shy away from the obvious , it ’s impossible not to be excited for his theatrical version of the classic 1960s gothic TV soap opera Dark Shadows , which would star Johnny Depp as the vamp Barnabas Collins .
While the project has been in development for years now , it looks as if it might start shooting as early as next fall .
“ We ’re actually going to shoot that film next September / October with Tim Burton and Johnny , ” Producer Graham King told Sci Fi Wire .
“ We ’ve been given a script .
John August wrote the first screenplay .
We ’re making some changes , but the film ’s going to be in production , as I say , September or October of next year . ”
Over 1,225 episodes , “ Dark Shadows ” was a highly atmospheric , spooky soap that featured gothic horror staples like vampires , monsters , witches , werewolves , ghosts and zombies .
Apple has improved its app approval process , but that does n't mean it 's entirely cured of quirks .
Apple sent an email to Tim Novikoff , founder of flash card app , Flash of Genius , asking him to delete , " Finalist in Google ’s Android Developer ’s Challenge ! ” from his app description .
According to Apple , " Providing future platform compatibility plans or other general platform references are not relevant in the context of the iPhone App Store . "
In other words , do n't talk about the competition !
It sounds harsh , but makes sense .
It does n't matter if it 's a great Android application , this is a different platform .
On the other hand , it makes Apple look petty , and points to more evidence of Apple trying to rub out Google , and its Android platform .

Early morning on the 1st of May 1943 , a Spanish fisherman discovered a corpse clothed in British military attire which had washed ashore .
Apparently a casualty of an airplane accident at sea , he had a briefcase chained to him .
Identified as Major William Martin of the British Royal Marines , the body and the briefcase was demanded by the British Admiralty .
Spain , technically a neutral party during WWII , turned them in , but not before letting the Abwehr– the German intelligence organization– examine everything .
Inside the suitcase was the letter from Sir Archibald Nye , vice chief of the Imperial General Staff to Sir Harold Alexander , the British commander in North Africa , which outlined the Allies ’ plans to invade Europe from Sardinia , Corsica and Greece .
This vital information was rushed to Berlin .
On May 12th , Hitler sent an order : “ Measures regarding Sardinia and the Peloponnese take precedence over everything else , ” diverting resources away from Sicily , through which the Allied Forces eventually invaded .
This was because Germans had fallen for an elaborate deception : Major Martin never existed , and was part of a ruse named , “ Operation Mincemeat ” .
The British Intelligence procured the body of a 34 - year - old man who had recently died with pneumonia , with lungs full of fluid as a drowned man ’s would .
To create the aura of authenticity , the corpse was given IDs , keys , personal letters , and other possessions such as overdue bills and a letter from his fiance .
Considering the deliberate efforts to protect the true identity of Major Martin at the time , and the wishes of his real family who granted permission to use the body on the condition that the man ’s identity never be revealed , it is quite possible that we will never know the real name of Major Martin .
Saturn 's largest moon , Titan , looks to be the only place in the solar system -- aside from our home planet , Earth -- with copious quantities of liquid ( largely , liquid methane and ethane ) sitting on its surface .
According to planetary astronomer Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) , Earth and Titan share yet another feature , which is inextricably linked with that surface liquid : common fog .
The presence of fog provides the first direct evidence for the exchange of material between the surface and the atmosphere , and thus of an active hydrological cycle , which previously had only been known to exist on Earth .
In a talk to be delivered December 18 at the American Geophysical Union 's 2009 Fall Meeting in San Francisco , Brown , the Richard and Barbara Rosenberg Professor and professor of planetary astronomy , details evidence that Titan 's south pole is spotted " more or less everywhere " with puddles of methane that give rise to sporadic layers of fog .
( Technically , fog is just a cloud or bank of clouds that touch the ground ) .
Brown and his colleagues also describe their findings in a recent paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The researchers made their discovery using data from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer ( VIMS ) onboard the Cassini spacecraft , which has been observing Saturn 's system for the past five years .
The VIMS instrument provides " hyperspectral " imaging , covering a large swath of the visible and infrared spectrum .
Brown and his colleagues -- including Caltech undergraduate students Alex Smith and Clare Chen , who were working with Brown as part of a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship ( SURF ) project -- searched public online archives to find all Cassini data collected over the moon 's south pole from October 2006 through March 2007 .
They filtered the data to separate out features occurring at different depths in the atmosphere , ranging from 20 kilometers ( 12.4 miles ) to .25 kilometers ( 820 feet ) above the surface .
Using other filters , they homed in on " bright " features caused by the scattering of light off small particles -- such as the methane droplets present in clouds .
advertisement
In this way , they isolated clouds located about 750 meters ( less than a half - mile ) above the ground .
These clouds did not extend into the higher altitudes -- into the moon 's troposphere , where regular clouds form .
In other words , says Brown , they had found fog .
" Fog -- or clouds , or dew , or condensation in general -- can form whenever air reaches about 100 percent humidity , " Brown says .
" There are two ways to get there .
The first is obvious : add water ( on Earth ) or methane ( on Titan ) to the surrounding air .
The second is much more common : make the air colder so it can hold less water ( or liquid methane ) , and all of that excess needs to condense . "
This , he explains , is the same process that causes water droplets to form on the outside of a cool glass .
On Earth , this is the most common method of making fog , Brown says .
" That fog you often see at sunrise hugging the ground is caused by ground - level air cooling overnight , to the point where it cannot hang onto its water .
As the sun rises and the air heats , the fog goes away . "
Similarly , fog can form when wet air passes over cold ground ; as the air cools , the water condenses .
And mountain fog occurs when air gets pushed up the side of a mountain and cools , causing the water to condense .

However , none of these mechanisms work on Titan .
The reason is that Titan 's muggy atmosphere takes a notoriously long time to cool ( or warm ) .
" If you were to turn the sun totally off , Titan 's atmosphere would still take something like 100 years to cool down , " Brown says .
" Even the coldest parts of the surface are much too warm to ever cause fog to condense . "
Mountain fog is also out of the question , he adds .
" A Titanian mountain would have to be about 15,000 feet high before the air would get cold enough to condense , " he says .
And yet the tallest mountains the moon could possibly carry ( because of its fragile , icy crust ) would be no more than 3000 feet high .
The only possible way to make Titanian fog , then , is to add humidity to the air .
And the only way to do that , Brown says , is by evaporating liquid -- in this case , methane , the most common hydrocarbon on the moon , which exists in solid , liquid , and gaseous forms .
Brown notes that evaporating methane on Titan " means it must have rained , and rain means streams and pools and erosion and geology .
The presence of fog on Titan proves , for the first time , that the moon has a currently active methane hydrological cycle . "
The presence of fog also proves that the moon must be dotted with methane pools , Brown says .
That 's because any ground - level air , after becoming 100 percent humid and turning into fog , would instantly rise up into the atmosphere like a giant cumulus cloud .
" The only way to make the fog stick around on the ground is to both add humidity and cool the air just a little , " he explains .
" The way to cool the air just a little is to have it in contact with something cold , like a pool of evaporating liquid methane . "

A Current Affair 's road safety crusade could be about to enter slippery legal territory after it used recycled footage from a two - year - old Top Gear audition tape in a faked attempt to " trap " a hoon driver .
A Current Affair ‘s road safety crusade could be about to enter slippery legal territory after it used recycled footage from a two - year - old Top Gear audition tape in a faked attempt to “ trap ” a hoon driver .
Last night on ACA , the heavily promoted opening segment , entitled “ Car Hoon ” and tagged with an “ exclusive ” watermark , ran three full minutes of footage of a mystery man called “ Carlo ” driving his souped - up Nissan somewhere on Sydney ’s roads .
[ youtube ]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35CWegauhlQ[/youtube]
“ We ’ll let the video speak for itself , because we want your help to find him , ” intoned host Tracey Grimshaw before airing the video of “ Carlo ” “ drifting ” across double lines to the network ’s heavy metal soundtrack .
At the end of the segment , reporter Tom Steinfort issued a shout for viewers to catch “ Crazy Carlo ” , and promised a follow - up on tonight ’s program .
“ But first we have to find him and that ’s where you come in .
We believe his name is Carlo — Crazy Carlo . ”
Steinfort then aired a cleaned - up image of the vehicle ’s registration .
But Crikey can reveal that the source for the story was the YouTube clip below , uploaded to the web on September 26 last year .
The clip clearly identified the driver ’s first and last name and its intended purpose — an audition tape for the mysterious Stig test - driver on the local version of Top Gear .
“ Hi everybody at Freehand , my name is Carlo Arena and I would like to be your Stig . ”

( For those unaware , The Stig is an white - clad character on both versions of Top Gear who test - drives vehicles under a cloak of anonymity .
Top Gear ‘s production company Freehand issued a shout out for Stig auditions way back in 2007 .
Arena submitted an audition and had n’t heard anything back — until last night . )
Damningly for Steinfort and Nine , the YouTube source not only includes lingering footage of the driver , but also reveals his first and last name , which Steinfort claims not to know .
None of this footage was aired by Nine .
Crikey contacted Arena and his representative ( Arena was in a meeting consulting with his lawyers ) told Crikey there were only two copies of the video — one retained by Arena and the other sent to Freehand .
The YouTube video was uploaded about a year after the initial audition tape was submitted and the poster and the initial commenters were far from friendly .
Nine secured the rights to Top Gear at around the same time the video was posted .
“ Look at the date on the YouTube video .
You can draw your own conclusions , ” Arena ’s representative said .
Crikey understands that the Nissan in question was sold just months after the video was shot , on February 22 , 2008 , and the registration was binned when it later became a track car — rendering Nine ’s shout - out pointless .
On the Freehand website , there are explicit instructions that the identity of the driver submitting tapes to the company would not be revealed .
Under the section “ How to Apply “ , the company says the following :
Record anything you think demonstrates for what you are and what you can do … and if you want to be The Stig — persuade us you know how to drive and we ’ll NEVER reveal who you are — and you wo n’t either . ”
Arena ’s representative admitted to Crikey that the stunt was “ dangerous ” , said the road in question had been blocked off with other vehicles .
We called Freehand executive producer Peter Abbott to ask whether he had liaised with Nine over the tape but were told he was “ asleep ” in Los Angeles , despite it being 4 pm Los Angeles time when we called .
Another Freehand employee , who did not want to be named , told Crikey they had received “ thousands ” of audition tapes along the lines of Arena ’s but were “ certain ” copies had n’t been released to Nine .
Steinfort and A Current Affair refused to respond to Crikey ‘s requests for urgent comment .
But YouTube commenters on the source for the story were damning .
“ So how did A Current Affair get the tape ?
If they want viewers to help them find him , why did n’t they show the video of him speaking to the camera at the start ? ” said one .
“ I love how they slap “ ACA exclusive ” on the video – it ’s on YouTube ffs , not exactly exclusive ” , said another .
The first - time buyer tax credit has boosted sales
Sales of previously - owned US homes fell 16.7 % in December , the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) has said .
Sales had risen from September to November as first - time buyers took advantage of tax credits .
The decline in December was expected as buyers rushed to complete deals before the original 30 November deadline .
The first - time buyer tax credit has since been extended until 30 April , and the NAR said there was likely to be another surge in sales in the spring .
December sales fell to a seasonally - adjusted annual rate of 5.45 million from 6.54 million in November , but are 15 % higher than the level seen in December 2008 .
The average sale price of a previously - owned home was $ 178,300 ( £ 110,200 ) in December , up 1.5 % on a year ago .
Total sales in 2009 were almost 5 % higher than in 2008 - the first annual gain since 2005 .
" It 's significant that home sales remain above year - ago levels , but the market is going through a period of swings driven by the tax credit , " Lawrence Yun , NAR chief economist said .
" By early summer the overall market should benefit from more balanced inventory , and sales are on track to rise again in 2010 .
" However , the job market remains a concern and could dampen the housing recovery - job creation is key to a continued recovery in the second half of the year . "
WASHINGTON 
In expansive remarks at a law school in Florida , Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday vigorously defended the Supreme Court ’s recent campaign finance decision .
And Justice Thomas explained that he did not attend State of the Union addresses  he missed the dust - up when President Obama used the occasion last week to criticize the court ’s decision  because the gatherings had turned so partisan .
Justice Thomas responded to several questions from students at Stetson University College of Law in Gulfport , Fla. , concerning the campaign finance case , Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission .
By a 5 - to - 4 vote , with Justice Thomas in the majority , the court ruled last month that corporations had a First Amendment right to spend money to support or oppose political candidates .
“ I found it fascinating that the people who were editorializing against it were The New York Times Company and The Washington Post Company , ” Justice Thomas said .
“ These are corporations . ”
GOOD
A team at Reading University in Britain gave 50 primary - school children set breakfasts for a month and tested their IQs before , during and after the test period .
They found orange juice and toast significantly improved IQs .
Next best ?
Bacon sandwiches .
BAD A 2007 study by American researchers found those who ate cured meat such as ham , hot dogs and bacon every other day were 78 per cent more likely to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
C is for CHOCOLATE GOOD A couple of squares of the dark variety a day may ward off wrinkles and lower the risk of skin cancer .
Researchers in London found volunteers who ate flavanol - rich chocolate - rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents - could tolerate more wrinkle - causing UV light on their skin .
BAD
The short high gained from eating chocolate could make depression worse .
Researchers from the Black Dog Institute found comfort eating was more likely to prolong a negative mood than shorten it .
D is for DIETARY FIBRE GOOD Dietary fibre , or roughage , found in wholegrain breads and cereals , fruit and vegetables plays a big role in maintaining a healthy immune system and keeping asthma , type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis at bay .
Researchers from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research found insoluble fibre is eventually converted by bacteria into short - chain fatty acids damping down inflammation in the gut .
BAD
Too much fibre and too little fat can lead to vitamin deficiencies .
E is for EGGS GOOD Long blamed for causing cholesterol problems , it seems eggs are back in fashion .
The Heart Foundation has lifted its recommended intake to six a week .
Low in saturated fat and high in protein , eggs contain choline , good for the metabolism and for foetal brain development during pregnancy , and lutein , which lowers the risk for cataracts .
BAD Specialists at Harvard Medical School in Boston found eating an egg every day could increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes by about 60 per cent .
F is for FOLIC ACID GOOD
While it has long been known to decrease the incidence of neural tube defects in babies , University of California scientists found it can also improve sperm quality in men .
Men with the highest levels had the lowest proportion of sperm harbouring genetic changes that can lead to Down syndrome and miscarriages .
BAD
A ground - breaking Australian study late last year found pregnant women who took too much of the supplement were 30 per cent more likely to have a child with asthma .
G is for GERMS
GOOD
Most bacteria within our bodies are helpful , constantly working to keep the numbers of disease - causing bacteria under control .
Anti-bacterial or anti-microbial cleaning products kill both the good and the bad , sometimes disturbing the ratio and allowing bad bacteria to get the upper hand .
BAD Hospitals can be havens for superbugs such as golden staph .
A study published in the Medical Journal of Australia found only 39 per cent of doctors regularly wash their hands , despite knowing its importance in reducing infection rates .
H is for HOLIDAYS GOOD Holidays offer the chance to relax and revive and can assist in achieving a healthy work - life balance .
BAD
Working too hard makes us stressed and our immune systems work at their peak .
When we finally stretch out on a beach and relax , our body notes it is no longer under stress and begins to stand down from its state of heightened alert .
This is unfortunate timing because our immune system becomes less vigilant at a time when we are being exposed to viruses and bacteria not encountered before .
I is for IRON GOOD Without iron our bodies can't transport oxygen in the blood .
Good sources of iron include red meat , offal , spinach and broccoli .
Drinking orange juice with your dinner helps iron absorption .
Tannins from tea , coffee and wine reduce iron absorption .
About one - third of the world 's population is iron - deficient , many of them menstruating or pregnant women , babies and toddlers and teenage girls .
BAD
The body can't excrete excess iron and unnecessary supplements can interfere with the ability to absorb zinc and copper .
J is for JUICE GOOD A study in the American Journal of Medicine showed that drinking juice more than three times a week reduced the risk of developing Alzheimer 's disease by 76 per cent , compared with those who drank it less than once a week .
It is the strong anti-oxidant properties of fruit and vegetable juices that have been shown to offer protection against the disease .
BAD
But an Adelaide - based study found that some people can't process juice 's natural sugar , resulting in bloating , flatulence and diarrhoea .
K is for KISSING GOOD Swiss scientists have found you need to be in a close relationship to benefit .
Indiscriminate kissing just wo n't do .
University of Zurich researchers studied 51 German couples for a week and found those who reported more physical contact had lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their saliva .
BAD Passionately kissing several partners can increase the risk of meningitis , a deadly infection of the lining surrounding the brain and spinal cord , researchers from the Children 's Hospital at Westmead found .
L is for LIPIDS
GOOD
Having high cholesterol is never good but some lipid - lowering drugs have the potential to halve the risk of amputation in diabetic patients , according to a study of 1000 people with Type 2 diabetes .
BAD
The liver processes cholesterol and dietary fat .
When we eat animal fats the liver transports the fat , with cholesterol , in the form of lipoproteins , into our bloodstream .
Too much cholesterol leads to fatty deposits in the arteries , which can become blocked , leading to heart disease and stroke .
M is for MILK GOOD A protein in milk can help fight drug - resistant bacteria that cause eye infections .
It also speeds the healing of wounds to the cornea .
When attached to contact lenses , it prevents bacteria growing on them , reducing the risk of eye disease .
BAD Drinking milk can increase the risk of prostate cancer .
A study of 82,483 men in the US found an increased chance of localised or non-aggressive tumours in those who drank low or non -fat milk .
Drinking whole milk showed a decreased risk of developing prostate cancer .
N is for NUTS GOOD
In a University of Wollongong study , 50 overweight adults with non-insulin - treated diabetes followed a well - balanced , low - fat diet .
Those given 30 grams of walnuts a day had more good , unsaturated fats in their diets than those who followed a low - fat diet alone .
BAD
At least one in 200 children born in 1995 had a peanut allergy but , by last year , that had risen to one in 75 .
In a study that tracked patients in one of Canberra 's two private allergy clinics , nine out of 10 children had their first reaction by age six .
O is for ORGASM GOOD Orgasms are natural stress - relievers .
Serotonin levels in the brain become elevated during sexual activity , promoting a sense of wellbeing that has a calming effect on cravings , such as those for junk food or cigarettes .
An orgasm can also help boost the immune system and flush toxins from the skin .
BAD
The inability to reach orgasm is known as anorgasmia .
About 90 per cent of cases have a psychological base , such as stress , but drugs , alcohol , injury , multiple sclerosis or diabetes may play a part .
P is for POTATOES GOOD
The potato , like the banana , is one of the few foods which , if eaten in isolation , provides the essential elements for healthy survival .
When boiled in its skin , a medium - size potato contains half the adult daily requirement of vitamin C and significant amounts of iron , zinc , folate , calcium , vitamin B and potassium .
BAD
The downside is weight gain but cutting them out can make you grumpy , as was revealed in a study by the CSIRO , the University of South Australia and Flinders University .
Q is for QUEUES GOOD Hospital waiting lists have blown out to the longest in four years but the State Government is unfazed , claiming waiting times are a better performance guide .
BAD
In 2007 - 08 , the median waiting time for elective surgery in NSW increased to 39 days .
In 2009 it was 40 days .
Health Department statistics show 62,890 people were waiting for surgery in NSW public hospitals in the March quarter .
The average waiting time was 2.66 months compared with 2.75 months for the same quarter last year when 58,839 people were waiting .
R is for RUNNING GOOD Humans are designed to run .
We have larger surface areas in hip , knee and ankle joints for shock absorption than our prehistoric ancestors as well as shoulders decoupled from the head and neck , allowing the body to rotate , bones in feet to create a stable arch for pushing off the ground and huge buttocks so we do n't fall on our faces .
BAD CSIRO figures show more than 2000 people in Australia die each year from air pollution - related diseases .
Those at risk include otherwise healthy people who exercise outdoors on high - pollution days .
S is for SLEEP GOOD Sleep is important to every facet of our lives .
Miss a few hours thanks to a crying baby or a long - haul flight and the day ahead looks grim indeed .
Most scientists believe eight hours sleep a night is critical in immune function , metabolism , memory and learning .
BAD
For some people , getting a full night 's sleep could be risky .
Researchers from the University of California found those who slept between 6 ½ and 7 ½ hours had a lower mortality rate than people who slept for eight hours or more .
T is for TEA
GOOD Research reveals that drinking just one cup of regular tea a day may help promote cardiovascular health .
The research , conducted at the University of L'Aquila in Italy , is the first study to show that black tea can reduce both blood pressure and the stiffness of your arteries .
BAD
But wait at least four minutes before drinking your cuppa because researchers have found that drinking very hot tea can increase the risk of throat cancer .
U is for UNDIES GOOD Wearing the loose cotton variety can make make life easier for women .
Thrush , or fungal infection , thrives best in moist , airless and warm places such as the vagina or the anus .
And be warned : persistent vaginal thrush could be a symptom of diabetes .
BAD
If you are trying to reproduce , wearing tight underwear can affect sperm production .
Tight undies increase the heat of the testes , affecting the quality and quantity of sperm .
The effects are temporary , but can last up to three weeks .
V is for VITAMINS GOOD People on restrictive diets , athletes , pregnant women , those with eating disorders and the elderly should take vitamin supplements , says a nutrition epidemiologist with the Cluster for Public Health Nutrition at the University of Sydney .
BAD Nutritionist Rosemary Stanton says the body can become dependent on high doses of vitamins .
When you stop taking them , it is no longer efficient at absorbing them from food and you can become nutrient - deficient , even though your diet may be good .
W is for WATER GOOD Drinking plenty of water is directly related to your health .
If you do n't get enough water you will become dehydrated and experience other problems .
Water helps regulate digestion and elimination , and improves skin quality .
BAD Drinking too much water causes cells to swell and upsets the body 's electrolyte balance .
This can cause an irregular heartbeat and cause fluid to enter the lungs .
Swelling puts pressure on the brain and nerves , causing behaviour resembling alcohol intoxication .
X is for X - RAYS GOOD X - rays are used to observe broken bones and swallowed objects and track blood flow in patients .
They can also be used to diagnose cancer , kill bacteria in food , detect flaws in machinery and analyse the structure of crystals or distant stars .
BAD Radiation experts warn of danger from overuse of medical X - rays , claiming they are responsible for many cancer and heart - disease deaths .
They can cause the material through which they pass to become charged , or ionised .
Ionisation can damage cells or DNA in living matter .
Y is for YOGA
GOOD Yoga has been credited with improving flexibility and performance , reducing stress and providing inner peace .
It has also been advocated as complementary treatment to help with conditions such as coronary heart disease , depression , anxiety , asthma , and extensive rehabilitation for disorders including musculoskeletal problems and traumatic brain injury .
BAD Performing a pose wrongly for years may cause chronic injury so it is best to see accredited instructors and regularly check that your technique is correct .
Z is for ZINC GOOD
If you love oysters , you probably do n't have a shortage of zinc .
They contain more zinc a serving than any other food , but red meat and poultry usually provide us with most of our needs .
Other good sources include beans , nuts , crab , lobster and whole grains .
BAD
If you 've been experiencing hair loss , skin lesions , diarrhoea and cold sores you could have a deficiency .
A lack of zinc also contributes to an increased incidence and severity of pneumonia and impairs cognitive and motor function in children .
We stay small to pay particular attention to our clients ’ needs , and we expand by engaging other counsel in co-counsel arrangements when necessary .
This allows us to keep our prices competitive .

We will be with you all the way .
Of course , even with this small - firm approach , we confidently take on the bigger firms .
Whatever the nature of the opponent , our philosophy has always been simply to work harder than the other side .
That is what separates our firm from the rest .
Our philosophy is the same for our employment law or business clients : pay attention to the client ’s needs and work harder than the other side .
This gives you big - firm results with small - firm responsiveness .
Brad Friedman Byon 2/15/2010 , 2:44 pm PT
Press release , as issued today , by media / election / corruption watchdog organization Velvet Revolution.us [ Disclosure : The BRAD BLOG is co-founder of VR ] , concerning the New York Times ' blatant and repeated mis-reporting on the James O'Keefe / Andrew Breitbart false ACORN " pimp " story , and the " paper of record 's " remarkable excuses for still refusing to issue retractions , explanations and apologies :
Watchdog Group Demands Retraction and Explanation From New York Times for Multiple Inaccurate O'Keefe / ACORN /' Pimp ' Reports NYT 's Senior Editor for Standards " stands by " repeated misreporting , cites Fox News appearance by rightwing propaganda " journalist " as " evidence , " despite contrary eye - witness testimony , independent reports and video WASHINGTON , Feb .
15 / PRNewswire -USNewswire / ---
National nonpartisan watchdog group Velvet Revolution calls on the New York Times to immediately issue a retraction and correction of its repeated , inaccurate reporting that James O'Keefe entered offices of The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) dressed as a " pimp . "
This information is false .
" Not since the Times ' flagrant and inexcusable front - page ' reporting ' by Judith Miller on Saddam Hussein 's non-existent Weapons of Mass Destruction has the paper so irresponsibly , and repeatedly , in saturation coverage , helped to mislead the American people in a way that has caused so much harm , " says Brad Friedman , Velvet Revolution co-founder and publisher of The BRAD BLOG , which first reported on the Times ' errors .
In several stories over the past six months , the Times falsely reported that O'Keefe :
" visited Acorn offices … dressed so outlandishly that he might have been playing in a risque high school play "
http://www.nytimes.com/2...litics/16acorn.html?_r=1
http://www.nytimes.com/2...litics/16acorn.html?_r=1
" travels in the gaudy guise of pimp … through various offices of Acorn "
http://www.nytimes.com/2...09/09/19/us/19sting.html
http://www.nytimes.com/2...09/09/19/us/19sting.html made a " national splash last year when he dressed up as a pimp and trained his secret camera on counselors with the liberal community group Acorn … "
http://www.nytimes.com/2...09/09/19/us/19sting.html
However , the visual evidence from video tapes and direct interviews with ACORN employees who actually witnessed O'Keefe in their offices provide direct proof that O'Keefe did not dress as a pimp when he entered the ACORN offices .
In fact , the official December 7 , 2009 report of an investigation by former Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger , states : " Although Mr. O'Keefe appeared in all videos dressed as a pimp , in fact , when he appeared at each and every office , he was dressed like a college student --- in slacks and a button down shirt . "
http://www.proskauer.com...iles/uploads/report2.pdf
That finding , and the report itself , were never reported by the New York Times .
Instead , the Times relied on O'Keefe and his Rightwing employer propagandist Andrew Breitbart for the false " dressed as a pimp at ACORN " claims at least eight times on their pages since the report was released .
Through these articles , the Times has consistently ill - served both the public and the truth , and caused irreparable harm to a legitimate organization that does serve the needs of the public .
Incredibly , Times ' Senior Editor of Standards , Greg Brock , in charge of corrections at the paper , attempted to justify the paper 's multiple misreports by referencing a live appearance on Fox News by O'Keefe dressed in his pimp outfit , as evidence to back up their reporting .
" We believe him , " Brock stated .
" Therefore there is nothing for us to correct ....
We stand by our reporting " .
https://bradblog.com/?p=7689
The Times ' repeated false and unsupported reporting encouraged Congress to pass legislation , signed by the President and later found unconstitutional , to defund ACORN at a time when the low and middle - income citizens it serves are in the greatest need in decades .
Moreover , this false , garish and politically charged " reporting " introduced many Americans to ACORN , a community organization that works for better schools , wages , loans , voting rights and neighborhoods , by painting it as an incompetent , corrupt , and criminal enterprise .
ACORN lost critical funding , suffered widespread opprobrium , and its employees received waves of violent threats as a result of these false and inaccurate portrayals .
A report by the Congressional Research Service , commissioned by the House Judiciary Committee , also concluded , as did Harshbarger , that ACORN did not violate any laws vis a vis the O'Keefe affair , although a number of state laws against secret wiretapping were likely violated by O'Keefe .
http://judiciary.house.gov/news/091222.html .
And yet , the New York Times has failed and even refused to find the truth and the facts " fit to print . "
VR calls on the " paper of record " to issue a retraction and apologize to the American public , ACORN and the U.S. Congress .
Moreover , VR calls on the Times to launch a full investigation and provide readers with an explanation of how its own editorial failures allowed such a serious and damaging error to be repeatedly reported in the face of conclusive evidence to the contrary .

“ Sharing Food , ” a series by A&E , hopes to bring together students and their own cultural cuisines to discuss their recipes and stories , letting no meal go unshared .
Many economists still argue that the Great Recession was just like all the others , except a bit bigger .
Here 's why they 're wrong .
Check out the number of people unemployed more than 26 weeks ( expressed below as a percentage of the population ) .
Even if the recovery continues and the number of the long - term unemployed finally stops rising , it will likely take a decade or more for this group to shrink to normal levels .
Americans who fail to pay the penalty for not buying insurance would face legal action from the Internal Revenue Service , according to the Joint Committee on Taxation .
The remarks Thursday from the committee 's chief of staff , Thomas Barthold , seems to further weaken President Barack Obama 's contention last week that the individual mandate penalty , which could go as high as $ 1,900 , is not a tax increase .
Under questioning from Sen. John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) , Barthold said the IRS would " take you to court and undertake normal collection proceedings . "
Ensign pursued the line of questioning because he said a lot of Americans do n't believe the Constitution allows the government to mandate the purchase of insurance .
" We could be subjecting those very people who conscientiously , because they believe in the U.S. Constitution , we could be subjecting them to fines or the interpretation of a judge , all the way up to imprisonment , " Ensign said .
" That seems to me to be a problem . "
Ensign 's argument , however , was n't persuasive to the committee -- which rejected an amendment from Sen. Jim Bunning ( R - Ky. ) to eliminate the individual mandate .
Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) was the only Republican to vote with Democrats to preserve the mandate .

Some women seem to get turned on by almost anything man - on - women action , man - on - man , woman - on - woman , animal - on - animal , and so on .
This is what sex researchers find when studying sexual arousal .
When female volunteers are asked to watch erotic movies while outfitted with a plethysmograph , an instrument for measuring blood flow to the vagina , they often get very hot and bothered “ down there . ”
Problem is , when many of those same women are asked to report how aroused they actually feel “ up there ” they often say they ’re not turned on at all .
Sometimes they even say they ’re repulsed .
So what ’s going on ?
Do women even know what turns them on ?
Such is the puzzle that has plagued sex researchers for decades .
And it ’s a topic clinical psychologist Meredith Chivers and her colleagues address in a recent study , a meta - analysis of 132 papers on the genital measures of sexual arousal .
Why do n’t women ’s genital and subjective responses always agree ?
Here are a few theories the researchers present :
Women ’s genital responses are hidden from view and produce less prominent somatosensory cues .
While men may get turned on by feeling themselves get erect , women do not .
However , [ studies have found that ] even when women received feedback about their level of vaginal engorgement , correlations ( between genital and subjective arousal ) were low and statistically nonsignificant .
[ Being told we ’re getting turned on does n’t necessarily turn us on . ]
Women may edit their self - report of feeling sexually aroused because of socially desirable responding .
Positive affect directs attention to erotic stimuli , thereby increasing sexual response , whereas negative affect interferes in the processing of sexual cues , resulting in lower sexual response .
Lower concordance among women may reflect their experience of negative affect while watching the
conventional , commercially available erotica that is primarily produced for men .
Interestingly , the authors suggest that genital response to sexual stimuli may be an evolved self - protection mechanism :
Female genital response is an automatic reflex that is elicited by sexual stimuli and produces vaginal lubrication , even if the woman does not subjectively feel sexually aroused …
Female genital response entails increased genital vasocongestion , necessary for the production of vaginal lubrication , and can , in turn , reduce discomfort and the possibility of injury during vaginal penetration .
Ancestral women who did not show an automatic vaginal response to sexual cues may have been more likely to experience injuries that resulted in illness , infertility , or even death subsequent to unexpected or unwanted vaginal penetration , and thus would be less likely to have passed on this trait to their offspring ….
Reports of women ’s genital response and orgasm during sexual assaults suggests that genital responses do occur in women under conditions of sexual threat .
That women can experience genital response during unwanted sex or when viewing depictions of sexual assault suggests that women ’s vasocongestion response is automatically initiated by exposure to sexual stimuli , whether or not these stimuli are preferred , and without subjective appraisal of these stimuli as sexually arousing or desired .
During processing of sexual stimuli , brain areas associated with emotional inhibition are activated among women …
Genital responses are not affected by involuntary inhibition involving the anterior cingulate cortex , but subjective responses are .
[ Incidentally , women ’s anterior cingulate cortex is most active when we ’re ovulating and attracted to macho , high - testosterone men .
The ACC is activated when you ’re in conflict about something .
Is this also a self - protection mechanism warning us to proceed with caution ? ]
Bottom line : Physical arousal is no proof a woman is really turned on .
To really get a woman hot and bothered , you have to start from the top .
Students and faculty at University of North Carolina , Charlotte called for the removal of John Bogdan from his position as the associate vice chancellor for safety and security .
American Association of University Professors chapter president John Cox said Bogdan 's hiring " had already prompted us , a lot of professors , to get together and begin to talk about the serious and deep problems at the university , as central problems of democracy and of what kind of a university is this that hires someone who presided over the Guantanamo Prison Camp for two years ? " he said .
( Home to the author of the ' Torture Memos ' UC Berkeley comes to mind . )
" Why would the university even seek to hire someone , why would they be attracted to someone with that resume ? "

The Collapse of Sovereign Government Bonds The Next Financial Crisis Contagion
The next contagion is beginning to spread around the globe .
It is unexpected on Wall Street , misunderstood in Washington — and very dangerous .
It could sabotage the plans of the U.S. Treasury , the Federal Reserve , and many of their counterparts overseas .
It is …
The Collapse of Sovereign Government Bonds
This is certainly not the first financial contagion of recent memory :
Back in 1997 , we witnessed a currency contagion — hatched in Thailand , spreading quickly to the rest of Southeast Asia … smacking Russia in the gut … and sinking a major player in the U.S. derivatives market .
Then , 10 years later , came the debt contagion — incubated in a subsector of America ’s mortgage market … soon infecting nearly all credit instruments … striking Wall Street like a sledgehammer … and mortally wounding the global financial system .
Those contagions were bad enough .
Now , however , the contagion is beginning at a much higher level , in the most important financial instruments on Earth — long - term bonds issued by sovereign governments .
The Saga Begins in Greece
Just 116 days ago , on October 8 , Greece ’s benchmark 10 - year bond was selling for 112.295 .
Today , it has collapsed to 92.13 .
And the drama of its yield surge is even more striking — from only 4.41 percent to 7.14 percent , a jump of more than 60 percent in less than four months .
Coincidentally , I was in Greece not long ago , visiting the origins of Western democracy .
If a local soothsayer had told me that the next global debt contagion would begin there , blocks away from the Pantheon , I would have been incredulous .
Yet that is precisely what has just happened in recent weeks .
Already , this contagion is spreading to other countries …
Portugal ’s 10 - year government bond reached a peak on December 1 , 2009 , just 62 days ago .
And now it has also started to plunge virtually nonstop , with its biggest declines registered late last week .
British government bonds ( gilts ) are equally vulnerable .
Sovereign bonds in Spain , Japan , and other major deficit nations are also starting to get hit .
Next Victim : U.S. Government Bonds
In the global competition for investor funds , U.S. Treasuries are typically viewed as the “ least ugly . ”
So global investors have usually been willing to pay a relatively higher price for them , grudgingly accepting lower yields .
This helps explain why U.S. government bonds have not been among the first targets of the contagion .
But that does not protect them from becoming one of the next targets .
Indeed …
The U.S. government suffers from the same , or worse , underlying disease as Greece , Portugal , or any other victim of the contagion — massive , out - of - control federal deficits .
America ’s red ink was $ 1.4 trillion last year and ANOTHER $ 1.4 trillion this year .
Washington has buried its head in the same mound of sand as Athens and Lisbon — grossly underestimating ( a ) the size of the deficit , ( b ) its potential impact on investor confidence , and ( c ) the speed by which its bond prices can fall .
Like his counterparts in Athens and Lisbon , President Obama ignored advisors who warned of a deficit disaster and has only just begun to seriously consider deficit - reduction measures .
And yet he continues to avoid steps that can make a significant difference .
Specifically …
The president supports a commission to study deficit reduction ( rejected by the Senate last week ) … but the commission ’s recommendations would be nonbinding with no clear process in place for implementation .
The president has proposed a freeze on some domestic spending , but the freeze will impact only a small portion of the budget , would not kick in until next year , and would include a mix of spending cuts and spending increases .
It would have zero impact on the 2010 deficit and little impact on future deficits .
The president has promised to give TARP funds back to taxpayers , but has also proposed applying unspent TARP money to community bank lending — another lost deficit - reduction opportunity .
The president supports “ pay as you go ” rules for Congress — requiring new spending to be balanced against spending cuts or revenue increases .
But the devil is in the details .
If the rules have no truly sharp teeth , they will be ineffective .
My view :
If the deficit was just $ 200 billion or even $ 300 billion , I might support and even applaud these small steps .
But in the context of back - to - back $ 1.4 trillion deficits and in the face of a looming bond market collapse , they represent barely more than too - little - too - late tinkering .
The Consequence of This Complacency Is Catastrophe
Sadly , although most advisors on the Obama team are now more conscious of the rising political tide against Washington bailouts and deficits , they not yet see the approaching tsunami arriving from Greece .
Money and Markets ’ Mike Larson explains the situation this way :
“ Imagine what would happen if Uncle Sam ’s borrowing costs shot up like they have in Greece — by 60 percent !
Imagine what that would mean for the cost of car loans , mortgages , and other products whose rates track Treasury yields !
And imagine the impact on an economy still struggling to recover from the Great Recession !
This is the next big story that few people are talking about . ”
He ’s right and he has been warning about it tirelessly .
But , alas , unless the Obama administration and Congress can somehow ax the budget or find a new gusher of revenues — both extremely unlikely anytime soon — collapsing U.S. bond prices and sharply higher long - term interest rates are unavoidable .
Like we saw during the contagions of 1997 - 98 and 2007 - 09 …
Confidence in vulnerable investments — this time , long - term U.S. government securities — will suddenly collapse .
Then , it was certain geographical regions or market niches .
Now it ’s threatening the CORE of our national essence .
Investors will yank their money out in great haste …
The avalanche of selling will drive ALL bond prices — government , corporate , and municipal — into an uncontrollable swan dive .
And …
The contagion will spread to any country on the planet that has the same obvious vulnerability to the disease — massive federal deficits .
There is , however , one outstanding silver lining in this new crisis : Sinking government bond prices — bringing surging costs for government borrowing — are the single most powerful market mechanisms for persuading governments to end their print - and - spend madness .
Provided we do n’t fall again for the false promises of politicians — and provided we are willing , as a nation , to make the needed sacrifices — there IS still hope for America .
That ’s one reason I do n’t recommend you abandon the safety of Treasury securities .
Rather , all along , I ’ve made it clear the real concern is not with ALL Treasury securities .
It ’s strictly with longer term Treasuries .
The other reason is that shorter term Treasury notes ( under a couple of years in maturity ) are far , far less vulnerable than the longer term variety .
And U.S. Treasury bills ( always shorter than one year ) suffer virtually no price declines , even in the midst of a bond market collapse .
So stick with them .
Yes , I know .
Their yield is miserably low .
But they still provide the world ’s best safety and liquidity .
Just make sure you avoid all longer term notes and bonds — whether government - issued or not .
When the market price of bonds declines , so does your principal value .
And because of that loss in principal , any extra interest they might pay you could be wiped out in a heartbeat .
Good luck and God bless !

A federal law taking effect Monday may alter the standard checklist for many Americans as they pack to visit their national parks : insect repellent , snacks , hiking boots . . . double - barreled shotgun .
Visitors now can pack heat in any national park from Gates of the Arctic to Everglades , provided they comply with the firearms laws of the park ’s home state , according to the new law that was passed as an amendment to credit - card legislation .
In some instances , they may carry concealed and loaded firearms , including at campsites in Yosemite Valley , along trails at Yellowstone and at the rim of the Grand Canyon .
Gun advocates welcomed the law as overdue , saying firearms are allowed in national forests and other federal lands , many of which are next to national parks .
Advertisement
But opponents say guns do n’t belong in the nation ’s highly protected parks , where it remains illegal to fire a weapon or kill an animal and where employees , including most rangers , are unarmed .
The presence of guns , they say , could increase the chance of deadly accidents and up the ante in confrontations between park visitors or between visitors and wildlife .
The law , passed by Congress in May , reverses 94 years of National Park Service policy that generally allowed visitors to transport unloaded , disassembled weapons in the trunks of their cars .
It applies not only to national parks , but also to national wildlife refuges .
Weapons wo n’t be allowed in buildings where federal employees work , such as the Statue of Liberty and park visitors centers .
But restaurants , hotels and gift shops will be subject to the new gun law .
Yosemite ’s historic
Ahwahnee hotel , for example , must allow visitors who are legally entitled to carry weapons to bring them into the building .

Gun-rights advocates are planning to mark the occasion by holding weapon - toting cookouts at Gettysburg , Valley Forge and other parks .
Bill Wade , chairman of the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees and a former park superintendent , said some of the changes will be nuanced .
“ I do n’t expect that there ’s going to be hordes of people going into parks on Monday with rifles slung over their shoulders , ” he said .
Mike Stollenwerk , co-founder of OpenCarry.org , which advocates legally carrying holstered handguns in public , said the law opens 85 million acres of the country where gun owners say they have felt unwelcome .

“ Now it ’s a big sea of gun freedom , ” Stollenwerk said .
“ The idea is that the same rule that applies on Main Street will apply to the national park .
We will have a uniform federal rule that will make it easier for everyone to know the rule . ”
Critics , however , say there are as many potential complications as there are state and local gun laws .
David Barna , a National Park Service spokesman , said park websites are providing some guidance to visitors , but it is the responsibility of each gun owner to understand the laws of the state they are visiting .
That could confuse visitors at the more than 30 national parks that span more than one state .
The Appalachian Trail crosses 14 states .
And though Yellowstone is mostly in Wyoming , parts of the world ’s first national park also straddle the borders of Montana and Idaho , each of which has different weapons laws .
Advertisement
Implementing the law will be particularly hard in California , which has more national park units than any other state and some of the nation ’s most restrictive firearms laws .
State law generally prohibits possession of concealed and loaded weapons , although local law enforcement agencies can issue concealed - carry permits , and carrying a loaded weapon may be allowed in some unincorporated areas .
Officials are scrambling to fully comprehend how the law will play out at national park units in California , from Redwood and Presidio , to Death Valley and Joshua Tree .
“ Many of the details of the law are unknown at this time , ” said Deputy California Atty .
Gen. Alison Merrilees .
“ It wo n’t be crystal clear the day the law goes into effect . ”

The park service is restrained from taking a position on legislation , but an array of law enforcement groups and retired park employees oppose it .
Critics fear that looser rules on guns could encourage wildlife poaching and increase destruction of historic or cultural resources .
Shooting cactuses , signs and structures is common on other federal lands .
Opponents say the law ratchets up the potential for violence in parks , where for seven consecutive years rangers have been the most assaulted federal law enforcement officers , according to data compiled by the park service .
Major crimes reported in 2008 were at the lowest level since at least 1995 , according to park service statistics .
There were 1,844 weapons - related offenses reported in national parks last year .
Advertisement
Lesser offenses are on the rise , however , including the common offense of car clouting : breaking into vehicles left in parking lots for long periods .
“ What do we do when a person does the right thing , and leaves his gun locked in the car when he goes into the visitors ’ center and someone steals the gun ? ” said John Waterman , a ranger at Valley Forge National Historic Park .
Bill Wade , of the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees , worries about law - abiding gun owners who may not be accustomed to camping in wild places .
“ The single biggest threat is the situation that ’s going to occur in campgrounds , where you have inexperienced people , who do n’t know much about parks , who are out of their element , ” Wade said .
“ You are sleeping under the trees and you hear a noise .
You look out of the tent and see a shape and start firing .

“ It changes the dynamic in parks .
People go there to feel safe and secure , to get away from the stuff they face every day where they live . ”

The photo above was taken in 2007 and shows a portion of what was to become the world ’s largest sand painting , situated in the Town Hall square of La Orotava in Tenerife .
When completed , the enormous creation covered an area of 9?250.7 ft² and remained in place for the duration of the town ’s Corpus Christi celebrations , a beautifully creative tradition which has taken place on an annual basis for generations .
However the gigantic sand painting above is just one part of the festivities which are planned meticulously during the months preceding the Christian feast .
Using a combination of naturally coloured sand and millions of flower petals , the narrow streets of the town are covered with patterns and pictures by the locals to form a network of what is known as Las Alfombras de Corpus ( The Corpus Rugs ) .
Fortunately the weather is fairly predictable as the sand and petals are free to blow away at any moment due to the lack of adhesives used and on the day of the ceremony the decorated streets are walked on by the procession , all traces of the locals ’ artistic efforts brushed away in a fraction of the time taken to painstakingly place them there initially .
The artwork attracts thousands of people from all around the world , but surprisingly The Corpus Rugs are still relatively unknown to foreigners , even to the majority of tourists who visit Tenerife on a regular basis and find themselves visiting the same tourist traps year after year .
The next time you visit Tenerife be sure to make a detour and visit this beautiful part of the Island .
It ’s a perfect way to see a local tradition in full swing and to witness a community pulling together to create something incredibly unique and beautiful .

This week US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited the Gulf States in an attempt to gather support for more severe sanctions against Iran .
Her meetings in Saudi Arabia were aimed at putting pressure on Riyadh to use its influence with China in order to get it to support the sanctions .
What Everyone 's Talking About Israeli UN envoy : China ' a mystery ' on Iran sanctions AFP Ambassador Shalev says if Security Council wo n't agree on new sanctions for Tehran , individual world powers will have to team up outside Council to punish Iran economically Israeli UN envoy : China ' a mystery ' on Iran sanctions
But it remains to be seen whether Saudi pressure or oil benefits it is able to give Beijing will convince China to toe the line on sanctions , as in recent years the country has increased trade with Iran and its economic interests are now firmly bound to those of the Islamic Republic .
For example , Iran currently exports 448,000 barrels of oil a day to China , which amounts to 15 % of the gross .
Trade volume between the two countries has reached at least $ 36.5 billion , the Iran - China Chamber of Commerce reported , which makes Beijing Tehran 's biggest trading partner .
Iran mainly imports consumer goods and machinery from China .
The rise in commerce between the partners was made possible by Western countries ' abandonment of the oil - rich country due to the sanctions imposed on it .
For example , a Chinese firm has replaced France 's Total in a widespread natural gas project in southern Iran .
In total , China has earmarked $ 50 billion in investments in Iranian gas and oil , of which $ 35 billion has already been invested .
Yin Gang , an expert on Iran at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , offers another explanation for China 's reluctance in imposing sanctions – namely Beijing 's concern that they will go too far , ultimately harming the flourishing economic ties .
" China has economic and trade relations with Iran , so it 's natural that China would not want to see regional security and its own national interests affected due to excessive sanctions , " Yin said .
In addition , Beijing believes past measures to punish Iran have been largely ineffective , said retired diplomat Hua Liming .
" China and the international community have all seen that the sanctions have not changed Iran 's decision to carry on the nuclear program , " Hua said .
" On the contrary , sanctions will take the already complex and tense situation in the Middle East to a more dangerous stage , which is something China does not wish to see , " he said .

Casinos are a psychological minefield .
Their architectural design , as well as everything in it , has a methodical function devised to keep you , the player , inside spending your money .
Some tactics they use are as conspicuous as the nose on your face , while others are guile and subtle .
However , they all play on the players ’ psyche and make them feel comfortable , wanted , and most of all , optimistic .
Following are ten maneuvers casinos use that keep them rolling in our money .
10 No Clocks
It ’s surprising that a lot of people really do n’t wear watches .
Casinos know this and are n’t about to assist people in keeping them punctual .
It ’s a fact that when someone is engaged in an activity time seemingly drifts by at a faster pace for them , and you will rarely see humans more engaged than in a casino .
Whether it be at a slot machine , table game , or poker table , most are in a trance - like state while chasing their dreams .
With no clocks adorning casino walls it is not difficult to simply let time slip away deep into the night without a care in the world .
Do n’t expect to get the time from dealers either since they are told not to wear watches for this very reason .
Day melds into night and night into day and schedules dissolve into nothingness .
Add that to the fact that if you ’re in a casino you are most likely on vacation , and that contributes to the indifferent attitude you may have about sticking to your standard routine and spend more time than you had planned repeatedly slapping dollar bills down .
Some casinos , likes those in the UK , have passed laws saying that players must be aware of how much time they have spent gambling , and the casino must encourage taking breaks from playing .
9 No Windows
In most casinos there may be windows near the entrance or exit , but once you get inside the belly of the beast you will be hard up to see any .
This tactic goes hand - in - hand with having no clocks .
When they get you in , they do n’t want you to have any inkling of what is occurring in the outside world .
If you were to see it getting dark outside , or even getting light with the dawn , your internal clock would kick in and tell you it ’s time to move on and do something else , like go to sleep .
However , this will tear you away from gambling and the casino can’t have that .
In addition , they do n’t want you to see anything remotely interesting happening outside .
If you ’re playing in a casino on the Las Vegas strip , there is enough visual stimulation outside to draw anyone ’s eye to it .
Therefore , the casino you are in will do its best to make that outside world nonexistent .
8 Lights , Sounds and Activity
A casino is a cacophony of wonderful and alluring stimulation : bells ringing , siren - like lights flashing , change clanging , slot wheels whirring , digital sounds beeping – it ’s all captivating .
Why is it captivating ?
Because it ’s non-verbal communication saying , “ Win ! Win! Win ! ” .
It gives the impression that everyone is indeed winning when , in reality , most are losing .
However , even as these people are losing , whatever machine they are on is still blaring out festive , euphoric sounds .
It makes people want to get in on the action and become part of the winning as well .
It ’s such a happy place , how can I lose ?!
Everything is slick , burnished , and gleaming with a hypnotic draw to it .
On some level , everyone , regardless if they are a big or small bettor , is attracted to these ostentatious displays of excess and flamboyance .
7 Ambience
Ever notice how the lighting in a casino is low and mellow ?
This is to give it a homey , friendly feel , kind of like sitting on your couch in your living room at home – and who wants to get off of their comfortable couch ?
Harsh lighting can be grating to the eyes , but a more subdued motif allows gamblers to settle in , kick back , and enjoy themselves while feeling safe , secure , and cozy .
Also , the carpeting in casinos is n’t just picked out randomly .
Many may say that the patterns and designs on these carpets are downright tacky , with colorful swirls , lines , and splashes being the norm .
However , to the human brain they are mesmerizing , welcoming and pleasing to the eye .
In addition , the color of the walls is often times red which studies say evokes a safe , comfortable feeling .
And like shopping malls and stores , the soundtracks played at casinos are always soft , easing , and mollifying which helps get the gambler in the trance - like state that is desired .
Related to this category is the cleanliness of casinos .
Any reputable one will be spotless with no clutter or waste in sight .
Workers continually sweep and pick up after players which makes them feel somewhat pampered and catered to , as well as gives them a pleasing environment in which they want to stay .
6 Location of Services
If you want to use the restroom , get something to eat , or cash out your chips , you must burrow yourself deeper into the bowels of the casino .
Often , these services are wedged as far back as possible .
This is a last - ditch effort to keep you inside since you have to walk through the whole place again and pass all of those tempting machines and tables .
You have just cashed in your winnings and perhaps you may want to try your luck one last time before leaving .
It ’s the same principle stores use in hopes of getting a customer to make that last impulse buy during that long walk to the exit .
In larger casino / hotels , the casino is buried deep inside the building itself .
Taking various escalators , stairs , etc. is the only way to get to and from it and is one way to keep you on the property .
5 Near Wins
Next to actually winning , nothing gets your adrenaline pumping like nearly winning and the realization that you almost took money from the casino .
But if casinos gave out money to everyone who almost won , they would be broke after one day .
Every game , whether it be a table or machine , is designed to payout small wins in the short run , but eventually take more from you in the long run .
Slot machines constantly make small payouts while perpetually being one cherry or star away from the big jackpot .
Players always win hands at blackjack which gives them the impression that the game is winnable , but the house edge is always grinding away at their bankroll and their money slowly dissipates .
Other games give the gambler a feeling of “ control ” such as craps or keno .
Here , the player has a direct influence on the outcome , such as throwing the dice or picking their own numbers .
This is yet another ploy that gives the player a false sense that they can beat a game and therefore will cause them to play longer .
Basically , players overestimate their chances and probability of winning .
Near wins are what essentially keep casinos in business .
Giving players a taste of winning will almost always guarantee that they visit again .
4 Freebies
Free or reduced services , otherwise known as comps , are another lifeblood of the casino .
Players will often receive coupons for free meals , buffets , shows , etc. , or point cards which enable them to win other prizes in order to get them to keep coming back .
It makes them feel important , even if they are low rollers and do n’t gamble substantial sums of money .
Even if they lose , they still feel as if they have gained something and are more likely to return .
They are important to the casinos because the vast majority of money made comes from these smaller gamblers , so their business is even more coveted than the high rollers ’ .
Are they simply being good hosts to their patrons ?
Not really .
It ’s all calculated to keep them there so they play more and longer .
Whatever casinos give out in comps , they make back hundreds - fold from the same people .
It ’s sort of like persuading a child to behave well in exchange for a cheap toy .
3 Alcohol
This could have gone under the freebies category but deserves to be discussed independently .
It ’s as obvious and transparent a trick as freebies but may be the most powerful .
Free drinks work on a couple of levels .
First , they ’re FREE .
Unless you ’re a teetotaler , who does n’t love free drinks ?
Cocktail waitresses swarm the casino floor , their trays full of various drinks at all times .
It ’s no secret why this would keep a player put , satisfied , and feeling cheerful .
Next , alcohol makes even smart players sloppy .
If you ’re a player who uses basic strategy in blackjack , alcohol will slow your brain therefore corrupting your ability to make the proper decisions .
Gamblers will also become more liberal with their money if buzzed or drunk , throwing their chips around like they ’re nothing more than the pieces of clay that they are .
To many , sucking down free drinks while playing enjoyable games is pretty much as good as it gets .
2 Keeping the Big Winners
Although small bettors are important , casinos surely want to keep the high rollers as well .
Those fortunate enough to win big are treated like kings .
They basically make these players offers they cannot refuse , from free suites to extravagant , special treatment .
The longer a big winner lingers inside the casino / hotel , the more money they will inevitably spend there .
The casino may lose money giving away a free suite or room , but by keeping that person there they can make it back in the casino ; the house edge ensures that .
Players feel like they are treated like royalty because they are important , yet it ’s their MONEY that is important .
In addition to keeping the money there , casinos are also gaining free advertising and marketing when other high rollers learn how they will be treated at that particular establishment .
Pandering to big winners is so crucial for casinos that a large part of their resources , from VIP hosts to limousines , is dedicated to it .
1 Labyrinth Design
Casinos are essentially giant mazes that are intentionally set up for you to literally get lost in .
A sea of machines and tables create obstacles and barriers that keep the player from leaving .
There is no logical arrangement ; a bank of slot machines may be in one location , then another bank of the exact same machines will be 200 feet away .
Confusion is the end result .
You know the exit was near the video poker machines , but which set of video poker machines ?
Nooks and crannies abound with various twists and turns .
This plays on the common mental error people make when they mistakenly believe that if they walk in along a certain path , they can easily turn around and walk out the same way .
However , the path leading out is unfamiliar because visually it is completely different .
The tall slot machines which make up most of the floor layout also hinder people from seeing far which further disorients them .
Moreover , more modern casinos have lower ceilings which prevent someone from seeing any landmarks on the walls or ceiling in the distance that may help orient them , but instead keep them hemmed in .
For many , especially those who have been imbibing alcohol , finding their way out is like participating in one , large , interactive brain teaser .
New Year , New Laws
Well , so much for a happy new year .
As the year 2010 rushed in , so did numerous laws that took effect .
There were 40,697 new legislatures passed by the 50 US states , the District of Columbia , Guam , the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico .
Some went in effect during New Year ’s Day , January 1 , in about 30 states .
Some of the laws are serious while some are open for “ interpretations ” .
Here are some samples :
In New Hampshire , same sex marriages will be allowed .
Physical therapists can get certified to practice on animals .
In Texas , college freshmen and transfer students will need to be vaccinated against bacterial meningitis before they can live on campus .
Smoke detectors will need to be able to alert a hearing - impaired person if requested by a tenant .
Teenagers cannot use a tanning bed unless accompanied by an adult .
In North Carolina , smoking gets banned in bars and restaurants .
The state is the largest tobacco producer in the country .
In Kentucky , payday borrowers will be restricted to two loans of no more than $ 500 at a time , and payday lenders face tougher penalties if they lend to someone who has reached the maximum .
In Oregon , children under age 16 are required to wear a seat belt on any ATV or vehicle on public property , and will increase the fine for people riding a motorcycle without a helmet to $ 720 .
In Montana , insurance companies will be required to provide coverage for autism - spectrum disorders .
These signs are spotted in the streets of Manhattan , Miami , Los Angeles , Detroit , Philadelphia and Williamsburg USA .
They are made by TrustoCorp , but who the people are behind this name is unknown .
Very clever , some are hardhitting , others are hilarious .
At least it will give passers something to think about .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - France said on Wednesday it would support a ban on global trade in bluefin tuna , but after an 18 - month delay , bowing to pressure from the fishing lobby to hold off an immediate decision on the giant fish .
France , Italy and Spain account for half of the world ’s total allowable catch of bluefin tuna .
Environmentalists such as Greenpeace called the delay “ absurd ” and said it could lead to the extinction of the fish that is prized by sushi lovers .
“ Asking for 18 months to implement this measure equates to waiting until there is no more bluefin tuna before acting , ” Greenpeace said in a statement .
“ The government is buying peace with the fishermen at a time of regional elections . ”
Monaco has proposed protecting bluefin tuna , which can fetch up to $ 100,000 in Japan , by listing it under appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) .
France did not expect a ban to come into effect before September 2011 , Environment Minister Jean - Louis Borloo said on Wednesday , adding the CITES committee needed the results of a scientific study on stocks before taking a decision in July 2011 .
“ There is still powerful international lobbying from a big country , which has allies , ” he said , referring to Japan , where 80 percent of the catch is exported .
The European Union failed to make progress on bluefin tuna last year , with Greek Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas and Maltese Fisheries Commissioner Joe Borg deadlocked over how far the EU should go to protect the fish .
EU diplomats expect to see faster progress this year under newly nominated Greek Fisheries Commissioner Maria Damanaki .
French Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Wednesday that France would call on the European Commission to compensate fishermen for lost revenues should the ban be imposed .
Fishermen ’s representatives called the French position “ incoherent ” ahead of the regional elections in March .
“ The government is really in a messy position , ” said Francois Wendling , head of a fishermen ’s trade association in Sete in southern France .
“ If waiting for scientific studies is so important , why is the government giving a position now ?
This is purely political . ”
President Nicolas Sarkozy said last year he favoured a clear trade ban on bluefin tuna .
Asked if the government would stand by its position if fishermen decided to block ports as they did in Marseille last April , Le Maire said :
“ French fishermen are reasonable people .
But what makes them angry is when rules do not apply to everyone .
France will ask for reinforced sanctions against countries which do not respect them ( bluefin tuna fishing quotas ) . ”
There are about 200 tuna boats in France , but only 28 are so - called “ purse - seiners , ” 40 - meter long high - tech boats which account for 90 percent of all French catch .
Traditional fishing for domestic markets will remain possible , Le Maire said .

Australia 's fifth - largest city could be reliant on bottled water as early as next week as overuse and drought stretch the Murray river to its limit
The water in Australia 's biggest river is running so low and is so salty that the nation 's fifth - largest city , Adelaide , is at risk of having to ship water in to its residents , politicians have warned .
Adelaide 's water crisis follows similar problems in cities around the world , as the combination of growing population , increasing agricultural use and global warming stretches resources to the limit .
Experts are warning of permanent drought in many regions .
Salinity levels in some stretches of the Murray river already exceed the World Health Organisation 's ( WHO ) recommendations for safe drinking , and South Australia 's water authority and 11 rural townships east of Adelaide have been told to prepare for the worst .
" Another dry year will deplete our reservoirs and the water in the Murray will become too saline to drink .
We are talking about 1.3 million people , who are not far off becoming reliant on bottled water .
We are talking a national emergency , " said South Australian MP David Winderlich .
As early as next week , water from parts of the river may become too dangerous to drink , which would require the water authority to begin delivering supplies to hospitals , clinics , aged care facilities and local supermarkets in plastic bottles , said Winderlich .
" There 's simply too many people pulling water out of the river , " said Roger Strother , Coorong council mayor .
" We 've been saying that one day it would catch up , and this summer is when it is going to happen .
It could be next week . "
Recent rains have topped up Adelaide 's dams , but only enough for one year , and the Murray - Darling Basin Authority , which oversees water use across the whole of south - east Australia , says water levels in reservoirs are much lower than expected .
Today the authority said the whole basin was at 25 % capacity .
Australia 's worst drought in a century has lasted over 10 years in places , and many cities have had to restrict water use .
Climate experts fear the continent faces a permanently drier future as the impact of global warming kicks in .
South Australians have watched the waters stagnate as farmers , especially cotton and rice growers upstream , siphoned up to 83 % of the water from the river system .
The WHO says the acceptable level of salinity for safe drinking water is 800 EC ( electrical conductivity ) units but the salinity in parts of the Murray is now around 1,200 EC units .
The water authority says it will begin shipping water when the salinity rises to 1,400 EC units .
Adelaide is one of many cities around the world facing acute water shortages as populations grow , long - term droughts continue and ground water is not replenished .
The Chinese water minister , Chen Lei , today told engineers at a water conference that two - thirds of Chinese cities now face serious shortages due to rapid industrialisation and climate change .
" Compared to 1956 - 79 , the average rainfall has dropped 6 % in three major river basins , " Lei said .
" Most parts in the north of China are now facing water shortages problems , especially because of the increasing influence of climate change and the faster speed of industrialisation and urbanisation . "
By 2015 , Lei said , water efficiency would have to be increased by 30 % .
" Water abstraction must be strictly controlled .
We should have strict management of groundwater exploitation and consumption , put a limit on total use of groundwater , and ban or set quotas on groundwater exploitation .
Nearly two out of three cities are facing water shortages , and the farmland affected by drought reaches nearly 15 m sq km a year . "
According to a new UN environment programme report , perennial drought conditions are developing in south - eastern Australia and south - western North America .
" Projections suggest that persistent water scarcity will increase in a number of regions in coming years , including southern and northern Africa , the Mediterranean , much of the Middle East , a broad band in central Asia and the Indian subcontinent , " the report said .
" There is growing concern that thresholds or tipping points may now be reached in a matter of years or a few decades , including dramatic changes to the Indian subcontinent 's monsoon rains , the Sahara and west Africa monsoons , and climate systems affecting the Amazon rainforest , " it said .
Hopes in some countries that an El Niño weather event would bring rain to parched areas of the US this week declined as the US government climate prediction centre said temperatures in the equatorial Pacific had stopped climbing .
During strong El Niños , abnormally warm waters in that region pump heat and moisture into the atmosphere , which leads to intense storms .
Cities around the world under water stress
Beijing : Most of Beijing 's water comes from the Miyun reservoir , but a decade of drought and huge population increase has left extreme shortages .
Water diversion projects are helping , but this is depleting resources from other regions .
The city must spend $ 3.5 bn ( £ 2.2 bn ) in the next five years to cope with a population expected to rise to 17 million .
Nairobi :
The city has imposed water rationing , following an acute drought that has affected all Kenya 's water catchment areas .
River and reservoirs are at historically low levels .
Flower farms and export - oriented agriculture are also reducing supplies available to people .
Mexico City : 2009 has been the driest year recorded in the city of 19 million people .
Water is rationed and many areas have no piped water for days at a time .
The government has imposed fines of up to $ 1,200 for hosing down cars and sidewalks or watering lawns during daytime hours .
Signs warn that the city could run out of water next spring unless residents switch to low - flow showers and toilets , and plug leaks .
Gaza :
Water fit for human use will run out in the Gaza strip within 10 years , the Gaza Coastal Municipal Water Utility and UN agencies said this month .
Tap water is already salty , and only 5 - 10 % of groundwater is drinkable .
Gaza 's population is expected to increase to 3 million by 2025 .
Kathmandu : Erratic rainfall and drier winters have left Nepal 's capital very short of water .
The water company can provide only 160 m litres a day but the demand is well over 200 m litres .
Many households are drilling their own boreholes to extract groundwater with electric pumps , but the water table is sinking approximately 2.5 metres a year and this is not sustainable in the medium term .
The first clinical trials for smoked marijuana in more than two decades show that the drug is effective in relieving pain and reducing muscular spasms from multiple sclerosis .
The five studies , four published and one under review for publication , are just the first of 14 that have been funded by a California state program and undertaken at the University of California .
After years of debate , does this new research prove once and for all that pot has medical value ?
It 's settled — marijuana is medicine : Look , five separate U.C. studies found that marijuana can ease pain caused by a host of injuries and diseases , says Dennis Romero in LA Weekly .
Pot has " medicinal value , " end of the story .
This is welcome confirmation that California and other states were right to go against the grain and legalize the medicinal use of cannabis .
" Medical marijuana does a body good ( if you 're in pain ) "
This " over - hyped " report proves nothing : " It should come as no surprise that ingesting marijuana makes people feel good , " says physician Peter Lipson in Forbes .
But " marijuana has many negative effects , such as addiction and withdrawal . "
So it 's wrong to use this " incomplete and over - hyped " research of pot 's alleged benefits to justify its " premature use as a drug . "
" Medical marijuana : An over - hyped drug "
It 's a good first step :
There 's always been plenty of controversy surrounding medical marijuana , say the editors of the San Francisco Chronicle , " but little science . "
So the U.C. - backed research , " partial as it is , is welcome . "
These findings reinforce the White House decision to ease up on medical marijuana crackdowns — and the " humane " thing to do is to leave patients alone until scientists can deliver " the final word " on " the weed 's worth . "
" A win for marijuana research "

“ The colonial state died .
The new pluri-national , autonomous , and solidarity - based state is being born , ” asserted President Evo Morales at his inauguration January 22 , after being elected along with Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera to a new five year term .
Morales made a pledge to “ liberation heroes ” rather than to a deity .
A giant portrait of martyred indigenous hero Túpac Katari served as backdrop to the festivities .
Bolivia ’s first indigenous president won re-election in December with a 64 percent plurality .
In previous elections he defeated a recall referendum in 2008 with 67 percent of the vote , and won his election as president in December 2005 with 53.7 percent .
Divisions of race , class and wealth made these stunning victories all the more remarkable .
Under the new constitution approved last year by a 62 percent majority vote , the “ Bolivian Republic ” became the “ pluri-national and communitarian Bolivian state . ”
Congress was renamed the Pluri-national Legislative Assembly .
Sixty percent of Bolivians are indigenous and belong to one of 36 indigenous nations .
The new administration benefits from Bolivia ’s present economic strength , due largely to the natural gas industry having been nationalized in 2006 .
From 2005 through 2009 , foreign currency reserves grew from $ 1.7 billion to $ 8.6 billion , foreign debt fell from $ 4.9 billion to $ 2.6 billion , tax collections rose from $ 2.2 billion annually to $ 4.3 billion , and GDP growth exceeded four percent each year until last year ’s drop to 3.7 percent .
The 2009 rate of inflation was 0.26 percent .
In a two hour inauguration speech , Morales established priorities .
They included fighting corruption , promising judicial reform and improved indigenous legal systems , further agrarian reform measures , and legislation on regional autonomy .
Victory in December gave Morales ’ Movement toward Socialism party ( MAS ) control of both legislative chambers .
The opposition ’s previous hold on Congress had blocked approval of 100 laws promoted by MAS .
Morales ’ mention of extending nationalization of hydrocarbon resources elicited wild applause .
High military commanders on hand clapped in response to his call for weaning young soldiers away from capitalism .
Extolling socialism , Vice President Álvaro García Linera warned the process will take “ years , decades , or centuries . ”
He tried to reconcile ecological and communitarian values with national economic dependency on mining and natural gas extraction .
For the “ global demon that is empire , ” he said , “ we need another globalization , that of the peoples . ”
Later at press conferences , rural development minister Nemesia Chacollo promised increased agricultural production and attention to food sovereignty , while health minster Sonia Polo denounced privatization of public services .
Other officials emphasized industrialization as an adjunct to natural resources exploitation .
They highlighted manufacture of steel , cement and paper products ; production of copper and lithium ; and dairy processing .
Equal division between male and female members of the new cabinet represented one milestone in gender equality , Ana María Romero becoming Senate president , another .
Inter Press Service ’ Franz Chavez explained that “ The major changes seen in Bolivia over the last four years are largely due to the strength and drive of women . ”
Morales and Garcia Linera complement each other .
According to MAS Senator Adolfo Mendoza , the president epitomizes change , the primacy of social movements , and Bolivian prominence as an international role model .
The vice president , a former academician , author , guerrilla fighter , and political prisoner , performs the “ rearguard ” action of instilling an amalgam of Marxist and indigenous ideology into practical politics .
The president oversees implementation of pluri-national governance , while Garcia Linera attends to “ communitarian socialism . ”
Morales gained international visibility following the recent Copenhagen Climate Summit , widely regarded as failing to deal with threats to human survival .
In response , Morales will be hosting an international conference on climate change set for Cochabamba in April .
On inauguration day , Morales insisted upon harmony between governmental action and nature .
Speaking to indigenous peoples everywhere , he declared , “ We have the responsibility to save the world . ”
The day before , Morales was anointed as the political and spiritual leader of the world ’s indigenous people .
Ceremonies took place near Lake Titicaca amidst ruins at a pre-Inca center of Tiwanakota culture .
Mexican economist Ana Esther Ceceña has high hopes for a “ Bolivian people mobilized and aware ” with “ enormous responsibility . ”
“ Will it be Bolivia , ” she asked , “ offering the key for launching that new era of humanity , one of living well , with no capitalism ? ”

The murder rate in England and Wales has fallen to its lowest level for 20 years with 651 deaths recorded in the 12 months to November 2009 .
The Home Office says this figure represents a drop of 14 % in the annual murder rate , with 102 fewer deaths recorded by the police in the year to November than in 2007 / 08 .
Senior Home
Office statisticians have speculated that advances in medical science , which have saved the lives of some murder victims , may lay behind the decline , but this is not necessarily borne out by the statistics .
The most popular murder weapon remains the knife or other sharp instrument , such as a broken bottle , with 255 of the 651 deaths analysed the result of a fatal stabbing .
This compares with 271 knife murders the year before .
However , the police figures show that the overall level of knife crime has fallen by 12 % , with particularly substantial declines in robberies and attacks involving grievous bodily harm , suggesting that it is not improved treatment for victims that is behind the fall in the murder rate .
There is a similar picture in gun crime where the number of murder victims has fallen from 53 to 39 – the lowest number since 1989 .
The annual Home Office analysis of the homicide figures shows that babies under the age of 12 months remain the most " at risk " age group , with a murder rate of 27 per million .
The next most likely victim is a male aged 16 to 29 , with those aged over 70 at the least risk of being murdered .
The overall risk of becoming a murder victim is 12 per million population .
More than two - thirds of murder victims last year were male , with 459 male victims and 192 female .
Women were far more likely to be killed by someone they already knew ( 76 % ) compared with 50 % of male victims .
More than half of murder cases last year were due to a quarrel , a revenge attack or a loss of temper , with only 7 % – 45 – happening during a robbery or a burglary .
Only 4 % are attributed to " irrational acts " .
The Home Office says the murder rate in England and Wales is broadly in line with other western European nations at 1.43 per 100,000 population based on what happened between 2005 and 2007 comparisons .
This is higher than Germany ( 0.9 per 100,000 ) and Italy ( 1.13 ) but lower than France at 1.46 , Northern Ireland at 1.59 and Scotland at 2.17 .
But western European murder rates are still far below the homicide rate in the United States .
Although murders in the US have fallen substantially in recent years they are about four times as common as in England at 5.6 per 100,000 .
• This article was amended on 22 January 2009 .
The original said that Murders in the US are five times more common than in England .
This has been corrected .
Food Stamps Create Jobs … in India Several states with high unemployment are outsourcing food stamp services .
April 29 , 2009  -- Michele Brown has seen Americans ' struggles with jobs first hand .
She lives in hard - hit Florida , spent 20 years in the real estate business and recently had her days as a nanny cut back after her boss had his own hours reduced .
But nothing prepared her for what happened one day when she called a toll - free line to inquire about her food stamps .
" The woman who answered the phone -- it 's not like she was n't nice or anything -- but it was kind of evident that she was n't in the States , " Brown said .
It turns out the woman was at a JP Morgan Chase call center in India .
" That really put me over the edge , " said Brown , 52 , of Jupiter , Fla .
" It 's not right because we need the work here .
People are in a bad way here . "
How is the Economy Treating You ?

Americans have never liked the idea of jobs going overseas .
But for many , it 's more offensive when taxpayer dollars -- including those in the federal stimulus plan -- go to create those jobs .
And when those jobs deal with food stamps , unemployment insurance and other public benefits , well forgot irony , to many it 's just downright plain insulting .
Unemployment in Florida is now 9.7 percent .
" Why is the state of Florida sending these jobs away ? "
Brown asked .
" The thing that really iced it for me , I knew that JP Morgan had gotten bailout funds . "
So she called her local politicians and then she reached out to her local newspaper , the Palm Beach Post .
The paper did a story two weeks ago about the $ 50 million Florida paid JP Morgan in the last three years to administer the food stamps distribution .
Those services include 24 - hour customer - service call centers .
Some of those calls were answered in Bangalore and Gurgaon , India .
Others were taken at two U.S. call centers .
The next day the head of the state 's Department of Children and Families said something needed to change .
" I do n't want any calls going to India , " he said .
" We need to take care of this . "
Click Here for the Latest Business Stories From ABC News
The state now has a commitment from JP Morgan to move all of its calls to the United States , according to Judi Spann , a spokeswoman for the Department of Children and Families .
Florida is n't alone in sending its customer service calls overseas .
There are three major companies that provide debit cards to food stamp recipients : JP Morgan Chase ; eFunds , which is now part of Fidelity National Information Services ; and Affiliated Computer Services or ACS .
JP Morgan Chase Sends Calls to India
JP Morgan is the only one today still operating public - assistance call centers overseas .
The company refused to say which states had calls routed to India and which ones had calls stay domestically .
That decision , the company said , was often left up to the individual states .
ABC News canvassed the country , asking states about their call centers .
Often state officials overseeing the programs had no idea , despite past controversies , where their calls were going .
JP Morgan provides food stamp debit cards in 26 states and the District of Columbia .
It also provides child support debit cards in 15 states and unemployment insurance cards in seven states .
The 130,000 food stamp families in West Virginia have their calls routed to India , according to Jerry Luck , program director for the state .
" We have no complaints with the call center .
We get very good service , " he said .
" I was born and raised in Pittsburgh .
There 's sometimes a communication issue between somebody from Pittsburg and somebody from Harrisburg , Pa . "
The state 's contract with JP Morgan expires on Aug. 31 .
In requests for a new contract , West Virginia has requested a domestic call center because of political concerns .
The 488,000 households in Tennessee also have their calls sent to JP Morgan call centers in India .
The state 's contract runs through February 2012 and there are currently no plans to change it , according to Michelle Mowery Johnson , director of communications for state 's Department of Human Services .
She noted that there are no federal or Tennessee state laws prohibiting the outsourcing call center operations .
Unemployment in West Virginia is now 6.9 percent and 9.6 percent in Tennessee .
Other states struggled to answer questions about their call center locations .
" Who would have ever thought it would be such a difficult question to answer , " said Amy Kempe , spokeswoman for the governor 's office in Rhode Island .
She eventually learned that JP Morgan was sending the state 's food stamps calls to India but now keeps them all domestically .
Kempe later told ABC News however that JP Morgan was still routing calls for unemployment benefits to India .
Unemployment in Rhode Island now stands at 10.5 percent .
Following a congressional mandate in 1996 , states started moving toward electronic delivery of food stamp benefits , now called Electronic Benefit Transfer or EBT .
States Save by Outsourcing
States found it cheaper to outsource these services .
By switching to debit cards for food stamps and other benefits , states save millions of dollars in processing and administrative fees .
Companies , including JP Morgan , filled the niche .
For a fee , the bank will provide debit cards to benefit recipients .
Each month , they will load money onto the cards and on a daily basis process transactions at stores .
For unemployment insurance , the providers also process ATM cash withdrawals .
For instance , in Michigan , JP Morgan allows unemployment recipients two free withdrawals from its network of ATMs .
For each addition withdrawal , the bank takes a $ 1.50 fee .
If somebody loses their card , the first replacement is free .
The second costs $ 7.50 .
The banks also get a fee for each case they handle .
Take Indiana .
JP
Morgan gets 62 to 64 cents for each food stamp case handled monthly there .
With 296,245 cases right now , that means the state is paying JP Morgan $ 183,672 a month on top of any other fees it collects .
Indiana eliminated 100 full - time employees when it hired JP Morgan to make the program cost - neutral , according to Marcus Barlow , spokesman for the state 's Family and Social Services Administration .
But unlike Florida , Tennessee or West Virginia , Indiana keeps all its calls domestically .
In fact , all of its calls go to a call center in Maryville , Ind. , Barlow said , because the state required an in - state call center when soliciting bids .
Other states have rebelled against sending jobs overseas .
South Carolina used to have its calls go to a JP Morgan call center in India .
But in its latest contract , signed a year and a half ago , it stipulated that the calls stay domestically .
Indian call - center employees typically earn about $ 2.50 to $ 3.50 an hour , roughly 70 percent less than their American counterparts , said Jagdish Dalal , a managing director at the New York - based International Association of Outsourcing Professionals .
Overseas call center sites , he said , can vary from small " mom and pop shops " with 15 employees to mass operations with 3,000 seats .
But Dalal added that companies that engage in outsourcing often end up facing higher costs related to infrastructure because the transportation and electrical systems in the developing countries often home to call centers , like India , are n't as reliable as in the United States .
Despite these obstacles , he said , the savings from outsourcing persists , with companies saving about 25 percent to 30 percent by locating workers in foreign countries .
The Fight Against Outsourcing
In recent years , lawmakers have attempted to curb federal and state governments ' use of outsourcing and met with varying degrees of success .
In 2005 , New Jersey passed a law essentially requiring all services under state contracts to be performed within the United States .
Since at least 2003 , Congress has considered several bills related to outsourcing , including those that would limit the practice as well as one -- the " Call Center Consumer 's Right to Know Act " that would require call center operators to disclose their location to callers .
The act never became law .
Most recently , Rep. Sue Myrick , R - N.C. , proposed a bill stopping banks that receive funding under the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program -- which includes JPMorgan Chase -- from sending new call center jobs overseas .
The bill was approved by the House , but did not move on from there .
While JP Morgan would not say what percentage of its calls go overseas , the other two major companies said all of their calls are handled in the United States .
" While we do not comment on specific client contracts , the support for all of our food stamp programs is handled domestically , " Ken Ericson , director of corporate communications for ACS , said in an e-mail .
e Funds used to route calls overseas .
It was acquired in 2007 by Fidelity National Information Services and now keeps all public - assistance calls domestic , according to Anthony Ficarra , who oversees the electronic benefit transfer program for the company .
Fidelity is the largest food stamp servicer , handling accounts in 31 states .
All of the calls go to centers in Wisconsin , Arkansas , Florida and Minnesota .
" We have a large operation in India ourselves , but because of the nature of the programs , we do it all in the U.S , " Ficarra said .
" For us there 's a long - term sensitivity to not handling those things outside the borders of the country . "

Reporting from Baghdad —
A double bombing Friday in the southern city of Karbala killed at least 32 people and wounded over 100 as hundreds of thousands of pilgrims commemorated a major Shiite Muslim holy day .
The attack took place at the eastern entrance to the city as pilgrims from around Iraq were leaving the commemorations in the city center .
First a car bomb exploded near a hospitality tent erected to offer refreshments , killing 10 people , according to Karbala police .
Moments later a suicide bomber driving a car plowed into the carnage left by the first explosion , and killed another 22 .
It was the third major attack against pilgrims this week , and coincided with a sharp escalation in violence ahead of crucial national elections due in March .
More than 70 pilgrims died in two other suicide bombings earlier this week as they headed for Kerbala to mark the Arbayeen , or 40th , day of mourning for Imam Hussein , the 7th century grandson of the prophet Mohammed .
Overall , there have been eight suicide bombings in Iraq the past 11 days , targeting hotels and government buildings as well as pilgrims , in a sign that the Sunni extremist insurgency appears to be regrouping in an attempt to destabilize the country ahead of the March 7 election .
U.S. officials blame Al Qaeda in Iraq for most suicide attacks , but the Iraqi government also accuses members of the former Baath Party that ruled Iraq under Saddam Hussein .
The start of the election campaign has been delayed by a dispute over whether hundreds of candidates with alleged ties to the Baath Party may participate , a dispute that has sharply escalated tensions between the ruling Shiite religious parties and the secular and Sunni groups who are hoping to unseat them .

HadCRUT3 warms at 0.46
UAH MSU warms at 0.33
Possible Surface data error of 0.13 per decade
For East China :
HadCRUT3 warms at 0.44
UAH MSU warms at 0.21
Possible Surface data error of 0.23 per decade
For Africa :
HadCRUT3 warms at 0.315
UAH MSU warms at 0.013
Possible Surface data error of 0.302 per decade
So I am saying there are HUGE inconsistencies in satellite minus surface figures around the globe .
Post ClimateGate – it is interesting that we heard the Russians speaking out against the quota of warming IPCC / CRU / Jones find in Russian datasets .

Brooklyn , New York ( VBS.TV ) --
On January 22 , 2006 , the New York Times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from Pakistan 's tribal areas , which has been called " the most dangerous place in the world . "
A week before that , the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area .
They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives .
Instead , they killed 18 women and children .
One week before that , I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel , the massive open - air market located deep in the tribal areas , where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns .
Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible .
It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar .
They repeatedly denied us entry because , according to them , the Pakistani Army had too many " sensitive operations " going on in that region .
Without my personal advantage ( a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province ) , we never would have gotten in .
The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi .
He was born and raised in the tribal areas .
He took care of us while we were there , and he was a godsend .
You can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem .

Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center , where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia , six angry - dad - looking guys with AKs and sidearms .
They became our personal bodyguards , and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories , barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day .
Most of the work is done by hand .
The vendors are Pashtuns , who are basically the toughest people in the world .
They comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late ' 80s .
These days , the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the Taliban .
They purchase the guns , then cross the border to fight the U.S. army in Afghanistan , or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the Pakistani army .
This summer , I went back to Pakistan , and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter .
The Pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas , attempting to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda .
The U.S. and British troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in Afghanistan .
Meanwhile , Pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers , where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations .
But at the same time , there is a cultural explosion taking place , a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere .
The whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government .
For Pakistan , it 's a volatile , turbulent , and fascinating moment in time .
Santiago , Chile ( CNN ) --
As the sun set in Chile on Saturday , a picture of the immense structural damage wrought by an early morning earthquake had come clearly into focus , with the nation 's president estimating that 2 million people had been affected in some way .
More than 300 people were killed , according to Chile 's Office of Emergency Management , and 15 are missing .
The carnage from the 8.8 - magnitude quake did n't begin to approach that unleashed by January 's earthquake in Haiti , which left 212,000 people dead and more than a million homeless , even though it was considerably less forceful , with a 7.0 magnitude .
Saturday 's quake was 700 to 800 times stronger , but at a greater depth -- 21.7 miles -- compared to the shallow 8.1 - mile depth of the Haiti quake , which contributed to much of the damage there .
Coastal Chile has a history of deadly earthquakes , with 13 quakes of magnitude 7.0 or higher since 1973 , the U.S. Geological Survey said .
As a result , experts said that newer buildings are constructed to help withstand the shocks .
Still , the damage from Chile 's earthquake was widespread .
A 15 - story high rise near the southern city of Concepcion collapsed ; the country 's major north - south highway was severed at multiple points ; and the capital city 's airport was closed after its terminal sustained major damage .
Chilean President Michelle Bachelet announced that all public events would be canceled for the next 72 hours and that the start of the the school year -- originally scheduled for Monday -- would be delayed until March 8 .
" The forces of nature have hurt our country greatly , " Bachelet said in a nationally televised message Saturday night .
" We are now having to face adversity and stand again . "
The quake struck at 3:34 a.m. ( 1:34 a.m. ET ) off the Pacific coast at a depth of nearly 22 miles ( 35 km ) and about 60 miles ( 100 km ) northwest of Chillan , Chile , the USGS said .
Santiago , the capital , is 200 miles ( 325 km ) northeast of the epicenter .
Saturday 's epicenter was just a few miles north of the largest earthquake recorded in the world : a magnitude 9.5 quake in May 1960 that killed 1,655 and unleashed a tsunami that crossed the Pacific .
The quake was followed by 76 aftershocks of 4.9 magnitude or greater , according to the USGS .
That includes a 6.1 - magnitude temblor in Argentina that killed a 58 - year - old man and an 8 - year - old boy in separate towns , the government - run Telam news agency said .
Some buildings in the Argentine capital , Buenos Aires , were evacuated , though the city is 690 miles ( 1,111 kilometers ) from Santiago .
Earlier Saturday , a large wave killed three people and 10 were missing on the island of Juan Fernandez , 400 miles ( 643 km ) off the coast of Chile , said Provincial Governor Ivan De La Maza .
Across Chile , desperate relatives spent the day searching for missing loved ones .
Many used the Internet to ask for help in finding relatives .
Millions of other Chileans began swapping tales of fear and confusion in the early morning hours , soon after the quake struck .
CNN iReporter Matias de Cristobal said many homes in her Santiago neighborhood were destroyed .
Cristobal tried to climb upstairs to check on her three children after she began feeling tremors Saturday , but she was slowed by shifting ground and falling objects .
Mirko Vukasovic , a 25 - year - old illustrator in Santiago , had been dancing at a club early Saturday when the disco ball began swinging wildly .
A chaotic evacuation was already under way when the lights went out , and everyone managed to escape , Vukasovic said .
" Broken windows and falling building parts was what welcomed us in the streets , " he said .
Many initially greeted the quake with disbelief .
" It was 3 or 4 in the morning and I had come home late , " said Aneya Fernando , an American who teaches English in Santiago .
" Suddenly my bed was moving so violently that it woke me up . "
" I'm on the 10th floor of a building and it was swaying and shaking , " Fernando , 23 , said .
" Suddenly [ the shaking ] was just gone and I was confused .
I thought it was in my head . "
When Fernando's electricity returned 30 minutes later , she learned of the earthquake on TV .
The task of trying to rescue survivors and recover the dead continued into the night .
Buildings lay in rubble , bridges and highway overpasses were toppled and roads buckled like rumpled paper .
Mangled cars were strewn on highways , many of them resting on their roofs .
Santiago , the capital , lost electricity and basic services , including water and telephones .
A chemical fire in the city that was spreading from one building to others forced the evacuation of everyone within 500 meters .
Chilean television showed buildings in tatters in Concepcion , in coastal central Chile .
Whole sides of buildings were torn off , and at least two structures were engulfed in flames .
Emergency teams rescued 30 people from one collapsed building in Concepcion .

President - elect Sebastian Pinera , who will take office in March , also was monitoring the situation and warned , " The number of victims could get higher . "
Bachelet declared areas of catastrophe , similar to a state of emergency , which will allow her to rush in aid .
She noted that two of the nation 's largest hospitals had suffered structural damage and patients were taken to other facilities .
Other public institutions also were affected .
" There were reports of riots at one of the jails , " Bachelet said .
" The jails have , of course , received significant damage ...
We are looking into possibly moving some of these inmates . "
Two airlines , LAN and Cencosud , announced they were temporarily suspending services .
Several international humanitarian groups pledged help for Chile 's relief effort , with AmeriCares announcing it was sending medical aid and an emergency response team to Chile .
Oxfam said it 's sending a team of water engineers and logisticians from Colombia and senior humanitarian staff from Mexico to help in relief efforts .
In a televised address Saturday , President Obama said that the United States has resources positioned to assist Chile if it requests help .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she will proceed Sunday with her planned trip to five Latin American countries , including Chile .
Meanwhile , the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a major tsunami warning for parts of its coastline , indicating the possibility of waves 9 feet or higher .
Tens of thousands of coastal residents were evacuated ahead of the potential surge .
Follow tsunami warning information
The Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology also issued a tsunami alert , with the first waves expected in the Philippines around 1 p.m. on Sunday ( midnight Saturday ET ) .
In Hawaii , a tsunami warning was lifted around 1:45 p.m. ( 6:45 p.m. ET ) , the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said .
Check out the world 's biggest earthquakes since 1900
Small waves from the tsunami also reached Tasmania , an island about 150 miles ( 240 km ) east of Australia , said Chris Ryan co-director of the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Center in Melbourne , Australia .
No damage was expected from possibly stronger waves to follow , Ryan said .
" We have a two - level warning system , " he said .
" It 's at the lower warning level .
...
We expect some danger for people on the beach or close to water 's edge ... but not to buildings or structures . "

RAW STORY obtains MSNBC video claiming judge ‘ instructed the four not to talk ’
Even though his lawyer apparently pre-approved it , a statement posted by a conservative activist arrested for attempting to “ interfere with ” the telephone system inside a US senator ’s office is striking for a number of reasons .
Last Friday , James O’Keefe released a denial on Big Government that anyone “ tried to wiretap or bug Senator Landrieu ’s office , ” after he was arrested along with three comrades a few days before on January 25th .
Purportedly intended to address “ inaccurate and false ” reports of what actually happened , the statement reads more like a political broadside against the media than anything else .
ADVERTISEMENT
Since the case is to be potentially tried in a courtroom , as opposed to a Sunday morning political talk show , some observers are questioning the strategy , while others are wondering if it skirts the conditions for his release .
Only a few bloggers even pointed out that the statement does n’t seem to match the facts .
One thing that has gone unnoticed in the multiple press reports on the not exactly apologetic denial is that O’Keefe , and Andrew Breitbart ’s website Big Government , are cherry - picking news reports to “ prove ” their case in the media .
A RAW STORY examination of the facts reveals that O’Keefe ’s statement depends on the same reporter that it later damns for committing “ journalistic malpractice . ”
The Times - Picayune reports , “ While attorneys typically advise clients after their arrest to keep quiet , Michael Madigan , the Washington attorney representing O’Keefe , said in an e-mail message Friday that the statement ‘ was necessary due to the massive misreporting ’ of the incident . ”
Notably , as Media Matters points out , O’Keefe and Big Government , who has been compiling a list of media outlets that owe apologies and / or retractions , are ignoring conservative outlets like The New York Post and The Corner who committed similar “ journalistic malpractice . ”
NBC News reports ‘ judge instructed the four not to talk ’
ADVERTISEMENT
Last Thursday , RAW STORY reported , “ If there is a gag order against accused phone tamperer James O’Keefe then the once - celebrated conservative activist / journalist / prankster / defendant just might have broken it Wednesday night . ”
The report hinged on an NBC News reporter ’s account and the following O’Keefe Tweet : “ Govt official concedes no attempt to wiretap . ”
Sometime around noon on December 27 , MSNBC ’s News Live welcomed NBC News justice correspondent Pete Williams to discuss the “ convoluted story . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Now , normally James O’Keefe is a fairly talkative young man but the judge has instructed the four not to talk , so we do n’t know if we ’re going to hear anything further from him , ” Williams wrongly predicted .
Contacted by RAW STORY , Professor Jonathan Turley , a nationally recognized legal expert , concurred , “ It could indeed violate an order .
It is extremely unwise for clients to be tweeting on their case even without such an order .
Mr. O’Keefe has a record of reckless conduct and this would certainly add to that record . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Having said that , these orders often create a conflict for counsel in zealous representation and protecting a fair trial , ” Turley added .
“ Mr. O’Keefe is being widely accused of an attempted wiretap .
He has an interest in rebutting such claims .
Yet , it is always problematic for a client to directly manage the media .
While a tweet is not likely to result in serious punishment in this case , it can bring a sharp rebuke and undermine the relationship with the court . ”
At his blog , Turley added , “ O’Keefe seems to relish reckless acts .
His stunt with ACORN appears to have violated state laws .
Even without a surveillance conspiracy , the Landrieu stunt is still quite serious .
What is interesting is that O’Keefe hardly needs to directly communicate such information given the press attention in the case . ”
Later Thursday night , Turley discussed the Tweet on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow show .
Maddow hyped the segment earlier in the show by stating , “ Four guys charged with trying to tamper with the phone system in a United States senator ‘s office .
Now , one of them is tweeting about it in violation of what I thought was a legal gag order .
That ‘s next with Jonathan Turley . ”
Maddow also referred to “ a reported gag order ” later .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Why is the tweet significant ? ” Maddow asked Turley .
“ How could he get in trouble for tweeting about the case if there is a gag order ? ”
Turley responded : “ Well , if there ‘s a gag order , it usually binds all parties and you ‘re not allowed to discuss the case .
That can sometimes raise some constitutional issues about a person ‘s right to defend himself in public .
But usually , if you want to get outside of a gag order , you have to petition the court .
But putting aside the gag order and the possibility of contempt , it ‘s a uniquely stupid thing for a defendant in a criminal case to be addressing the media or the public directly .
It ‘s a very dangerous practice , and I do n‘t know any attorney that would tolerate such a thing . ”
“ Why is it dangerous ? ” Maddow asked .
Turley added , “ Well , because anything that you say in public usually can be admissible in court .
It also tends to destroy the relationship with the judge .
It could bring a charge of at least a technical violation or a contempt sanction . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
However , as O’Keefe argues , while there does n’t appear to be any specific “ gag order ” there are other indications that the judge has advised the defendants who are each facing potentially a decade behind bars not to talk about the case .
Gag order or no gag order ?
Last Friday , TPMMuckraker ’s Justin Elliott reported , “ O’ Keefe also appears to be correct that there was never any gag order in the case , despite media reports .
A clerk at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana told TPMmuckraker he knew of no such gag order . ”
David Stechmann , a clerk at Judge Moore ’s office , confirmed to RAW STORY that the judge had n’t provided any advice or direction “ prohibiting O’Keefe from speaking or commenting . ”
However , the initial Times - Picayune article which broke the arrest noted that Judge “ Moore allowed three of the men to stay together Tuesday night , but ordered them to not talk about the case . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
In addition , an Associated Press article published Monday , quotes “ the front man for the swing band Johnny Angel and the Swinging Demons , ” who met O’Keefe and two of his alleged co-conspirators , Stan Dai and Joseph Basel , while they stayed with his roommate Ben Wetmore in New Orleans :
“ They said they could n’t talk about it , that the judge said they could n’t discuss the case . ”
At his blog , Patterico argues “ several leaks from unnamed law enforcement officials sharing otherwise unknown details of the case ” are “ seemingly a little worse than O’Keefe straightforward Twitter message reporting public news to correct a distortion repeated by several outlets . ”
RAW STORY has learned that a media outlet has ordered a copy of the transcript from the initial court appearance in order to find out what the judge specifically said .
Conservatives have a long history of bashing the mainstream press , and sometimes they rely on mainstream press accounts to bash other mainstream press accounts .
“ The government has now confirmed what has always been clear :
No one tried to wiretap or bug Senator Landrieu ’s office , ” O’Keefe writes in his statement .
ADVERTISEMENT
In addition , multiple requests for retractions at Breitbart ’s Big Journalism website claim that “ a law enforcement official has conceded that the four men were not attempting to wiretap or intercept calls . ”
But that confirmation only came from an unnamed law official in an MSNBC post written by NBC’s Pete Williams , the same reporter responsible for , as O’Keefe put it , “ falsely claim[ing ] that I violated a non-existent ‘ gag order . ’ ”
O’Keefe statement may skirt release agreement
Even if there is no “ gag order ” or judicial direction to keep quiet , the release O’Keefe signed ( posted at Talking Points Memo ) may still become an issue when the defendants return to court on February 12 .
ADVERTISEMENT
As commenters at TPM and other online sites have noted , section 7 j of O’Keefe ’s conditions for release states , “ The defendant shall : avoid all contact , directly or indirectly , with any persons who are or may become a victim or a potential witness in the subject , investigation or prosecution , including but not limited to , ” with “ unless for business purposes only ” added in ink .
O’Keefe ’s
Tweet and statement could be viewed by the court as attempts to influence a potential jury , or even witnesses in the actual case .
Joseph Basel , an alleged co-conspirator can be seen on O’Keefe ’s Twitter list of “ followers ” and he Tweeted a link to O’Keefe ’s statement himself .
Andrew Breitbart , who has admitted paying O’Keefe , also could be called in as a potential witness , or even co-conspirator .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ What he does for the site exclusively is he tells his life rights , basically , ” Breitbart told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt , “ So when he puts a story out there , it ’s on the Breitbart sites , the Big sites , that he can tell people what transpired . ”
There is clearly coordination between O’Keefe and Breitbart , as , along with the statement , his site is filled with multiple articles defending O’Keefe and demanding retractions from the media .
Traditionally , judges do n’t normally take kindly to lawyers attempting to try their cases in the public , but in this case , the terms of O’Keefe ’s release could be potentially changed , sending him back to jail .
Lawyer : O’Keefe statement ‘ unconvincing , incriminating ’
ADVERTISEMENT
At The Reality Check Saturday , Manhattan - based attorney Michael J. Gaynor , in a line - by - line takedown , argued that O’Keefe ’s “ statement is unconvincing , incriminating and notable for what is not included . ”
“ O’Keefe is charged with aiding and abetting others ‘ to commit…entry for the purpose of interfering with [ a ] telephone system on January 25 , 2010 , ' ” Gaynor wrote .
“ Instead of unqualifiedly denying that , O’Keefe denied that anyone ‘ tried to wiretap or bug Senator [ Mary ] Landrieu ’s office ’ or ‘ to cut or shut down her phone lines . ’
He was not charged with trying to wiretap or bug or cut or shut down and it is not clear that accessing a telephone closet under false pretenses is not interfering with a telephone system , even if no wiretapping , cutting or shutting down was contemplated . ”
Gaynor notes that O’Keefe ’s statement unwittingly “ supports the claim that he aided and abetted Flanagan and Basel in entering federal premises under false pretenses . ”
The lawyer continues , “ This sentence in O’Keefe ’s statement is a telling admission that O’Keefe was not merely present and aware that a crime was being committed ( if one was ) :
‘ In investigating this matter , we decided to visit Senator Landrieu ’s district office – the people ’s office – to ask the staff if their phones were working . ’
Even though O’Keefe arrived in Senator Landrieu ’s office first and apparently not under false pretenses , he admitted having been engaged in a joint effort with Flanagan and Basel and it is alleged and apparently not disputed that O’Keefe ‘ positioned his cellular phone in his hand so as to record FLANAGAN and BASEL . ’
The hope that acts of Flanagan and Basel cannot be attributed to O’Keefe was dashed by O’Keefe ’s written statement ( if not earlier when he was questioned ) . ”
“ Since Basel and Flanagan never gained access to the telephone closet , they were never in a position to shut down phone lines , so the denial definitely seems credible to me , ” Gaynor points out .
“ But O’Keefe did not explain what Basel and Flanagan , each of whom was wearing a tool belt , planned to do if they had gained access to the telephone closet , and people who enter an office under false pretenses seeking access to a telephone closet have a big credibility problem and their assurance that they had only the best of intentions will not be blindly accepted . ”
Gaynor adds , “ If the sole intent of their investigation was to determine “ whether or not Senator Landrieu was purposely trying to avoid constituents who were calling , ” there was no need for any false pretenses , any tool belts , or any request to access the telephone closet .
Since there were false pretenses , tool belts and a request for access to the telephone closet , O’Keefe ’s explanation is not satisfying to me or fair - minded conservatives like HotAir ’s Ed Morrissey , at HotAir.com . ”
“ There has been considerable overreach by some media outlets , to be sure , ” Morrissey wrote at Hot Air .
Morrissey adds ,
Some elements of the story have come directly from the report filed by the FBI , - detailing what the witnesses told them about the operation .
That information remains to be tested in court , but the description therein does n’t quite square with O’Keefe ’s explanation .
They would n’t have needed to get access to the telephone closet in order to observe people answering the phone , and attempting to access it under false pretenses ( representing themselves as telephone - company technicians ) strongly implies that they wanted access for other reasons .
If the FBI affadavit or the witness testimony is inaccurate , then that will come out in court .
However , I doubt that the FBI got the description of their clothing wrong , and dressing up as telephone repairmen would n’t have been necessary at all to get undercover video of people answering the phone , or not answering it , as the case may be .
If all O’Keefe and his people wanted was an admission that the phone system was working , then the disguise may have helped , but it still would n’t have been necessary to gain access to the phone closet .
Attorney Michael J. Gaynor concluded , “ O’ Keefe ’s main problem is not whether professional journalists like David Shuster can get facts straight or are credible , but whether he committed a crime in Louisiana and will be prosecuted for it .
O’Keefe is right about media misreporting , but it is not relevant to whether crimes were committed during the Louisiana caper and the sins of the media he complained of apparently are not the fault of the prosecution .
His statement has me pondering whether now he will be prosecuted in Pennsylvania , Maryland and California too . ”
O’Keefe is reportedly scheduled to make an appearance on Fox News Monday night during Sean Hannity ’s show .
That is , unless his lawyer decides at the last hour that enough is enough , and that risking the judge ’s ire anymore might not be so wise .

It goes without saying , what s going on in Haiti right now is an absolute tragedy .
Initial reports indicate that nearly 50,000 people have died due to the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that leveled buildings  including the islands major hospital  in one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere .
I know things are tight here because of the economy , but considering most Haitians sustain themselves on less than $ 1 per day , they probably need our spare change a lot more than we do .
Below is a list of very well known and reputable relief and charity organizations who will put any donation that you are willing to give them to good use for the people of Haiti .
Each of the below links goes directly to a webpage where you can donate money specifically for the Haitian earthquake victims .
Obviously , these are n’t listed in any order of importance , and it ’s certainly not an all inclusive list .
Thank you for your help .
In Somerville , Massachusetts , an unabridged , unapologetic dictionary lies on a pub table surrounded by lagers , pints of Guinness , burgers , chicken Caesar wraps , and Corona - bottles - turned - salt - and - pepper - shakers .
It ’s a Tuesday night , and the dictionary has been pulled off the shelf near the bar to help certain patrons decode what many consider to be the most dense , difficult piece of literature ever written .
Right now , eight members of the Finnegans Wake reading group are , for the most part , chewing .
Soon they will read aloud a page or two of the Wake , as they do every week , and discuss the passage for about an hour .
Some have been doing this since 1997 .
They are not yet halfway through the book .
While many literary scholars have only a cursory understanding of Finnegans Wake , this group of Web designers , data analysts , and aerobics teachers has jerry - rigged an impressive understanding of it while meeting at a bar , their pace somewhere between struggling and savoring .
The Wake , James Joyce ’s final work , was published in 1939 .
Most of the reading public did n’t exactly take to his 628 pages of complex allusions , portmanteaus , and nearly incomprehensible plot lines .
Joyce ’s patroness , Harriet Shaw Weaver , wrote , “ I do not care much for the output from your Wholesale Safety Pun Factory nor for the darknesses and unintelligibilities of your deliberately entangled language system .
It seems to me you are wasting your genius . ”
But Joyce insisted until his death two years after its publication that the text , which he spent 17 years writing , was still one of his works “ that people should spend a lifetime figuring out . ”
The first line is , “ riverrun , past Eve and Adam ’s , from swerve of shore to bend of bay , brings us by commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs . ”
In an uncommon way , the Wake reconciles exaggeration and description .
Hyperbole becomes not only valid but necessary for describing the experience of reading it .
Short of calling the book nonsense , you cannot dismiss it as easy , no matter how much expertise you have or how familiar you are with the classics or with , say , the street ballads of Dublin .
Its complexity prevents any attempt at a gritty rolling - up - your - sleeves - and - just - getting - it - done tactic ; its style protects it from revealing itself through the profligate attentions of the college student during an all - nighter , an impenetrability that precludes the CliffsNotes approach .
Like some old Mafioso , the Wake has been cloistered away partly just by its reputation .
It yields nuggets of information to which , among a group of know - it - alls , no one can believably respond , “ I knew that . ”
It has a difficulty that is objective , a prissy intellectualism rendered macho by extremity .
It ’s a bit of an introvert ’s Everest .
By the autumn night of this session a year ago , only two of the original four members remain , but the Somerville group has grown to nine and has met here for three years in the snug — a partially enclosed booth — at the Thirsty Scholar Pub .
They first came together in another , now - closed bar in Cambridge near Porter Square that was actually called Finnegans Wake .
Then they bounced around , trying to find a spot with the right feel .
In the last few years , they ’ve gotten better about meeting every week , and so the members ’ bookmarks are moving quicker .
In 2002 , new members led to the group starting over at page one .
At the current average rate of a page or two a week , they could be done as soon as 2012 .
( But Todd Sjoblom , a programmer at Mathworks who studied science at MIT — as well as Greek , Russian , Chinese , German , French , Japanese , and a little bit of Old English — said he has n’t sat down and done the math . )
Other groups are also reading the Wake .
Most meet monthly ( a Belgium group meets “ fortnightly ” ) or are tied to a university .
“ I think it ’s incredible , ” says Murray Gross , the president of a New York City Wake group , when told of the schedule in Somerville .
“ Once a month is enough for us . ”
It might seem to many , then , that the Somerville group ’s members are wasting their genius .
Inman Square straddles Cambridge , Boston ’s encephalized offshoot , and Somerville , a working - class city .
In the same strip of buildings as the Thirsty Scholar is Fi-Dough , a gourmet dog food store with a statue of a dog in a chef ’s outfit out front , holding a tray in his paws .
A young couple passes .
“ Ham jerky ?
Is it for dogs ? ”
It is for dogs , but they both try it .
“ It ’s a bit soft , ” the man says in a British accent as they keep walking .
The Thirsty Scholar ’s façade , black with gold trim , has a studied authenticity , a pub - from - a - kit look , though the inside is known as a genuinely friendly place .
The snug where the group meets is high , the boards inside wide and shellacked red ; 10 feet up , model ships rest on the beams that separate the group from the rest of the pub .
There never seems to be any extra space , whether the number present for a meeting is six or nine .
Two stools , when occupied , seal off the group at the opening like a child pulling the last bits of covers over his head .
It ’s a conspicuous isolation that captures the group ’s style — communal , yet set apart .
Rich Cosma , a biotech engineer from Framingham and one of the group ’s four originals , is among the earliest to arrive .
The first pages of his copy are yellow and rheumatic ; he has written “ 3 - 9 - 97 ” on the title page .
The first half of the two - hour sessions is for eating , drinking , and catching up on everyone ’s weekend , though the conversation often turns to Joyce .
Rich jokes with Todd about the dangers of the Fung Wah bus to New York and asserts , with a laugh , that he ’d heard that the creature from John Singleton Copley ’s Watson and the Shark was merely a basking shark .
Joel Reisman arrives .
A soft - spoken data analyst who favors button - down flannel shirts , Joel joined the group the preceding December after he ’d met Rich at a lecture on the Wake his wife had talked him into attending .
Joel asks someone to pass the “ red , equilateral triangle ” bottle for his French fries .
The mock - intellectual request propels the mood to another energy level .
It ’s time to start .
This week the group is on page 293 .
“ We ’ve got a mistake tonight , ” says Brian Jewett , the member with the broadest shoulders and possibly the thickest Boston accent .
Brian reads from his book of annotations so those with older editions know that there should be a parenthesis before the “ with ” in the sentence “ Viues Von DVbLin , ’ twas one of dozedreams a darkies ding in dewood ) the Turnpike under the Great Ulm ( with Mearingstone in Fore ground ) . ”
Good thing he caught that .
Could have been confusing .
The footnote , for clarification , reads : “ Draumcondra ’s Dreamcountry where the betterlies blow . ”
They take turns reading .
No one drinks .
Some smile , like they ’re hearing a song they know .
Some look concerned .
Joel engages the text with a magnifying glass .
“ Wonderful Tonight ” plays in the bar .
“ But , thunder and turf , it ’s not alover yet !
One recalls Byzantium . ”
Tonight ’s reading concludes , and discussion begins .
Someone points out that if you add up the Roman numerals Joyce used to spell Dublin , you get 566 , which is half of 1,132 ( by “ dublin ” 566 you get 1132 , an important year in Irish history and a number that keeps recurring in the text ) .
“ And , heaving all jawbreakical expressions out of old Sare Isaac ’s universal of specious aristmystic unsaid .
. . . ” The Sare Isaac pun everyone gets pretty easily : Sir Isaac Newton and Sarah and Isaac .
It ’s supported by Joyce ’s note in the margin that says “ Uteralterance or the Interplay of Bones in the Womb , ” referring to Jacob and Esau struggling in Rebekah ’s womb .
“ Newton ’s name for algebra was ‘ Universal arithmetic , ’ ” someone adds .
The spelling of aristmystic returns the group to William Butler Yeats ’s mystical work A Vision , which group member Earle Lane , a retired businessman who worked in manufacturing , has become familiar with lately .
Earle wonders aloud if Joyce used the same automatic , free - association writing techniques that Yeats did .
Lily Delaney , who once owned a Celtic store in Harvard Square and now works as a financial adviser , supports the idea with a story about Joyce dictating a part of the Wake to Samuel Beckett when there was a knock at the door .
Joyce said , “ Come in , ” and Beckett wrote it down , thinking it was part of the book .
Joyce , pleased with the mistake , left it in .
“ Counter to this view , ” Joel writes a few days later in his meticulous e-mail summary of the week ’s discussion , “ several people felt Joyce would n’t have relied on automatic writing alone , since he was extremely deliberate and attentive in polishing his work . ”
Some members have read Joseph Campbell ’s Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake or Roland McHugh ’s Annotations to Finnegans Wake , two of the authoritative Wake interpretations .
Others go at it cold .
Collectively , they tease out an understanding from a combination of the two approaches , trusting in the wisdom that the group average comes closest to guessing the correct number of jelly beans in the jar , here applied to decoding German and Arabic ; they do n’t open that big English dictionary very much .
Someone usually knows the word .
A quarter of page 293 is taken up by a diagram .
This , they decide , can signify half - a- dozen things , including a female pubic triangle with the letters ALP for Anna Livia Plurabelle , the major female character in the book .
Lois Leav , at 70 the group ’s senior member , draws upon her career in ortho - optics to interpret the diagram as a reference to how Joyce saw the world at the end of his life .
His double vision led him to wear an eye patch when reading .
The two intersecting spheres , she says , represent the brain bringing two images together .
By reading the Wake like this , the group pools the knowledge of nine people who have led interesting but very different lives .
The book seems always to support a connection with at least one aspect of each person ’s life or area of familiarity , so occasionally it becomes a Rorschach test , a medium so ambiguous that the members project onto it .
For the most part , though , they show an impressive discipline in sticking to the text .
The first chapter of Finnegans Wake introduces the central character , a hod carrier named Finnegan who falls to his death from a scaffold .
At his wake , a fight breaks out , whiskey splashes on his corpse , and he rises from the dead .
But a summary of this sort is a little like saying the Bible is about a really powerful guy .
For starters , the title is at least a quadruple pun : Finnegan ’s wake , the service for him ; his wake , the effects he leaves behind him ; Finnegan ’s awake , as he comes back to life ; fin egan ( the French “ end ” with “ again ” ) meaning to “ end again ” — the book is cyclical , its last passage stops midsentence and we realize that the first words of the book pick up there .
Many great works of literature have made it to the list of Oprah ’s Book Club — Anna Karenina , East of Eden — but it ’s safe to say Finnegans Wake never will .
Almost 70 years after its publication , fate has relegated the Wake to the efforts of determined academics and eccentric souls , something many know about , even talk about , but few have experienced , like running with the bulls .
But it might be presumptuous to assume a book is written to be read alone .
And the Somerville group — as many groups have , though perhaps not to such an extreme extent — has realized that the Wake , while definitely not a beach read , might be a pub read .
“ It is not written for the individual , but for people working together to construct ‘ meaning ’ across national , linguistic and historical boundaries .
And in that sense [ the work ] anticipates in extremely challenging ways the phenomenon of globalization , ” Vicki Mahaffey , a professor of English , wrote in the description of a course she taught at the University of Pennsylvania .
She warned that the Wake , the “ most atypical , experimental book , ” is not often considered intelligible in the usual sense of the word .
“ It has been defended , though , as the verbal equivalent to the achievement of splitting the atom ; by splitting the word , Joyce aims to unleash previously untapped creative and interpretive energy . ”
In an e-mail to me from her new post at the University of York in Heslington , England , she wrote , “ I think the communal aspect of reading the Wake is real : what I usually say is that it is the first book written to be read collaboratively ( rather than individually or competitively ) . ”
At one point , when the Somerville group had dwindled to two , Erik Jespersen , its longhaired leader , canceled some readings because , he said , without other people “ there was nothing to learn . ”
Mahaffey ’s class at Penn also read Aesop , Freud ’s Interpretation of Dreams , Ibsen ’s Master Builder , and The New Science by the 18th - century Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico .
Her students studied , as well , the lives of Napoleon , Buddha , Mohammed , St. Patrick , St. Kevin , and Grace O’Malley , the 16th - century Irish pirate .
More than just requiring context , the Wake demands context — and almost seems to generate it .
Lois says her husband asked her why she was reading the Talmud .
“ I said , ‘ I got to know what ’s in it ’ cause Joyce keeps referencing it . ’
I said , ‘ My God , I ’m a Jew and I do n’t know this stuff .
I ’m reading this book because an Irish Catholic said it was worth reading . ’”
The Internet has made reading Joyce easier .
The group first formed after Erik posted an announcement online .
Joel uses the Web to find the primary texts that Joyce cites .
“ Sometimes I feel , when I look up a certain word , that I ’m looking at the same source document that Joyce was looking at , ” he says .
A phrase on page 296 — “ And let you go , Airmienious , and mick your modest mock Pie out of humbles up your end ” — led Joel to Google , where he discovered that the word Airmienious ties together the page ’s multiple references to Armenia and the Germanic general Arminius who defeated three Roman legions in 9 A.D.
The Wake , in this sense , captured the dizzying amplitude of the Internet before it existed .
Like the Web , the book is an incredibly vast , far - reaching , piecemeal collection that is brilliant and unifying when taken in context , but gibberish when not .
( Also , a portion of each has been dedicated to naked women . )
Almost every phrase in the book is a sort of hyperlink to a half - dozen other sources or ideas , and , in fact , a Wiki - Wake is in the works .
Click on a word on page three and you ’ll get a link to a half - dozen notes that people have posted explaining its significance .
Click on something on page 555 and you ’re still on your own .
The Internet has not yet caught up with the Wake .
At the Thirsty Scholar , reasons for joining the group vary : bestsellers waste time , or a course in high school or college left a favorable impression of Joyce , or the Wake was the next step after Ulysses .
Joel had tried to tackle the book on his own and felt that it was “ a dead end , more trouble than it ’s worth . ”
If his decision to read the Wake were strictly about the book ’s being on a pedestal , he would resent it by now , he says .
“ I ’ve never shied away from something difficult .
I had felt that if the only way to tackle it was through criticism , then I did n’t want to do it . ”
He does admit to occasional Wake - induced exasperation , and the weekly gatherings occasionally resemble an AA meeting — people working together to get through something tough .
Erik claims there is nothing particularly strange or quixotic about the undertaking : “ I did Ulysses on my own , but when I got to Finnegans Wake it was clear from the beginning that this was something I was not going to be able to do alone .
It ’s knowing how to admit that , how to ask for help , and that it ’s not a failing of yourself . ”
Joel likens the group to amateur scientists in the 1800s , when amateurs were making real discoveries .
“ I do n’t see us finding anything that we can communicate to the community , ” he says , “ but we are engaged in something that is important to the community . ”
The group has a good time .
They often act playfully ashamed , or unaware , of how funny they are .
Teased about his water consumption , Todd boasts , “ I put the sewer back in connoisseur . ”
Rich quotes : “ Ah , the triumph of hope over experience , ” and Brian asks , “ Samuel Johnson ? ” “ Naw , it was a friend who said it to me . ”
Their explanations are never condescending .
These are quirky intellectuals , even by Cambridge standards , but they are all humbled by one another ’s knowledge , each assuming he or she ranks somewhere at the bottom of the group in terms of proficiency with the book .
They are humble in the way kids from tough neighborhoods are sometimes less cocky in the lead - up to a street fight because they ’ve realized there ’s always someone tougher .
Several say that reading as little as one page of the book on Tuesday nights has affected the way their minds work .
Lois teaches aerobic dance classes to seniors and has to memorize and execute intricate stepping patterns .
“ People tell me ‘ Gee , you can think better on Wednesday ; what are you doing ? ’
It ’s not a coincidence .
My thinking is clearer . ”
Joel has coined the term “ Vicoinsidence , ” referring to Wake - related coincidences inspired by Giambattista Vico , a major presence in the Wake .
Mimi Breed , a psychiatric nurse who writes poetry for her own amusement , says she now plays with words and spellings in e-mails ( and has learned to love Guinness ) .
Without acknowledging her pun , she says that relearning to play with the language has been “ joyous . ”
The dominant impression is that this is a book the group wants to read , that the effort is an indulgence , like the burgers and fries and beer they order and like the yellow Porsche Earle drives to the meetings .
“ Whereas other people were tapping their subconscious and Freud was mapping it , Finnegans Wake tickled the subconscious , ” Joel says .
“ If that thought is true , doing it with other people might be almost sexual . ”
He likes having a task to accomplish each week and “ the feeling that one is creating afresh . ”
Plus , he says , “ Alcohol helps . ”
Mimi is not alone in thinking of the project as a Sudoku that just happens to have as its subject the collective knowledge of mankind .
Joel says , “ I ’ve been on record as saying that chess is not an intellectual game .
There ’s something about Finnegans Wake that is not intellectual .
It ’s not snooty .
Some people say it sounds good when read to babies .
I ’m not sure about that , that it ’s a magical thing .
It is a document that gives people the opportunity to decode it . ”
And so the group collectively chips away at the text , tinkers with it , rendering it accessible with joking and beer .
They perform an odd alchemy , making something so often dulled by its own density shine , transcending the limitations of a work that transcends the concept of knowledge to begin with .
For decades , communal
Wake readings have been facilitated by a fortunate circumstance : the book ’s pagination , with few exceptions , has never changed .
That is because , says Michael Seidel , a Wake scholar at Columbia , the potential for error in resetting is great , given the strangeness of almost every word , and it ’s easiest to make new plates from photocopies of pages .
Some Somerville group members believe — or rather feel — that consistent pagination is something Joyce probably would have preferred .
They think that , because of all the ambiguity surrounding the text , Joyce wanted everyone on the same page .
After the discussion one week , Mimi places a carrot cake , which she ’s baked , on the dictionary .
She has decided to celebrate her 65th birthday with the group — and she wants 65 candles .
“ This is good , ” says Lily , “ because Joyce ’s birthday was very important to him . ”
With only half the candles lit , the snug heats up .
Lois asks Violeta , the Lithuanian waitress , to turn on the AC .
Todd jabs a fork into a candle and uses his new torch to light other candles .
The room takes on a glow .
The AC creates a breeze , making the candles harder to light .
By the time Todd and Brian and Mimi light the 65th candle , the first ones have burned down to the cake .
Its off - white frosting is itself frosted with beads of wax .
The table and dictionary are spotted .
Though flames are confined to the cake , a large percentage of the room is , when you think about it , actually on fire .
The group sings .
Then , careful to protect the sacred texts while eating , the members sit smiling , chewing carrot cake and bits of wax in the momentary silence .
Violeta brings the check , wallets open , and the air cools in the snug .
Back to the real world .
Finnegans
Wake , in the words of Vicki Mahaffey , is “ a strange , festive celebration of our own individual ignorance , which instead of being shaming fosters a fresh appreciation of how many pieces of human knowledge and culture remain unconnected , unassimilated . ”
One night , as several group members begin to pack up , Todd wonders about Mexico .
There was one word that night that sounded like a volcano in Mexico .
“ But Mexico is suspiciously lacking from the text , ” he says .
Meanwhile , Lois , who tends to linger on passages while others move on , reads out loud , “ We ’re only all telescopes ! ” and says to no one in particular : “ Is n’t that a wonderful line ?
‘ We ’re all telescopes . ’ ”
The judge called Mr. Leary a vengeful and self - aggrandizing man with an inflated view of his intelligence who knowingly carried two firebombs , built from mayonnaise jars , kitchen timers , batteries and flashbulbs , onto the two Manhattan trains .
Forty - eight people were injured , 14 seriously , including himself .
Two teen - age students were injured in the first bombing , on Dec. 15 , 1994 , on a No. 3 train at 145th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem .
Investigators at first thought one student had been carrying the device .
Six days later , at 1:35 P.M. , a second device went off in the sixth car of a No. 4 train packed with people returning to work from lunch and Christmas shopping .
Panicked straphangers scrambled to the doors , trampling those who had fallen in the rush or were crawling as they tried to escape the scorching heat .
Once outside on a platform filling with smoke , they rolled around or patted themselves and others to put out the flames .
The sentencing was a relief to victims , but some said it was just one step in a long recovery .
" I hate to see a man lose his liberty , " said Winfield Edey , a former truck driver from Far Rockaway , Queens , who receives physical therapy three times a week to regain full use of his hands and feet .
" But what Mr. Leary did to me and the other people in that train is unforgivable and he has to pay the penalty for that . "
Joseph Schendelman , a former bank supervisor , said his facial scars have healed but he continued to see a psychologist twice a month .
" I 'm satisfied , " said Mr. Schendelman of Linden , N.J. " It 's not going to take away from our pains and sufferings , but to know that he would be away for a long time is good . "
Largely overlooked in the renewed spruiking of the rise and rise of housing prices is the salutary lesson learned the hard way over the past decade in that region .
There the bubble did n't burst spectacularly , a la Keen , but property buyers have been damaged , especially property investors .
Made possible by ( relatively ) low interest rates , sooled on by often - dodgy investment spruikers and fuelled by intemperate lending , the working - to - middle class south - west seized on the early noughties property boom with a vengeance – a " safe as houses " way of getting rich for those indoctrinated by the negative gearing salesmen .
The early period of the bubble – before it 's obvious there is one – can be rewarding but for those who bought near the top in the first half of 2004 , the reality has been six miserable years and a level of forced sales that at times distorted broader Sydney statistics .
As the accompanying graph from RP Data shows , average south west Sydney house prices went down and stayed down from that 2004 peak , barely regaining those levels now .
And RPdata research analyst Cameron Kusher says the outer south western Sydney region continues to see a lower level of price growth than the Sydney average .
Add interest charges , the hefty holding costs inherent in real estate and the even worse opportunity cost of the funds tied up in a dud investment , and that $ 350,000 median house remains an economic disaster .
Even someone buying in mid-2003 , a year before the peak when the median price hit $ 300,000 , is still behind .
The boom " winners window " was n't open for long .
It 's not just the stock market that can go flat .
Yet it is something of a testimony to Australians ' dogged belief in home ownership that it was n't worse .
Among the side issues Keen and his few allies have failed to adequately assess is willingness of Australian property owners to either soldier on servicing their mortgage or take their lumps by selling up before the bank forces them to .
More fundamentally , the core issue for Australian home owners is n't the relative " expensiveness " of a house or the size of the debt , but the ability of the owner to service that debt .
Rory Robertson put it more bluntly when stung by a reported suggestion that there might be a second leg to his bet against Keen 's dire forecast of an imminent 40 per cent crash in average Australian housing prices , never mind a depression with 15 to 20 per cent unemployment .
Dr Keen is preparing to walk from Canberra to Mt Kosciuszko , but still claims that he will be right – one of these years .
" The fact that the downtrend in house prices underway in 2008 ended within a few short months of the bet being agreed , rather than 10 - 15 years down the track , and with prices then rising to new highs within a year simply highlights how hopelessly wrong Dr Keen was about the outlook for house prices , " writes Robertson .
Looking back , the drop in local house prices from their first quarter 2008 peak was small and short - lived , rather than large and prolonged as anticipated by Dr Keen , mainly because the RBA 's big ( and predictable ) interest - rate cuts alongside Canberra 's deposit and funding guarantees quickly stabilised confidence and ensured extraordinarily cheap funding for most existing and would - be homebuyers .
Counter - cyclical macroeconomic policy worked .
" For the record , the peak - to - trough fall in the ABS house price index was only 5.5 % , so Dr Keen was out by a factor of seven !
" House prices on average now are 10 % or so higher than in late 2008 when Dr Keen famously sold his home .
" Betting the house on an economist 's forecast typically is not a smart move .
Unfortunately , Dr Keen recklessly encouraged everyday Australians to sell their homes at what turned out to be the peak of the global financial crisis and the trough in local house prices . "
Robertson says he has no strong view on the outlook for house prices , seeing both positives and negatives , but believes that extremists will continue to be wrong .
" Those with the strongest views that the price of Australian houses " must " fall typically either do n't own one , do n't really know what they are talking about , or both . "
Yet the south - west Sydney story over the past decade shows a crash does n't have to be spectacular to hurt .
What might unnerve some is the speed of the price recovery in parts of the Australian housing market was approaching the stuff of bubbles if maintained .
The RBA is pleased to see a slight cooling in home loans and a quiet tightening of loan to valuation ratios by Australia 's banks , a sign perhaps of the banks themselves either taking a hint from the authorities or seeing a potential danger themselves .
Loading As Robertson alludes , extremists of both varieties will be wrong .
The RBA thwarted the Doomsday scenario – and it will also do what it must to prevent another asset bubble .
We have indeed been warned .

SACRAMENTO – Over 1000 workers and union activists gathered in the state capital on a working day recently in a spirited rally for job - creating legislation .
Unfortunately , AFL - CIO leader Richard Trumka , snowbound in Washington , D.C. , was n’t able to appear .
His place was taken by union leaders and rank - and - file activists along with legislative and Congressional figures .
“ Arnold ( Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ) believes that the economy will fix itself – he ’s still reading from the George Bush hymnal , ” joked Art Pulaski , executive secretary - treasurer of the California Labor Federation , after reporting that 2 million Californians are out of work , and there is 30 % unemployment in construction .
“ The low road economy has failed the people . ” he added .
“ I ’m tired of being in budget crises , ” declared Yvonne Walker , president of Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) Local 1000 , which represents most California state employees .
“ It ’s time for us to hit the streets and demand jobs for each and every one of us . ”
Walker said as she introduced a Local 1000 member , Renee Lee , who described how the 14 % pay cut caused by Schwarzenegger ’s furlough policy has put her house in foreclosure and left her and a five - year - old adopted grandchild in poverty .
“ I ’m tired of my baby asking why we do n’t have any money , ” said Lee .
“ Legislators need to get off their asses , ” said Operating Engineers Local 3 member , Charles Bynum , after describing how his months of employment have decreased in each of the last three years .
Now he is looking for a job to maintain medical insurance and help his family .
“ Many of my brothers and sisters are in the same situation , ” he added .
“ When you spend your money , it keeps the economy going , said Bynum . ”
It does n’t work going in reverse . ”
“ The only way we are going to grow and maintain a tax base is to create jobs now ” said California Senate President Pro Tem Darryl Steinberg from Sacramento .
“ This is my 10th year in the legislature and my 10th budget , ” he said .
“ Every year is the same : cuts , fights and the two - thirds vote , which we have to change . ”
In California , a two - thirds majority is required to pass a state budget or any tax increase , while a tax decrease only needs a majority vote .
“ We need to get going on high speed rail so 50,000 people can get to work ” Steinberg added .
“ And restoring vocational education in our schools , and ending the furlough policy . ”
Commenting on the two - third law , Sacramento Central Labor Council Executive Secretary Bill Camp , who emceed the rally , said , “ We need to remind people that this is a democracy , where the majority rules . ”
Congressman and former Lieutenant Governor John Garamendi told the demonstrators that in the perspective of Washington , the job crisis did n’t begin with the Obama administration .
“ It ’s the fault of the horrible policy of the Bush administration , ” he said .
“ We want the TARP ( Troubled Assets Relief Program ) money back for jobs , and it ’s not nearly enough . ”
The country needs to bring back WPA ( Works Program Administration ) of the 1930s , when federal funds built , libraries , schools and bridges , Garamendi said .

Mitt Romney , who is the GOP insiders ' favorite to win the GOP nomination in 2012 , went on Greta Van Susteren 's show the other night to talk about how much better a job he would be doing than President Obama .
But Greta also brought up the , um , * delicate * subject of the Tea Parties .
Of course , we 're now becoming accustomed to the Romney flip and flop maneuver .
He had it on display here .
First , he was for the Tea Parties ...
Romney : I think it shows a great deal of energy and passion on the part of the American people to say stop , we 're going the wrong way , enough already , let 's get things right in America .
And America is headed in the wrong direction -- this growing government , the increase in taxes , the more intrusivesness of government has made a lot of people very angry , and they want to see change in Washington .
They want to see the Washington politicians that have been voting for this kind of intrusive government thrown out of office .
And I think it 's a good thing .
I think Washington politicians need to understand , there 's a lot of focus and energy around what 's happening , and people are n't going to take it a lot longer .
Afore he was agin ' 'em ...
Romney :
Well , if there were a third party , and a real intent to create a strong third party , that would obviously be very damaging to the party it drew the most votes from , and if it were a Tea Party party , why , that would certainly be from conservative Republicans .
I do n't think that 's going to happen .
I think people recognize right now we 're not talking about politics , we 're talking about the country .
This is a really critical time for the country , both globally and in terms of our safety and security , but also economically .
And if we divide the conservative vote , and therefore hand over to the Democrats more years of single - party rule and Barack Obama another four years , we would have a very different country at the end of eight years of Obama rule .
And I do n't think in the final analysis that anyone is going to put their personal political aspirations above the needs of the country .
Maybe I need to clean out my ears or something , but it sure sounded to me like he was saying that voting out Obama transcends politics -- it 's a national - security issue .
If that 's what he said , well , wow .

Individual figures for universities will not come until March Hundreds of thousands of would - be students will be denied a university place because of spending cuts , says higher education body Universities UK .
Universities ' funding body
Hefce will later outline how spending on teaching , research and capital will be allocated in England in the next academic year .
For 2010 - 11 , cuts of £ 135 m have been added to " efficiency savings " of £ 180 m - with a further £ 600 m to follow .
Higher Education Minister David Lammy said the fears were " scaremongering " .
Professor Steve Smith , president of vice - chancellors ' group Universities UK , said the cuts would impact on the quality of teaching , as managers prepared to cut teaching budgets for the first time since Labour came to power .
He added that the cuts would increase competition for places .
SPENDING ON UNIVERSITIES
Finland 1.6 % Sweden 1.4 % France 1.1 % United States 1 % Germany 0.9 % UK 0.9 % Poland 0.9 % Spain 0.9 % Italy 0.7 % Japan 0.5 % Source : OECD , public spending on higher education as percentage of GDP .
Most recent figures 2006 .
( UK combined figure for England , Scotland , Wales and N.Ireland ) Mr Smith , vice chancellor of Exeter University , said : " Last year about 160,000 students who applied did n't end up going to university .
" This year , we already know that there are about another 75,000 applying for university . "
This means that more than 200,000 could miss out , he said .
He added : " So the number of students who go to university will be less than the number that actually want to go and thus there will be a lot of students this year who do not get a place at university . "
Although Universities UK represents higher education bodies across the UK , these funding arrangements relate to England .
' Meltdown '
Last month , leaders of the top universities said the programme of cuts could cause a " meltdown " in their sector .
The Russell Group of leading research universities warned that a succession of cuts could lead to universities and courses closing and much higher student ratios , damaging " gold standard " universities beyond repair .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This is wasting talent needed for an efficient and successful economy and it's extremely short - sighted .
Andy , Camberley Higher Education Minister for England , Mr Lammy , said the savings were relatively small and that he was confident that Hefce could achieve these in a way that " minimises the impact on teaching " .
He said : " Investment in higher education has gone up by 25 % since 1997 .
Next year there will be more students at university than every before in our history . "
He said that university entrance had always been a competitive business and added that the ratio of lecturers to students was higher today than it was five years ago .
The funding council is giving more detail than it normally would because of the unexpected cuts announced before Christmas .
A Hefce spokesman said it would be giving the detail of high - level decisions it had made on how to allocate funding to universities .
International comparisons
" The main purpose of this announcement is for the sector to be able to plan , " he said .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" We are issuing something that has a lot more detail this year , because of the current financial situation , because of the extra pressures . "
It will be sent out urgently to vice - chancellors by e-mail to enable them to redraw their budgets .
However , the announcement will not be broken down by university or course subject .
Universities will get those figures in March .
The savings of nearly £ 315 m are expected in 2010 - 2011 from universities ' £ 7.3 bn teaching budgets set out in the last comprehensive spending review .
However , overall spending on higher education will increase compared to last year .
Further savings of £ 600 m across the higher education , science and research budgets are required over 2011 - 2013 .
General secretary of the University and College Union Sally Hunt said the higher education system was already creaking under the pressure of government efficiency savings and the planned cuts would be a devastating blow .
" Other leading economies are investing money in universities in order to help economic growth and widen participation , yet our government seems intent on doing the opposite . "
Liberal Democrat universities spokesman Stephen Williams said the government 's target to get half of young people into university was proving to be " empty rhetoric " .
" Targeting universities for cuts in this way is setting us up to see record numbers of bright young people turned away this summer . "

Rating : 5 stars I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Guinea in West Africa and this is a very popular dish there .
This recipe is more or less the same as what they make there .
I 've had this probably 200 times and I still make it here in the US .
I do n't even use vegetable broth water is fine .
It 's also good to add a sweet starchy vegetable like sweet potatoes or butternut squash .
But the biggest difference between the African version and this recipe is how it 's served .
I was surprised to see this being served as a soup .
It 's very very rich !
In Africa they typically pour two ladels or so over a plate of rice .
And if you 're serving it over rice 2 - 3 lbs of chicken or beef turn it into a very hearty meal .

Rating : 5 stars I have made this many times and while it is wonderful as is I have tweaked it to make it a little healthier .
First I add some carrots and celery to increase the veggie content and only use about 3/4 - 1 cup peanut butter which is plenty .
If you find this is not thick enough I sometimes make a cornstarch slurry to give it the same consistency as the original .
I also use fire - roasted tomatoes in this as it adds a particular rustic flavor to it .
Either way this soup is requested all the time at my work parties !

This is just like the groundnut soup here in West Africa .
I add chicken to it and I use chicken broth instead of vegetable .

Rating : 5 stars I like this better than the African Peanut Soup from this site it has more flavor and richness thanks to more peanut butter and pepper flakes .
I made this with almond butter ( really good ) and quinoa instead of rice ( also delicious ) coconut instead of olive oil .
I would like this better with crushed tomatoes .
I added a diced sweet potato .
One review suggested using water instead of broth so I used less broth -- needed more flavor maybe cinnamon ?
Next time I will use the full amount of broth .

Yum yum yum !
Being a peanut butter lover and always looking for new taste combinations thought I 'd give this a try .
Fantastic .
If you do n't LOVE peanut butter you may want to cut it back a little .
Ends up being pretty creamy - might be too much for some .
But for me - EXCELLENT .
Definitely serve with crusty bread for dipping .
Also apple slices compliment this soup well .

Rating : 5 stars I made it pretty much as is .
Except I added African " pepper " which is like cayenne pepper .
It definitely needed it in addition to the red pepper flakes for my taste .
I threw the onions garlic and bell peppers in the food processor and it was finely chopped within a few seconds .
I used virgin coconut and red palm oils .
I recommend using a natural peanut butter : which is just peanuts and salt .
It tastes ( and looks ) like a spicy savory peanut sauce not unlike what you would find in a Chinese restaurant with duck .
I can imagine it would be nice with a roasted chicken thigh .

Tasty filling unusual soup that was devoured by my in - laws much to my surprise !
I added chicken which made it a full meal .
Add the brown rice earlier if it usually takes 40 minutes to cook or if its a ten minute Uncle Bens version use the recipe .
I used tinned tomatoes with chilli already in it to kick up the heat and organic crunchy peanut butter added to taste at the end .
Would recommend take some hot soup out and mixing it with the peanut butter as a paste or you will end up chasing spoons of it around the pan tying to get it to blend !
Already made it again .

Rating : 1 stars I made this recipe tonight and my husband and I did not care for it .
It is way too peanut - buttery and rich for our taste made me feel sick after eating half my bowl .
Too bad because the ingredients ( especially the red peppers and peanut butter ) are not cheap !

“ If the board of directors and management of Entergy were thoroughly infiltrated by antinuclear activists , I do not think they could have done a better job of destroying their own case , ” said one senator , Randolph D. Brock III , a St. Albans Republican who cast several votes friendly to the plant .
Image The Vermont Senate has voted to block a license extension for the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant in Vernon , Vt. Credit ... Vermont Yankee Corp .
In the hours of debate , one virtue of nuclear power emphasized by proponents at the national level — production of electricity without emissions of greenhouse gases — was hardly mentioned , even by supporters .
Entergy said in a statement after the vote , “ We remain determined to prove our case to the legislature . ”
Under Vermont law , any extension of the plant ’s license beyond 2012 would have to be approved by both houses .
Unless the Senate reverses itself and the House also approves an extension , the plant must close by March of that year .
All members of the House and the Senate are up for re-election in November , raising the possibility that a vote next year on the plant ’s fate could yield a different outcome .
Democrats have large majorities in both chambers .
But the company faces a struggle in allaying the concerns of lawmakers and their constituents .
In debate , senators cited estimates of over $ 1 billion for decommissioning the plant , although only about $ 450 million is on hand for the job .
Tritium leaks could raise the bill , they said .
Before debate began Wednesday morning , Entergy said it had instructed a law firm to examine the misstatements its officials had made under oath and concluded that officials had not intended to deceive the state .
It said communications had “ led to misunderstandings , ” and a result was that “ the responses were incomplete and misleading . ”
How It Should Have Ended by AJJ
There is hope , after all
The WaPo online has been given a good tongue - lashing by – so far – every single commenter on their ‘ Is Elizabeth Edwards Right to Drop John ? ’ discussion .
The forum set - up goes ; ‘ Elizabeth Edwards and her longtime husband , former senator and Presidential hopeful John Edwards , have separated , according to People magazine , via Reliable Source . …
Is Elizabeth Edwards , who is battling incurable cancer , doing the right thing by separating from John ?
Should she file for divorce ?
Weigh in below . ”
Responses range from to “ how in the world would I know whether two people I never met should stay together ?
Why would the Post have such an incredibly stupid discussion ? ” all the way to “ When The Post would offer such an idiotic , shallow , voyeuristic question for discussion , it should surprise no one that the institution of the fourth estate has failed . ”
The obvious question , ‘ is this TMZ ? ’ , is asked along the way .
Shame on WaPo .
This is cheap journalism in both senses of the word .
Once more the newspaper is called on the carpet by readers who have no difficulty seeing the difference between public interest and voyeurism .
How has WaPo fallen so low ?
Any of us who ’ve been around the block a few times work - wise know how strong the toxic effect of a few key people can be .
A whole organisational culture can shift with shocking ease from collegiality to zero sum games by the simple failure to punish bad behaviour .
As soon as a minority is rewarded for – let ’s call it non-cooperation because there ’s such a range of behaviours that can poison a workplace – then the rest look like chumps for not piling in .
But you do n’t need game theory to explain something most of us have experienced .
The nasty effect of ‘ a few bad apples ’ is nothing new .
( A striking example of a good place gone radically bad is HP .
Anyone thinking of voting for Carly Fiorina for public office should read this ) .
I ’ve no particular insight to what ’s happened in the Washington Post .
I suspect the unbearable commercial pressures have changed the balance of power between editorial and commercial people to the point where cheapo user - created content and page views trump journalistic merit .
They should listen to their readers to whom that bright line is very clear .
? If you were a comic fan and a toy fan in
Unless you 're comfortably wealthy , pathologically thin , or both , you probably go to the grocery store at least once every couple of weeks .
When you go , there 's one factor that most determines the your experience there , and it's not fluctuations in the price of ground coffee , the number of Ben & Jerry 's flavors on hand , or how gripping the National Enquirer cover stories are that week .
It 's how smoothly you move through the check - out line .
A country cannot be great without ?
great grocery store baggers — their speed , courtesy , and ability to keep our spaghetti sauce from crushing our hot dog buns is crucial to maintaining public morale .
To encourage baggers to attain new levels of excellence , the National Grocers Association holds a Best Bagger Championship every year at its annual convention in Las Vegas .
This year , on February 11 , state champions from 24 states will convene at the Paris Hotel to compete for a $ 10,000 first prize .
They may even get the chance to pit their bagging skills against David Letterman , as past winners have done , or meet President George W. Bush , who will be at the convention to deliver its keynote address .
Of course , even for elite baggers , life is n't always so glamorous .
In the 2009 documentary Ready , Set , Bag , filmmakers Justine Jacob and Alex D. da Silva introduce viewers to eight state champions as they prepare for the 2007 Best Bagger Championship .
Some are high school or college students , others are career grocery store employees , and they approach the competition with varying degrees of intensity .
" I thought it'd be fun to try it once and try to win the trip to Vegas , " says Kim Weaver , a genial , low - key mom from Pennsylvania .
" Amateurs practice till they get it right , pros practice until they can't get it wrong , " exclaims Publix store manager Joe Yaeczitis , who 's training one of his employees , an immigrant from Trinidad and Tobago named Roger Chen , to compete in the event .
While all the contestants anticipate moments of glory in the bright lights of Las Vegas , what Ready , Set , Bag illustrates most is how the recognition for doing something well , and the desire to do it even better that that recognition prompts , enriches their lives on an everyday basis .
Bagging could be drudge work , a task to endure rather than excel at , but the chance to prove one 's expertise in the heat of competition , to be cheered and rewarded for one 's efforts , makes it fun and meaningful .
No doubt this is an obvious epiphany with a potentially condescending dimension — look at the small - town baggers and their tiny big dreams !
But it 's also a ?rare one , at least in the context of the service industry .
Just as seemingly every book or movie about suburban American depicts the weird , complex wonderland that exists there as a stifling cul de sac of conformity , repressed desire , and thwarted dreams , every depiction of service industry work presents a dull hell of petty bosses , rude and thankless customers , tedious tasks , and insultingly low wages .
Whether it's in movie comedies like Clerks and Waiting , non-fiction accounts like Barbara Ehrenreich 's Nickel and Dimed , or YouTube shock videos of fast - food employees using your lunch as a handkerchief , any job that ?
involves pushing a mop or ringing a cash register is invariably portrayed as undignified and soul - deadening at best , grimly exploitative at worst , a one - way ticket to cynicism , ennui , and disgusting acts of sabotage .
Maybe the people who excel at competitive grocery bagging are just preternaturally decent .
Maybe the cameras were never around when disgruntled employees were complaining about inexplicable management policies or overbearing customers .
However arrived at , Ready , Set , Bag presents the service - industry milieu in which its story takes place as so harmonious and fulfilling it might chill Michael Moore to his very marrow .
The baggers its showcases all seem to get a high degree of satisfaction from their jobs .
They 're focused , ambitious , and eager to win the national championship , but not in the ruthless , backstabbing way of Celebrity Apprentice , Project Runway , and similar shows .
Bosses mentor their charges .
Co-workers support and take pride in their colleagues ' achievements .
Competition is an ennobling force , not a corruptive one .
In stores where an employee experiences success in competitions , others tend to follow .
A single store in Sandstone , Minnesota , population 1600 , has produced nine state champions over the last two decades .
Its teenage employees come in on their off days and bag for free to further hone their skills .
" This Best Bagger competition places a value on the bagging position , [ which ] is often not viewed upon as very prestigious , " exclaims National Grocers Association senior vice president Frank diPasquale in the movie .
" This competition really challenges them and brings out the best in people . "
When this year 's finalists take the stage in Las Vegas , they 'll get all the time they need to fill two reusable grocery bags with approximately two dozen items ?
or so .
But if they want to win , they 'd better need only 35 seconds or less .
In addition to speed , other judging criteria include weight distribution ( the two bags should be as evenly weighted as possible ) and bag - building technique .
A well - constructed bag features heavy items on the bottom , no glass items touching each other , and all crushables in the same bag .
Points are deducted for disorderly bags , damaged items , and items left on the table , amongst other potential infractions .
While the various judging criteria help turn what might be viewed as a fairly simple activity into a sport of sorts , they 're not there just for show .
The skills and ? techniques baggers must develop to do well in competition makes them better baggers in stores .
According to Ready , Set , Bag , a single bagger can serve as many as 200 customers a day and pack as many as 7000 items — if each customer ?has an average of three bags , and a bagger can pack a bag in 40 seconds rather than 60 seconds , and there are typically three customers waiting in line at any time , each customer ends up waiting in line three minutes less thanks to the speedier bagger .
Three minutes may not sound like much , but imagine the impact an entire nation of highly motivated baggers could have .
If , say , 20 million people go shopping each day , and they all have three more free minutes in their lives than they previously did , America suddenly has an extra million man-hours at its disposal each day .
Sure , at first , we 'd probably waste most of it waiting for frustratingly slow waiters , bartenders , pizza delivery men , toll - takers , and the like — but all we'd need to fix that is a few more national contests .

Chemists have severed one of the strongest bonds in chemistry - in dinitrogen - and reacted it with carbon monoxide to make useful organic compounds
Chemists have uncovered a way to sever two of the strongest bonds in chemistry - in dinitrogen ( N 2 ) and carbon monoxide ( CO ) - and make useful organic compounds .
The process works through a hafnium complex - and is an important step towards developing ways to produce important chemicals from abundant gas feedstocks .
Although nitrogen makes up 78 per cent of the atmosphere , it is not used in many industrial processes as the triple bond is difficult to break .
The exception is the Haber process to make ammonia - but this requires high pressures and temperatures , as well as hydrogen gas that usually comes from fossil fuel sources .
Alternative chemistry to break the N 2 triple bond is highly sought after and could be in great demand in the future .
Now , Paul Chirik and colleagues at Cornell University in New York , US , have found a new way to do this - and surprisingly , it works at room temperature .
" Anytime someone finds a new chemical transformation for dinitrogen , we get closer to solving one of chemistry ’s long standing holy grails " - Michael Fryzuk , University of British Columbia
’ We discovered a method to combine two simple diatomic molecules with very strong bonds : N 2 and CO , to make new organic fragments such as oxamide , which is an important slow - release fertiliser , ’ Chirik told Chemistry World .
Key to the process is a compound called hafnocene , which is a complex of hafnium metal ions with cyclopentadiene and chlorine ligands .
The complex can be activated to react with N 2 by switching the chlorine for iodine - causing each N 2 molecule to be complexed between two hafnocenes .
This bonding effectively reduces the triple bond to a single N - N bond .
At this stage , carbon monoxide is added , which breaks the final N - N bond and forms new C - N bonds .
By varying the amount of CO added , different organic compounds can be made .
’ The downside is that the process is stoichiometric , rather than catalytic - meaning that one hafnium compound is required for every N 2 molecule that is cleaved , ’ Chirik says .
’ But this does not deter us from moving forward .
We have uncovered a new reaction space and a unique transformation that we hope to apply to catalytic reactions and important industrial processes . ’
An unexpected result of the research is the reactivity of CO - which bonds with the held N 2 rather than the metal ion , as is commonly expected .
Alessandra Quadrelli at the University of Lyon , France , said : ’ We are ourselves trying to develop N - C bond formation from N 2 - but we did not fathom that stable CO could be the synthon of choice ’ .
’N - C bond formation from inert , stable and abundant molecules is a dream reaction - since so many valuable compounds in pharmacy and household products have these bonds , ’ she adds .
Michael Fryzuk , at the University of British Columbia in Canada , agrees that there is great potential in the process .
’ This work represents a whole new kind of reactivity for coordinated dinitrogen , ’ he says .
’ Anytime someone finds a new chemical transformation for dinitrogen , we get closer to solving one of chemistry ’s long standing holy grails : that of utilisation of N 2 as a feedstock for producing organonitrogen compounds . ’

Last October , NASA received a committee report that called existing planning " unsustainable . "
The agency could n't even budget the money to deorbit the International Space Station as planned in 2016 — itself a waste of the construction costs — and the vehicles needed for its planned return to the moon would n't be ready by the 2030s ... " if ever , " in the committee 's words .
So today , NASA administrator Charles Bolden announced a new five - year budget plan that significantly changes the nation 's spaceflight priorities .
A completely revamped human program
The biggest decision in the new budget is the end of the Constellation program , which included the Orion crew vehicle and Ares launch vehicles , which merged the Apollo approach to orbit with technology developed for the shuttle .
At current budget levels , the full development of these systems would take us well into the 2020s even if completed on schedule , and arrive after the planned appearance of private - sector equivalents .
Political opposition to this decision , which will mean the loss of jobs in a number of states , is already present , and many questions in the press conference that accompanied the announcement focused on this issue .
NASA staff members defended the decision when questioned about the development money already spent .
" The fact that we poured $ 9 billion into an unexecutable program does not mean that we should pour another $ 50 billion after it , " said one , " that 's what i'd tell taxpayers . "
Another argued that this did not mean a fundamental change for NASA , saying " We 're not canceling our commitment to explore space ; we 're canceling Constellation . "
Part of that commitment will involve a reprieve for the International Space Station .
Instead of being deorbited in the middle of this decade , the ISS will be treated like a national laboratory , and used to pursue research on materials and long - term human habitation in space through at least 2020 , with additional construction , including new infrastructure , planned beyond the end of the shuttle program .
The budget also includes money for an extension of the shuttle through 2011 , which will allow for the inevitable launch delays in its remaining five missions .
The remaining construction , crew exchange , and servicing will be provided by both international partners and private companies if all goes as planned .
The NASA administrators argue that this does n't represent a radical departure , as both the agency and military largely rely on commercial launch vehicles for getting hardware into space .
The only change is that we may now be relying on them for manned missions , although a few companies are already in work on manned launches .
$ 50 million in stimulus money is already allocated to private companies to support development work , and NASA appears to be considering contests like the X - Prize .
With the new vision , NASA will shift focus to the R&D that will be needed to create a sustainable human exploration program .
Over the next five years , a total of roughly $ 14 billion will be spent on three main programs .
More than half of this amount will go to the development of technology for cheaper , extended - range space flight .
This includes in - orbit fuel depots , closed - loop life support systems , and automated rendezvous and docking technology .
The goal here is clearly to develop the ability to assemble a platform for long - range human space travel from multiple unmanned launch vehicles .
Another $ 3 billion will go towards the development of heavy - lift engines and propellants .
As of the previous plan , development of heavy lift vehicles did n't get any money until 2016 , so this is being presented as an acceleration of this capability .
Finally , NASA will begin to develop what they term " robotic precursor missions , " starting with a robotic , teleoperated Moon rover .
The ultimate goal is to develop a robotic resource processing capability designed for the Moon and asteroids .
If the equipment is launched successfully , it will begin prepositioning supplies that can be used by any manned follow - on missions .
Another planned expenditure that may ultimately lower launch costs will be a major overhaul of the Kennedy Space Center .
The modernization , funded to the tune of $ 2 billion is intended to improve the efficiency of both manned and unmanned launches .
Business as usual for unmanned work
Although the manned program has been in turmoil , NASA 's unmanned programs have been very successful , so it 's no surprise that there were no surprises there .
NASA will work with the DOE to restart plutonium production for use in power long - distance unmanned vehicles .
Money is in place to to launch the Mars Science Laboratory rover in the fall of 2011 , and they have the funds to give the James Webb Space Telescope a 70 percent chance of launching in 2014 .
The Juno probe , which will orbit Jupiter , is also on track .
The big news for near - Earth missions is that NASA will try again with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory , which will provide fine - grained monitoring of carbon fluxes from space , allowing us to monitor sources and sinks of greenhouse gasses .
The first OCO failed to reach orbit , and nothing else of the same caliber is planned by any other space agency , so the decision to build a second and " refly " it , in NASA parlance , is very good news for geoscience .
The OCO will be joined by Glory , which will track aerosols and black soot ( items that can alter the climate , but are poorly monitored ) and two other environmental monitoring satellites .
These will join 15 Earth - observing systems currently in orbit .
As per existing policy , all the data obtained by these systems will be made available to any government or private organization that wishes to use them .
Programs for the identification of near earth objects , which could obviate all worries about climate change were they to become on - Earth objects , will receive another $ 16 million a year .
The big picture
Since the dawn of the space age , NASA has been the only way for a human to get to space from within the US .
Its problems with the shuttle and work on the ISS have forced it to rely on international partners for manned launch capabilities in recent years , and the Constellation program would n't have been ready to supplement Russian launches for several years , even in the most optimistic plans .
Despite all that , the new strategy represents an enormous break from tradition : NASA is out of the business of putting people into low - earth orbit , and does n't see getting back in to it .
The Agency now sees its role as doing interesting things with people once they get there , hence its emphasis on in - orbit construction , heavy lift capabilities , and resource harvesting hardware .
Given budgetary constraints and the real issues with the Constellation program , none of that is necessarily unreasonable .
But it 's also a frightening step into the unknown .
The commercial companies that NASA will be relying on have n't yet launched any crew - capable hardware .
The heavy lift and orbital assembly technology will be developed without a sweeping vision to support it ( " Maybe we 'll go to an asteroid at some point " really does n't cut it in the vision department ) .
It 's a program that may make a lot of sense , but it 's not a program that will inspire until some of the details get filled in .

There has been some buzz swirling around agave nectar and whether the sweet cactus - nectar is good for our bodies or not .
I want to help my readers be aware of the increasing number of fraudulent , poor - quality " agave " products being sold in common supermarkets around the country .
The following article will educate you on fraudulent high - fructose agave nectar and its negative health consequences , as well as the benefits of using true organic agave nectar as a sweetener .
The Downside of High - Fructose Agave Nectar
Recent claims regarding agave nectar urge us to be aware of the type of agave we are purchasing .
Many brands sold in the supermarket , claiming to be organic , are nothing more than refined fructose .
Common forms of retail - refined agave syrup sold in supermarkets do not tell consumers what has been done to the syrup in the laboratory .
While the label may claim that the agave is " organic and all - natural , " the label does not explain that the syrup has gone through an extensive process of chemical refining which changes the enzymatic structure of the syrup , converting it into man-made , chemical fructose .
Herein lies the main concern surrounding the nectar that many well - known nutritionists are recommending as a healthier sugar - substitute .
There is a direct link between man-made chemical fructose and deadly degenerative diseases .
Critics also note that once consumed , refined fructose is turned into triglyceride , which is essentially stored as body fat .
And while high fructose agave syrup does not cause the extreme spikes in blood sugar levels like common white sugar , it does have possible associations to a spectrum of health - depleting conditions such as :
Depletion of the body 's minerals
Irritation of the liver
Hardening of the arteries
A tendency towards insulin resistance , a predecessor to diabetes
Heart disease
Weight gain , and even obesity
Toxic effects is pregnant women
Rami Nagel describes agave and refined fructose as having a " lack amino acids , vitamins , minerals , pectin , and fiber .
As a result , the body does n't recognize refined fructose .
Refined fructose is processed in the body through the liver , rather than digested in the intestine .
Refined fructose robs the body of many micronutrient treasures to assimilate itself for physiological use .
While naturally occurring fruit sugars contain levulose bound to other sugars , high fructose corn syrup contains " free " ( unbound ) , chemically refined fructose .
Research indicates that free refined fructose interferes with the heart 's use of key minerals like magnesium , copper , and chromium . "
The Upside : All Agave Nectar Is Not Equal
Natural agave has been harvested traditionally in Mexico for hundreds of years .
Ranking fairly low on the glycemic load scale , a small amount of the nectar provides a larger amount of sweetness than common sugar , and thus , a little goes a long way .
The agave plant also contains saponins and fructans , phytochemicals associated with many beneficial and immune - boosting capabilities .
( Journal of Ethnopharmacology , 1996 ; 52:175-7 ) .
One of these fructans is known as inulin , a natural plant sweetener with an extremely low impact on blood sugar and cholesterol levels .
The ancient Aztecs even used the nectar as a healing salve for wounds .
Additionally , compounds derived from blue agave have been studied for their potential utility for helping colon diseases like ulcerative colitis , irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn 's disease .
Agave also holds high amounts of protein - building amino acids and alkaloids ( Plant Foods Hum Nutr 2007 ; 62:133-8 ) .
Research indicates that minimally - processed agave does provide nutrients to the human body , and may even prevent chronic disease ( Nutr Rev 2004 ; 62 : 439-42 ) .
It is also important to mention that not all agave products are created equal , and the dangerous high - fructose content cited by critics is not typical in all agave products .
Roger Clemens , a professor at USC , has stated that : " Depending on how the syrup is processed , it may or may not contain more fructose . "
My Favorite Brand of Agave Nectar
What is important to determine when purchasing agave nectar is whether the sweetener comes from a trusted source .
My personal favorite , that I use quite frequently , is Madhava Agave Nectar .
Madhava offers extremely high - quality , all - natural , 100 % organic agave nectar , made by minimal processing .
There are no chemicals used in the production of Madhava 's agave nectar from agave salmiana , and it is not cooked .
Madhava agave is produced using only low temperatures during the evaporation of excess water from the juice .
Used in moderate amounts , this low - glycemic sweetener is an excellent choice over white sugar and artificial sweeteners .
When choosing agave nectar , contact the company to make sure they are not using chemicals in the processing techniques and that it is organic .

BANGKOK — Thailand ’s Supreme Court on Friday confiscated $ 1.4 billion in frozen assets from the nation ’s fugitive former prime minister , Thaksin Shinawatra , after finding him guilty of illegally concealing his ownership of a family company and abusing his power to benefit the companies he owned .
But it softened the blow by allowing him to keep the remainder of what had been $ 2.3 billion in frozen assets , saying that “ to seize all the money would be unfair because some of it was made before Thaksin became prime minister . ”
The case resonates in Thailand beyond the assets of one man , part of a long - running and sporadically violent confrontation that has divided the country .
It has pitted the nation ’s rural and urban poor , who support Mr. Thaksin , against the established ruling class , whose control of the political system he challenged during his six years as prime minister .
“ This case is very political , ” Mr. Thaksin said during a televised response from an undisclosed location outside the country .
“ The court was used to get rid of a politician .
The ruling will be a joke for the world . ”
In a phrase : AIPAC 's foreign policy , with Cheney 's torture regime in place , to back it up .
She has already stated that she wants more Israeli settlements and more Israelis in the West Bank , and is now hinting that she would also like a full - scale war with Iran :
WALLACE : How hard do you think President Obama would be to defeat in 2012 ?
PALIN : It depends on a few things , say he played I got this from Buchanan say he played the war card .
Say he decided to declare war on Iran or decide to really come out and do whatever he could to support Israel which I would like him to do .
That changes the dynamics of what we can assume will happen between now and three years .
Because I think if the election were today , Obama would not be elected .
WALLACE : You ’re not suggesting that Obama would cynically play the war card ?
PALIN : I ’m not suggesting that , I ’m saying if he did , things would dramatically change if he decided to toughen up and do all that he can to secure our nation and secure our allies .
I think people would shift their thinking a bit .
When she was first asked about foreign policy - before she was Kristolized by Randy Scheuneman - she said she wanted an exit plan for Iraq and had only heard about the " surge " " on the news . "
Now she is a paid - up neocon fanatic .
Notice that in her view , Obama is not actually supporting Israel at the moment .
And yet Israel pre-emptively tried to kill Obama 's attempt to reach out to the Muslim world by the brutal , polarizing Gaza campaign , has adamantly refused to freeze all settlements on the West Bank , and has done its usual brilliant job of lobbying the US Congress to prevent any leverage over the country .
In Jerusalem , recently , two US senators , John McCain and Joe Lieberman , openly told the Israelis that they had the power to prevent Obama from conducting foreign policy with respect to Israel , if it conflicted with the agenda of the Israeli government .
Obama 's clearest failure , in fact , in his first year is in trying to budge Israel from its suicidal path .

It seems as though the first era of digital music may have come to an end .
Napster died , P2P lived in some black market twilight zone , streaming services on ad - supported revenue were suffocated by unsustainably high licensing fees , and subscription services sputtered along , never quite capturing the imaginations of music fans .
2009 ended in a flurry of acquisitions ( LaLa , iLike ) , launches ( Vevo ) and shutdowns ( iMeem ) , which dramatically rearranged the digital music landscape .
When the dust finally settles , expect digital music to begin anew .
With that in mind , here are my five predictions for music in 2010 .
1. Labels Will Get Smart
It ’s been coming for more than a decade , but major labels are starting to grasp the digital opportunity .
They ’re licensing music on more sustainable terms , diversifying their business model , investing in new technology and , most critically , understanding more than ever what it means to be truly consumer - led .
As market leaders , major labels have the resources and the networks to profit most from the changes currently taking place .
The move from physical to digital has n’t been as fast as many people might have wished , but that ’s because digital still does n’t pay like physical does .
CDs , when they sell well , still mean big money .
Digital is n’t like that .
But that ’s changing , and as major labels have shrunk , their capacity for change has increased .
Expect 2010 to be the year that the bad press on the major labels starts becoming more favorable .
The promises of the digital age — deeper understanding of the music consumer , integrated ticketing and merchandise , direct - to - consumer sales , and fans as marketing teams — are all about to become a reality , and major labels will lead the charge .
2. Physical CD Sales Will Continue to Decline
To ensure at least one of my predictions comes true , I ’m going to forecast that globally , sales of physical CDs will decline in 2010 .
That ’s one thing you can definitely count on .
3. Release Strategies Will Evolve
The traditional model of building buzz through radio singles followed by a carefully timed album launch will still be the norm for commercial pop music .
But at the edges , we ’re going to start seeing a new model for releasing music that ’s more attuned to the diverse community of music consumers .
The new model , pioneered by Topspin Media , will be the multi-tiered , staggered release .
Artists will offer free , full streams and selected downloads early to the curious and the devoted , building their fanbase as they grow .
Traditional release schedules will follow , in tandem with more innovative products , at more diverse prices , to more accurately segmented groups of fans .
Rather than just a plastic CD , we ’ll start seeing multiple tiers of music product : free streams and low quality mp3s , simple digital and physical packages , enhanced audio and packaging on digital and physical releases , and then levels of premium products including vinyl , merchandise , and increased access to the artist .
We still think of music in its physical form as a CD on the shelf .
Increasingly , we ’re going to understand it as a suite of music products — T - Shirts , mugs , books , framed art , signed lyric sheets , USBs , and once - in - a - lifetime music experiences .
4. Music Will Live Legitimately in the Cloud
It ’s been talked about for a number of years , but 2010 could be the year we start thinking of music less as a finite product and more as an infinite , on - demand reservoir to be accessed at any time for a fee .
This process will roll out in tandem with the evolution of music " products . "
Even if music is universally accessible , it 's still key to people ’s idenity .
We still need something to put on a coffee table , something to pass to friends , something to put under the Christmas tree and something to signal to the world that " this music is part of me and I want you to know it . "
iTunes , as ever , is in the driver ’s seat to make the most of this change .
Its acquisition of LaLa could see them own the streaming market as it currently owns digital music .
Spotify ’s buzz seems to have cooled , but it ’s still the best - placed streaming service to take advantage of the cloud ’s potential .
Grooveshark ’s growth , if it continues , is going to make it a serious player in the streaming game .
MySpace , with iMeem and iLike in its back pocket may also consolidate its place in the land of the streaming .
And finally , Google –- who owns the bridge over the moat , digitally speaking –- could pull the rug from everyone and facilitate properly integrated music streaming into its search platform .
Whoever emerges at the front of this pack will be in new territory , providing access to the world ’s music , anytime , anywhere on any device .
5. Who Knows ?
There ’s some as - yet untested consumer models building momentum .
Guvera is promising the world , not just to the music industry , but to advertisers as well .
Whether consumers buy into its advertisement for content exchange remains to be seen .
Rdio , with serious pedigree and some big money backing it , has n’t poked its head up completely yet , but you can be assured that whatever it offers is n’t going to be lightweight .
Lost in all the buzz is the fact that some legacy digital music companies — Last .
FM , Pandora and MySpace to name a few — still have the established brands , the existing customer base , and the revenue streams that preserve their lives beyond the froth of the tech / music blogosphere .
And of course , there ’s Facebook .
The biggest country in the world ( or soon to be ) , Facebook and music have always been awkward bedfellows .
If Zuckerberg and Co. can figure a way to integrate music with the Facebook platform , the existing user base would guarantee a big chunk of the market overnight .
It all adds up to create a big void of uncertainty , one that will be filled in the way the web knows best — by its end -users .
What those end - users decide they love will ultimately determine the winners and losers in the digital music economy .
As a passionate music fan , I ca n’t wait for the competition to heat up .
For those on the digital frontier , music really is better than it ’s ever been .

This Friday ’s update is just a Threat of Peace issue .
Here ’s the official news :
The twenty - fifth issue of Threat of Peace™ begins in the heat of the fight between the Jedi and the Sith in Dantooine ’s crystal caves .
Lord Baras confronts Satele Shan with the fact that her Master was responsible for the attacks that threatened the peace process .
When Satele hesitates , Lord Baras tries to urge her towards the dark side , even as Master Dar ’Nala screams at Satele to strike the Sith Lord down …
Check out the latest issue of Threat of Peace now .
And it ’ll likely remain fairly sparse for the next few weeks as Sean noted on the official forums :
While we have announced our target launch window , we also realize there is a lot of information to release between now and then .
We met with the development team soon after returning from the holiday break and discussed some of the information we want to release .
In going over that , we decided to wait on a few things to ensure we are giving the community the most accurate information possible .
We understand that pretty much everyone would love to have all the information about The Old Republic now but we would n’t be serving the community properly if we told you all about a particular feature or mechanic only for it to be completely different than the way we explained it when The Old Republic releases .
We definitely have some new reveals and announcements coming up but I wanted to inform everyone that our next couple of updates wo n’t be those .
And while I ’d like nothing better than to tell you what is on the horizon , I ca n’t for the very same reason as I talked about above .
We have a plan on what information we want to release and when we want to release it but we always make sure the rest of the team is confident with the information we are releasing before we put it out there .
Ah well , so it goes .
With more than a year to go before release we ’ll have to be patient one way or the other anyway .

Janice Shaw Crouse of The Beverly LaHaye Institute joined the EagleForum ’s Phyllis Schafly and Tim Goeglein of Focus on the Family for a CPAC panel entitled “ Saving Freedom from The Enemies of Our Values . ”
While Schlafly spent most of her speech rambling on about the internal enemies of the conservative movement , namely RINOs and Rockefeller Republicans , and Goeglein spent most of his time quoting other people , Crouse got right down to business , explaining that the those who are undermining our families , our morals , and our values are making today ’s children susceptible to becoming the next Hitler Youth :
Our chance of finding alien life is greater than ever , says Britain 's top astronomer
The chance of discovering alien life is greater than ever thanks to improving technology , Britain 's leading astronomer said today .
Lord Rees , the president of the Royal Society and Astronomer Royal , believes new space telescopes will help us focus our search because they are capable of detecting earth - like planets around distant stars .
‘ Technology has advanced so that for the very first time we can actually have the realistic hope of detecting planets no bigger than the earth orbiting other stars , ’ he said .
Aid for eyes :
The Hubble Space Telescope can help us see further into space
‘( We ’ll be able to learn ) whether they have continents and oceans , learning what type of atmosphere they have . ’
His comments come as scientists gather in London for an international conference to discuss the prospect of discovering extra-terrestrial life .
Confident : Lord Rees , the Astronomer Royal , believes new telescopes will help us focus our search for aliens in space
Among topics being discussed is the fascinating possibility that evidence of alien life may even be found on Earth .
Professor Paul Davies , a physicist from Arizona State University , believes that instead of scanning the skies , we should probe inhospitable areas such as deserts for signs of ‘ weird ’ microbes that might belong to a ‘ shadow biosphere ’ .
‘ We need to give up the notion that ET is sending us some sort of customised message and take a new approach , ’ he told The Times .
But the majority of the scientific community believe the search in outer space remains our best bet for finding aliens .
This week marks the 50th anniversary of the Search for Extra - Terrestrial Intelligence programme .
Scientists scanning the skies for alien radio broadcasts have so far have only heard static .
But Lord Rees is optimistic that we may one day make a discovery .
‘ Were we to find life , even the simplest life , elsewhere that would clearly be one of the great discoveries of the 21st Century .
‘ I suspect there could be life and intelligence out there in forms that we ca n’t conceive .
‘ And there could , of course , be forms of intelligence beyond human capacity , beyond as much as we are beyond a chimpanzee . ’
The debate over where to search for aliens is a hot topic among scientists .
Home bet : U.S. physicist Paul Davies says we should search on Earth instead
Professor Davies , who speaks at the Royal Society tomorrow , will tomorrow argue that demonstrating that life has appeared more than once on Earth would be the best evidence yet that it exists elsewhere in the universe .
Felissa Wolfe - Simon , from the U.S. Geological Survey , is currently looking at the possibility that arsenic , found in contaminated places such as the Mono Lake in California , might support forms of life in the same way as other life forms use phosphorous .
But Professor Colin Pillinger , who led the Beagle 2 Mars landing mission and is due to speak at the Royal Society today , remains sceptical of focusing our search on Earth .
He said : ‘ I prefer to deal in scientific fact - this is wildly science fiction .
You ’d be off your trolley to go searching for arsenic - based life . ’
Instead , he argues the Red Planet remains our best bet for finding life .
The conference , whose audience will include representatives of Nasa , the European Space Agency and the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs , will also discuss how humans might respond to the discovery of extra-terrestrial intelligence .
Albert Harrison , the from University of California , said : ‘ It is easy to imagine scenarios resulting in widespread psychological disintegration and social chaos .
‘ But historical prototypes , reactions to false alarms and survey results suggest that the predominant response to the discovery of a microwave transmission from light years away is likely to be equanimity , perhaps even delight . ’
Demonstration as millions of striking Greek workers prepare to pour on to the streets tomorrow to protest against austerity measures aimed at ending a debt crisis
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Militant trade unionists blockaded the entrance to the Athens stock exchange today as millions of striking Greek workers prepared to pour on to the streets to protest against austerity measures aimed at ending a debt crisis that has sent tremors through the eurozone .
The demonstration , by protesters affiliated to the communist party , came on the eve of a 24 - hour general strike that is expected to bring Greece to a standstill .
Unions described it as yet another sign of the labour unrest the socialist government can expect from spending cuts they fear will deepen the country 's recession .
" The measures call for low - income Greeks to carry the burden and no one else , " said Giorgos Perros , one of the protest leaders .
" We believe that stock market indices – gauges of wealth – should halt for a day . "
The action coincided with a further blow for the Greek economy as the credit agency Fitch downgraded the ratings of the nation 's four largest banks a notch from BBB + to BBB .
It warned that the outlook for National Bank , Alpha Bank , EFG Eurobank and Pireaus Bank remained negative .
Explaining its decision , Fitch said the measures – announced in a bid to contain the crisis – would inevitably affect customer appetite for loans and hurt the banks ' profits .
" [ They ] will have a significant effect on the real economy , affecting loan demand and putting additional pressure on asset quality , " the agency said .
Analysts said the downgrade would make it harder for the banks to borrow money , and more expensive for the government to access loans .
Under pressure from markets and eurozone peers , prime minister George Papandreou has announced an ambitious program to slash the country 's ballooning public sector deficit from 12.7 % to just under the permitted EU level of 3 % of GDP by 2012 .
The deficit - cutting policies include a freeze on public sector salaries , a rise in the retirement age to 63 by 2015 , the slashing of state bonuses , controls to tame widespread tax evasion and higher levies on fuel , alcohol and luxury goods .
Greece has been given until mid-March by the EU to prove the measures are effective .
Eurozone finance ministers have already warned that tougher austerity measures may have to be taken if progress is deemed insufficient .
In an indication of the close monitoring Athens can expect , a team of officials from the European commission , European Central Bank and the IMF arrived in the Greek capital today to start a three - day surveillance tour .
The visit came as Olivier Blanchard , the head of the IMF , warned that Greece was among the European countries that faced up to 20 years of " extremely painful " belt - tightening .
Thanks to the 1000 + developers who participated in our ruby community survey a few weeks back .
Here are the results as we head into 2010 .
There are result reports linked to from within each section , and this post does not comprehensively list all the results , so click through if you ’re interested .
I ’d like to apologize to the dozens of people who felt personally wronged by this survey .
There are questions that are too narrow or too broad .
There are questions that are missing options .
There are questions that assume too much about an “ either / or ” scenario , when people really behave differently depending on context .
There are questions which insult people ’s core beliefs , I guess .
Fortunately for all of us , the results of this survey are n’t being used to decide anything too important .
The demographics results show that PHP ( 36 % ) and Java ( 22 % ) are the dominant “ prior languages ” of many ruby developers .
Notably , we left out Python .
Sorry python folks .
We also see that more than half the people who took the survey work on ruby professionally on a small team .
Textmate ( 51 % ) wins the editor battle , with vim ( 21 % ) in second place - and “ Distributed VCS ” ( git , hg , etc ) dominates ( 83 % ) the version control section .
I ’m sure that credit and thanks are due to the github team for building a product which makes using a great VCS tool even better .
The results show that in regard to an 80 character line limit , the “ modern displays are wide enough to not enforce a limit ” position wins out , though not with a majority .
The questions about keyword spacing , and blank lines are fairly evenly split .
A solid 75 % of people always use parentheses on method definition – maybe enough to justify criticizing people who do n’t ?
The results ( part 1 , part 2 ) show a strong preference for “ self.method_name ” over “ class << self ” for class method definitions and for only using exceptions in exceptional situations .
The results show that a slight majority prefer to disallow null in boolean columns – but most are willing to allow NULL in Integer and String columns .
Results are split on adding indexing “ only when performance issue ” vs proactively adding them to foreign key columns ahead of time .
The results that many people use a shared folder for “ global partials ” , and show little consensus on how / where to send email from .
I think this question got the most “ other ” replies – let us know how else you ’re sending email in the comments .
The results show that ruby programmers prefer meaningful variable names , and only like to document code when it ’s complex and needs explanation .
Almost 80 % have committed a code change which effects only code formatting and not functionality .
Maybe most encouragingly , when asked about whether the types of questions in the survey mattered or were a huge waste of time , nearly 90 % chose the “ I think it ’s worth caring about your craft , and these questions are professionally relevant ” option .
From our experience at conferences and user group events , that seems consistent with the commitment to quality and best practices that exists in the ruby community .

Note : Nancy Atkinson is at Kennedy Space Center covering the launch of STS - 130
The official countdown clock is ticking for the STS - 130 mission of space shuttle Endeavour to the International Space Station .
This is the last planned night launch for the shuttle program , with a scheduled liftoff time of 9:39:47 GMT ( 4:39:47 a.m. EST ) on Sunday , February 7 .
“ Everything thus far is going exceeding well … we ’re right on schedule where we ’re supposed to be and we ’ll continue to work through the day on our preparations , ” said NASA Test Director Jeff Spaulding during this morning ’s L - 3 Countdown Status Briefing at KSC .
The weather forecast might be the only issue , as forecasters are predicting a 70 % chance of favorable weather , with high winds being the only concern for Sunday morning .
The seven - member crew will bring the Tranquility Node and a “ cupola , ” an observation deck for a full 360 degree view of Earth and the station .
It will also serve as a robotic work station .
With these new additions , the ISS will be 98 % complete .
Tranquility , also known as Node 3 was built in Italy under direction of ESA , in coordination with NASA .
“ It is one of the most complex modules we ’ve brought to the station , ” said NASA Payload Manager Joe Delai .
“ Node 3 is over 3,600 kg ( 8,000 lbs ) heavier than any other module , ( with a total weight of 15,115 kg ( 33,325 lbs . )
Delai said adding the modules will make the ISS larger than a five bedroom house .
With all the storage space in Tranquility , the ISS will in total be able to house 100 telephone booth - sized racks and store the supportive equip to allow for a 6 - person crew on the ISS .
Delai said they are taking advantage of the 7 X 4 meter ( 24 X 14 ft ) volume of the Node and bringing 33 bags of stowage containing 485 kg ( 1,068 lbs ) of provisions for the crew .
Preparations and tests at Launch Pad 39A will continue with final flight crew stowage occurring after communications checks Saturday .
The rotating service structure that protects the shuttle from weather prior to launch will be moved away from the vehicle at about 8 a.m. EST Saturday , and we hope to bring you pictures and an update at that time .
For more pictures and an inside look at what it is like to cover a space shuttle launch , I ’m writing about my adventures on my personal blog .

CHICAGO – With frustration mounting over the economic crisis and its devastating impact on city services , Mayor Richard M. Daley blasted US funding for military occupation in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Speaking to the Feb. 9 Chicago Neighborhood Development Awards dinner , Daley pleaded for money being spent on war to be redirected to social needs .
The speech marks an about face for the mayor .
The Daley administration has engaged in ugly confrontations with anti-war protesters since 2003 including the mass arrest of 800 marchers protesting the invasion of Iraq .
“ Just think of all the money that we spend on wars to save the world .
Today we ca n’t save America .
Why do we always have to go to war , continually , why ca n’t we rebuild America ?
Why is it we have to take $ 300 or $ 400 billion . . . and then tell people we ’re only going to be there for a year and we ’re coming home . . . and then we ’ll declare victory , ” said the mayor , whose son Patrick is facing overseas redeployment .
“ What is it about America ? ” Daley asked .
“ How did we start this century with 10 years of war ?
Ten years of war !
Where are the anti-war people ?
I look down at the Dirksen Center ( site of many anti-war protests ) .
Where are they ?
They ’ve disappeared !
What happened ?
I thought war was evil ?
Where are the people who believed in their heart against George Bush .
What happened ?
“ But do n’t you know it ’s a political issue , ” said Daley .
“ We won the election .
Now we go home . ”
The US government has now spent $ 961 billion on both the Iraq and Afghanistan military occupations , including $ 253 billion to Afghanistan .
Daley has become alarmed over the crisis state of city finances , despite efforts to plug the gaps including massive privatization of city assets .
He spoke as the Chicago Transit Authority was slashing $ 100 million from its budget by laying off 1,100 transit workers , resulting in service cuts on 119 bus routes and 7 train lines .
Daley had demanded transit workers make wage , health care and work rule concessions which were rejected by the Amalgamated Transit Union Locals 241 and 308 who represent bus and train workers .
ATU Local 241 is threatening to engage in a work to rule protest against the layoffs .
Last summer Daley forced city worker unions to reopen contracts and make concessions .
Nearly 500 other public workers were laid off when AFSCME and Teamsters refused concessions , resulting in curtailing of garbage pick up and shorter library hours among other service cuts .
Daley also imposed a 6 % cut in all city departments on Feb. 6 , except for public safety .
This came after more cuts were made in the 2010 budget to close a $ 520 million deficit .
To close the gap , the city exhausted funds from the recent privatization of parking meters that caused a public uproar .
“ It ’s really a realignment of America , ” Daley told the awards dinner .
“ It ’s not just a recession where tomorrow everyone is going to go back to work .
It ’s not going to be like that .
It ’s much more a restructuring of America and it ’s changing rapidly . ”
Chicago can’t appeal to the Illinois state government for help .
The state has a $ 13 billion budget deficit and can’t pay its bills .
It faces a backlog of $ 3.7 billion in bills to school districts , local governments , social service agencies and others around Illinois .
And an additional $ 2.3 billion in short - term loans comes due next month .

There ’s a reason Abiding Truth Ministries chief Scott Lively , along with faith - based hate leaders Don Schmierer and Caleb Lee Brundidge , finds himself tied to Uganda ’s Kill The Gays bill : Because he ’s one of the most vocal Americans who traveled there , met with religious , community , and political leaders , and tried exporting his homophobia across the Atlantic Ocean .
And now arrives video of him doing just that .
Somewhere between “ outright creating and promoting ” the Anti-Homosexuality Bill and “ merely recommending sanctions against Uganda ’s gays ” lies the truth about Lively ’s involvement .
He just got done defending himself against charges he helped orchestrate the bill , at the same time reminding everyone that he ’s a drug addict and alcoholic who thinks therapy for homos is the right course of action .
Now , in video footage obtained by Box Turtle Bulletin of Lively ’s appearance at a conference in Kampala in March , his rhetoric is plain as day .
Though not all that surprising , given what we know about Lively .
And while the footage does n’t reveal a smoking gun ( i.e. Lively recommending lawmakers execute gays ) , it paints Lively ’s involvement in Uganda ’s perpetration of Uganda ’s homophobia .
Of course , Lively eschews the reputation as a “ hatemonger , the same as a racist ” because he ’s “ a Christian , I ’m not against people on any basis … I do n’t want violence against them . ”
Please do n’t confuse Lively ’s speech as a stand - up routine , as we almost did .

Many of us have long suspected that the Tinner Family — Father Freidrich and brothers Marco and Urs — Swiss businessman who participated in the AQ Khan network — were also US intelligence assets ( See Urs Tinner and Tinner Talks ) .
World Radio Switzerland reports that a Swiss court ruling “ confirms ” that the Tinners were assets — though how this was confirmed is not made clear :
For the first time , it ’s been officially confirmed that the Swiss brothers Urs and Marco Tinner did work for the American Central Intelligence Agency , the CIA .
The brothers and their father have been suspected of smuggling nuclear secrets for a group that supplied weapons components to Libya .
The documents related to their case have been the subject of dispute – the Americans and some members of the Swiss government have wanted the documents destroyed .
The Tinners and the CIA denied that they were working together but information revealed in a ruling today from the Federal Court confirms that there was a secret collaboration between them .
The case against the Tinners continues .
Update | 8:33 23 February 2009
In the comments , reader Nik posts the relevant passage of the document , in which the court notes that “ die Tinners auch für die USA gearbeitet hätten . ”
Latest stage of ID cards to be rolled out in London
By Jerry Thomas
The Politics Show , BBC London
All 16 to 24 year olds in London will be invited to take part in the scheme London is about to see the roll - out of the latest stage of the government 's identity card scheme .
All 16 to 24 - year - olds in the city will be invited to carry a voluntary card , which will cost them £ 30 .
They can be used in place of a passport while travelling within Europe , but not outside , and can also be used as proof of age and identity in shops and bars .
A voluntary scheme for British citizens was introduced in Greater Manchester in November - so far 3,500 have signed up .
Compulsory cards
The government has already begun to issue the first compulsory ID cards to foreign nationals .
By 2014/2015 some 90 % of all foreign nationals across the country will have been issued with an identity card .
London is at the forefront of the trials due to the large amount of foreign nationals living in the city .
With about one million non-EU residents , approximately one in seven Londoners will be forced to carry a card .
Peter Fawcett , 21 , will be the first person to get a National Identity Card in London .
He told the Politics Show London : " I 'd looked at other ways of getting identity cards , getting a provisional licence , that 's more expensive and really this is the cheapest option for me .
" I can put this identity card in my wallet , which is really good .
If you lose your passport it is so much more expensive to replace . "
Isabella Sankey , director of policy at Liberty , disagrees .
She told the Politics Show London : " There are far better ways to prove your age than by becoming a guinea pig in the government 's disastrous identity experiment .
" It 's a cheap shot to target the young with crude enticements , but savvy multi-cultural London will reject this divisive and unnecessary scheme . "
Prior consent
At the core of this debate is the National Identity Register ( NIR ) , the database that will hold the information .
In its scope and the amount of information held , it will be unlike any other system in the world .
The NIR is designed to be up and running by 2011 / 12 and the information will be collected from people when they next renew their passports , including biometric and traditional information .
In the end the difference between a passport and ID card will be slim .
People will be able to travel to Europe on an ID card .
The NIR will be accessible by up to an estimated 200 government bodies and 40,000 private sector organisations , although mostly only with an individual 's prior consent .
The cost of the entire scheme for the next 10 years is put at £ 4.7 bn .
Of this only about 10 % will go on the cards .
Some 20 % will go on the National Identity Register and the remainder is to upgrade the passport to include biometrics , replace existing applications and enrolment systems and the passport database .
One London School of Economics study in 2005 put the cost of the scheme at between £ 10bn and £ 19bn .

When Gary Webster was celebrating the announcement of his appointment to the TTC ’s top job in June 2007 , customer service was an issue high on his agenda .
“ We ’re moving into an era of expansion and modernization .
Our customers have high expectations .
You want the bus or the streetcar to be a choice for them .
That has n’t been our focus , ” he told the Star then .
Webster has been embarrassed and frustrated by the headlines thudding on his doorstep since November , he said in an interview this week .
Mostly focused on how the TTC treats its riders , the news has all been bad : fare hikes ; token hoarding ; ticket lines ; and most infamously , sleeping , surly staff .
“ You wind the clock back and you say : ‘ Did we know we had issues ? ’
Yes , we did , ” he said Thursday in his corner office above the Davisville subway station .
But crisis ?
“ I ’ve never felt it was a crisis , ” he said .
“ I ’ve always had a problem with the way it ’s been typified in the paper . ”
He admits , however , that he may have underestimated the dissatisfaction of a sleeping giant that began to roar as lineups at collector booths lengthened during the Christmas shopping season .
“ If you do n’t have these problems , you ’re not going to be on the front page of the newspaper .
We did acknowledge that .
We did n’t argue , ” he said .
A 35 - year TTC employee , Webster believed the system was already tackling its customer service problems , in part through its internal Work Safe , Home Safe campaign , which has reduced injury and illness rates among the system ’s 12,500 employees .
Dress code and courtesy were discussed with employees as one means of reducing the risk of assault frontline transit workers face .
“ If I ’m an operator and I ’ve got my shirt and tie on and I present myself in the professional way , and I welcome the customer in an appropriate way — we think that goes a long way to developing a relationship of respect between the two and reduces the likelihood of a conflict , ” said Webster .
He admits the rate of assault on TTC drivers remains stubbornly high .
But if expectations of dress and courtesy were discussed in the past , they have n’t always been enforced .
And that is changing .
Fifty TTC supervisors are already being re-deployed from control rooms to the city streets , both to support staff and , where appropriate , correct them .
But Webster admits it ’s still a daunting task , with about 160 supervisors to oversee about 3,000 drivers during a typical weekday rush .
And next time there ’s a subway shutdown , collectors will be coming out of their booths .
With the help of new signage and announcements , they will be redirecting passengers and , if they wo n’t be able to get where they ’re going , stop them before they drop a token in the box .
That kind of service was expected of them before , too , but it may not have been communicated and supported properly , says Webster .
In the next few months , every collector will receive training on how to act in such situations , and new signs will be placed to help redirect riders .
For his own part , Webster has been busy talking to transit officials in Philadephia and Montreal about how they have met similar challenges .
Meantime , he ’s still offering up some good news about the TTC to anyone who will listen , although he recognizes there ’s not much appetite for it :
• Ridership is at a record high .
Early results show even January ’s fare increase did n’t bring the numbers down as expected .
• There ’s never been more service on the street .
The bus fleet , at least , is mostly new , and new subway cars will be coming later this year .
• For the first time in a decade , the TTC is preparing to break ground on a subway extension .
The SRT is also being renovated and three new LRT lines are on the way .

• The system is increasingly accessible .
More than 90 per cent of buses are fully accessible and 75 per cent of all riders board at accessible stations or vehicles .
Is the customer always right on the TTC ?
“ No , ” says Webster .
“ But here ’s the thing :
You do n’t start with the customer being wrong .
You do n’t dismiss them out of hand . ”

One autumn day in 1964 , Elisabeth Kübler - Ross , a Swiss - born psychiatrist , was working in her garden and fretting about a lecture she had to give .
Earlier that week , a mentor of hers , who taught psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine , had asked her to speak to a large group of medical students on a topic of her choice .
Kübler - Ross was nervous about public speaking , and could n’t think of a subject that would hold the students ’ attention .
But , as she raked fallen leaves , her thoughts turned to death : Many of her plants , she reflected , would probably die in the coming frost .
Her own father had died in the fall , three years earlier , at home in Switzerland , peaceful and aware of what was taking place .
Kübler - Ross had found her topic .
She would talk about how American doctors — who , in her experience , were skittish around seriously ill patients — should approach death and dying .
Elisabeth Kübler - Ross ’s “ stage theory ” of grief captured the popular imagination , but the reality can be far messier and tenacious .
Photograph by Jenny Lynn
Kübler - Ross prepared a two - part lecture .
The first part looked at how various cultures approach death .
For the second , she brought a dying patient to class to talk with the students .
Asking around at the hospital , she found Linda , a sixteen - year - old girl with incurable leukemia .
Linda ’s mother had just taken out an ad in a local newspaper asking readers to send Linda get - well and sweet - sixteen cards .
Linda was disgusted by the pretense that her health would improve .
She agreed to visit the class , where she spoke openly about how she felt .
The students , Kübler - Ross observed , were rapt but nervous .
They avoided dealing with the source of their discomfort — the shock of seeing an articulate , lovely young woman on the verge of death — by asking an abundance of clinical questions about her symptoms .
Soon afterward , as her biographer , Derek Gill , relates , Kübler - Ross took a job as an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Chicago .
Four students from the Chicago Theological Seminary learned that she was interested in terminal illness and asked if she might help them study dying people ’s needs .
Kübler - Ross agreed to try .
At Chicago ’s Billings Hospital , she began a series of seminars , interviewing patients about what it felt like to die .
The interviews took place in front of a one - way mirror , with students observing on the other side .
This way , Kübler - Ross gave the patients some privacy while accommodating the growing number of students who wanted to watch .
Many of Kübler - Ross ’s peers at the hospital felt that the seminars were exploitative and cruel , ghoulishly forcing patients to contemplate their own deaths .
At the time , doctors believed that people did n’t want or need to know how ill they were .
They couched the truth in euphemisms , or told the bad news only to the family .
Kübler - Ross saw this indirection as a form of cowardice that ran counter to the basic humanity a doctor owed his patients .
Too many doctors bridled at even admitting that a patient was “ terminal . ”
Death , she felt , had been exiled from medicine .
Kübler - Ross began to work on a book outlining what she learned in her work with the dying .
It came out in 1969 , and , shortly afterward , Life published an article about one of her seminars .
( “ A gasp of shock jumped through the watchers , ” the Life reporter wrote .
“ Eva ’s bearing and beauty flew against the truth that the young woman was terribly ill . ” )
Kübler - Ross received stacks of mail from readers thanking her for starting a conversation about death .
Angered by the article and its focus on death , the hospital administrators did not renew her contract .
But it did n’t matter .
Her book , “ On Death and Dying , ” became a best - seller .
Soon , Kübler - Ross was lecturing at hospitals and universities across the country .
Her argument was that patients often knew that they were dying , and preferred to have others acknowledge their situation :
“ The patient is in the process of losing everything and everybody he loves .
If he is allowed to express his sorrow he will find a final acceptance much easier . ”
And she posited that the dying underwent five stages : denial , anger , bargaining , depression , and acceptance .
The “ stage theory , ” as it came to be known , quickly created a paradigm for how Americans die .
It eventually created a paradigm , too , for how Americans grieve : Kübler - Ross suggested that families went through the same stages as the patients .
Decades later , she produced a follow - up to “ On Death and Dying ” called “ On Grief and Grieving ” ( 2005 ) , explaining in detail how the stages apply to mourning .
Today , Kübler - Ross ’s theory is taken as the definitive account of how we grieve .
It pervades pop culture — the opening episodes of this season ’s “ Grey ’s Anatomy ” were structured around the five stages — and it shapes our interactions with the bereaved .
After my mother died , on Christmas of 2008 , near - strangers urged me to learn about “ the stages ” I would be moving through .
Perhaps the stage theory of grief caught on so quickly because it made loss sound controllable .
The trouble is that it turns out largely to be a fiction , based more on anecdotal observation than empirical evidence .
Though Kübler - Ross captured the range of emotions that mourners experience , new research suggests that grief and mourning do n’t follow a checklist ; they ’re complicated and untidy processes , less like a progression of stages and more like an ongoing process — sometimes one that never fully ends .
Perhaps the most enduring psychiatric idea about grief , for instance , is the idea that people need to “ let go ” in order to move on ; yet studies have shown that some mourners hold on to a relationship with the deceased with no notable ill effects .
( In China , mourners regularly speak to dead ancestors , and one study has shown that the bereaved there suffer less long - term distress than bereaved Americans do . )
At the end of her life , Kübler - Ross herself recognized how far astray our understanding of grief had gone .
In “ On Grief and Grieving , ” she insisted that the stages were “ never meant to help tuck messy emotions into neat packages . ”
If her injunction went unheeded , perhaps it is because the messiness of grief is what makes us uncomfortable .
Anyone who has experienced grief can testify that it is more complex than mere despondency .
“ No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear , ” C. S. Lewis wrote in “ A Grief Observed , ” his slim account of the months after the death of his wife , from cancer .
Scientists have found that grief , like fear , is a stress reaction , attended by deep physiological changes .
Levels of stress hormones like cortisol increase .
Sleep patterns are disrupted .
The immune system is weakened .
Mourners may experience loss of appetite , palpitations , even hallucinations .
They sometimes imagine that the deceased has appeared to them , in the form of a bird , say , or a cat .
It is not unusual for a mourner to talk out loud — to cry out — to a lost one , in an elevator , or while walking the dog .
The first systematic survey of grief was conducted by Erich Lindemann , a psychiatrist at Harvard , who studied a hundred and one bereaved patients at the Harvard Medical School , including relatives of soldiers and survivors of the infamous Cocoanut Grove fire of 1942 .
( Nearly five hundred people died in that incident , trapped in a Boston night club by a revolving front door and side exits welded shut to prevent customers from ducking out without settling their bills . )
Lindemann ’s sample contained a high percentage of people who had lost someone in a traumatic way , but his main conclusions have been borne out by other researchers .
So - called “ normal ” grief is marked by recurring floods of “ somatic distress ” lasting twenty minutes to an hour , comprising symptoms of breathlessness , weakness , and “ tension or mental pain , ” in Lindemann ’s words .
“ There is restlessness , inability to sit still , moving about in an aimless fashion , continually searching for something to do . ”
Often , bereaved people feel hostile toward friends or doctors and isolate themselves .
Typically , they are preoccupied by images of the dead .
Lindemann ’s work was exceptional in its detailed analysis of the experience of the grieving .
Yet his conception of grief was , if anything , more rigid than Kübler - Ross ’s : he believed that most people needed only four to six weeks , and eight to ten sessions with a psychiatrist , to get over a loss .
Psychiatrists today , following Lindemann ’s lead , distinguish between “ normal ” grief and “ complicated ” or “ prolonged ” grief .
But Holly Prigerson , an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard , and Paul Maciejewski , a lecturer in psychiatry at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital , in Boston , have found that even “ normal ” grief often endures for at least two years rather than weeks , peaking within six months and then dissipating .
Additional studies suggest that grief comes in waves , welling up and dominating your emotional life , then subsiding , only to recur .
As George A. Bonanno , a clinical psychologist at Columbia University , writes in “ The Other Side of Sadness : What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After Loss ” ( Basic ; $ 25.95 ) , “ When we look more closely at the emotional experiences of bereaved people over time , the level of fluctuation is nothing short of spectacular . ”
This oscillation , he theorizes , offers relief from the stress grief creates .
“ Sorrow . . . turns out to be not a state but a process , ” C. S. Lewis wrote in 1961 .
“ It needs not a map but a history . ”
To say that grief recurs is not to say that it necessarily cripples .
Bonanno argues that we imagine grief to be more debilitating than it usually is .
Despite the slew of self - help books that speak of the “ overwhelming ” nature of loss , we are designed to grieve , and a good number of us are what he calls “ resilient ” mourners .
For such people , he thinks , our touchy - feely therapeutic culture has overestimated the need for “ grief work . ”
Bonanno tells the story of Julia Martinez , a college student whose father died in a bicycling accident .
In the days after his death , she withdrew from her mother and had trouble sleeping .
But soon she emerged .
She went back to school , where , even if sometimes she felt “ sad and confused , ” she did n’t really want to talk to her friends about the death .
Within a few months , she was thriving .
Her mother , though , insisted that she was repressing her grief and needed to see a counsellor , which Julia did , hating every minute of it .
Bonanno wants to make sure that we do n’t punish this resilient group inadvertently .
Sometimes the bereaved feel as much relief as sorrow , he points out , especially when a long illness was involved , and a death opens up new possibilities for the survivor .
Perhaps , he suggests , some mourners do not need to grieve as keenly as others , even for those they most love .
Yet Bonanno ’s claims about resilience can have an overly insistent tone , and he himself turns out to be a rather imperfect model of it .
He thrived after his own father died , but , as he relates in his book ’s autobiographical passages , he became preoccupied , many years later , with performing an Eastern mourning ritual for him .
The apostle of resilience is still in the grip of loss : it ’s hard to avoid a sense of discordance .
All of which forces the question that ’s at the heart of all thinking about grief :
Why do people need to grieve in the first place ?
To the humanist , the answer to that question is likely to be something like :
Because we miss the one we love , and because a death brings up metaphysical questions about existence for which we have few self - evident answers .
But hardheaded clinicians want to know exactly what grieving accomplishes .
In “ Mourning and Melancholia ” ( 1917 ) , Freud suggested that mourners had to reclaim energy that they had invested in the deceased loved one .
Relationships take up energy ; letting go of them , psychiatrists theorize , entails mental work .
When you lose someone you were close to , you have to reassess your picture of the world and your place in it .
The more your identity was wrapped up with the deceased , the more difficult the loss .
If you are close to your father but have only a glancing relationship with your mother , your mother ’s death may not be terribly disruptive ; by the same token , a fraught relationship can lead to an acute grief reaction .
In the nineteen - seventies , Colin Murray Parkes , a British psychiatrist and a pioneer in bereavement research , argued that the dominant element of grief was a restless “ searching . ”
The heightened physical arousal , anger , and sadness of grief resemble the anxiety that children suffer when they ’re separated from their mothers .
Parkes , drawing on work by John Bowlby , an early theorist of how human beings form attachments , noted that in both cases — acute grief and children ’s separation anxiety — we feel alarm because we no longer have a support system we relied on .
Parkes speculated that we continue to “ search ” illogically ( and in great distress ) for a loved one after a death .
After failing again and again to find the lost person , we slowly create a new “ assumptive world , ” in the therapist ’s jargon , the old one having been invalidated by death .
Searching , or yearning , crops up in nearly all the contemporary investigations of grief .
A 2007 study by Paul Maciejewski found that the feeling that predominated in the bereaved subjects was not depression or disbelief or anger but yearning .
Nor does belief in heavenly reunion protect you from grief .
As Bonanno says , “ We want to know what has become of our loved ones . ”
“ Let ’s never forget that the public ’s desire for transparency has to be balanced by our need for concealment . ”

When my mother died , Christmas a year ago , I wondered what I was supposed to do in the days afterward — and many friends , especially those who had not yet suffered an analogous loss , seemed equally confused .
Some sent flowers but did not call for weeks .
Others sent well - meaning e-mails a week or so later , saying they hoped I was well or asking me to let them know “ if there is anything I can do to help . ”
One friend launched into fifteen minutes of small talk before asking how I was , as if we had to warm up before diving into the churning waters of grief .
Without rituals to follow ( or to invite my friends to follow ) , I felt abandoned , adrift .
One night I watched an episode of “ 24 ” which established the strong character of the female President with the following exchange about the death of her son :
CSF Welcomes Historic NASA Commitment of $ 75 Million for Commercial Suborbital Flights , Payloads
Washington , D.C. –
The Commercial Spaceflight Federation enthusiastically welcomes NASA ’s announcement today that NASA will fund dozens of science and education payloads to fly on commercial suborbital vehicles built by companies including Armadillo Aerospace , Blue Origin , Masten Space Systems , Virgin Galactic , and XCOR Aerospace .
At the first annual Next - Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference , NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver announced in her keynote speech today that President Obama ’s Fiscal Year 2011 budget request for NASA commits $ 75 million in funding over five years for the new Commercial Reusable Suborbital Research program ( CRuSR ) .
“ We are thrilled to see NASA recognizing the enormous potential of new commercial vehicles for science , research , and education , ” said Mark Sirangelo , Chairman of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation .
“ NASA Deputy Administrator Garver ’s announcement today means that hundreds of scientists , educators , and students will be able to fly payloads on these new commercial vehicles . ”
“ For the first time ever , NASA has put forward a commitment to dramatically expand the number of research and education payloads that fly into space , ” said Dr. S. Alan Stern , chair of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation ’s Suborbital Applications Researchers Group ( SARG ) and former NASA associate administrator for science .
“ Since this new generation of commercial vehicles are low cost , NASA ’s $ 75 million will open the floodgates for everyone from astronomers to high school classrooms to conduct real science in space .
This will be one of the best investments NASA has ever made . ”
“ For everyone who has dreamed of participating in the grand adventure of spaceflight , this $ 75 million commitment marks the dawn of a new space age , ” added Stern .
“ As the commercial space industry continues to grow , I expect that we will see increasing numbers of payloads and people flying to space . ”
“ I am pleased to see NASA ’s recognition of the transformative potential of these new commercial vehicles , ” stated Dr. Fred Tarantino , President and CEO of the Universities Space Research Association .
“ The space science community is thrilled to see such a commitment to low - cost , reusable , and frequent access to space that will provide hands - on experience for students and change the way many space scientists operate . ”
NASA is proposing to spend $ 15 million in each of five years from 2011 - 2015 for the CRuSR program , funds that will both go to universities and other research institutions to build science and education payloads , as well as being used to purchase flights on commercial suborbital vehicles .
The CRuSR program is based at NASA ’s Ames Research Center in the heart of Silicon Valley .
The Next - Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference , a first - of - its - kind forum for bringing together scientists , educators , and vehicle developers to discuss potential research and education uses for commercial spacecraft , is being held in Boulder , Colorado and is co-organized by the Southwest Research Institute ( SwRI ) , the Universities Space Research Association ( USRA ) , and the Commercial Spaceflight Federation ( CSF ) .

A fog - shrouded East Palo Alto neighborhood was thrown into chaos Wednesday when a twin - engine Cessna crashed shortly after an early - morning takeoff , spilling wreckage and bodies onto a quiet bayside street — and triggering a massive outage that turned high - tech Palo Alto into a powerless island for 10 hours .
The pilot and two passengers — all employees of Tesla Motors — were killed and three houses were damaged , including a home day care center .
The plane brought down a high tension transmission tower , then broke apart in a dramatic and terrifying descent over the East Palo Alto neighborhood .
A wing slammed into the day care , landing gear smashed into a garage , an engine careened into a carport and the fuselage skidded to a halt in the middle of Beech Street .
Flames shot out from houses and debris .
Miraculously , nobody on the ground was injured .
Pamela Houston and six others fled from the day care as the plane came crashing down shortly before 8 a.m .
“ I grabbed the baby , and we ran into the street , ” she said .
“ We were all crying ; we were screaming .
There is not any word to describe the feeling . ”
Authorities had not released the identities of any of the victims by late Wednesday .
Authorities have also yet to identify who was piloting the plane , but the Cessna 310R was registered to a former Santa Clara company that was started by Doug Bourn , a Tesla engineer .
An investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board said it ’s too early to say whether the plane struck power lines or a 60 - foot transmission tower .
At the time the plane took off , visibility was so poor — only one - eighth of a mile , and only 100 feet above the ground — that flights had been canceled or delayed at the Bay Area ’s three major airports .
Yet others speculated that the plane ’s unusual veering path suggested a mechanical failure .
Investigators said it will be at least five days before they finish a preliminary probe and months after that for an official report into what happened .
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said taking off in bad weather is left up to the discretion of the pilot , whether it be a commercial or private plane .
The Palo Alto Airport ’s control tower opened at 7 a.m. , and the Cessna was the only plane to take off between then and around 8 a.m. , Gregor said .
He added that most commercial airlines have policies to follow before a pilot decides to fly .
On the ground , the fog added to the confusion — and fear .
Residents on Beech Street described waking up to explosions ; some of them told of watching parts of the plane fall from the dense fog that blanketed the area .
And saddest yet , a young girl and 10 - year - old boy described seeing the bodies .
Ten - year - old Luis Ramirez Sandin said he was in his front yard , getting ready to go to school , when he saw the blue - and - white plane descend , rock from side to side and then suddenly veer toward his home .
It plunged to the street , striking several vehicles and bursting into flames , he said .
“ There was no way to get near to help out , ” said his father , Benjamin Ramirez , through a translator .
“ It was too hot , with tall blue flames .
Everybody kept telling us to run .
They told us not to get near it . ”
“ The first thing I thought about was my daughters , ” said Leslie Ramos of Menlo Park who was driving down Beech Street to pick up her two girls , ages 3 and 6 , just as the plane was crashing .
“ I left my car in the middle of the street and ran to the house . ”
When she was reunited with her daughters a few minutes later , the youngest was crying .
Others ran into the street to find thick smoke rising from three houses .
Many feared the worst for the children at the in - home day care center , but it was too early for them to have arrived , and the people living in the house managed to escape out the back .
“ Some neighbors ran to the house to help , ” said Houston , one of the people at the day care center .
Menlo Park Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman said he believes the plane clipped a power line on a PG&E high - tension transmission tower shortly after lifting off from the Palo Alto Airport runway just before 8 a.m. , headed for Hawthorne Municipal Airport in Southern California .
Moments after the crash , the power went out in neighboring Palo Alto .
The city relies on PG&E ’s transmission lines to feed its city - run utility .
Schools stayed open with teachers ’ improvising with no computers and principals using airhorns instead of class bells .
Stanford Hospital resorted to backup power and diverted all nonemergency calls to hospitals outside the city .
Businesses throughout the city were either forced to close or count cash the old - fashioned way .
Some merchants took to the sidewalks to hawk coffee , sandwiches and pastries .
But many blacked out of Palo Alto ’s high - tech offices left for Menlo Park and Mountain View to crash at Wi-Fi cafes .
“ I shudder at the thought of what it ’s going to cost in losses for these retailers , ” said Sherry Bijan , president of the Palo Alto Downtown Business and Professional Association .
When the Cessna took off , 16 Southwest Airlines flights out of Mineta San Jose International Airport already had been canceled because of the fog .
In foggy or cloudy weather conditions , planes taking of from Palo Alto Airport go straight down the runway and then turn 60 degrees to the right toward the bay at 1,000 feet , said Ken Gottfredson , who owns Advantage Aviation , a flying school and club for pilots that operates out of the Palo Alto Airport .
“ He was off to the left of center by half a mile , ” Gottfredson said .
“ He should have been over the bay . ”
John Ferrell , a Los Altos Hills resident , who flies out of the airport three or four times a week , said he arrived there just after the ill - fated plane took off .
“ You could n’t see 100 yards in front of you , ” Ferrell said .
He noted that under those conditions , a plane can take off but not land because the runway is n’t visible .
Despite speculation about the fog , Ferrell also suggested the plane ’s left engine may have gone out at takeoff , causing it to veer sharply to the left .
“ Even in the best weather , if you lose an engine on takeoff , it ’s very difficult to overcome it , ” Ferrell said .
“ You have to level the wings .
You have to feather the engine . ”
Bourn , an experienced pilot , has commercial and multiengine pilots licenses .
An online bio from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers said he helped design and test the power electronics module for the Tesla Roadster .
A graduate of Stanford University , Bourn enjoys “ motorcycling , sky diving , flying and teaching others how to fly . ”
No one was home Wednesday morning at his single - story house in Santa Clara , where two motorcycles and a Lexus were in the driveway .
Neighbors said he lives alone .

Tibet Is No Shangri-La
In the popular imagination , Tibet is a land of snow - capped mountains and sweeping vistas , fluttering prayer flags , crystal blue skies , saffron - robed monks spinning prayer wheels , and , perhaps most of all , timelessness .
And likewise , the Dalai Lama , the spiritual leader of Tibet and its chief emissary to the West , is a man of abiding wisdom and compassion , an inspiration and moral compass , a beacon of calm in a frenetic modern world .
Set aside the fraught politics of this contested region .
If one word sums up what Tibet means to the West it is this : purity .
That sensibility was entrenched long before Hollywood stars like Richard Gere and Stephen Seagal made Tibetan freedom a cause célèbre — most famously in the 1933 British novel Lost Horizon , a fictional account of excursions among lamaseries in the Himalayas , where the protagonist encounters a people who are forever happy , mystically content , slow to age , and isolated from most ills that trouble the human race .
Author James Hilton ( whose other notable work is Goodbye , Mr. Chips ) depicts " Shangri-la , " a monastery nestled in a misty mountain valley ; its name has since become synonymous with earthly paradise .
Tibet ’s enduring hold on Western minds — together with the energetic , globe - trotting advocacy of the Dalai Lama — helps explain why the concerns of the region ’s minority population are so familiar to so many so far away .
( By comparison , it took violence in the streets of Urumqi to awaken foreign readers to the agitation of another of China ’s minority groups , the Uighurs . )
In the Washington , D.C. , neighborhood where I live , more than a few homes have decorative Tibetan prayer flags strung sentimentally across balconies and backyard porches .
This week , U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to meet with the Dalai Lama in the Oval Office — over the inevitable protests of Chinese authorities .
Besides being the spiritual leader of Tibet , the Dalai Lama is also the author of dozens of religious and self - help books , from The Art of Happiness to The Universe in a Single Atom , published in multiple languages ; he drops in to visit political leaders in European capitals and entertainment moguls in Los Angeles .
He has received the Nobel Peace Prize and twice been named to Time magazine ’s list of the " 100 Most Influential People . "
The first in his lineage to ever travel to the West , the Dalai Lama has managed to build an impressive multinational media and public relations .
( Such is his fame and prestige that some recent awards to His Holiness appear motivated largely to bring good publicity to the donor ; the town of Wroclaw , Poland , offered the Dalai Lama honorary citizenship in 2008 ; Memphis , Tennessee , extended a similar offer last September . )
But how much do Westerners really know about the Dalai Lama ?
His advocacy of an ethos of compassion and environmental protection are popular among his largely left - leaning Western admirers , while his more socially conservative views tend to be either unknown , or selectively ignored .
( Christopher Hitchens is one of the few to have taken exception . )
He is basically anti-abortion ( except in rare circumstances ) and ambivalent about homosexuality ; his 1996 book , Beyond Dogma , was strikingly explicit in its sexual prohibitions : " A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else . "
In recent years , his remarks on the subject have somewhat softened : he told an audience in San Francisco that while Buddhist teachings historically discourage gay relationships , such prohibitions only apply to Buddhists .
( He has also written , rather confusingly , " Homosexuality , whether it is between men or between women , is not improper in itself .
What is improper is the use of organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact . " )
As for Tibet itself , it ’s no Shangri-la .
That is to say , there was no real place named Shangri - la until recently , when the city of Zhongdian ( Gyalthang in Tibetan ) changed its name to recall Hilton ’s paradise .
In truth , the modern city is not quite a dreamscape .
Situated on an alpine plateau , in a location resembling that of Lost Horizon , the modern city of 130,000 is divided into an " old " and " new " town .
The new town came first .
It resembles many midsize Chinese cities that have arisen in recent decades , with hastily erected concrete apartment blocks and glass storefronts .
The old town , however , was built entirely in the last decade years ; it has " quaint " cobbled streets and wooden storefronts , and when I visited last fall , I stayed in a rustic lodge , with a wood - burning stove and a sloppy dog who slept on the steps .
All this is pleasant fabrication for visitors like myself , catering to what we expect to find .
Shangri-la is n’t even in Tibet proper ; it ’s situated in the far north of China ’s Yunnan province .
( The region where Tibetans live actually spans parts of five Chinese provinces , and is known as " greater Tibet . " )
Han Chinese tourists from the country ’s wealthy eastern cities , who now are becoming more curious about Tibetan lands and culture , also come here to take in the view .
They roll in on large tour buses and stay in luxury hotels in the new town , with banquet halls and karaoke bars .
Chinese tourists generally spend little time in Shangri-la and instead book guided day trips to take in the dramatic scenery .
Western tourists stay in old - town lodges , and stock their backpacks and suitcases with hand - sewn Tibetan coats , jade jewelry , prayer wheels and other trinkets , and profess more interest in the Tibetan people .
Tibetans , for their part , have discovered that there is money to be made from the outside world ’s interest in them .
That is to say , they are more worldly than we typically give them credit for .
In Shangrai - la , some of the most enterprising and entrepreneurial Tibetans can be found running tour shops that cater , alternately , to both Western and Chinese expectations .
When I visited the Ganden Sumtseling Monastery just outside of town , there was , improbably , a large construction site in the center of the grounds , with cranes erecting new facilities for the recent surge in tourism .
It is dangerous to generalize from chance encounters , but the young Tibetans I met there were less ethereal , and more down - to - earth , than our mythology suggests .
Near the central square in " old " Shangri -la , a 21 - year - old Tibetan named Tashi was sitting on the steps outside a travel agency , waving a cigarette .
" It ’s bad for my health , but it looks sexy , " he said .
Tashi was wearing a black Adidas jacket , tight jeans , and had short spiky gelled hair .
He told me he fancies himself a discerning connoisseur of global sexiness from the many American movies he ’s watched .
He was also , he mentioned , distraught about Michael Jackson ’s death , and , cigarette in hand , showed off his version of the moonwalk .
At night , he and his friends hung out playing chess and drinking coffee and beer at new bars downtown .
Judging by appearances , the new generation of Tibetans seems , in a superficial sense , rather un -Tibetan .
But that , too , is an oversimplification , as it became clear from talking to Tashi that he certainly thinks differently than Han Chinese his age .
For one , he expressed little interest in Deng Xiaoping ’s famous invocation " to get rich is glorious , " which is very nearly the closest thing there is to a unifying Chinese dream .
For another , he told me that he and his family members continue to consult their lama , the equivalent of a priest in Tibetan Buddhism , about major life decisions .
Recently that meant seeking the lama ’s spiritual appraisal of whether Tashi ’s sister should marry a pair of brothers then wooing her ( Tibetan custom permits polygamy in certain circumstances involving siblings ) .
Many versions of Buddhism are practiced in China , some with tacit consent of the authorities , but Tibetan Buddhism has proved particularly difficult to integrate because , as with the Islam practiced by Uighurs , it invests authority in local religious leaders who rival the authority of local officials .
On issues ranging from property rights to marriage customs , sparks may fly .
Tashi invited me to a Tibetan wedding reception , held in a modest banquet room in downtown Shangri-la , the wooden tables cluttered with bottles of hard liquor , 3 - liter Coke bottles , six - packs of " Dali " beer ( Dali is another city in northern Yunnan province ) , sunflower seeds , and trays of dumplings .
The guests , mostly in their 20s , sat in plastic chairs laughing and smoking .
The bride was wearing a traditional Tibetan costume , with her face painted and hair plaited .
The others wore jeans , leather jackets , or hooded sweatshirts .
Everyone identified themselves as " Tibetan , " although they hailed from different provinces in greater Tibet .
The groom was from Qinghai ; the bride was from Yunnan .
They teased the handful of guests from Lhasa , the capital of Tibet proper , for being city slickers .
The stereotype , among Tibetans , is that Lhasans are more educated , glamorous , and somewhat deceptive , while those from Yunnan , whose families came there as soldiers , are supposed to be straighter - shooters .
But these distinctions matter less than the fact that they are all Tibetans .
Part of what makes
Beijing worried is the surprisingly resilient sense of shared identity among the 6 million Tibetans .
While younger Tibetans are hardly relics from the past , they still felt a strong sense of separateness from the Chinese mainstream .
What they resent , they told me , is three things : when government actions benefit new Han settlers more than locals ; when government makes incorrect assumptions about what Tibetans really want ( for instance , the railroad into Tibet and greater development in general ) ; and when government restricts their culture and practice of religion .
( To learn about traditional Tibetan culture and heritage , many families in China who can afford to do so send their children to study in India , where there is a large Tibetan exile community .
Some say it is near impossible to learn about real Tibetan culture within China . )
These young Tibetans did , not , however , say their concerns necessarily added up to wanting independence , but they did think that something in the system would eventually have to give .
Such grievances came to a head in Lhasa in March 2008 , when a peaceful demonstration by Tibetan monks for the release of political prisoners met a harsh police crackdown .
Rioting ensued , with violence and casualties on both sides .
Most observers believe long - standing grievances — about income and educational inequality between Tibetan and non-Tibetans , and about religious restrictions — lay behind the unrest .
For its part , Beijing alleges without evidence that it was an uprising planned by what Communist Party apparatchiks call " the Dalai clique . "
Unfortunately , there ’s no open , continuing dialogue to bring voices about the future of the region together in the same conversation .
The political and territorial stakes are serious , and not likely to be resolved anytime soon .
But there is also a gauziness with which the region and the man who represents it to the West are most often discussed .
Even in the fast - paced and cynical 21st century , talk of Tibet still elicits a 19th century aura of romanticism and melancholy .
In general , sentiment veils critical thinking .
In the case of Tibet , our collective nostalgia , inexplicably , for a place most of us have never seen lends itself to a striking absolutism with which we discuss the place , its people , its present condition , its future destiny .
While most things in life are murky and grey , the Tibet of our imagination is pristine , and the lines between good and evil are as clear as a mountain stream .
The reality is somewhat hazier , on all accounts .

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit on behalf of a college student who was arrested at an airport for being in possession of Arab language flash cards .
After emptying out any metal contents , he produced some English - Arabic flashcards which aroused the suspicion of agents .
George was then aggressively questioned in the public screening area for another 30 minutes by a TSA supervisor who asked him to explain his feelings about the 9/11 attacks , whether he knew who had been responsible for them and what language they spoke .
Shortly after , a Philadelphia Police Officer arrived and George was handcuffed and detained in a cell for two hours while officials poured over his possessions and made phone calls .
Ben Wizner , staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project had this to say : Arresting and restraining passengers who pose no threat to flight safety and are not breaking any law not only violates people 's rights , but it wo n't make us any safer .
It may actually make us less safe , by diverting vital resources and attention away from true security threats , Nick George was handcuffed , locked in a cell for hours and questioned about 9/11 simply because he has chosen to study Arabic , a language that is spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world .
This sort of harassment of innocent travelers is a waste of time and a violation of the Constitution .
He was also questioned by FBI agents who asked him whether he had become an " Islamist " or had joined any " The 22 year - old was never informed of his rights nor offered an attorney and had to miss his flight due to the lengthy detention .
I feel the TSA acts like it has a blank check as long as what it does is in the name of fighting terrorism , Said George .
Of course , the TSA 's job is to keep us safe -- but they have to follow the Constitution and respect rights .
A senior student with a Physics major , George had considered a career as a U.S diplomat and had brought some studying material to look over during the flight .
I want to serve my country using my Arabic language , George told CNN .
And it just seems crazy to me that for that I was arrested and treated like a criminal .
As someone who travels by plane , I want TSA agents to do their job to keep flights safe .
But I do n't understand how locking me up and harassing me just because I was carrying the flashcards made anybody safer , said George .
No one should be treated like a criminal for simply learning one of the most widely - spoken languages in the world .
He was eventually released and forced to fly the next day but was offered no explanation nor apology .
For their part , the three agencies named in the suit refused to comment .
One TSA agent , speaking on condition of anonymity , claimed George was exhibiting " anomalous behavior " prior to reaching the check point and “ was referred for additional screening , where his behavior escalated further " .
Of the 200 flashcards in his possession , a small number contained words such as " bomb " , " explosion " and " terrorist " which George explained were words commonly found in Arabic media :
They asked me why I had those words .
I told them honestly because I had been trying to read Arabic news media , especially Al - Jazeera , and these are words that come up when you read the news about the Middle East .
George , along with the ACLU and the Philadelphia branch of the ACLU are suing the TSA , FBI ( Federal Bureau of Investigations ) and Philadelphia Police for violation of 1st amendment rights right to free speech 4th amendment rights of freedom from unreasonable search and seizure and excessive use of force Official complaint found here
The ACLU has filed a lawsuit on behalf of a college student who was interrogated then detained for nearly five hours last summer at Philadelphia International Airport .
College student Nick George was flying from his hometown of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania back to California to attend the Fall semester at Pomona College when he was taken aside by TSA ( Transportation Security Administration ) agents at a security screening point and asked to empty his pockets .
After emptying out any metal contents , he produced some English - Arabic flashcards which aroused the suspicion of agents .
George was then aggressively questioned in the public screening area for another 30 minutes by a TSA supervisor who asked him to explain his feelings about the 9/11 attacks , whether he knew who had been responsible for them and what language they spoke .

“ We stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas .
And we recognize that the world ’s information infrastructure will become what we and others make of it . ”
These two sentences , from Secretary of State Clinton ’s groundbreaking speech on Internet freedom , sum up beautifully the challenge facing our Internet policy .
An open Internet can advance our values and support our interests ; but we will only get there if we make some difficult choices now .
One of these choices relates to anonymity .
Will it be easy to speak anonymously on the Internet , or not ?
This was the subject of the first question in the post - speech Q&A :
QUESTION : You talked about anonymity on line and how we have to prevent that .
But you also talk about censorship by governments .
And I ’m struck by – having a veil of anonymity in certain situations is actually quite beneficial .
So are you looking to strike a balance between that and this emphasis on censorship ?
SECRETARY CLINTON : Absolutely .
I mean , this is one of the challenges we face .
On the one hand , anonymity protects the exploitation of children .
And on the other hand , anonymity protects the free expression of opposition to repressive governments .
Anonymity allows the theft of intellectual property , but anonymity also permits people to come together in settings that gives them some basis for free expression without identifying themselves .
None of this will be easy .
I think that ’s a fair statement .
I think , as I said , we all have varying needs and rights and responsibilities .
But I think these overriding principles should be our guiding light .
We should err on the side of openness and do everything possible to create that , recognizing , as with any rule or any statement of principle , there are going to be exceptions .
So how we go after this , I think , is now what we ’re requesting many of you who are experts in this area to lend your help to us in doing .
We need the guidance of technology experts .
In my experience , most of them are younger than 40 , but not all are younger than 40 .
And we need the companies that do this , and we need the dissident voices who have actually lived on the front lines so that we can try to work through the best way to make that balance you referred to .
Secretary Clinton ’s answer is trying to balance competing interests , which is what good politicians do .
If we want A , and we want B , and A is in tension with B , can we have some A and some B together ?
Is there some way to give up a little A in exchange for a lot of B ?
That ’s a useful way to start the discussion .
But sometimes you have to choose — sometimes A and B are profoundly incompatible .
That seems to be the case here .
Consider the position of a repressive government that wants to spy on a citizen ’s political speech , as compared to the position of the U.S. government when it wants to eavesdrop on a suspect ’s conversations under a valid search warrant .
The two positions are very different morally , but they are pretty much the same technologically .
Which means that either both governments can eavesdrop , or neither can .
We have to choose .
Secretary Clinton saw this tension , and , being a lawyer , she saw that law could not resolve it .
So she expressed the hope that technology , the aspect she understood least , would offer a solution .
This is a common pattern : Given a difficult technology policy problem , lawyers will tend to seek technology solutions and technologists will tend to seek legal solutions .
( Paul Ohm calls this “ Felten ’s Third Law ” . )
It ’s easy to reject non-solutions in your own area because you have the knowledge to recognize why they will fail ; but there must be a solution lurking somewhere in the unexplored wilderness of the other area .
If we ’re forced to choose — and we will be — what kind of Internet will we have ?
In Secretary Clinton ’s words , “ the world ’s information infrastructure will become what we and others make of it . ”
We ’ll have a free Internet , if we can keep it .
British researchers have developed a new way of preserving vaccines without refrigeration by sealing the vaccine 's live viruses inside glass made of sugar .
The vaccines trapped in the sugar - glass could be stored at 45 C for four months without any degradation , and suffered only a small amount of degradation after a year of storage at 37 C , the researchers say .
Their study , published this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine , is a proof - of - concept of the technology .
The researchers said further testing is needed to see if the sugar - glass can withstand temperature extremes and physical conditions typically seen in overseas shipping .
The technique involves mixing the vaccine 's live viruses with two sugars , sucrose and trehalose .
The solution is then dried out on a plastic film and hardens into glass .
Inside the sugar - glass , the vaccine is immobilized and kept in suspended animation .
To prepare the vaccine for injection , the glass is flushed with water and quickly dissolves , reactivating the vaccine .
The new technology , developed by manufacturer Nova Bio-Pharma Technologies , could improve the distribution of vaccines to tropical countries that may lack the infrastructure necessary to keep vaccines stable .
" Currently , vaccines need to be stored in a fridge or freezer , " said the study 's lead author Matt Cottingham of Oxford University .
" That means you need a clinic with a nurse , a fridge and an electricity supply , and refrigeration [ trucks ] for distribution .
" If you could ship vaccines at normal temperatures , you would greatly reduce cost and hugely improve access to vaccines , " he said , in a statement .
A study of the technology , using two malaria vaccines that are currently in human clinical trials , found that the vaccines could be used even after up to a year in storage at tropical temperatures .
Sugars like the ones used in the study are currently used to preserved biological molecules , and the researchers say that those preservation properties are at work in the glass .
Currently , Nova 's technology , called the Hypodermic Rehydration Injection System , is in the form of a plastic cartridge that screws into standard vaccine syringes , but the researchers say that the sugar - glass could be adapted to be put inside the syringes themselves .

" She just said ' thank you " .
She 's very weak , which suggests that she 's been there for 15 days , " rescue team spokesman Commander Samuel Bernes said on Wednesday .
" She was in a pocket surrounded by concrete , completely dehydrated , " he added .
" She was treated on the spot , she was n't able to get out alone , " said Commander Bernes , explaining that neighbours had been searching in the rubble of their home in the central Carrefour - Feuilles district when they heard a voice .
They had to do relatively little digging to free her , he said .
The girl was treated at the scene for dehydration and a weak pulse , transferred to a French field hospital in Port - au - Prince and then taken to a French navy ship anchored off the coast , he added .
Michel Orcel , a doctor at the field hospital , said the girl was " happy " after her rescue .
" She is 16 years old .
She is alive and she has her whole life ahead of her .
She was speaking ; she said that she was happy , " Colonel Orcel said .
" She is in a very advanced state of dehydration .
For the moment we have to calm her , tranquilise her , stabilise her . "
About 135 people have been pulled alive from the ruins in Port - au - Prince since the 7.0 - magnitude earthquake , which devastated much of the capital in the worst recorded disaster to hit the Americas .
US troops on Wednesday pulled a 31 - year - old man from the rubble , although he may have been buried by a building that collapsed after the earthquake .
On Tuesday , Haitians pulled a man from the rubble of a downtown store .
He later said he had been trapped since one of the quake 's early aftershocks .
Haiti has been rattled by dozens of aftershocks following the initial quake .
Experts say each powerful new tremor diminishes remaining hopes for people buried in rubble , who risk being crushed by masonry dislodged by the new tremors .
Cases of trapped survivors holding out for a week after an earthquake are considered extraordinary , while surviving beyond 10 days is extremely rare .
Haiti's President Rene Preval said " nearly 170,000 " bodies have already been counted , substantially higher than previous toll estimates of 150,000 .
" In 15 days many efforts have been made .
The National Equipment Company has made great efforts in removing nearly 170,000 dead from the streets and clearing the roadways to facilitate traffic , " Mr Preval told a press conference on Wednesday .
On Monday , Health Minister Alex Larsen said he expected a final death toll of about 150,000 from the earthquake .
At least 83 UN staff members died in the earthquake and 32 remain unaccounted for , Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said .
Pillagers have run rife in the ruins of the capital , while there is no sign of the tent camps promised by the Government for the hundreds of thousands of homeless people fleeing grim conditions in Port - au - Prince .
Just four blocks from the destroyed presidential palace as crowds queued under a blazing sun , Immacula Cadet said she was hungry , but was afraid of being hurt in the long lines if fighting erupts over the handouts .
" I do n't want to battle in the road to have a little bread , " she told AFP .
" We really have problems .
We need all that [ aid ] .
We need food , we have no water . "
A massive aid effort has swung into place , but many Haitians , left living in makeshift camps dotted around Port - au - Prince , say they have yet to receive vital supplies of food or water .
A massive aid effort has swung into place , but many Haitians , left living in makeshift camps dotted around Port - au - Prince , say they have yet to receive vital supplies of food or water .
Haitians are " desperately in need of meals ready to eat " and tents ahead of the rainy season , senior UN humanitarian official Catherine Bragg said at the World Economic Forum at the Swiss mountain resort of Davos .
In the Cite Soleil slum on Tuesday , several thousand desperate people converged on a walled police compound for sacks of relief supplies , surging against the steel gates .
Across the city , walls have been scrawled with messages .
" We need help .
Food , water , medicine , " said one in Spanish and English .
About 20,000 US troops have been sent in to help distribute food and water .
The US said it had begun to hand out 14 million meals and was aiming to supply half a million people with fresh water within a few days .

Sir Tim Berners - Lee does n't have an easy manner in the flesh ; there is n't the relaxed manner of a politician , whose careers depends on putting people at their ease .
Instead , Berners - Lee has a darting , urgent manner .
And his career has turned out to be one which ends up putting people at their unease : look around at what the web has done to the world , and the huge upheaval it 's caused , and that 's Berners - Lee , magnified .
Now he 's turned his gaze to the Gordian Knot that is the HTML5 specification .
For this we need to backtrack a bit , and see where things have gotten to since the last time I wrote about Apple / Flash / HTML5 at the start of February .
The question then was , if Apple is not going to have Flash on the iPad or iPhone / iPod Touch – because it implements HTML5 's handling of video , via H.264 , embedded directly in web pages via the Canvas API – is Adobe 's technology going to find a home in HTML5 ?
Since then sooo much has happened .
Let 's unload some links :
The Flashmobileblog looks at battery performance of Flash Player on Google 's ( sorta flashy ) Nexus One :
" Bloggers from Daring Fireball and Macgasm have spent a little more time than expected studying the battery indicators , as opposed to the incredible advancements in web browsing for mobile phones , netbooks and tablets . "
Umm , perhaps : it depends on whether you think battery life is more important than being able to see that awesome Flash opening page for that restaurant .
An Adobe engineer said that the next version Flash will be so much better on Mac OSX , honest .
Simon St Laurent wrote , over at O'Reilly , about " the widening HTML5 chasm " .
( He 's a former worker on the World Wide Web Consortium ( aka W3C ) , where Berners - Lee has of course toiled for longer than one would have thought humanly possible . )
He reckoned that discordant interests would leave HTML5 damaged and its credibility weakened .
And then the Free Software Foundation urged Google to kill Flash by open - sourcing its video codecs and pushing them out to YouTube users - meaning " The world would have a new free format unencumbered by software patents . "
No response from Google – which announced that it 's dropping Gears support , so it can concentrate on HTML5 support in the Chrome browser .
Jason Garrett - Glaser , the primary x264 developer and an ffmpeg developer , noted ( in a long post about Flash , Adobe , and performance ) that Adobe has made two critical mistakes : first , assuming Linux and Apple 's OSX did n't matter ( turned out lots of important developers are there ) and secondly , attacking free software :
" Practically all the websites on the internet use free software solutions on their servers — not merely limited to LAMP - like stacks .
Youtube , Facebook , Hulu , and Vimeo all use ffmpeg and x264 .
Adobe 's H.264 encoder in Flash Media Encoder is so utterly awful that it is far worse than ffmpeg 's H.263 or Theora ; they 're practically assuming users will go use x264 instead .
For actual server software , the free software Red5 is extraordinarily popular for RTMP - based systems .
And yet , despite all this , Adobe served a Cease & Desist order to servers hosting RTMPdump , claiming ( absurdly ) that it violated the DMCA due to allowing users to save video streams to their hard disk .
RTMPdump did n't die , of course , and it was just one program , but this attack lingered in the minds of developers worldwide .
It made clear to them that Adobe was no friend of free software . "
There 's plenty more in the post – it's basically your essential backgrounder on the technical and financial obstacles to HTML5 video .
The key question is : who 's going to get their way with HTML5 ?
The companies who want to keep the kitchen sink in ?
Or those which want it to be a more flexible format which might also be able to displace some rather comfortable organisations that are doing fine with things as they are ?
Adobe , it turned out , seemed to be trying to slow things down a little .
It was accused of trying to put HTML5 " on hold " .
It strongly denied it .
Others said it was using " procedural bullshit " .
Then Berners - Lee weighed in with a post on the W3 mailing list .
First he noted the history :
" Some in the community have raised questions recently about whether some work products of the HTML Working Group are within the scope of the Group 's charter .
Specifically in question were the HTML Canvas 2D API , and the HTML Microdata and HTML + RDFa Working Drafts . "
( Translation : Adobe seems to have been trying to slow things down on at least one of these points . )
And then he pushes :
" I agree with the WG [ working group ] chairs that these items -- data and canvas – are reasonable areas of work for the group .
It is appropriate for the group to publish documents in this area . "
Chop !
And that 's it .
There goes the Gordian Knot .
With that simple message , Berners - Lee has probably created a fresh set of headaches for Adobe - but it means that we can also look forward to a web with open standards , rather than proprietary ones , and where commercial interests do n't get to push it around .
The upshot : HTML5 , as a standard , may still be some years off .
But the fact that there 's so much interest in it , and that browsers – Apple 's Safari , Mozilla 's Firefox , Google 's Chrome – are already starting to incorporate parts of its specification now means that in some parts of the web , the latest sites will work really well .
The advantage there goes both to the sites and to the users of those browsers .
( Remember too that Firefox is the most widely - chosen browser in the world . )
So Adobe really does have a problem now .
It will be very interesting to see how it reacts , and how it keeps Flash moving forward over the next ten years .
At the very least , it might want to take some advice from x.264's Garrett - Glaser : be open , do n't ignore platforms , work on performance .
And where will Berners - Lee pop up next ?
Ah – following his success in getting data .gov.uk to happen , he 's now focussing on UK local authorities .
If you work in one , you have been warned …
Last week , the Pirates unveiled plans for their newest statue to be erected outside of PNC Park sometime next summer .
As you can see from the picture to the right , it ’s an awesome depiction of one of the Pirates ’ most memorable moments : Bill Mazeroski’s Series - clinching home run over the Yankees in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series .
In the statue , Maz is seen rounding second - base with his arms spread wide in jubilation , exactly as it happened fifty years ago .
It just might be the single best statue in Major League Baseball today .
But what would be its competition ?
Living in Milwaukee , I ’m very familiar with the Robin Yount and Hank Aaron statues outside Miller Park .
I ’ve also had a good chance to see the Bob Feller statue in Cleveland , the Willie Mays statue in San Francisco , and a few others around the country .
That ’s only a drop in the bucket , though .
With 30 major league stadiums around the country , there are many , many statues that I ’ve never had a chance to see – especially when you consider that , for the most part , teams ca n’t seem to stop at erecting just one .
Using Flickr and a few ingenious searches ( e.g. , “ comerica park statues ” or “ busch stadium statues ” ) , I went on a little statuary expedition last night , trying to compile a list of statues found in the major leagues .
Now , I make no promises that this list is comprehensive .
I did my best to make sure that I did n’t miss any statues at any given park , but , with the vagaries of people ’s tagging at Flickr and the sheer number of statues , I ’m bound to have missed one or two or ten , or mis-classified those that I did find .
If you happen to see any errors or omissions , please drop me a line in the comments .
And if you can include a link to a picture of said statue , even better .
But what would a list like this be without a little personal taste thrown in ?
I ’ve listed the thirty ballclubs and their roster of statues below , in order of my most favorite collection of statues to my least favorite ( based solely on their pictures , of course ) .
This is in no way scientific , so I ca n’t say that the factors involved in each club ’s rank are perfectly consistent across the league .
However , the factors did tend to focus on uniqueness , execution , and number ( I tend not to like too many statues ) .
I ’ll explain my choices as I list them .
And if there ’s anything the internet has taught me , it ’s that most of you will disagree with me in some way .
Which is fine .
We ’re only talking about team statues , after all .

Amid growing tension in the north , the IDF Home Front Command will begin a pilot program to redistribute gas masks in Or Yehuda on Sunday .
Under the plan – drawn up by Col. Yossi Sagiv , head of the Home Front Command ’s Gas Mask and Protection Kits Department – the masks will be returned to private homes by the Israel Postal Company , which beat out seven other companies in a Defense Ministry - issued tender in late 2009 .
Gas masks were collected from private homes starting in 2007 by a private delivery company .
The distribution is slated to take three years .
Officials said that after the distribution is completed in Or Yehuda , the IDF will review the operation , implement corrections and improvements and then start distributing the kits in other parts of the country , based on operational considerations of which area is under a more immediate threat .
The public will receive the same rubber gas mask that it had in thepast with an improved filter – more effective against chemical andbiological threats Israel faces – but without the syringe of Atropinethat was in past kits .
Under the plan , Postal Company representatives will contact homeownersand schedule a time to visit and deliver the gas masks required by thefamily .
Each family will be asked to pay a nominal sum of less than NIS20 .
The courier will also help fit the gas masks to the family membersand explain how to use them .
People that prefer not to pay the fee cantravel to a distribution center , that will be located in each city , topick up their gas masks .
A Queensland man will have to pay Nintendo $ 1.5 million in damages after illegally copying and uploading one of its new games to the internet ahead of its release , the gaming giant says .
James Burt , 24 , of Sinnamon Park in Queensland will pay Nintendo $ 1.5 million after an out - of - court settlement was struck to compensate the company for the loss of sales revenue .
Nintendo said the loss was caused when Burt made for the Wii gaming console available for illegal download a week ahead of its official Australian release in November last year .
Under Australian law , copying and distributing games without the permission of the copyright holder is a breach of the Copyright Act .
Nintendo applied and was granted a search order by the Federal Court forcing Burt to disclose the whereabouts of all his computers , disks and electronic storage devices in November .
A new study claims that certain types of beer are a rich source of dietary silicon , and can help prevent osteoporosis
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Beer is a rich source of a nutrient that can help prevent weak bones – but it depends what type you drink , claim researchers at University of California , Davis , today .
As one of the nation 's favourite tipples , beer is a rich source of dietary silicon , which can help cut the chance of developing diseases like osteoporosis , they conclude .
However , not all beers are the same , with those containing malted barley and hops having higher silicon content than beers made from wheat .
Some light lagers made from grains like corn have the lowest levels of silicon while beers made from hops seem to come out on top , according to the study .
The research , published in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture , examined 100 commercial beers and their production methods .
The experts said beer was a major source of dietary silicon – roughly half of the silicon in beer can be readily absorbed by the body .
Charles Bamforth , lead author of the study , said : " Beers containing high levels of malted barley and hops are richest in silicon .
" Wheat contains less silicon than barley because it is the husk of the barley that is rich in this element .
" While most of the silicon remains in the husk during brewing , significant quantities of silicon nonetheless are extracted into wort and much of this survives into beer . "
Dr Claire Bowring , from the National Osteoporosis Society , said : " These findings mirror results from previous studies which concluded that moderate alcohol consumption could be beneficial to bones .
" However , while the National Osteoporosis Society welcomes measures to improve bone health we do not recommend anyone increases their alcohol consumption on the basis of these studies .
" While low quantities of alcohol may appear to have bone density benefits , higher intakes have been show to decrease bone strength , with an alcohol intake of more than two units per day actually increasing the risk of breaking a bone .
" There are also many other health concerns linked with alcohol which cannot be ignored . "
Catherine Collins , a dietician at St George 's Healthcare NHS Trust in London , said there was no recommended daily amount of silicon people should be consuming .
She said it was hard to prove deficiency in silicon because so little was needed .
" Sources of silicon do include beer – either alcohol - containing or alcohol - free – and it's also added as an anti-caking agent to powders such as baking powder .
" It is found in different amounts in water , so contributes to beer 's total silica content .
" Silica may well contribute to bone health but in a minor way .
" It is not really significant compared with nutrients that we know are essential for bone health and are potentially deficient in the UK diet – such as calcium and vitamin D. "
Negative Ions a Positive Sign for Liquid Water in Enceladus
Status Report From : Jet Propulsion Laboratory
Posted : Monday , February 8 , 2010
In recent dives through the water ice plume of Enceladus , the Cassini plasma spectrometer has found unexpected populations of charged molecules and dust that strengthen arguments for the presence of liquid water and the ingredients for life inside the icy moon .
The Cassini plasma spectrometer , originally designed to take data in Saturn 's magnetic environment , measures the density , flow velocity and temperature of ions and electrons that enter the instrument .
But since the discovery of Enceladus ' water ice plume , the instrument has also successfully captured and analyzed samples of material in the jets .
Early in its mission , Cassini discovered the plume that fountains water vapor and ice particles above Enceladus .
Since then , scientists have found that these water products dominate Saturn 's magnetic environment and create Saturn 's huge E ring .
Now , Cassini scientists report they have found negatively charged ions in the plume , many of which are water , but also including other hydrocarbon species .
Their findings , based on analysis from data taken in plume fly - throughs in 2008 , are reported in the journal Icarus .
Enceladus thus joins Earth , Titan and comets where negatively charged ions are known to exist in the solar system .
Negative oxygen ions were discovered in Earth 's ionosphere at the dawn of the space age .
At Earth 's surface , negative water ions are present where liquid water is in motion , such as waterfalls or crashing ocean waves .
" While it 's no surprise that there is water there , these short - lived ions are extra evidence for sub - surface water and where there 's water , carbon and energy , some of the major ingredients for life are present , " said lead author Andrew Coates from University College London 's Mullard Space Science Laboratory .
" The surprise for us was to look at the mass of these ions .
There were several peaks in the spectrum , and when we analyzed them we saw the effect of water molecules clustering together one after the other . "
The measurements were made as Cassini plunged through Enceladus ' plume on March 12 , 2008 .
Looking toward high northern latitudes on Titan , the Cassini spacecraft spies a banded pattern encircling the pole .
At Titan , the same instrument detected extremely large negative hydrocarbon ions with masses up to 13,800 times that of hydrogen .
A paper in Planetary and Space Science by Coates and colleagues in December 2009 .
They found showed that , at Titan , the largest hydrocarbon or nitrile ions are seen at the lowest altitudes of the atmosphere that Cassini flew ( 950 kilometers , or 590 miles ) .
They suggest these large ions are the source of the smog - like haze that blocks most of Titan 's surface from view .
They may be representative of the organic mix called " tholins " by Carl Sagan when he produced the reddish brew of prebiotic chemicals in the lab from gases that were known to be present in Titan 's atmosphere .
Tholins that may be produced in Titan 's atmosphere could fall to the moon 's surface and may even make up the sand grains of the dunes that dominate part of Titan 's equatorial region .
The findings add to our growing knowledge about the detailed chemistry of Enceladus ' plume and Titan 's atmosphere , giving new understanding of environments beyond Earth where pre-biotic or life - sustaining environments might exist .

The highest sounds are the hardest to hear .
Going forward is a way to retreat .
Greater talent shows itself late in life .
Even a perfect program still has bugs .
If it were not for laughter , there would be no Tao .
How could it be otherwise ?
Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out of time and space for their programs .
Programmers that comprehend the Tao always have enough time and space to accomplish their goals .
But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it .
Each language has its purpose , however humble .
Each language expresses the Yin and Yang of software .
Each language has its place within the Tao .
The assembler gave birth to the compiler .
Now there are ten thousand languages .
The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of morning .
If the Tao is great , then the operating system is great .
If the operating system is great , then the compiler is great .
If the compiler is greater , then the applications are great .
The user is pleased and there is harmony in the world .
The Master replies : " That programmer has mastered the Tao .
He has gone beyond the need for design ; he does not become angry when the system crashes , but accepts the universe without concern .
He has gone beyond the need for documentation ; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code .
He has gone beyond the need for testing ; each of his programs are perfect within themselves , serene and elegant , their purpose self - evident .
Truly , he has entered the mystery of the Tao . "
" They are alive within the Tao . "
The manager said : " I should have never sent you to the conference .
Those programmers live beyond the physical world .
They consider life absurd , an accidental coincidence .
They come and go without knowing limitations .
Without a care , they live only for their programs .
Why should they bother with social conventions ? "
The answer exists only in the Tao .
Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds ?
Aware , like a fox crossing the water .
Alert , like a general on the battlefield .
Kind , like a hostess greeting her guests .
Simple , like uncarved blocks of wood .
Opaque , like black pools in darkened caves .
The master programmer shrugged .
" Then the design will never be completed , " he said .
" And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it ? "
The master programmer frowned .
" In that case , it will take two years . "
" But we need this system immediately or even sooner !
How long will it take if I assign ten programmers to it ? "
" It will take one year , " said the master promptly .
The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled .
" That is all good and well , but which is easier to debug ? "
" Not so , " said the programmer , " when designing an accounting package , the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas : how it must operate , how its reports must appear , and how it must conform to the tax laws .
By contrast , an operating system is not limited by outside appearances .
When designing an operating system , the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas .
This is why an operating system is easier to design . "
The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief .
" Surely an accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating system , " he said .
The man smiled .
" I am stealing ideas , " he said .
On the final day of the trade show , the guard could restrain his curiosity no longer .
" Sir Thief , " he said , " I am so perplexed , I can not live in peace .
Please enlighten me .
What is it that you are stealing ? "
On the next day of the trade show , the man returned and chided the guard saying : " I escaped with a vast booty yesterday , but today will be even better . "
So the guard watched him ever more closely , but to no avail .
When the man left , the guard took him aside and searched his clothes , but nothing was to be found .
4.1
A program should be light and agile , its subroutines connected like a strings of pearls .
The spirit and intent of the program should be retained throughout .
There should be neither too little nor too much , neither needless loops nor useless variables , neither lack of structure nor overwhelming rigidity .
A program should follow the ' Law of Least Astonishment ' .
What is this law ?
It is simply that the program should always respond to the user in the way that astonishes him least .
A program , no matter how complex , should act as a single unit .
The program should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward appearances .
If the program fails in these requirements , it will be in a state of disorder and confusion .
The only way to correct this is to rewrite the program .
4.2
A novice asked the master : " I have a program that sometimes runs and sometimes aborts .
I have followed the rules of programming , yet I am totally baffled .
What is the reason for this ? "
The master replied : " You are confused because you do not understand the Tao .
Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans .
Why do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed ?
Computers simulate determinism ; only the Tao is perfect .
The rules of programming are transitory ; only the Tao is eternal .
Therefore you must contemplate the Tao before you receive enlightenment . "
" But how will I know when I have received enlightenment ? " asked the novice .
" Your program will then run correctly , " replied the master .
4.3
A master was explaining the nature of the Tao to one of his novices , " The Tao is embodied in all software -- regardless of how insignificant , " said the master .
" Is the Tao in a hand - held calculator ? " asked the novice .
" It is , " came the reply .
" Is the Tao in a video game ? " continued the novice .
" It is even in a video game , " said the master .
" And is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer ? "
The master coughed and shifted his position slightly .
" The lesson is over for today , " he said .
