You already know that Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th President of the United States of America on January 20th at noon , but what you might not know is that Barack Obama loves his beer .
According to Truemors not only does he love beer but he was hoping to have his favorite beer served at the Inauguration party , InaugurAle , brewed by Piece Brewery and Pizzeria in Chicago .
Barack Obama might soon be the leader of the free world , but even he was n’t able to actually make it happen .
Piece kegs their beer , but shortly before the inauguration they were told they needed to provide the beer in bottles , but there ’s not enough time to bottle the beer before the 20th , so Barack ’s going to have to drink something else .
Do n’t worry , if you want to try InaugurAle and you ’re somewhere near Chicago , Piece Brewery and Pizzeria will be having an inauguration celebration on January 20th and they ’ll be serving InaugurAle .
Read the full story at ChicagoBusiness.com .
If you ’re not near Chicago there are a few other Barack Obama Inauguration themed beers available .
Homebrewer Sam Chapple - Sokol has been working on his Audacity of Hops InaugurAle beer , named after Obama ’s second book The Audacity of Hope .
Dale ’s Pale
Ale has also been using the Audacity of Hops name to advertise their beer using a poster styled after Barack Obama ’s Audacity of Hope poster .
The Pageant in St. Louis , Mo is brewing a Presidential Porter for their Inauguration party on the 20th .
According to the San Francisco Chronicle , in Kenya , where homemade alcohol is commonly mixed with battery acid or formaldehyde to increase potency , Obama Beer is taking the country by storm and saving lives .
Actually called Senator beer , it ’s been dubbed Obama Beer ever since he was elected Senater back in 2004 .
Of course , if you ’re not in Chicago , St. Louis , Kenya , or friends with a homebrewer in DC check your local bars , they might have their own version of InaugurAle .
If all else fails you can join President - elect Obama in a nice cool Pabst Blue Ribbon .
I have often been accused of being arrogant and closed minded because I am openly atheist .
It really annoys me because ( and I know I am biased ) I feel it is so far from the truth and very often the person who is saying this is describing themselves .
I am called closed minded because I am not ' open ' to the idea of a GOD .
Now this is just stupid word play and essentially they are saying I am closed minded because I refuse to put my rationality and reason to one side and accept a concept simply on faith or tradition .
Where else in life would someone actually think this is an OK thing to expect of you ?
Nowhere !!
If your boss refused you a good pay rise and you asked why and he simply said " you just need to accept it as so " , you would flip and demand a proper answer that treated you with respect .
I regularly am pointing out to people that I am not an atheist simply because I got bored with church or religion and was too lazy to go to Mass on Sunday .
I researched , studied , questioned and THOUGHT about it and after a few years or soul searching ( pun intendid ) I realised that it makes no sense .
The arguments are full of childish " yeah well in that case then .... " type arguments that are there simply to plug holes in an increasingly weaker and weaker stance .
The irony is that these people often are the closed minded ones and will refuse to read about atheism or even entertain the point of view that God may be a myth .
Even in the face of contrary evidence .
The arrogant tag is equally galling .
I am arrogant because I do not go with the crowd , because I used my own mind and decided it was wrong .
Whereas they believe that a being that has the power to create a universe in 7 days , is superhuman , omnipident and omniscient , is listening to THEIR prayer for a good pay rise .
Now that to me is arrogance .

I want to build on the point that Adam Green , writing at Open Left , makes about the need for more liberals in the mainstream media .
Watch the clip below from the “ Roundtable ” segment on yesterday ’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos .
Aside from Krugman , there are no liberal voices .
The others on the panel either spout tendentious re-imaginings of political and economic history ( George Will ) or half - baked solutions that are grounded in little to no schooling or expertise ( Sam Donaldson ) .
Green asks ,
“ What would this segment be like if Krugman was n’t there ? ” I totally agree , but not just because Krugman reps the lefty point of view .
In the absence of expertise , conventional wisdom fills the void .
You see that from Will , Donaldson , and Cokie Roberts .
Krugman pairs a liberal perspective with actual knowledge , and it ’s that combo that makes him the most effective member of the panel .
We need more liberals in the media , but we really more liberal experts in the media .
So go out and nab those Nobel prizes , folks .
There ’s an idea war to be won .
Academy Award winners Joel and Ethan Coen , known for their grimly comic portrayals of human nature , are poking fun at a new target : the coal industry .
The filmmaking brothers have directed a TV spot for an environmental coalition that ’s trying to demolish the notion that there ’s anything clean about so - called clean coal .
Launched Thursday , the ad follows a grinning , lacquer - haired pitchman whose can of “ clean coal ” air freshener sends a suburban family into coughing spasms when they spray a grimy cloud of it inside their spotless home .
The ad ends with a tag line : “ In reality , there ’s no such thing as clean coal . ”

The spot is the latest salvo in the media battle between the coal industry and environmentalists over the role that carbon fuels should play in the United States ’ energy future .
The Obama administration has signaled its intention to move the nation toward clean , homegrown energy sources in an effort to boost energy security and fight global warming .
The nation ’s coal industry has gone on the offensive to persuade Americans that coal is part of the solution , not part of the problem .
It has formed a trade group known as the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity , spending $ 18 million so far on television spots touting coal ’s abundance and the efforts being made to clean up this fuel , a major emitter of the greenhouse gases that are changing the Earth ’s climate .
“ Meeting America ’s growing energy demand . . . is going to require the use of all energy technologies , ” said Joe Lucas , spokesman for the coalition .
“ Technology has made coal a cleaner energy option . ”

Lucas said the industry had spent more than $ 50 billion since the 1970s installing pollution - control equipment and designing plants that are more efficient .
The industry is working on the next wave of innovation , he said , including carbon sequestration to capture carbon dioxide emissions and prevent their release .
The trouble , environmentalists say , is that the coal industry ’s marketing campaign has left Americans with the impression that such “ clean coal ” technology already exists .
Such a breakthrough has yet to be developed and may never be at a cost that makes economic sense , said Bruce Nilles , national coal campaign director for the Sierra Club .
His nonprofit and four others -- the Alliance for Climate Protection , the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural Resources Defense Council and the National Wildlife Federation -- formed their own group last year to counter the coal industry ’s message .
Known as the Reality Coalition , it has launched three TV spots since December mocking the notion of “ clean coal . ”
Coalition spokesman Brian Hardwick said the sardonic script proposed by the group ’s advertising agency hooked the Coen brothers , who won 2007 Oscars for producing , directing and adapting “ No Country for Old Men ” and a 1996 Oscar for writing “ Fargo . ”

“ They thought it was their style , ” he said .
In a statement , the Coens said : “ We were excited to be part of this important project and tell another side of the ‘ clean ’ coal story . ”
The spot is running on CNN , MSNBC , Comedy Central and can be viewed at www .
this isreality.org .
The ad is humorous , but the stakes are serious .

Coal is the bedrock of U.S. electricity generation .
About half of the nation ’s power is supplied by 600 coal - burning plants .
The fuel is reliable , cheap and plentiful .
The U.S. possesses about one - quarter of the planet ’s coal reserves .
But some scientists say that weaning the world off coal is crucial to slowing the devastating effects of climate change .

Dogbert the CEO Dogbert says , " I 'm happy to announce that the government gave us a bailout loan of $ 25 billion . "

Since at night I keep it in the same room where I sleep , I figured that I could as well use it as an highly customizable alarm clock .
My alarm script uses rtcwake ( 8 ) from util - linux -ng to set the RTC alarm clock , suspends the computer and then plays some music at a set volume when it wakes up ( if it never wakes up , check your BIOS settings ) .
Since it uses the date ( 2 ) command it can parse the alarm time in many formats .

TWENTY - THREE years after it started selling cars in the United States , and in the midst of an industrywide slump that has pushed some competitors to the brink of bankruptcy , the Korean automaker Hyundai spent $ 3 million to tell Americans watching the Super Bowl how to say its name correctly .
“ It ’s ‘ HUN - day , ’ like Sunday , ” said one of its two ads during the game .
Few carmakers have the luxury to be concerned about pronunciation these days .
New - vehicle sales fell 37 percent last month , the industry ’s worst January since 1963 .
Then again , more car shoppers are saying Hyundai ’s name .
The company ’s market share nearly doubled last month as sales rose 14 percent , the largest year - over - year increase that any big automaker has posted in the United States since last May .

One reason for the jump in January , after a dismal December , appears to be Hyundai ’s new marketing strategy of promising to let buyers return their vehicles , at no cost in most cases and with no penalty to their credit rating , if they lose their job or income within a year .

Koresh was born Vernon Howell
The mother of the notorious Waco sect leader David Koresh has been found stabbed to death at the house of a sister in Texas , police say .
Bonnie Clark Halderman , who was in her sixties , was found dead at the home of Beverly Clark who has been taken into custody pending a court appearance .
Police say they have no idea of a possible motive for her death .
She had recently written a book about her son , who led 80 people to violent death in the 1993 Waco siege .
Ms Clark Halderman was found on Friday afternoon at the home of Ms Clark , in a rural area near Chandler , about 175 miles ( 280 km ) north of Houston .
" It 's still under investigation , and we really do n't know what the motive was or what caused this to happen , " said Henderson County Sheriff Ray Nutt .
Authorities found a knife they believe was used in the killing , he added .
The siege at Waco shocked America
Deputies had been called to the home and the two women were the only people in the house when they arrived .
Ms Clark Halderman wrote a 2007 book about her son and the cult he came to lead , called Memories of the Branch Davidians : The Autobiography of David Koresh 's Mother .
Koresh and 80 of his followers , including more than 20 children , died when a 51 - day armed siege of their compound by US federal security forces ended in an inferno .
Independent investigators concluded in 2000 that Koresh had been solely to blame for the deaths .
All are sold as boxed sets in retail stores across the country without classification by the Classification Board or the appropriate labelling , for instance M or MA15 +.
A spokesman for NSW Attorney - General John Hatzistergos said the NSW Classification Enforcement Act prohibited publishers and retailers from selling unclassified computer games .
" The NSW legislation covers computer games bought online as well as those bought in stores , and treats single , multi-player and online games the same way , " he said .
The spokesman added that enforcement of the act was the responsibility of police but penalties for breaking these laws ranged from $ 1100 to $ 11,000 for individuals and / or 12 months ' imprisonment .
For corporations the fines were approximately double .
" If there is any suggestion that any business is trading illegally , police need to know , and it should be reported , " he said .
A spokeswoman for Federal Attorney - General Robert McClelland said that , although it was up to each state and territory to enforce game classification requirements , Commonwealth legislation also had no loopholes for online games .
" The National Classification Scheme does not distinguish between games based on whether or not they contain a single player component , " she said .
" Online games are computer games within the meaning of the Classification ( Publications , Films and Computer Games ) Act 1995 and are covered under the existing legislation . "
But Ron Curry , chief executive of games industry body the Interactive Entertainment Association of Australia said he believed that online games without a single player component did not require classification by the Classification Board .
He said the issue centred on how one defined the term " computer game " .
" A disk [ in retail packaging ] that provides access to an online computer game is in itself not a computer game for the purposes of the Classification Act , " he said .
Although the state and federal attorneys - general have said that online games are computer games as far as the legislation is concerned , police do not appear to be enforcing this aspect of the law .
A spokesman for NSW Police Minister Tony Kelly urged members of the community to contact local police if they saw retailers selling computer games illegally .
The spokesman did not respond when asked why police needed to wait for complaints when virtually every game retailer in the country was selling the online games without classification .
" Police officers in the NSW Police Force will respond to complaints received from members of the community or other agencies to investigate alleged breaches of either the Commonwealth 's or NSW 's Classification ( Publications , Films and Computer Games ) Enforcement Act 1995 , " he said .
Shane Stockwell , merchandising director at EBGames , said the retailer was always compliant with the law and " we do not believe we are selling an illegal product " .
The issue was first picked up by Melbourne games journalist Tateru Nino , who writes for the MMORPG blog Massively .com .
– Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist .
The opinions expressed are his own –
Albert Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results .
His definition fits America ’s war on drugs , a multi-billion dollar , four - decade exercise in futility .
The war on drugs has helped turn the United States into the country with the world ’s largest prison population .
( Noteworthy statistic : The U.S. has 5 percent of the world ’s population and around 25 percent of the world ’s prisoners ) .
Keen demand for illicit drugs in America , the world ’s biggest market , helped spawn global criminal enterprises that use extreme violence in the pursuit of equally extreme profits .
Over the years , the war on drugs has spurred repeated calls from social scientists and economists ( including three Nobel prize winners ) to seriously rethink a strategy that ignores the laws of supply and demand .
Under the headline “ The Failed War on Drugs , ” Washington ’s respected , middle - of - the - road Brookings Institution said in a November report that drug use had not declined significantly over the years and that “ falling retail drug prices reflect the failure of efforts to reduce the supply of drugs . ”
Cocaine production in South America stands at historic highs , the report noted .
Like other think tanks , Brookings stopped short of recommending a radical departure from past policies with a proven track record of failure such as spending billions on crop eradication in Latin America and Asia while allotting paltry sums in comparison to rehabilitating addicts .
Enter Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) , an organization started in 2002 by police officers , judges , narcotics agents , prison wardens and others with first - hand experience of implementing policies that echo the prohibition of alcohol .
Prohibition , now widely regarded a dismal and costly failure of social engineering , came to an end 75 years ago this week .
As LEAP sees it , the best way to fight drug crime and violence is to legalize drugs and regulate them the same way alcohol and tobacco is now regulated .
“ We repealed prohibition once and we can do it again , ” one of the group ’s co-founders , Terry Nelson , told a Washington news conference on December 2 .
“ We can not arrest our way out of this problem . ”
FROM AL CAPONE TO DRUG CARTELS
“ In the 20s and 30s , we had Al Capone and his gangsters getting rich and shooting up our streets , ” said Nelson , who spent a 32 - year government career fighting drugs in the U.S. and Latin America .
“ Today we have criminal gangs , cartels , Taliban and al - Qaeda profiting from the prohibition of drug sales and wreaking havoc all over the world .
The correlation is obvious . ”
The before - and - after sequence is so obvious that the U.S. Congress passed a resolution in September noting that the 1933 repeal of alcohol prohibition had replaced a “ dramatic increase ” in organized crime with “ a transparent and accountable system of distribution and sales ” that generated billions of dollars in tax revenues and boosted the sick economy .
That ’s where advocates of drug legalization want to go now , and some of them hope that the similarities between today ’s deep economic crisis and the Great Depression will result in a more receptive audience for their pro-legalization arguments among lawmakers and government leaders .
The budgetary impact of legalizing drugs would be enormous , according to a study prepared to coincide with the 75th anniversary of prohibition ’s end by Harvard economist Jeffrey A. Miron .
He estimates that legalizing drugs would inject $ 76.8 billion a year into the U.S. economy — $ 44.1 billion through savings on law enforcement and at least $ 32.7 billion in tax revenues from regulated sales .
Miron published a similar study in 2005 looking only at the budgetary effect of legalizing marijuana , the most widely used illicit drug in the United States .
That study was endorsed by more than 500 economists , including Nobel laureates Milton Friedman of Stanford University , George Akerlof of the University of California and Vernon Smith of George Mason University .
“ We urge … the country to commence an open and honest debate about marijuana prohibition , ” the economists said in an open letter to President George W. Bush , congress , governors and state legislators .
“ At a minimum , this debate will force advocates of current policy to show that prohibition has benefits sufficient to justify the cost to taxpayers , foregone tax revenues and numerous ancillary consequences that result from marijuana prohibition . ”
The advocates of current policy , led by outgoing President George W. Bush ’s drug czar , John Walters , never took up the challenge to discuss cost - benefit equations .
His Office of National Drug Control Policy has focused , with the single - minded determination of a moral crusader , on doing the same thing over and over again .
But the United States is not alone in pursuing drug strategies that are based more on wishful thinking than on sober analysis .
If you put faith in declarations by the United Nations , a “ drug - free world ” is an attainable goal and the war on drugs all but over .
In 1998 , a special session of the U.N. General Assembly forecast that the illicit cultivation of the coca bush , the cannabis plant and the opium poppy would be eliminated or significantly reduced by the year 2008 , a deadline that also applied to “ significant and measurable results in the field of demand reduction . ”
The clock is ticking towards midnight , December 31 , 2008 .

The Simpsons just completely overhauled their opening credits sequence .
Here are the little things I noticed and liked .
On Sunday night ’s episode of The Simpsons , the show rolled out it ’s first all - out overhaul of the credits since , well , the 1980s .
And while there ’s some stuff I did n’t love ( like Marge ’s car actually hitting Homer and a random bird flying across the opening clouds ) , there were a lot of subtleties that I really liked .
Here are 11 pictures of those subtle moments I liked … and , in most cases , I have them accompanied by a screen grab of the same moment in the old Simpsons opening .
Enjoy .
1 | The detail in the Springfield overview
This is a great improvement thanks to the HD .
The power plant is souped up ( and does n’t have the antiquated handwritten sign ) … the tire fire is actually on fire … plus the generic buildings have been replaced by landmarks .
And the Duff Brewery , KBBL tower and Springfield Hollywood sign are added .
2 | Homer the astronaut
This is a really subtle one that makes perfect sense .
The photo in Bart ’s classroom is of Homer in his astronaut gear .
So logical .
A town this size would totally hang a photo of its most successful local hero in the elementary school classrooms .
And for all of Homer ’s accomplishments , being an astronaut remains number one .
( Doing Poochie ’s voice is number two . )
3 | The grocery checkout
When this scene was first drawn , The Simpsons did n’t have 20 years of history to draw from .
Now they do .
So generic groceries have been replaced with Krusty O’s , Mr. Sparkle detergent and Tomacco juice .
And the new magazines have all been featured during the run of the series … as has the Absolut Krusty ad ( which was on the side of the building Bart lived in as an emancipated minor ) .
4 | The price of Maggie
Back in the day , everyone paused their VCRs to figure out how much Maggie scanned for .
It was $ 847.63 , which was the price of raising a baby for one month back in 1989 .
Now , they changed things .
The groceries add up to $ 243.26 and when Maggie ’s scanned , she doubles that to $ 486.52 .
Those numbers do n’t have any particular significance … but I love it because it sure gives the Internet lots of room to speculate .
Is it a commentary on how today ’s fat children double the cost of your grocery bill ?
How today ’s lazy parents spend three - and - a - half times less on their babies every month ?
How much it now costs to raise a baby for a week ?
Is this somehow connected to the Lost numbers ?
Who knows .
5 | The orchestra
I like three main things in this scene .
One : Adding all the traditional nerdy characters to the orchestra , replacing the old generic kids .
Two : Having Sheri and Teri playing Game Boys ( or possibly texting ) instead of playing instruments , which totally fits today ’s kids .
The only thing better would ’ve been them playing Guitar Hero .
And three :
As much as no one liked Bleeding Gums Murphy , adding his photo to the wall was a nice , appropriate touch .
6 | Apu’s responsibilities
Good character update here .
Apu originally was happy and walking a dog .
Now , 20 years later , he ’s got octuplets and he ’s miserable with them .
Quality switch .
7 | The Cat Lady and Rich Texan
Over the course of the series , The Simpsons has shed minor side characters that did n’t work and brought in new ones who do .
The crazy Cat Lady ( who I like ) and the Rich Texan ( whom I * love * ) were very good switches for Jacques and Bleeding Gums .
I also like the TVs that show Krusty have gone from old school TVs to flat panels .
8 | The missing statue head
Nice bit of continuity .
At the beginning of the credits , Kearny and Jimbo saw the head off the Jebidiah Springfield statue .
Then , as Marge speeds down the street , you can see the statue in the background … and the head ’s still lopped off .
9 | The quick pan of characters
The quick pan over a ton of characters ( generally visible only in slow motion ) has been seriously updated … and for the better .
Rather than just some random kids , we now have highlights like Willy on his signature tractor , Ralph making sand castles out of Frank Grimes ’s grave , Mayor Quimby and a mistress and Spider Pig .
10 | God versus the Devil
So weird !
They took a random , never - discussed mountain from the original credits and decided to use it to stage a fist - shaking battle between God and the Devil .
This is the most random thing in these new credits … and I ’m on board .
They also took Maude Flanders out and just have Rod and Todd releasing birds .
11 | The TVs
And finally , the TV is more modern than before … but only slightly .
They still have rabbit ears … just buttons instead of dials .
And when it eventually falls out of the wall , it has the red , yellow and white cords … meaning it ’s not HD , it ’s just a little more modern than before .
Which is really fitting here .

( Reuters ) - Wal - Mart Stores
Inc is mounting a new push to expand in Chicago , hoping its promises of jobs and sales tax dollars will prove more tempting in a recession than when city leaders first rebuffed the discount chain earlier this decade , the Wall Street Journal said .
The world ’s largest retailer , which so far has been able to build only one store in the third - largest city in the United States , hopes to open a half - dozen more in the coming years , the paper said , citing the company and politicians familiar with the plans .
It has been heavily courting Chicago leaders and is studying a dozen potential sites , the paper added .
The company now sees the Windy City as a potential proving ground for urban development strategies it could later bring to other resistant markets , including New York and Los Angeles , the Journal said .
Wal - Mart , whose stores are largely concentrated in rural and suburban markets , has long struggled to penetrate the largest U.S. cities amid opposition from politicians sympathetic to organized labor and small business groups concerned the discounter would steal sales from smaller retailers , the Journal said .
Wal - Mart ’s sales at U.S. stores open at least a year have been outpacing its competitors , but the retailer has said it would keep a close eye on expenses amid the economic downturn .
Wal - Mart Stores is cutting 700 - 800 jobs at its Wal - Mart and Sam’s Club home offices as the group looks to realign its corporate structure and reduce costs .
Wal - Mart ’s renewed Chicago push comes at a time when the company ’s domestic new - store expansion is slowing and it has begun to feel the drag of the recession , the Journal said .
Wal - Mart could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters .
Munich 's transit nsystem is a sprawling network of light rail , subway , tram and bus lines that reach every corner of a city inhabited by 1.3 million people .
It 's an amazing system , but it can be overwhelming if you 're a foreigner exploring the Bavarian capital .
Munich is Germany 's third largest city , yet its mass - transit system is small compared to those in London , Moscow and New York .
It 's half the size of Berlin 's mass - transit network .
Still , it 's among the most efficient in Europe .
It includes 245 stops and more than 325 miles of track , and it carries more than 1.6 million passengers a day .
It 's clean and so incredibly comprehensive that it 's said no household in Munich is more than 1,300 feet from a transit stop of some kind .
This vast network rests on two pillars .
The U Bahn is a six - line underground subway system the features 98 stops on 62.5 miles of track .
It 's the workhorse of the Munich metro , carrying almost a million passengers a day .
It is joined by the S Bahn , a light - rail system with six lines that run on 275 miles of track and stop at 147 stations .
A fleet of buses and trams ( .pdf ) – some 410 in all – fill in the gaps .
The two systems are run by separate entities , and integrated by a third , and it all works seamlessly .
And like other metros in Germany , it all runs on the honor system .
Riders purchase tickets at self - service kiosk priced by zone – a ticket covering most of the inner city costs € 2.30 ( $ 2.95 ) – and before boarding , stamp them with an old - school time clock .
It 's possible to score a free ride by " forgetting " to stamp your ticket , but at the risk of getting caught by plainclothes agents making random checks .
They ’ll slap you with a big fine , and the " I 'm just a confused tourist " wo n't get you anywhere .
The Munich system provides excellent connections between lines , especially at the major stations in the center of the city .
But the sheer number of choices can be overwhelming .
Arriving at the Hauptbahnhof , Munich 's main train station , from Austria , I had no fewer than 10 U and S Bahn lines and six trams to choose from .
My hotel was n't far , but it was freezing outside , so after much deliberation I hopped on tram # 17 toward Reichenbachplatz .
Big mistake .
It was going the opposite direction .
Four stops in I finally realized my mistake , got off and boarded a tram headed the right way .
I think it was the most crowded vehicle in the history of mass transit , a crush of rowdy teens , stressed out moms hogging up space with their enormous baby strollers , and a gaggle of Lufthansa flight attendants aloofly surveying the scene .
Making matters worse , the driver yelled at me three times in five minutes .
First , because I forgot to stamp my ticket , then because I inadvertently produced a bus ticket and , for good measure , a third time when I missed my stop .
It seems the trams do n't stop unless you specifically ask .
Everyone scowled at me because I took a picture .
They did it again when I bumped a woman with my suitcase .
A great experience all around .
I also spent some time on Vienna 's transit system
, a smaller , gentler version of Munich's .
The network consists of a 43 - mile , five - line U Bahn system with 84 stations , a 10 line S Bahn , trams and buses .
It is similar to Munich 's transit system with its ticket kiosks , time - punch machines and great connectivity between lines , but there are differences .
The Vienna system has routes that form a rough ring around the city , which means it 's easy to make short east - west trips .
Munich lacks a ring line , sometimes forcing east - west passengers to ride north or south into the city and then back out to reach their destination .
Vienna is cheaper ( €1.70 per single - zone ticket vs. € 2.30 in Munich ) , and it 's a whole lot easier to navigate .
And , the Vienna metro also comes with something I 've never before seen on a subway : its own magazine .
In most of the cars there were rows of them hanging from wires for people to browse through , though I did n't see anyone doing so .
Overall , I found Vienna system to be a delight .
Stations were well lit and easy to navigate , trains were never packed , even during rush hour , and people were exceedingly polite , offering their seats to elderly passengers and making room for mom's with strollers .
Both systems are amazingly punctual .
Trains , trams and buses are where they 're supposed to be when they 're supposed to be there , which is amazing when you consider how many people they carry .
Displays at every station and stop show exactly when the next train or tram will arrive , and they were always accurate to the minute .
I never waited more than 12 minutes for a ride .
In most ways , these two mass - transit systems run circles around those in the United States .
They 're clean , they run on time , and they get people where they need to be .
If I had one criticism , it would be that there are too many options , especially in Munich .
Trams , buses , trains and subways are so plentiful and so frequent that it 's easy to get disoriented , especially if you 're unfamiliar with your surroundings .

Rumors of the GDrive , Google ’s supposed answer to online file storage , are bubbling up again .
The fabled GDrive is by far the most clamored - for Google service that , so far anyway , has yet to see the light of day .
We ’ve been hearing about a Google Drive online storage solution for years , but lately some tell - tale signs seem to point toward GDrive becoming a reality .
First there was the menu item in Google ’s Mac version of Picasa — among the sync options is something called “ Google Web Drive , ” which currently does nothing — and now both Google Blogoscoped and Google Operating System , have dug up more evidence pointing toward GDrive ’s seemingly imminent arrival .
You might be thinking , what ’s the big deal ?
Why is TGDaily so excited they want you to throw away your hard drive ( recommended only for hyperbolic journalists ) ?
After all , DropBox and its ilk already offer pretty much what GDrive is rumored to be — it just is n’t Google doing the file hosting .
Aside from Google fan boys finally getting what they ’ve been salivating over for years , what advantages would GDrive offer ?
Well , according to what Google Blogoscoped discovered last week it looks like Google may be planing to slowly turn Google Docs into a web interface for GDrive .
That would mean that , assuming it works like DropBox , in addition to the storage and sync features , you ’d get the web - based document editing tools of Google Docs .
If that does n’t tickle your fancy , presumably client - side software for Windows and Mac would mean you could work on your documents in traditional desktop apps as well .
Sync clients would also mean that you essentially have a local backup of your documents , making for quick easy access even when there ’s no network connection .
The advantage of such as scenario is that the PC you ’re using at the moment becomes increasingly irrelevant — you can always sync all your docs onto any PC for anywhere access to your files .
As Gadget Lab points out , that ’s a huge win for the thriving netbook market , where manufacturers sacrifice drive space to keep costs down .
It ’s also a win for anyone who uses multiple PCs , since the biggest hassle of having two machines is keeping your files in sync ( never mind that tools like Subversion , CVS and rsync worked out most of these problems ages ago ) .
So what ’s not to love ?
Well , for one thing DropBox already does all that ( except for the Google Docs integration ) , but the real issues are the same ones that DropBox faces .
There are two essential problems with the whole cloud computing paradigm that no one has really solved .
The first is trust .
It ’s one thing to trust your e-mail to Google , it ’s another thing to trust the company with the entirety of your digital life .
Forget problems of security and privacy , even the basic issue of server downtime leaves many people cold .
The other big issue with online storage is that , for most of us , documents like spreadsheets , word processor files and the other formats that Google Docs understands are not what ’s taking up the majority of space on our drives .
Is the fabled GDrive going to store and sync my 200 or so gigabytes of mp3 files ?
For free ?
Somehow I doubt it .
What about movies ?
If you ’re like most of us GDrive will likely affect only your Documents folder — maybe four or five gigs worth of files , but hardly a substitute for your hard drive .
Microsoft ’s Live Sync service already offers exactly that and it has n’t changed the way we use Windows , nor has it made us throw out our hard drives .
The fabled Google Drive might be handy for those of you who want a better way to sync files to Google Docs , but it probably is n’t going to replace the hard drive .
TGDaily 's fantasy of a network bootable GDrive will be great when fiber optic lines reach our doorsteps , but , in the mean time , most of us have work to do , and unless you want to spend all day booting up , we suggest hanging onto your hard drive .
And if you do n’t feel like waiting for Google to get around to GDrive , there ’s always DropBox , Windows Live Sync and myriad of other options already available .

A native New Yorker of South Asian descent claims police have stopped and searched him 21 times in the subway because of his race .
In a lawsuit filed Thursday by the New York Civil Liberties Union , Jangir Sultan , 32 , says he is of Kashmiri descent and has dark eyes and brown skin and looks Middle Eastern .
The occupational therapist says he was born in Brooklyn and has lived in New York nearly his entire life .
Sultan says he was stopped at various subway stations around the city after the New York Police Department implemented a search program in response to bombings in London in 2005 .
At first , he said , he regarded the searches as a necessary part of life to prevent another terrorist attack .
But then he started asking around , and realized none of his friends were being stopped with the same frequency , according to the lawsuit against the city and the NYPD filed in Brooklyn 's federal court .
Police conduct subway stops at random times in stations around the city , setting up a table and a sign with the NYPD crest where bags are searched .
Straphangers are told consistently by transit workers that all bags are subject to search by police .
Paul Browne , the NYPD 's Deputy Commissioner for Public Information , said the checks are conducted without regard to ethnicity or race .
The city law department said two federal courts have already determined the subway bag searches are constitutional because they properly balance subway security and civil liberties .
“ It is an important anti-terror program that enhances the safety of millions of New Yorkers , ” the law department said in a statement .
“ The NYPD has made every effort to make the program as minimally intrusive as possible . ”
But Sultan says he has been stopped wearing scrubs , gym clothing and business attire , with several different bags , and has been singled out at different stations around the city .
The only plausible reason he continues to be stopped is because of his race , according to the suit .
“ Mr. Sultan began looking at himself in the mirror in the mornings before he left for work , wondering what about him provoked the officers to search him so frequently .
He tried carrying a different type of bag , but the stops continued , ” the lawsuit says .
After about the 13th time he was stopped , Sultan started filing complaints with the Civilian Complaint Review Board , documenting his version of the interactions with police .
When the stops continued , he wrote to the Mayor 's Office , to Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and to senators , representatives and City Council members to no avail , the lawsuit said .
The NYCLU said in the lawsuit that the subway checkpoint program is flawed because the NYPD provided little training to officers other than a brief directive explaining how to operate the checkpoints .
The suit seeks an undetermined amount of money as well as additional training , supervision , and monitoring of the subway search program so Sultan will not be targeted again .
Slovakia has called a state of emergency amid plunging gas supplies Russian PM Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will resume pumping gas to Europe once independent monitors are in place to check the flow to EU markets .
Ukraine , whose dispute with Russia over pricing led to the crisis , said it would guarantee transit to Europe .
The Czech EU presidency said monitors would check Russian gas entering and leaving Ukraine but it was unclear if a firm deal had been agreed .
Earlier , talks between the EU , Russian and Ukrainian officials stalled .
See map of affected area Ukraine , whose dispute with Russia over pricing led to the crisis , earlier said it would guarantee transit to Europe .
The EU presidency did not specify when the monitors would be in place or when gas supplies would resume .
" This deployment should lead to the Russian supplies of gas to EU member states being restored , " the EU presidency statement said .
The talks in Brussels on Thursday were aimed at ending the row that has seen supply to Europe cut off .
Ten of thousands of homes in Europe have been left with no heating , a situation which the European Commission has described as completely unacceptable .
International monitors Mr Putin had urged the EU to send monitors to Ukraine " as soon as possible " , so that gas deliveries to Europe could resume .

Ukrainian officials say the monitors could be in place as early as Friday .
Mr Putin also said Russia was prepared to pay the market price for Ukraine 's transit fee , as long as Kiev paid the market price for gas for its own use .
However , Russian officials say they have not yet signed a deal with Ukraine .
Oleg Dubyna , the head of Ukrainian gas company Naftogaz , said Kiev would transport Russian gas to Europe as long as Russia provided additional gas to keep the system running .
Some EU states are getting no gas at all or have seen supplies sharply cut .
Ukraine denies Russian accusations that it is stealing gas passing through export pipelines on its territory .
Russia cut gas to Ukraine itself a week ago as the row over pricing and allegedly unpaid bills escalated .
The EU depends on Russia for about a quarter of its total gas supplies , some 80 % of which are pumped via Ukraine .
Brussels has so far avoided taking sides in the dispute , calling only for deliveries to resume urgently , the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse reports from Kiev .
Apart from the immediate question of who is to blame , Kiev and Moscow have fundamental disagreements over how much Ukraine owes Russia for last year 's gas and how much it should pay this year , our correspondent adds .
Nuclear U - turn ?
On Wednesday , heating systems shut down in some parts of central Europe , as outdoor temperatures plunged to - 10 C or lower .
The list of countries that reported a total halt of Russian supplies via Ukraine included Romania , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Bosnia - Hercegovina , Bulgaria , Croatia , Greece , Hungary , Macedonia , Serbia , and Austria .

The Nuclear Emergency Search Team , 1974 - 1996
Declassified Documents Depict Creation , Capabilities ,
And Activities of Once - Secret Nuclear Counterterrorism Unit
National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 267
Edited by Jeffrey T. Richelson
Posted - January 12 , 2009

Jeffrey T. Richelson - 202/994-7000
Washington , D.C. , January 12 , 2009 - The U.S. government ’s secret nuclear bomb squad evaluated more than 100 nuclear extortion threats and incidents between 1974 and 1996 but only a dozen required actual deployments ( the others were hoaxes ) , according to the new book , Defusing Armageddon , and key primary sources posted today in the National Security Archive 's " Nuclear Vault " by Archive senior fellow Jeffrey T. Richelson .
( http://www.nsarchive.org/nukevault)
The Nuclear Emergency Search Team ( NEST ) had the capacity in 1996 of deploying up to 600 people and over 150 tons of equipment to an incident site , but all deployments to that point had been much smaller ( a maximum of 45 people ) , according to the documents .
A subsequent Web posting will cover the NEST from 1997 through the present .
Managed by the Nevada Operations Office of the Department of Energy ( and its predecessors ) , NEST drew personnel from key national laboratories – Los Alamos , Sandia , Livermore – and their contractors .
On an everyday basis NEST personnel worked in a multitude of areas – including weapons design , diagnostics , health physics , and information technology – and were called into action for exercises or actual deployments .
Today ’s posting of twenty - four documents includes , but is not limited to : national intelligence estimates on the threat of clandestine attack , the directive resulting in the creation of NEST , examples of extortion letters and the psycholinguistic analysis of such letters , accounts of NEST participation in the effort to locate the remains of a Soviet nuclear - powered satellite that crashed into the Canadian wilderness in 1978 , documents concerning the controversial 1994 MIRAGE GOLD exercise and its aftermath , and briefing material concerning NEST ’s mission as well as its human and technical capabilities .
The documents were obtained by Archive Senior Fellow Jeffrey T. Richelson while conducting research for his new book , Defusing Armageddon : Inside NEST , America ’s Secret Nuclear Bomb Squad .
The Nuclear Emergency Search Team , 1974 - 1996
Edited by Jeffrey T. Richelson
In May 1974 the Federal Bureau of Investigation received a letter demanding that $ 200,000 be left at a particular location or a nuclear bomb would be detonated somewhere in Boston .
In response to the threat William Chambers , a physicist with the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory , was instructed to assemble a team of scientists and technical personnel to travel to Boston and search for the allegedly hidden device .
While the threat did result in the formation of a team – the Nuclear Emergency Search Team – consisting of personnel from key national laboratories ( Los Alamos , Livermore , Sandia ) and their contractors , it was not the beginning of U.S. concern with stolen , lost , or concealed nuclear weapons .
During the Cold War , the U.S. Intelligence Community explored ( Document 2 , Document 4 ) the motivations and capabilities of the Soviet Union and China to smuggle weapons of mass destruction into the United States as well as U.S. vulnerabilities ( Document 1 ) .
The U.S. Air Force also experienced a number of accidents involving aircraft , including B - 52s , armed with nuclear weapons .
There was a crash at Palomares , Spain in February 1966 , as well as one at Thule , Iceland in January 1968 .
Both resulted in extensive efforts to locate personnel and debris .
The effort that followed the Thule crash , designated CRESTED ICE , was the subject of a Strategic Air Command history ( Document 3 ) and included the use of nuclear detection equipment to locate radioactive debris .
During the Nixon administration there was also concern about the threat posed to reactors , which resulted in a study concerning the status of domestic safeguards of nuclear material .
In a subsequent national security directive ( Document 5 ) , national security adviser Kissinger notes Nixon ’s special concern with the threat of sabotage , plutonium contamination , and armed attacks by terrorists .
The rushed , ad hoc , response to the threat to Boston , resulted in a directive ( Document 6 ) to the Atomic Energy Commission ’s Nevada Operations Office that assigned the office responsibility for search and detection operations .
In response to the directive the office established the Nuclear Emergency Search Team ( NEST ) .
Personnel chosen for NEST would still keep their positions in weapons design , diagnostics , or other areas but would participate in exercises and agree to deploy in the event of a real crisis .
Some would also help design detection equipment ( Document 9 ) for NEST personnel in the field .
In subsequent years NEST personnel deployed to a number of major and smaller cities in the United States in response to nuclear extortion threats .
A deployment to Los Angeles in late 1975 was triggered by an extortion letter ( Document 7 ) transmitted to the president of the Union Oil Corporation .
Another deployment followed in 1979 when an employee of a General Electric plant in Wilmington , North Carolina removed some low - enriched uranium and threatened to send vials of it to activist organizations and news outlets ( Document 12a ) if he did not receive the payment demanded .
One element of the NEST response was to examine the threatening communication for clues about the extortionist and to assess the credibility of the threat .
A number of assessments were conducted in the Wilmington case , including at least one ( Document 12 b ) by Syracuse University psycholinguist and NEST consultant Murray Miron .
Often the initial credibility assessments resulted in the conclusion that no NEST response was necessary .
In other instances NEST was deployed or was near deployment in response to the reentry of nuclear - powered Soviet or Russian satellites into the atmosphere .
When the remains of a Soviet satellite crashed into the Canadian Northwest Territories in 1978 , NEST personnel joined the search for any radioactive remains ( Document 10 , Document 11 ) .
While that was NEST ’s first foreign deployment , it would not be its last .
In June 1982 , a joint memorandum ( Document 14 ) signed by the Departments of Energy , Defense , and State that delineated the departments responsibility for responding to “ malevolent nuclear incidents ” overseas , with many of the Department of Energy ’s responsibilities being NEST’s .
When not involved in actual deployments NEST personnel often participated in exercises , including “ full - field exercises , ” whose purpose was to test the response of NEST and other agencies involved in dealing with a nuclear incident ( including the FBI , military , and Federal Emergency Management Agency ) .
A key exercise in the 1980s was MIGHTY DERRINGER , held in Indianapolis in 1986 .
In October 1994 , NEST , FBI , and other personnel participated in MIRAGE GOLD in New Orleans .
While the after - action report ( Document 16 ) of the exercise was positive , a much less favorable view was held by Admiral Charles J. Beers Jr. , the senior Energy department official directly responsible for NEST .
Beers detailed his concerns in a January 1995 memo ( Document 17 ) and “ requested ” an assessment team be assembled to review the NEST program .
The extensive report ( Document 18 ) was completed in July 1995 .
While NEST has become more secretive about its activities since the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , it was more open in the mid-1990s .
One example of that openness was the briefing slides and associated text ( Document 19a , Document 19 b ) used in explaining NEST human and technical capabilities and activities to the press .

This national intelligence estimate examined the vulnerability of the United States to a Soviet attack using chemical , biological , or chemical weapons prior to the formal outbreak of war between the two nations .
The estimate explored a number of means of clandestine attack with nuclear weapons – including the use of disguised aircraft , merchant ships , commercial shipments , and diplomatic channels .
It also considered the mostly likely targets for clandestinely introduced chemical and biological weapons .

As its title indicates the 1960 estimate is more focused on Soviet capabilities and intentions with regard to clandestine attack using weapons of mass destruction , rather than U.S. vulnerabilities , as in the 1951 estimate ( Document 1 ) .
While the estimate acknowledges a Soviet capability to conduct such an attack it asserts that such an attack “ would be most unlikely ” except in conjunction “ with a deliberate Soviet initiation of general war . ”
The 1968 estimate differs from the 1960 estimate it in at least one important respect – it also includes China as a potential smuggler of weapons of mass destruction into the United States
According to the estimate , China might seek to smuggle a nuclear weapon onto American soil because it ( at the time ) lacked any other means of attacking the U.S. with nuclear weapons , but considered such an action “ unlikely . ”

This estimate again examines the prospects that a nation , primarily the Soviet Union or China , would seek to smuggle chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons onto U.S. territory .
It examines Soviet and Chinese capabilities and strategic considerations .
The estimate explores a possible motivation for clandestine introduction of a nuclear weapon into the United States by China not examined in the 1968 estimate ( Document 2 b ) , but one that was explored in novels and movies of the era .
The authors of the estimate discussed the possibility that China might introduce a nuclear weapon , one constructed to appear to be a Soviet weapon , with the intention of either provoking a U.S. - Soviet crisis or war .

These two memos were the result of an action by several members of Greenpeace , who collected the uranium tailings from a mining operation , placed them in a barrel along with a geiger counter – to illustrate their concern that nuclear waste piles were contaminating the western United States– and left the barrel in front of the White House .
The barrel was removed and a NEST team examined and dismantled the barrel , ultimately concluding that there was no radioactive threat .

In a column I wrote last year on 4th amendment rights in UA residence halls , I observed that “ a cursory look at the Wildcat ‘s popular ‘ Police Beat ' ” shows most evictions and arrests for alcohol and drugs “ could be avoided if students merely exercised their rights . ”
I am amazed by the number of college students who happily open their doors when police come knocking , and consent without a second thought to searches that might otherwise require a warrant .
So I ’ll repeat the crux of my column again , for the good of the studentry : when any agent of the state knocks on your door , you have the right to turn them away .
That action has consequences .
If it ’s an RA , they may call the police .
If it ’s a police officer , they ’ll call a judge for a warrant to enter .
But your constitutional rights do n’t end where the university begins , and you ought to know how to exercise those rights to protect yourself .
I ’m no fan of abetting campus criminals , but the victimless drug violations that account for almost a third of all UAPD arrests are criminal in name only–or at least , I assumed most of them were .
To be sure , I decided to take a more - than - cursory look at this year ’s police blotter entries , to see how many arrests might have been avoided and how many crimes were consensual .
The Arizona Reefer Review , a new project here at the Lamp , is a collection of digital clippings I ’ve compiled from the Wildcat ‘s “ Police Beat , ” chronicling all marijuana - related arrests and citations reported in the campus daily since the beginning of the 2008 - 2009 academic year .
The results might shock drug warriors :
Of the 46 arrests and incidents involving marijuana possession reported in “ Police Beat ” this year , there were only three cases where police discovered anything beyond more pot , alcohol , and the occasional bong or pipe : a routine traffic stop on a car passing through campus that turned up six pounds of marijuana and a revolver , a man arrested in the library for violating an exclusionary order , and a man caught playing “ Mario Kart ” in Coronado with an outstanding warrant .
None of the three cases involved UA students .
In other words , all reported incidents involving marijuana on the UA campus this year have been victimless , nonviolent , consensual crimes .
Of the 46 arrests and incidents , there are 27 cases in which students had a chance to assert their rights by asking for a warrant before admitting police to their rooms or consenting to a further search , but did not do so .
Just once did students resist a search , by refusing to acknowledge an officer ’s knock at the door of their dorm room .
Of the 46 arrests and incidents , there are no reported cases involving students who smoked so much marijuana that they were rushed to the hospital in an ambulance or discovered covered in vomit on the bathroom floor in their dorm .
There are no reported cases where marijuana made a student trash his roommate ’s bedroom or send threatening messages to his ex-girlfriend .
Not one–just otherwise normal students enjoying a drug so potent that even occasional users can go on to win fourteen gold medals or become President of the United States .
Imagine if UAPD stopped wasting officer time and taxpayer money responding to nightly calls from resident assistants who catch a whiff of weed .
Imagine if UAPD spent that time and those resources on something else , like stopping drunk driving –the biggest campus crime that imposes significant costs on others .
Imagine if the Dean of Students office stopped wasting time disciplining students for their private choices , and wasting money running a parallel students - only judicial system .
Imagine if all the students whose property was confiscated by the state or who were arrested or cited by officers could have continued their academic lives without the hassle of mandatory diversion courses or trips downtown to Superior Court to be punished for their own decisions .
Then imagine if all these students had been private citizens whose homes were burned and dogs killed in no - knock raids , or Hispanic kids caught in a park in South Tucson , and be thankful that the worst atrocities and injustices of the war on drugs have n’t yet come to UA .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Fears about the health of big financial firms and the overall economy have roared back into play , sending the stock market tumbling toward its lowest levels since last November .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped about 300 points one point Wednesday morning following the latest round of dark economic news .
Retail sales fell 2.7 % from a year ago in December , a decline twice as large as economists had expected .
Department store chain Gottschalks became the latest retailer to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , a victim of the disastrous holiday shopping season .
In the technology sector , Canadian telecom equipment vendor Nortel ( NT ) filed for bankruptcy after years of struggling to compete in a fast - changing communications market .
Making matters worse , all of these mounting problems in the economy only add to the worries about the health of balance sheets across the banking industry .
Despite the Bush administration 's $ 250 billion infusion of capital into the banking system , investors continue to fear that big financial firms ' capital - already pressured by souring mortgages and trading losses - will be eroded by rising defaults on credit cards , auto loans and other types of lending as people around the globe lose their jobs .
" The financial services group is just in free fall , " said Bill Larkin , a fixed income portfolio manager at Cabot Money Management in Salem , Mass .
" The scale of economic destruction we 're seeing right now is going to take a long time to turn around . "
Adding to the unease was the news of the latest restructuring effort at Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , the troubled New York financial giant that has received more than $ 300 billion in federal aid and loan guarantees in recent months .
Citi said Tuesday it would spin off 51 % of its Smith Barney brokerage arm into a joint venture with Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) .
The move will help Citi to shrink its $ 2 trillion balance sheet and bring in $ 2.7 billion in cash , but investors were n't bowled over : Citi shares plunged nearly 20 % Morgan Stanley dropped about 8 % as well .
As go banks , so goes the market
Wednesday 's banking - sector swoon extended a theme that has played out since 2009 began .
The stock market has fallen steadily - the Dow is off 7 % this year after posting a 38 % plunge last year - but the shares of big financial firms have been among the hardest hit .
The KBW Bank index , which fell more than 5 % Wednesday , is off 19 % for the year .
Among the many financial industry losers have been Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , which slid 5 % in midday trading Wednesday to its lowest point since 1995 .
Analysts expect the firm , which just completed its purchase of brokerage giant Merrill Lynch , to post a fourth - quarter loss next week and that it may cut its dividend for the second time in three months to preserve capital .
" One of the main concerns investors have with bank stocks is fear that the banks will be forced to raise equity capital that will lead to significant dilution to common shareholders , " Citigroup Global Markets analyst Keith Horowitz wrote in a note Monday .
Bank stocks fell sharply in Europe as well , after Deutsche Bank ( DB ) said it would post a $ 6 billion fourth - quarter loss and Barclays ( BCS ) set plans to slash 2,000 jobs .
The unrest in the financial sector highlights one of the shortcomings of the official response to the panic that broke out last fall after Lehman Brothers failed , Larkin said .
" Part of the problem is that the companies that made mistakes and took on too much risk are being propped up , " he said .
" Normally , the competitors benefit when the poorly run companies fail , but now no one is able to benefit because there have been no failures . "
Larkin said the unease in the financial sector now points to the need to let some troubled financial firms fail .
Otherwise , he said banks will continue to hold back on lending , and the economy will continue to spiral downward .
" We 've been saying around here we were going to get a dose of reality in the first quarter , " Larkin said , noting that stocks posted a modest year - end rally even as economic data pointed to a deepening slump .
" Now we 're seeing that things are even worse than anticipated . "

SAN FRANCISCO 
More electronic books are coming to mobile phones .
In a move that could bolster the growing popularity of e-books , Google said Thursday that the 1.5 million public domain books it had scanned and made available free on PCs were now accessible on mobile devices like the iPhone and the T - Mobile G1 .
Also Thursday , Amazon said that it was working on making the titles for its popular e-book reader , the Kindle , available on a variety of mobile phones .
The company , which is expected to unveil a new version of the Kindle next week , did not say when Kindle titles would be available on mobile phones .
“ We are excited to make Kindle books available on a range of mobile phones , ” said Drew Herdener , a spokesman for Amazon .
“ We are working on that now . ”
Google ’s move greatly expands the number of e-books that are available for reading on the go .
The Kindle currently offers about 230,000 titles .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Al Qaeda has shown no signs it plans to attack the United States during the presidential election , but the government must keep guard during the 2 - 1/2 - month transition to a new president , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said on Thursday .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff listens to a question during an interview with Reuters in Washington October 23 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
Chertoff added the global economic turmoil had yet to cause any visible change in al Qaeda ’s strategy , although the financial crisis could reduce state and local spending on security .
He also cautioned about heated political rhetoric in “ an intemperate time , ” saying it could fuel violence among Americans .
“ I have not seen evidence that a major element of al Qaeda ’s planning is our anniversaries or our elections , ” Chertoff told Reuters in an interview .
“ Terrorist operations are undertaken when they are operationally ready .
They do n’t wait for something that ’s an external event , and they do n’t rush it . ”
But he said , “ In a transition , as people leave and new people come in , it ’s human nature to have some distraction , and therefore it ’s important to be extra- focused during that period so that distraction does not become a vulnerability . ”
The new president takes office on Jan. 20 .
Al Qaeda attacks around the time of elections in Spain , Britain and Pakistan have caused some experts to warn the United States is potentially vulnerable before the Nov. 4 vote .
“ The remaining ... days of before the elections should be seen as a time of high threat , ” Los Angeles Police Commissioner William Bratton and former National Security Council official R.P Eddy said in a New York Daily News opinion column on Wednesday .
Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden also issued a videotape in late October 2004 shortly before the U.S. presidential election that was seen as an attempt to tilt the outcome toward U.S. President George W. Bush .
That year ’s Democratic presidential challenger , John Kerry , blamed the video in part for his defeat .
Chertoff did not rule out the possibility al Qaeda would issue election - season statements , but said , “ I do n’t regard an election , or a milestone like that , as in and of itself a significant indicator ” of attack plans .
Asked about the potential for domestic violence , Chertoff warned that hot rhetoric could trigger a “ disturbed individual , ” something the United States has long lived with .
“ We live in an intemperate time , when a lot of people take political positions which they express not just with vigor but so often with animosity and anger , and there is always a danger that someone reading that or listening to that suddenly decides now they want to act out .
That ’s why we have the Secret Service . ”
The presidential campaigns of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain have each accused the other side ’s supporters of inflamed comments .
FINANCIAL SECURITY
Chertoff said he had seen no signs a global financial crisis was enticing al Qaeda to plan attacks to take advantage of a perceived new weakness .
But he remained concerned al Qaeda had taken advantage of safe locations in Pakistan ’s border with Afghanistan to train Europeans and dispatch attackers .
“ The question is whether that will translate into something that ’s imminent . ”
The U.S. financial system was relatively well protected against computer attacks , such as crippled Georgia during last summer ’s incursion by neighbor Russia , and against physical attacks , he said .
But the financial crisis may affect security .
Some state and local governments , facing tight budgets due to an economic slowdown , have already tried to shift federal homeland security money for other purposes , with stretched justifications that Chertoff characterized as treating “ muggers as terrorists . ”
Chertoff encouraged the Obama and McCain campaigns to identify early top homeland security aides so they could begin working with outgoing counterparts .
He said he intended to leave around the presidential inauguration to go into the private sector .
He said his successor needed a background in law enforcement or emergency management , and should lack a grander political ambition , because of the many feathers ruffled by the sprawling new department .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Obama administration told a federal court late Friday it will maintain the Bush administration 's position that battlefield detainees held without charges by the United States in Afghanistan are not entitled to constitutional rights to challenge their detention .
Former detainees pray near Kaubul in 2005 following their release from U.S. custody at Bagram Air Base .
" Having considered the matter , the government adheres to its previously articulated position , " said a Justice Department document filed in federal court in Washington .
In a controversial 5 - 4 vote , the Supreme Court last year ruled that detainees held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay had a right under the constitution to challenge their continued detention .
However , the court did not say whether it applied to prisoners in other locations abroad , including Afghanistan .
Five prisoners held at Bagram Air Base , backed by human rights groups , have gone to court to claim the same rights as the men detained in Guantanamo Bay .
The new administration , which was given a month by a federal judge to declare whether the government wants to change its position , has now indicated it will continue to argue that it is against its security interests to release enemy combatants in a war zone .
Barbara
Olshansky , lead counsel for three of the detainee petitioners , said that the administration 's decision was " deeply disappointing . "
" We are trying to remain hopeful that the message being conveyed is that the new administration is still working on its position regarding the applicability of the laws of war -- the Geneva Conventions -- and international human rights treaties that apply to everyone in detention there , " she said .
The air base at Bagram , located north of the city of Kabul , houses between 600 and 650 detainees .
Most were picked up for suspected ties to terrorism .

Sun Microsystems axed 1,300 employees on Thursday , the first wave in a series of planned redundancies intended to cut head count by almost a fifth .
The company said in a statement it had cut workers across all levels , including employees in vice president and director positions .
It did not say who'd been cut , but The Reg has learned that the departed include individuals working on and around some of the company 's highly touted open - source projects .
Among those gone are brains who worked on the OpenJDK , desktop Java , and the Java 2 Standard Edition ( JavaSE ) interface .
Also gone are individuals working in marketing and on social media who were trying to build a community around OpenSolaris , the open - source edition of Sun 's Unix operating system .
News of the cuts will provide a brief respite for some at Sun , who 've been living under a cloud of uncertainty .
But more cuts are coming .
Sun announced in November it would cut 6,000 of its 33,400 workforce , on top of between 1,500 and 2,000 cuts announced in May .
Sun said in a statement Thursday that the number of positions that are being eliminated " when combined with the other cost cutting measures and organizational changes being implemented , will put the company on track for improved financial performance . " ®

Rumors of a next - generation Kindle , Amazon 's e-book reader , started appearing on the Internet almost as soon as the initial version hit the market .
Now , it appears that the company is finally ready to show the world what it 's had up its sleeve .
The company invited the press to an event it will host on February 9th at a location -- the Morgan Library and Museum - - that suggests it may have books on its mind .
There are a number of reasons that the Kindle 's rumor mill seems to been able to produce a steady stream of material for such an extended period of time .
For one , the device has frequently wound up selling out of stock , which suggests that Amazon was tightly managing its supply chain so as not to wind up with an abundance of discontinued hardware in its warehouses .
The poor timing of some of these out - of - stock events , such as the one that included the entire holiday sales season , made this logic seem that much more credible .
Then there was the device itself .
Despite handling its book reading function with aplomb , the device suffered from a series of hardware quirks , and the software that handled non -book content left a few things to be desired .
And the device 's aesthetics , or lack thereof , left a lot of people hungering for something less , well , ugly .
Or at least something more akin to its primary competition , Sony 's Reader , which has seen an update in recent months .
Since we first took a look at the Kindle 2.0 rumors over eight months ago , a rough consensus seems to have emerged .
The next version of the device will have fewer sharp edges , but wo n't see two of its major features -- the white coloring and a keyboard that takes up a big fraction of the hardware 's user - facing surface -- revised in any way .
E - Ink , which manufactures the device 's display , says they 've had more advanced versions ready for a while now , so some sort of upgrade there seems inevitable .
Despite the quirks , the Kindle keeps selling out , and prominent Chicagoans such as Oprah Winfrey and our own Ken Fisher seem to love it .
So , it 's safe to assume that the 2.0 version will make a big splash in the e-book world .
We 're definitely attending the press conference , so you can expect to see a full report .
We 've had a rocky history when it comes to e-book reader hardware --a Manhattan bike messenger was needed to give us access to Kindle 1.0 , and Sony never followed through on their promise to give us a Reader 2.0 to review -- but we 'll do the best we can to get you a full hands - on .

With cloned steaks hitting supermarket shelves , cloning is gaining momentum as a major ( ahem ) cash cow .
Scientists have been effectively cloning animals since the early 1960s , when a Chinese embryologist cloned an Asian carp .
It ’s just a matter of time until cloned humans start emerging from test tubes ; meanwhile , we natural - borns are just starting to chow down on cloned meat ( which the USDA does not require producers to label ) .
Below is a rundown of 20 animals that scientists have successfully cloned :
1. Carp
( Featured above : A common carp , as - yet - uncloned )
An Asian carp was cloned successfully in 1963 ; ten years later , scientist Tong Dizhou also cloned a European crucian carp .
2. Dolly the Sheep
Dolly saw the light of day in 1996 .
She lived until the age of six .
The first cloned mammal , Dolly is considered to be a great success .
Later , several hundred other Dollies were cloned .
3. Cumulina the Mouse
Cloned in Hawa’ii in 2000 , Cumulina was the first successful mouse clone .
She lived until the ripe old age of two years and seven months , a victory for her researchers .
4. Noto and Kaga ( Cows )
These cows were cloned in 1998 and duplicated several thousand times .
Made in Japan , the cows pave the way for other clones engineered to produce better meat and milk .
5. Mira the Goat
Also cloned in 1998 , Mira and her sisters came from a US lab as predecessors for livestock engineered to contain pharmaceutical products beneficial for humans .
6. A Family of Pigs : Millie , Alexis , Christa , Dotcom , and Carrel
Labs intend to modify pigs so that they can grow cells and organs that humans can use .
Millie and her sisters ( if you can call them that ) were cloned in 2000 by a US - based company .
7. Ombretta the Mouflon
The successful cloning of this endangered animal ( 2000 ) exemplifies how cloning can rescue a species from the brink of extinction .
8. Tetra the Rhesus Monkey
The lab monkey world received its first clone in 2000 .
US - based Tetra is the first in a series of cloned monkeys that scientists could use as test subjects to learn more about diseases like diabetes .
9. Noah the Gaur
A gaur is an Asian wild ox whose numbers are dwindling .
Cloned in 2001 , Noah only lived for two days before dying of dysentery .
10 . Rabbit
Cloned in 2001 , a white rabbit like the one featured above–and its 30 clones –was n’t given a cute name .
11 . Copy Cat ( CC )
This cat , cloned in 2001 , was the starting gun for a pet - cloning process that may eventually become an industry .
12 . Ralph the Rat
Cloned in 2002 , Ralph eventually came out of the womb 15 separate times ( his clones , that is ) .
Though rats like Ralph may eventually be used in labs , cross your fingers that his ilk wo n’t find their way into New York sewers .
13 . Idaho Gem
Mules are sterile–unless you clone them , as proven by Idaho Gem , the pride of a 2003 American research team .
14 . Prometea the Horse
An Italian team produced Prometea in 2003 .
They hoped to produce more Italian stallions , but their attempts failed .
Prometea birthed her own in 2008 .
Racehorses could come in the future .
15 . Ditteaux the African Wildcat
Although African wildcats are n’t endangered , US scientists cloned one in 2003 as a sort of template for cloning other , more vulnerable animals .
16 . Dewey the Deer
This white tail , cloned at Texas A&M University in 2003 , is one of those clones lacking a solid premise .
His ilk are some of the most abundant game in North America ; still , scientists say clones could be used to research deer genes and produce better deer stock for hunters .
As importantly , they managed to clone a deer before anyone else could do it .
17 . Libby and Lilly , Ferrets
These ferrets , cloned in 2004 , almost beg another “ why the heck did you do that ? ”
It turns out that ferrets are very useful for studying human respiratory diseases , and some types are endangered .
18 . Buffalo
This cloned Murrah buffalo from India could eventually become a high - volume milk source .
19 . Snuppy the Dog
South Korean scientists accomplished the notoriously challenging task of cloning a dog in 2005 .
Snuppy ’s predecessors could be used to study human diseases .
20 . Wolves : Snuwolf and Snuwolffy
Seoul National University ( SNU ) hit the canine cloning jackpot again with these two gray wolves as precursors for eventual conservation projects in 2005 .
John McCain assaulted Jeannette Jenkins , cousin of an American missing in South Vietnam since May of 1965 , by backhanding her against the wall .
He then threatened a wheelchair - bound mother by raising his left arm as if to strike her before coming to his senses .
He then pushed her wheelchair out of the way and abruptly continued down the hall .
The two speakers are Eleanor Apodaca , sister of a Vietnam War MIA , and Carol Hrdlicka , wife of a USAF pilot shot down in 1965 .
Photos demonstrate that Hrdlicka 's husband was held in CAPTIVITY , yet he never returned after the war .
She details her long experience with John McCain 's betrayal of trust .
To view McCain 's rude and antagonistic attack against Delores Alfond , Chairperson of the National Alliance of Families for the Return of America 's Missing , at the Senate Select Committee for POW / MIA Affairs in November 1992
The first group is made up of people who , for whatever reason , will not be able to make their monthly payments .
Some took out mortgages with initial monthly payments that they could n’t afford .
Others took out adjustable - rate mortgages whose monthly payments have ballooned to an unaffordable level .
Still others have lost their jobs .
At the start of this month , almost 1.5 million homeowners  out of about 75 million nationwide  were in this category .
They were at least two months behind on their mortgage payments .
Mark Zandi , the chief economist of Moody ’s Economy.com , estimates that another five million or so will fall into the category over the life of their mortgage , as the economy worsens and more adjustable - rate loans reset .
The second group is quite different .
It is made up of people who are at risk of foreclosure not because they wo n’t be able to keep up with their monthly payments  but because they may decide they do n’t want to continue making them .
These are the homeowners who are “ under water , ” which is to say their houses have lost so much value that they ’re now worth less than the underlying mortgage .
Homeowners with an underwater mortgage face a choice .
Many will stay put and keep making their monthly payments , because they see their house primarily as a home , rather than an investment .
Maybe they love their neighborhood or their children ’s school .
Maybe they just do n’t like the idea of reneging on a deal , as Brett Barry , a real estate agent near Phoenix , put it .
Others , though , are going to look at their home purely in economic terms and see an investment that may never pay off .
Some of them will choose to walk away .
What matters , for the purposes of a bailout , is that the number of underwater homeowners is much larger than the number of people who will be unable to make their mortgage payments .
Assuming that home prices still have a ways to fall , something like 19 million homeowners may be under water by 2010 ( only a few million of whom will be struggling to make their payments ) .
Now , who should be rescued ?
Let ’s start by acknowledging that morality cannot be the main criteria , unfortunately .
We used to both fit in this basket not THREE MONTHS ago .
Honey ?

Palo Alto ’s Ellin Klor would have a hard time intimidating anyone .
The 58 - year - old children ’s librarian is of medium height , with a physique that is more couch potato than gym rat — and a demeanor more friendly than frightening .
In her free time , she knits .
But three times in the past 15 years , she ’s stared down death .
Twice she battled breast cancer and won .
Right before her second bout with cancer , she got stabbed in the heart by a knitting needle in a freak accident .
Not only did she live to tell about it , but Klor was also instrumental in her own survival .
At least twice she warned people — including one emergency room doctor — not to pull the needle out of her chest .
Had they not listened to her , she most likely would have bled to death before doctors had time to close the hole in her heart .
Klor says there ’s nothing special about her .
If she can survive what she ’s been through , anyone can .
“ Look at me .
I ’m a little cream puff .
I ’m not a warrior woman , ” she said Saturday , sitting at a round wooden table in her home .
But others think people in similar situations could learn a lot from Klor .
Indeed , the story of how she survived the knitting needle accident is in the opening chapter of “ The Survivors Club : The Secrets and Science that Could Save Your Life , ” a book by Ben Sherwood that hits store shelves today .
An accidental stab wound to the heart is unusual but not unheard of , said Susan Brundage , the surgeon at Stanford University Medical Center who removed the needle from Klor ’s heart and stitched up the wound .
How one reacts to that kind of trauma can be crucial .
Two years ago , Australian “ Crocodile Hunter ” Steve Irwin died after he was stabbed in the heart by a sting ray ’s barb , Brundage noted .
Unlike Klor , who left the needle in her chest , Irwin reportedly removed the barb from his .
“ This is someone who should have known what he was doing , ” Brundage said .
In contrast , Klor — who told Brundage her medical knowledge came from the television show “ E.R. ” — “ calmly reacted and sought care , ” Brundage said .
The accident happened three years ago .
Klor was on her way to a friend ’s house for a regular meeting of her knitting club .
She had her arms full of things , including a friend ’s wooden knitting needles , when she slipped on the step leading into the house and fell flat on her chest .
When she picked herself up , she felt a pain in her chest every time she breathed .
After going inside , she tried to figure out what was wrong , but there was n’t any blood and no obvious signs of injury .
Only after removing her sweatshirt did she discover that a broken knitting needle was sticking through her bra .
“ I knew it was in my chest , but I did n’t know how far , ” she said .
One of Klor ’s friends , Alyssa Erickson , wanted to pull it out , but Klor told her not to touch it .
The group of friends then started talking about driving Klor to the emergency room , but she told them they needed to call 911 — right away .
Before the paramedics took her away in an ambulance , she sat on the couch in the living room with her friends and even had the presence of mind to ask them to call her husband , Hal , to let him know what had happened .
“ She did n’t panic , and she knew the right things to do , ” Erickson said .
“ It was all kind of very matter of fact . ”
Klor says now that she just did n’t think the injury was very serious .
“ There was no blood , ” she said .
“ I was n’t in a huge amount of pain . ”
After she arrived at Stanford Medical Center — and fended off the doctor who wanted to pull out the broken needle — the emergency doctors gave her a CT scan and discovered that the needle had pierced the right ventricle of her heart .
“ That ’s when I started to get scared , ” Klor said .
“ I wondered if I would live or die . ”
She went into surgery immediately .
Her chest was cracked open as if she were undergoing bypass surgery , and Brundage removed the needle .
One stitch to the heart later , Klor was on her way to recovery .
And to her next date with death .
Less than two weeks after the accident , Klor was back at Stanford , suffering from a terrible pain in her upper back .
Worried that she was suffering from a blood clot , possibly in her lungs , the doctors took X - rays and other tests of her chest region .
But the tests turned up nothing , so the doctors sent her home with nothing more than some pain medication .
Two days later , a radiologist called to let her know that they had found an enlarged lymph node in her right breast .
For a cancer survivor like Klor , that was a warning sign that cancer had returned .
Fortunately for Klor , the cancer had n’t spread .
After surgery , and six months of chemotherapy and radiation , she ’s healthy once more .
The first time she battled cancer , Klor said , she was emotional , frequently in tears .
The second time , she was much calmer .
She drew on her recent accident for strength :
If the knitting needle did n’t kill her , cancer was n’t going to either , she told herself .
Klor says she ’s lucky .
The needle accident could have been much worse .
Her second cancer could have been much more widespread .
What ’s more , she acknowledges she had a lot of help , including a loving family , good friends and , overall , top - flight medical care .
But she hopes others can learn from her experiences , that “ for people who need it , it gives them hope . ”

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - DVD revenue in the U.S. fell by 8 % in 2008 , but a new research report projects it ’s only a matter of time before Blu-ray begins to compensate for declining returns from traditional discs .
For now , the picture is a bit dimmer .
Even accounting for the sales of the fledgling high - def format , the home entertainment industry absorbed a 6 % decline last year .
The industry trade organization Digital Entertainment Group ( DEG ) circulated year - end data for the segment on Wednesday , even as researcher SNL Kagan released a report projecting an incremental strengthening of home entertainment revenue over the next several years .
Kagan said growth in the installed base on Blu-ray players eventually will help compensate more meaningfully for DVD declines
“ We expect a resurgence ... over the next couple of years , thanks to high - definition , ” Kagan forecasts in its report , dubbed “ The State of Home Video . ”
“ Retail revenue should start to grow again in 2010 , ” Kagan said .
“ Sales should start a short period of growth as high - definition player prices drop below $ 200 in 2011 and Blu-ray really begins to penetrate the mass market . ”
DVD sales and rentals totaled $ 21.6 billion in ‘ 08 , according to the DEG .
Adding in Blu-ray and near - negligible VHS boosted overall consumer spending to $ 22.4 billion .
The declines were worse than in the previous calendar year , when the initial wane in DVD interest shaped a 2 % falloff in home entertainment revenue .
Yet industryites ’ collective reaction seemed to be that it could have been worse in 2008 , with DEG suggesting the data shows the home entertainment market proved “ stable ” and “ resilient ” last year .
“ The upbeat assessment of these numbers as much as anything else is a reflection of the landscape and the times we ’re living in , ” DEG executive director Amy Jo Smith said .
“ Nobody really knew what to expect . ”
Paramount home entertainment president Kelley Avery said the revenue stats show “ people still came out for good movies on DVD and Blu-ray . ”
Avery added that disc pricing represents “ a great value to today ’s budget - conscious consumers . ”
Speaking of pricing , Blu-ray hardware sales represented a true bright spot after retailers slashed prices on Blu-ray players at the cusp of the holiday gift - buying season and consumers responded .
In fact , it ’s somewhat remarkable in the current economic climate that 3 million of the fewer than 10 million Blu-ray players sold to date were purchased during the fourth quarter .
On the software side , Blu-ray sales contributions amounted to less than 3 % of total home entertainment revenue last year .
But Kagan projects the high - def piece of the pie will grow to almost 19 % by 2011 , when Blu-ray revenue is projected to reach $ 3.53 billion .
By 2014 , the researcher expects high - def to account for 60 % of segment revenue , at $ 13.05 billion .

I do n't like the word " fusion " being used to describe cooking , because it implies a combination of ingredients that 's contrived .
Sure , the Provençal aïoli in these pork belly and steamed bun sandwiches is n't especially traditional — neither , for that matter , is putting Sriracha in Provençal aïoli .
But I 'm half Chinese and half American , and I live in New York City , where all culinary traditions bleed into one another .
This is just how we eat here .
The pork belly sandwich is assembled from four components :
1. Mantou , or Chinese steamed buns , which can be found in the freezer section of most Asian grocery stores .
The milk - white buns are fluffy , slightly sweet , and can be as small as an apricot or as large as a fist .
2. Soy - braised pork belly
3. Sautéed , sesame - scented cabbage
4. Homemade chili aïoli
Personally , I live in fear of spectator sports — but I 'll venture that these boldly - flavored stuffed buns would make a popular game day dish .
I spent $ 7.44 to make six substantial sandwiches , but , if you buy the miniature steamed buns , you can serve at least double that number as snack - sized " sliders . "
The Shopping List
Note : Items bought in large quantities , like the eggs , have been pro-rated for cost .
Ingredients a cook can reasonably be expected to have on hand are considered " Pantry Items " and are not factored into recipe cost .
1 pound pork belly - $ 2.89 Package of 6 mantou , or Chinese steamed buns - $ 2.99 Half a head of green cabbage - $ 0.74 Small knob of ginger - $ 0.15 1 egg - $ 0.17 ( total cost of carton - $ 1.99 ) 1 lemon - $ 0.50
Pantry Items Garlic , soy sauce , star anise and / or cinnamon sticks and / or five - spice powder , chili sauce , mustard , sesame oil , vegetable oil , sugar , and salt
Total Cost
$ 7.44
The Star Ingredient
Pork belly is basically pre-bacon — that is , bacon before it 's been salt - cured and soaked in nitrates .
Bacon 's already pretty cheap , and pork belly is cheaper .
Sadly , it 's not sold as widely as bacon , and , in the likely scenario that your grocery store does not carry it , you 'll have to visit an independent butcher shop .
( In Manhattan , I go to Jeffrey 's inside the Essex Street Market — he sells it for $ 2.89 a pound . )
Cheap as it is , pork belly needs long , slow cooking to tenderize its sizable swathe of fat .
Fortunately , the majority of the cooking time in today 's dish is not active ; during the 3 - 4 hours of braising , you 'll only need to worry about periodically replenishing the water .
Soy - Braised Pork Belly
- will fill 6 large or 12 - 15 mini sandwiches -
A note on spices :
This recipe calls for either five - spice powder or a mixture of cinnamon sticks and whole star anise .
If you do n't have these items , experiment with Moroccan spice blend ras - el - hanout , or even toasted coriander or anise seeds and whole peppercorns .
Most fragrant , woody spices will work here , even if they 're not strictly " authentic . "
Bonus :
As the pork belly simmers , place a few peeled , hard - boiled eggs in the braising liquid .
Remove them after an hour or two , when they have taken on a rich , brown color .
These are " soy sauce eggs , " a traditional Chinese snack and side dish .
The pitted roads around Multan , the city of saints , stretch flat across the fields .
They lead past rundown factories , workshops , shabby roadside teashops and mile after mile of flat fields broken only by the mud and brick houses of the villages of Pakistan 's rural poor .
One road leads south - east to the nearby city of Bahawalpur , the biggest recruiting base of the militant groups currently being blamed by India for the Mumbai attack ; another leads north - west to Faridkot , the home village of Mohammad Ajmal Mohammad Amin Kasab , a 21 - year - old Pakistan national named yesterday in the Indian media as the only gunman involved in last week 's atrocity now alive and in custody .
Already a picture claimed by the Indian media to be Kasab , showing a young man dressed in combat trousers , carrying a backpack and an AK47 , on his way to to Mumbai 's main station to carry out his deadly work , has become an iconic image of the assault on the city .
Two other militants have been named .
Like Kasab , according to the Indian media reports , they are said to be from the Multan region , southern Punjab .
They , too , are said to be members of the Pakistan - based militant group Lashkar - e - Taiba ( Army of the Pure ) and to have followed a five - month training period to prepare them for the attack .
The charge of the group 's involvement , denied by its spokesmen , has explosive political consequences for the volatile region and must be treated with caution .
In the long - running contest between India and its neighbour , propaganda and misinformation is far from rare .
But if the details now emerging are confirmed , the link to Pakistan may spark war .
For though it is widely acknowledged that Pakistan 's civilian government has limited control over local militant groups , it is clear that Pakistan 's military and security establishment does .
Lashkar - e- Taiba was originally founded with the support of the Pakistani military intelligence service , the ISI , to fight as ' deniable ' proxies in the contested territory of Kashmir , part of a decades - old strategy by the militarily weaker Pakistan to ' bleed ' its bigger rival .
The ISI also has connections with Jaish - e - Mohammed , the second group that New Delhi security officials has accused of involvement in the Mumbai attacks .
For the moment little is known about the three men named yesterday or their accomplices .
But their place of origin comes as no surprise to experts .
Both Lashkar - e - Taiba and Jaish - e - Mohammed draw the majority of their recruits from the southern Punjab .
Last week The Observer travelled to the twin towns of Multan and Bahawalpur , the centres of the region , to investigate the reality of the groups ' power on the ground , their relations with the Pakistani intelligence services and the factors which drive young men , possibly including the Mumbai gunmen , to join them .
Trace a line from where US special forces battle Taliban fighters in the corner of empty desert where the Afghan , Pakistani and Iranian frontiers meet , follow it through the badlands of the Pakistani North West Frontier and on through the bomb - blasted cities of northern Pakistan and down through Delhi , attacked in September , to shell - shocked Mumbai , and one thing becomes clear : this zone has displaced the Middle East as the new central front in the struggle against Islamic militancy .
The southern Punjab falls on the line 's centre point .
There may be doubt over the identity of the attackers , but there is none that Multan and Bahawalpur and villages such as Faridkot are in the Indians ' sights .
For most militants in the region the story - and that of Azam Amir Kasab is unlikely to be very different - starts at school .
The southern Punjab has one of the highest concentrations of religious schools or madrassas in south Asia .
Most teach the ultra - conservative Deobandi strand of Islam that is also followed by the Afghan Taliban and , crucially in this desperately poor land , offers free classes , board and lodging to students .
In Bahawalpur the Jaish - e - Mohammed group , believed responsible for a string of brutal attacks across south Asia , including the murder of Jewish American journalist Daniel Pearl , has been linked to two such madrassas .
One is the headquarters of the group - a semi- fortified and forbidding complex in the centre of the town .
The other is the Dar - ul - Uloom Medina , where the brother - in - law of Rashid Rauf , the Bahawalpur - based suspected British militant thought to have been killed in an American missile attack eight days ago , is a teacher .
Surrounded by some of the 700 students , he told The Observer that ' jihad ' was the duty of all his young charges .
The pupils at the more radical Bahawalpur and Multan schools grow up soaked in extremist ideology .
The most senior cleric in Bahawalpur , Maulana Riaz Chugti , said his students could only go ' for training or to fight ' after their studies or when the schools were shut for the holy month of Ramadan .
' To fight in Afghanistan or Kashmir and to struggle against the forces who are against Islam is our religious duty , ' Chugti , who oversees the education of 40,000 students , told The Observer .
In Bahawalpur both the effects and the limits of the recent reversal of policy by the ISI , the powerful Pakistani military intelligence service , are evident .
A crackdown on the militant groups was launched after they were blamed for a bloody attack on the Indian parliament in 2001 which almost brought India and Pakistan to open war .
The groups , previously seen as a strategic asset , were suddenly seen as , at least for the moment , a liability .
When their operatives were linked to plots to assassinate the then President , and evidence of collusion with al - Qaeda itself became clear , the pressure mounted on the ISI to rein in their former protégés .
' The militants have had to lower their profile , ' said one local security official .
' They are no longer recruiting or preaching or raising funds openly .
Things are much more difficult for them .
If they recruit at all they do it individual by individual , not en masse like before .
There is no production line .'
But the groups - along with break - away outfits with their roots in sectarian Shia - Sunni violence in the region - still have a significant presence in the region , particularly in remote villages such as that of Azam Amir Kasab .
' They may be semi-retired , but in my village there are 300 men who have fought in Afghanistan and have training and can be activated with one phone call , ' one local former militant said .
That fighters for one operation should come from the same place was not surprising .
' When I went to Afghanistan I went with five guys who I knew from school , ' he said .
The young men of the southern Punjab have been found across a broad swath of south Asia and even further afield .
In Kabul in August , The Observer interviewed Abit , a 23 - year - old from Bahawalpur who had surrendered to Afghan police seconds before he was supposed to blow himself up in a huge truck bomb .
Other militants from the town have been found as far away as Bangladesh .
Lashkar - e - Taiba members have even been located in Iraq .
The groups are also of great interest to British intelligence services , who fear their key role as intermediaries between young volunteers from the UK's Muslim community - such as Rauf - and al - Qaeda leaders based in the volatile tribal zones along Pakistan 's western frontier .
The groups , the sources say , have a UK support network to supply funding .
The groups ' relationship with the intelligence services is complex .
Front organisations for the groups have even put up candidates in recent elections and travel without fear throughout Pakistan .
Earlier this year The Observer interviewed a representative of one group alleged to be linked to Lashkar - e - Taiba in the foyer of a luxury Lahore hotel .
Local politicians said groups in the region were still powerful enough to intimidate the local government and security forces and even to collect tax or mediate in legal disputes in some areas .
Roshan Gilani , a Shia community leader in Bahawalpur , said music shops had received Taliban - style threats , telling them to close or risk violence .
Prominent Shias have been told they are on a hit list .
Until the Mumbai attacks , the recent series of bombings in India had been attributed by most analysts to a home - grown militant outfit : the Indian Mujahideen .
With many highly educated and middle - class recruits among its ranks , and led by a 36 - year - old computer engineer , the group 's members have a very different profile from the Pakistani groups ' recruits .
But though their paths may be very different , the militants ' eventual destination - fanaticism , violence and hate - are the same .
Intelligence agencies have done much research since 9/11 into how individuals become terrorist killers .
Dehumanising the enemy is seen as key .
Civilians are no longer seen as innocent but as complicit in a war waged by their governments against Islam .
Group dynamics also play a huge role , particularly when teams of militants are isolated from normal society for long periods of time .
Training camps - such as those in which Azam Amir Kasab is said to have spent months - are the perfect way of reinforcing solidarity and the new ' world view ' which will allow them to execute murderous operations , such as killing diners in a hotel restaurant in cold blood .
Indian authorities believe local members of the Indian Mujahideen may have acted as scouts to prepare the ground and gather intelligence before the attack .
Security services now recognise that militant groups looking to prepare attacks seek out resources and often enter into temporary coalitions with other outfits when necessary .
Though criminal links to Islamic militants are rare , they are not unknown , and there are some suggestions that local underworld networks may have been exploited to get the attackers to the targets by sea .
India 's terror groups
Lashkar - e- Taiba ( Army of the Pure )
Battling to end Indian rule in Kashmir , this Pakistan - based group is routinely blamed by Indian security forces for attacks .
The surviving gunman arrested in Mumbai is said to be a member .
Maoists , also known as Naxalites
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said the Maoists are the most serious threat to national security .
Their battles with police cause a steady death toll .
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
The violence caused by this Sri Lankabased separatist group spilled into India in 1991 when a suicide bomber killed Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi .
Sikh separatists
President Indira Gandhi's
Sikh bodyguards shot her in 1984 in revenge for the hundreds killed when the military , aiming to suppress separatist militants , stormed a temple in Amritsar .

You know how it is .
You 're a power user , an alpha nerd .
You just are n't happy without multiple screens - a puny one - screen desktop is n't enough for the multiple video feeds , apps and so forth that are essential to your working life .
But that 's too bad , because you are also a deadly US Navy SEAL supertrooper .
Your video feeds are n't CNN - well , maybe some of them are actually - they 're live video from surveillance drones prowling overhead , or from robothopter bat - bugs you have sent into the bad guys ' stronghold .
You 're normally working up to your chest in the snows of the Hindu Kush or the stinking mud of the Euphrates delta , generally resting your ruggedised laptop on the dead body of a terrorist you have just killed in total silence with no more than a piece of string , using a little known Oriental grappling technique .
So no multiple screens for you - or at least , not until now .
Because now the era of the waterproof , shockproof , dustproof , dual screen laptop has dawned .
The machine in this case is a ruggedised version of the G400 dual - screen machine from Alaskan startup gScreen , which says the G400 is " the first true dual - screen laptop with identical 15 - inch LED backlit displays " , though others might dispute that .
The G400 is n't actually on sale yet - customers can reserve one from the 25th .
Meanwhile , however , certain privileged customers are jumping the queue .
Last week , Naval Special Warfare Group 2 based at Little Creek , Virginia issued a notice of intent to award a small - biz set aside contract for " Titan M1 Dual screen Laptop Workstations " .
The gScreen corporate blog confirms that " this product is being built specifically to specs requested by the US NAVY for extreme environments " .
Apart from dual displays , the frogman - commando IT types will get an Intel CORE 2 Quad QX9300 processor , 4GB of RAM , 500GB hard drive and standard MIL - STD 810 F ruggedisation .
The SEALs have also specified dual GeForce 8600 M graphics cards , Blu - Ray drive , Gigabit networking , WiFi and Bluetooth .
It seems they 're no fans of Vista - the machines are to come with Windows XP Pro .
It does occur that machines of this sort would also be capable of other than strictly work - related tasks . ®

Excess supply of rental property is a factor across the UK , the reports say
The cost of renting a home has dropped as frustrated property sellers have been flooding the market , according to two separate surveys .
Owners were choosing to let rather than sell , having accepted that property prices were likely to stay low for some time , said property website Globrix .
Cities such as Manchester continue to have an oversupply of new - build apartments , said Findaproperty.com .
Its research chief said landlords were adding perks to attract tenants .
Extras such as satellite television or cleaners were being included in the rental agreement to make properties more appealing , said Andrew Smith , of Findaproperty.com .
Supply surge Both surveys , drawing on listings placed by estate agents on the websites , suggest that the tough economic climate has caused a surge in supply of rental properties - even since the turn of the year .
AVERAGE ASKING RENT Scotland : £ 683 , down 2.3 % year - on - year North East England : £ 625 , up 10.6 % North West England : £ 592 , down 14.3 % Yorkshire and the Humber : £ 595 , down 2.3 % West Midlands : £ 643 , down 4.9 % East Midlands : £ 633 , up 2.4 % Wales : £ 651 , down 2.3 % East England : £ 787 , down 4 % London : £ 1,669 , down 5.9 % South West England : £ 815 , down 2.4 % South East England : £ 1,066 , down 6.1 % Source : FindaProperty Rental Index , February 2009
Perils of the defaulting landlord Average rental asking prices dropped by 4.8 % over the year to £ 830 a month in February , according to Findaproperty.com .
It found that the average home was up for grabs for 70 days before tenants were found , 15 days longer than a year ago .
" Tenants are becoming more demanding as the market swings in their favour and landlords are now less likely to receive the uplift in rents at renewal that they might previously have achieved , " said Mr Smith .
" Despite falling rents and increased competition , we do not expect investors to abandon the market . "
He suggested that the rush to build new flats , designed primarily during the property boom for buy - to - let investors , was the most significant reason behind the 14.3 % fall in rental prices in the North West in the last year .
This was particularly obvious in Manchester , said Mr Smith .
Most other regions of the country saw a fall in asking rents in the last year of between 2.3 % and 6.1 % , with the exception of price rises in the East Midlands and the North East .
Local issues
The Globrix report found that the growing supply of properties available to rent had accelerated since the start of 2009 .
Although the report described the rental market as at saturation point , chief executive Daniel Lee said that supply would continue to outstrip demand .
" Many homeowners , worried about losing their jobs and struggling with debts accrued during the good years , are renting their properties and downsizing or moving to less expensive areas to hedge their bets , " he said .
But the situation could be different at a local level , according to Zaza Patterson , lettings manager at Dreweatt Neate estate agents .
" The rental market is a localised beast and it's important to understand that in some areas rents will have fallen by less , by more or even not at all , " she said .

Editor 's note : Fareed Zakaria is a foreign affairs analyst who hosts " Fareed Zakaria : GPS " on CNN at 1 p.m. ET Sundays .
Fareed Zakaria says only the inefficient part of the automobile industry is asking for a bailout
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The future of the U.S. auto industry was in doubt Friday after a proposal for $ 14 billion in federal loans died in a late - night Senate vote .
The Senate voted 52 - 35 to bring the measure up for a vote -- short of the 60 votes needed to advance the legislation .
The failure followed the collapse of negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans seeking a compromise that all parties , including the auto companies and the United Auto Workers union , could accept .
The dramatic late - night developments could doom General Motors to bankruptcy and closure in the coming weeks , with Chrysler LLC potentially following close behind .
While Ford Motor has more cash on hand to avoid an immediate crisis , its production could be disrupted by problems in the supplier base , as could the production of overseas automakers with U.S. plants , such as Toyota Motor and Honda Motor .
CNN spoke to world affairs expert and author Fareed Zakaria about a potential bailout .
CNN : Is a bailout of the U.S. automotive industry necessary ?
Zakaria :
There are really two different U.S. auto industries .
And only one part of it would have qualified for the bailout that was just rejected by the U.S. Senate -- the inefficient part that is headquartered in Detroit .
There is another auto industry in the United States and it is healthy .
While it is obviously going through tough times because of the economic crisis , it has not gone begging to Washington for taxpayer help .
CNN : But are n't the Big Three the drivers of the American auto industry ?
( No pun intended . )
Zakaria : Actually there are 12 international car companies that have manufacturing operations in the United States .
Collectively , they employ 113,000 Americans directly -- even though that is less than the 239,000 at Ford , GM and Chrysler .
However , those international car companies sell more cars than the Big Three and their customers love their products .
They have millions of American shareholders .
They do sophisticated work like research , design and marketing in the United States .
All in all , they add jobs and high value to the United States .
CNN : So what are they doing better than the U.S. car companies ?
Zakaria :
It is simple -- better management .
Yes , Detroit has problems because of its legacy costs , the cost of paying health care and pensions to its retirees .
But many other Americans firms in other industries have had to change their benefit systems or die .
Detroit always managed to avoid making the change in part because of government assistance .
But companies like Toyota , Honda , and BMW are not just skilled at cutting costs -- they make better cars .
They have more flexible factories and production systems , and understand what American consumers want .
For example , Toyota and Honda are years ahead of American carmakers in designing and producing hybrid cars , and as consumer demand moves in that direction , they will reap the rewards .
Al Gore remarked on the problem on our show a few weeks back .
" It 's really tragic that General Motors , for example , allowed Toyota to get a seven - year head start on the hybrid drive train in the Prius that is now positioned to really be a dominant feature of the industry in this century . "
CNN : But are n't the Big Three saying they will restructure to compete with their foreign competitors ?
Zakaria :
Yes , as in the past , now that the heat is on , Detroit has been promising to change its ways -- as long as it gets cash .
But many people are skeptical and think of it as just a jobs program .
CNN : So you are against the bailout ?
Zakaria : No .
But the reasons the CEOs of Ford , GM and Chrysler present -- that they will restructure , they are still competitive , they will change -- are bogus ; they wo n't .
The best argument for the bailout is that it is the most cost - effective jobs program that the government can run in the short term .
Spending on infrastructure to create jobs will take months , maybe years .
However , keeping the Big Three afloat will keep hundreds of thousands of jobs in place quickly and easily .
It 's true the companies will eventually go bankrupt , but by then hopefully the economy can withstand it .

The farmer and his sons waited until the daily lull in the Israeli offensive before attempting their dash for safety .
About 1 p.m. Friday , Mohammed Shurrab and his two sons piled into a red Land Rover and fled the family ’s farm in the village of Fukhari , southeast of Khan Yunis , in the southern Gaza Strip .
Kassab , a 28 - year - old engineer , sat in the front passenger seat and Ibrahim , an 18 - year - old college student , sat in the back .
They did n’t get far .
As they drove , a hail of bullets struck the car , shattering the windshield .
A group of Israeli soldiers had opened fire from a house about 30 yards away , Shurrab said .

Shurrab , 60 , ducked and shouted for his sons to do the same , but Kassab had already taken at least one bullet in the chest .
Panicking , Kassab leaped from the car , staggered perhaps 10 yards and then fell in the street as the bullets continued to fly , his father said .
Ibrahim pushed open the back door and tried to get out , but was immediately shot in the leg .
He pulled out a cellphone and tried to call for assistance , but a soldier ordered him in broken Arabic to throw down the phone , his father said .
Shurrab coaxed his injured son back into the car .
Only then did he notice that his own hand was bleeding .

“ It was so terrifying , ” Shurrab said the next day from his hospital bed in Khan Yunis .
“ I shouted at the soldiers to help us , but no answer . ”
With the body of Kassab lying in the street , Shurrab said , he and Ibrahim sat bleeding in their car for 20 hours .
Shurrab called the local ambulance service and was told that they were waiting for coordination with the Israeli army so they could come safely to the scene .
He phoned his relatives , who called the Red Cross and gave his number to local journalists .
As night approached and his bleeding son grew weaker , he spoke with Al Jazeera , BBC Arabic and several local radio stations , pleading to be rescued .

Ibrahim complained to his father that he felt cold .
“ I could not do anything for my son , ” Shurrab said .
Around midnight , the cellphone battery died .
Soon afterward , Ibrahim stopped responding .
“ I waited for my fate , ” Shurrab said , crying .

Israeli troops allowed an ambulance through at 11 a.m. Saturday .
Ambulance driver Mahmoud Heikal said he saw Israeli troops watching from a nearby house as he approached the red Land Rover .
Kassab Shurrab lay dead in the street .
Ibrahim had bled to death in the car .
The Israeli army did n’t comment on the incident involving the Shurrab family .
But a statement issued Saturday said that “ given the difficult combat circumstances , complex battles and fighting in urban settings , uninvolved civilians are unfortunately exposed to danger . ”

With McLaren ’s MP2 - 24 unveiled yesterday we can now see how the first three 2009 F1 cars to be launched compare .
Here ’s some close - up comparisons of the new McLaren alongside the Ferrari F60 and Toyota TF109 .
Front wing
McLaren only provided two studio photographs of the MP4 - 24 making comparisons with the other cars launched so far a little tricky .
We will hopefully get a better impression of their 2009 F1 challenger when it begins testing at Portimao in Portugal today .
In the meantime , a side - by - side comparison of its front wing with the Toyota TF109 ’s is possible ( above , click to enlarge ) .
F1 Technical notes the advanced development of the MP4 - 24 ’s front wing :
While Ferrari attempted a modest double decker wing and Toyota displayed a basic version , the new McLaren wing looks ready to be raced .
The main panel features sweeping curves starting from a minimum - height horizontal leading edge .
The red coloured moveable flaps are similarly curved in an attempt to improve the airflow in the inside of the front wheels , while maximising downforce ahead of it .
View from above
Without a proper top - down shot of the MP4 - 24 , comparisons here area little tricky .
We can , however , see that McLaren has not emulated the small constructions Ferrari and Toyota have in front of their sidepods .
The sidepod apertures are also interesting , with an oval shape distinctly different to that seen on the TF109 and F60 .
The MP4 - 24 does n’t seem to be anything like as narrowly waisted at the rear as the F60 does .
The difference in the MP4 - 24 ’s suspension is striking .
This picture gives a closer view of McLaren ’s suspension configuration :
Side - by - side
The McLaren ’s front nose is shorter than the Ferrari ’s but longer than the Toyota’s .
It looks taller , though that impression is slightly distorted in the above photograph by the endplate behind it .
The MP4 / 24 has a longer engine cover fin that its rivals and a much larger section cut from the rear endplate ( which I think does a lot for its aesthetic appeal ) .
They ’ve also carried over the roll hoop cutaway section from the MP4 / 23 not seen on either of the other cars .
On Monday we ’ll get the see the Renault R29 and Williams FW31 for the first time , giving us half a grid of 2009 - spec cars to examine .

At long last .
Change we can believe in .
In choosing Leon Panetta to take charge of the CIA , President - elect Barak Obama has shown he is determined to put an abrupt end to the lawlessness and deceit with which the administration of George W. Bush has corrupted intelligence operations and analysis .
First and foremost , the appointment gives hope that torture and " rendition " ( a euphemism for kidnapping people for delivery to foreign torture chambers ) is over  or will be in less than two weeks .
Character counts .
And so does integrity .
With those qualities , and the backing of a new President , Panetta is equipped to lead the CIA out of the wilderness into which it was driven by sycophantic directors with very flexible attitudes toward truth , honesty and the law  directors who deemed it their duty to do the President ’s bidding  legal or illegal ; honest or dishonest .
In a city in which lapel - flags have been seen as adequate substitutes for the Constitution , Panetta will bring a rigid adherence to the rule of law .
For Panetta this is no battlefield conversion .
On torture , for example , this is what he wrote a year ago :
" We cannot simply suspend [ American ideals of human rights ] in the name of national security .
Those who support torture may believe that we can abuse captives in certain select circumstances and still be true to our values .
But that is a false compromise .
We either believe in the dignity of the individual , the rule of law , and the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment , or we do n’t .
There is no middle ground .
" We cannot and we must not use torture under any circumstances .
We are better than that . "
Please tell those of your friends who rely solely on the Fawning Corporate Media ( FCM ) that torture is a crime  not only under international law , but also under the War Crimes Act ( 18 U.S.C. 2441 ) passed by a Republican - dominated Congress in 1996 .
And besides that , torture can never be counted upon to yield trustworthy intelligence  never .
As for integrity , this is nothing new for Leon Panetta .
As head of President Richard Nixon ’s Office of Civil Rights , he insisted on enforcing laws to protect minorities even under pressure from Nixon to get in line with the Republican “ southern strategy ” of neglecting civil rights .
Rather than buckle to these demands , Panetta resigned and later became a Democrat .
How Did We Get Here ?
Political courage  like that demonstrated by Panetta as a young man  was what was lacking as the Bush administration turned America ’s principled repudiation of torture inside out , from the top down .
Unfortunately for President Bush , he cannot feign ignorance of this process , since the White House itself has released a Memorandum for the President dated Jan. 25 .
2002 , in which his lawyers apprised him of the seriousness of the War Crimes Act and even noted , " punishments for violations of Section 2441 include the death penalty . "
That memorandum , signed by then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales ( but drafted by Vice President Dick Cheney ’s lawyer , David Addington ) warned specifically of " prosecutors and independent counsels who may in the future decide to pursue unwarranted charges based on Section 2441 . "
They then told Bush not to worry ; that all he needed to do was to make a " determination that the GPW [ Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War ] does not apply . "
They added cheerily , " Your determination would create a reasonable basis in law that Section 2441 does not apply , which would provide a solid defense to any future prosecution . "
It is a safe bet that Bush now wishes he had gotten a second opinion .
Instead , he went ahead and signed an executive memorandum on Feb. 7 , 2002 , incorporating the Mafia - style advice of his lawyers .
He then sent it to Vice President Dick Cheney , Secretary of State Colin Powell , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , Attorney General John Ashcroft , Chief of Staff to the President Andrew Card , Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet , Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Condoleezza Rice , and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Richard Myers .
It seems strangely appropriate that it bore the Orwellian title : Humane Treatment of al - Qaeda and Taliban Detainees .
In the memorandum , Bush lifts language verbatim from the Gonzales / Addington memo of Jan. 25 and makes it his own .
He claims , for example , " the war against terrorism ushers in a new paradigm [ that ] requires new thinking in the law of war . "
He then attempts to square a circle , directing ( twice in the two - page memo ) that " detainees be treated humanely and , to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity , in a manner consistent with the principles of Geneva . "
Exegesis by the Senate
On Dec. 11 , 2008 , Sen. Carl Levin , D - Michigan , and Sen. John McCain , R - Arizona , of the Senate Armed Services Committee released a report on the abuse of detainees  a report 18 months in the making and approved by the committee by voice vote without dissent .
Not surprisingly , every organ of the Fawning Corporate Media draped a smokescreen around President Bush ’s own role , by blaming everyone ’s favorite bête noire , former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld .
[ For a non-FCM approach , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Torture Trail Seen Starting with Bush . ” ]
It was not as though the President ’s own fingerprints were missing .
The first subhead was : Presidential Order Opens Door to Considering Aggressive Techniques , and the first words of the first sentence of the first paragraph were , " On Feb .
7 , 2002 , President Bush signed a memorandum stating " Later in that same paragraph the committee report again refers to " the President ’s order , " adding that " the decision to replace well - established military doctrine , i.e. , legal compliance with the Geneva Conventions , with a policy subject to interpretation , impacted the treatment of detainees . "
" Conclusion 1 " of the Senate Armed Services Committee report states :
" Following the President ’s determination [ of Feb. 7 , 2002 ] , techniques such as waterboarding , nudity , and stress positions were authorized for use in interrogations of detainees in U.S. custody . "
Consequences
Participants in detainee interrogations understood that the basis for the harsh tactics stemmed from policies approved by Bush .
According to a report by a panel headed by former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger on the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuses , Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez , the top commander in Iraq , instituted a " dozen interrogation methods beyond " the Army ’s standard practice under the Geneva Convention .
Sanchez explained that he based his decision on " the President ’s memorandum , " which he said allowed for “ additional , tougher measures ” against detainees , the Schlesinger report said .
In addition , an FBI e-mail of May 22 , 2004 from a senior FBI agent in Iraq stated that President Bush had signed an Executive Order approving the use of military dogs , sleep deprivation , and other tactics to intimidate Iraqi detainees .
In the e-mail , the FBI official sought guidance in confronting an unwelcome dilemma .
He asked if FBI personnel in Iraq were required to report the U.S. military ’s harsh interrogation of detainees when such treatment violated FBI standards but fit within the guidelines of a presidential Executive Order .
Thus , what happened in many of the jail cells and interrogation chambers stemmed directly from of Bush ’s Feb.
7 , 2002 , memo and other presidential and vice presidential decisions .
No doubt it has long since occurred to Bush that he was mistaken to have put his fate in the dubious hands of his sadistic lawyers ; foolish to sign his name to an executive order clearly in violation of international law as well as the U.S. War Crimes
Act of 1996 ; and foolish in the extreme to continue to let Gonzales roam the White House without adult supervision .
Shifting Blame
Ironies abound .
In June 2004 , after the obscene photos surfaced from Abu Ghraib , Gonzales screwed up again  royally .
Casting about to show that the President never authorized torture , Gonzales came up with the bright idea of adducing the Feb.
7 , 2002 , executive order as proof !
No , I ’m not kidding .
Gonzales apparently thought no one would read beyond the overly clever , first - word adjectival euphemism in the memo ’s title : Humane Treatment of al - Qaeda and Taliban Detainees .
So on June 22 , 2004 , the White House had the Feb 7 , 2002 , memorandum , together with other memos , declassified and released .
At a press conference that day , Gonzales said the release was motivated by a desire to address " confusion " over whether the torture techniques on display in the Abu Ghraib photos had been approved by higher - ups .
Gonzales explained that the government felt that the confusion " was harmful to this country , in terms of the notion that perhaps we may be engaging in torture .
That ’s contrary to the values of this President and this administration .
And we felt that was harmful , also . "
Harmful in more ways than one .
It appears that the chickens may now be coming home to roost , as those who are informed by alternative media , including many supporters of President - elect Obama , are demanding accountability for Bush ’s torture policies and are objecting strongly to any appointments tainted by complicity in those policies .
That sentiment led Obama to look for a CIA director outside the usual list of intelligence professionals who had carefully positioned themselves  and their careers  so as not to offend the Bush administration the past eight years .
Placing managerial skills and personal integrity over direct intelligence experience , Obama made the surprise choice of Leon Panetta , who followed up his resignation from the Nixon administration with a varied career as a congressman , federal budget director , White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton , and a member of the Iraq Study Group .
Opposing Panetta
It was no surprise that the current and former intelligence officials on the Washington Post ’s contact list have been upset at the naming of Panetta and the imminent cleaning and disinfecting of the Augean stables in Langley .
A lot of horse___ and bull___ is to be found on the ground there , and Panetta will need heavy equipment  and some time  to clean it up .
As flagship of the FCM , the Post seldom checks with us in Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity , so let me simply state that those in our movement are virtually unanimous in welcoming the naming of Panetta .
The clean - up is likely to begin before the end of the month , and the Post will be losing many of its inside sources , since they will no longer be in the swing of things .
Those tightly tied to torture will be gone .
And good riddance .
Understanding the importance for change , Tyler Drumheller , former chief of the European Division in the operations directorate , has warned that " the problem with the agency is that people will be defending what they ’ve done " in the realm of interrogations and detentions .
Drumheller , who was not directly involved in those activities , said he thinks Panetta will make a fine director .
Still , by force of habit , he used the collective " we " in stating matter - of - factly : " We did what we did because we were told to by the President . "
That is clearly the case .
It is also the case that Nuremberg put the kibosh on the we - were - only - following - orders defense .
People shall have to be reminded of that .
And I mean people on " both sides of the house , " as the CIA saying goes  analysis as well as operations .
To " justify " Bush ’s Iraq War , CIA Director George Tenet  along with his deputy John McLaughlin and the malleable managers in the CIA ’s analysis directorate  supervised the " fixing " of intelligence .
The head of State Department intelligence at the time , Carl Ford , later said , " They should have been shot " for the way they served up " fundamentally dishonest " intelligence to please the White House .
Over at the Washington Post ’s editorial section , however , the big worry is that the CIA ( and , gosh , maybe even the Post ) will be held to account for complicity in , and minimizing the significance of , the many misdeeds .
One of the Post ’s neoconservative columnists , David Ignatius , has pleaded for someone to " protect the agency and help rebuild it after a traumatic eight years under George Bush , when it became a kind of national pincushion . "
Sorry , David .
Under the direction of Cheney and Bush , the CIA became more like a kind of Gestapo than pincushion , doing the White House ’s bidding  while the co-opted leaders of the House and Senate " overlook committees " sat by silently .
It is high time your editorial page commented on that sorry story .
The Take From Torture
One of the high ironies in all this is the fact that , as Lt. Gen .
John Kimmons , head of Army intelligence , put it publicly on Sept. 6 , 2006 :
" No good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices .
I think history tells us that .
I think the empirical evidence of the last five years , hard years , tells us that . "
Now if it ’s inaccurate " intelligence " you ’re after  to " justify " a preordained policy like invading Iraq  well , that ’s another story .
Then , torturing captives on your own or rendering them to countries skilled in torture practices can be quite effective indeed .
Take Ibn al - Shaykh al - Libi , for example , who was captured and rendered to Egyptian intelligence .
And , would n’t you know , he " confessed " to knowing that Iraq was training al - Qaeda members in the use of terror techniques and illicit weapons , just the “ evidence ” the Bush administration was looking for .
Al - Libi became a poster child for the Cheney / Bush propaganda machine  that is , until he publicly recanted and explained that he only told his interrogators what he knew they wanted to hear , in order to stop the torture .
Covert Action
Without proper congressional oversight  or a strong ethos among intelligence professionals  a rogue President and brown - nose director can use the CIA at will  all of this enabled by an ill - starred sentence that was inserted into the National Security Act of 1947 to find a home for " covert action . "
The inserted language charged the CIA director with performing " such other functions and duties related to intelligence " as the President might assign .
Reflecting on this after he left office , President Harry Truman , in a Washington Post op - ed on Dec. 22 , 1963 , publicly bemoaned that the CIA had been " diverted from its original assignment from its intended role . "
Mincing few words , Truman argued that the CIA ’s " operational duties be terminated or properly used elsewhere . "
That was a good idea in 1963 .
And today , 45 years later , it is still a good idea .
Whether or not President - elect Obama decides to curtail or move the covert action functions of the agency , it is a truly encouraging thought that the country will soon have a President well versed in the Constitution and respect for the law , a President whose most recent appointments also spell the end of a corrupted Department of Justice .
Fair warning : Obama can expect little if any help from the co-opted chairpersons of the intelligence overlook committees in the House and Senate  Silvestre Reyes and Dianne Feinstein , respectively .
Obama and Panetta will have to do it themselves .
The incoming President has his work cut out for him , but he has an excellent model in the late Barbara Jordan , an African - American educator and member of Congress from Texas .
Jordan made an extremely valuable contribution on the House Judiciary Committee during the hearings on impeaching President Nixon  at a time when that committee was not the lamentable laughingstock it has now become .
I will not soon forget Jordan ’s words on July 25 , 1974 , two days before articles of impeachment of Nixon were approved and sent to the full House :
" My faith in the Constitution is whole , it is complete , it is total .
I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution , the subversion , the destruction of the Constitution [ As was said at ] the North Carolina ratification convention ,  No one need be afraid that [ government ] officers who commit oppression will pass with immunity . ’ "
Obama and Panetta will have to devote attention to repair work on the CIA at first .
But part of that process , sooner or later , will have to include holding accountable those guilty of war crimes as well as corrupting both the analysis and operations functions of U.S. intelligence .

Imagine a computer that can process text , video and audio in an instant , solve problems on the fly , and do it all while consuming just 10 watts of power .
It would be the ultimate computing machine if it were built with silicon instead of human nerve cells .
Compare that to current computers , which require extensive , custom programming for each application , consume hundreds of watts in power , and are still not fast enough .
So it 's no surprise that some computer scientists want to go back to the drawing board and try building computers that more closely emulate nature .
" The plan is to engineer the mind by reverse - engineering the brain , "
says Dharmendra Modha , manager of the cognitive computing project at
IBM Almaden Research Center .
In what could be one of the most ambitious computing projects ever , neuroscientists , computer engineers and psychologists are coming together in a bid to create an entirely new computing architecture that can simulate the brain 's abilities for perception , interaction and cognition .
All that , while being small enough to fit into a lunch box and consuming extremely small amounts of power .
The 39 - year old Modha , a Mumbai , India - born computer science engineer , has helped assemble a coalition of the country 's best researchers in a collaborative project that includes five universities , including Stanford , Cornell and Columbia , in addition to IBM .
The researchers ' goal is first to simulate a human brain on a supercomputer .
Then they plan to use new nano - materials to create logic gates and transistor - based equivalents of neurons and synapses , in order to build a hardware - based , brain - like system .
It 's the first attempt of its kind .
In October , the group bagged a $ 5 million grant from Darpa – just enough to get the first phase of the project going .
If successful , they say , we could have the basics of a new computing system within the next decade .
" The idea is to do software simulations and build hardware chips that would be based on what we know about how the brain and how neural circuits work , " says Christopher Kello , an associate professor at the University of California - Merced who 's involved in the project .
Computing today is based on the von Neumann architecture , a design whose building blocks – the control unit , the arithmetic logic unit and the memory – is the stuff of Computing 101 .
But that architecture presents two fundamental problems :
The connection between the memory and the processor can get overloaded , limiting the speed of the computer to the pace at which it can transfer data between the two .
And it requires specific programs written to perform specific tasks .
In contrast , the brain distributes memory and processing functions throughout the system , learning through situations and solving problems it has never encountered before , using a complex combination of reasoning , synthesis and creativity .
" The brain works in a massively multi- threaded way , " says Charles King , an analyst with Pund - IT , a research and consulting firm .
" Information is coming through all the five senses in a very nonlinear fashion and it creates logical sense out of it . "
The brain is composed of billions of interlinked neurons , or nerve cells that transmit signals .
Each neuron receives input from 8,000 other neurons and sends an output to another 8,000 .
If the input is enough to agitate the neuron , it fires , transmitting a signal through its axon in the direction of another neuron .
The junction between two neurons is called a synapse , and that 's where signals move from one neuron to another .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y0NOa-yjr8 "
The brain is the hardware , " says Modha , " and from it arises processes such as sensation , perception , action , cognition , emotion and interaction . "
Of this , the most important is cognition , the seat of which is believed to reside in the cerebral cortex .
The structure of the cerebral cortex is the same in all mammals .
So researchers started with a real - time simulation of a small brain , about the size of a rat's , in which they put together simulated neurons connected through a digital network .
It took 8 terabytes of memory on a 32,768 - processor BlueGene / L supercomputer to make it happen .
The simulation does n't replicate the rat brain itself , but rather imitates just the cortex .
Despite being incomplete , the simulation is enough to offer insights into the brain 's high - level computational principles , says Modha .
The human cortex has about 22 billion neurons and 220 trillion synapses , making it roughly 400 times larger than the rat scale model .
A supercomputer capable of running a software simulation of the human brain does n't exist yet .
Researchers would require at least a machine with a computational capacity of 36.8 petaflops and a memory capacity of 3.2 petabytes – a scale that supercomputer technology is n't expected to hit for at least three years .
While waiting for the hardware to catch up , Modha is hoping some of the coalition 's partners inch forward towards their targets .
Software simulation of the human brain is just one half the solution .
The other is to create a new chip design that will mimic the neuron and synaptic structure of the brain .
That 's where Kwabena Boahen , associate professor of bioengineering at Stanford University , hopes to help .
Boahen , along with other Stanford professors , has been working on implementing neural architectures in silicon .
One of the main challenges to building this system in hardware , explains Boahen , is that each neuron connects to others through 8,000 synapses .
It takes about 20 transistors to implement a synapse , so building the silicon equivalent of 220 trillion synapses is a tall order , indeed .
" You end up with a technology where the cost is very unfavorable , " says Boahen .
" That 's why we have to use nanotech to implement synapses in a way that will make them much smaller and more cost - effective . "
Boahen and his team are trying to create a device smaller than a single transistor that can do the job of 20 transistors .
" We are essentially inventing a new device , " he says .
Meanwhile , at the University of California - Merced , Kello and his team are creating a virtual environment that could train the simulated brain to experience and learn .
They are using the Unreal Tournament videogame engine to help train the system .
When it 's ready , it will be used to teach the neural networks how to make decisions and learn along the way .
Modha and his team say they want to create a fundamentally different approach .
" What we have today is a way where you start with the objective and then figure out an algorithm to achieve it , " says Modha .
Cognitive computing is hoping to change that perspective .
The researchers say they want to an algorithm that will be capable of handling most problems thrown at it .
The virtual environment should help the system learn .
" Here there are no instructions , " says Kello .
" What we have are basic learning principles so we need to give neural circuits a world where they can have experiences and learn from them . "
Getting there will be a long , tough road .
" The materials are a big challenge , " says Kello .
" The nanoscale engineering of a circuit that is programmable , extremely small and that requires extremely low power requires an enormous engineering feat . "
There are also concerns that the $ 5 million Darpa grant and IBM 's largess – researchers and resources –while enough to get the project started may not be sufficient to see it till end .
Then there 's the difficulty of explaining that mimicking the cerebral cortex is n't exactly the same as recreating the brain .
The cerebral cortex is associated with functions such as thought , computation and action , while other parts of the brain handle emotions , co-ordination and vital functions .
These researchers have n't even begun to address simulating those parts yet .

They are dismissed as primitive savages who charged into battle screaming and waving their claymores , only to be cut down by musket fire from well - drilled British army redcoats .
The defeat of Bonnie Prince Charlie 's forces at Culloden , near Inverness , in 1746 is widely considered a triumph of modernity over the romance of a bygone age .
But new research has established this is yet another of the many myths about the rebellion based largely on government propaganda of the day .
Gaelic poets also share some blame for the misconception because of their obsession with the sword as a heroic weapon .
In reality , the battles between the Jacobites and Hanoverian forces were more contests between equals with the rebels using up - to - date military tactics and relying on the musket and bayonet – not the claymore .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Professor Murray Pittock , who carried out new research for the forthcoming edition of his book The Myth of the Jacobite Clans , said : " It helps to create a story that they were primitive and barbaric to present them as very badly armed .
Highland self - representation played along with propaganda and interpretations by later historians which presented this caricature of the so - called ' Highland charge ' .
It is associated with a simple forward charge using swords , but it was part of a wide range of tactics which are being used by the Jacobites .
" There are far , far more guns than there are swords and the Jacobites thought ' real soldiers used muskets ' .
There was also a very large number of cannon – about 70 - plus cannon were in Jacobite hands in 1745 . "
A British army suffered a shock defeat at Prestonpans , near Edinburgh , in 1745 , partly because its commanders believed their own propaganda that " controlled fire - power " by a modern army would see off what they regarded as a bunch of irregulars .
Then at Falkirk , the redcoats received a taste of their own medicine .
" General [ Henry ]
Hawley orders his dragoons to ride at the Jacobites and break the frontline .
But he ends up facing not a bedraggled charge , but the McDonalds holding rank and opening fire – this was controlled Jacobite fire bringing down a cavalry charge , " said Professor Pittock of Glasgow University .
The defeat at Culloden , he says , happened because the Jacobites were outnumbered , did not have their heavy cannons and tried to cross boggy ground .
The redcoats ' use of cannons firing grapeshot also had a major effect .
Even the National Trust for Scotland 's visitor centre at Culloden is not immune from the false depiction of the Jacobites .
Professor Pittock said while it had " a lot of good information " , the dramatic recreation in its " immersion theatre " film played to public expectations .
" Everybody is hairy and screaming and they do n't have a gun .
Basically , it shows a lot of Highlanders , many in kilts , charging and waving swords against a lot of redcoats with muskets , " he said .
" It does n't represent the fact that from Culloden alone 2,320 muskets and 190 swords were picked up from the battlefield ; that 's more than 10 to one . "
The National Trust for Scotland said visitors were told that the Jacobites were not the " unruly rabble described in Whig propaganda " , but were " organised under full military discipline " .
A spokeswoman said the film was not meant to be realistic .
" The aim is to give visitors some insight into the sights , sounds and confusion of the battle for soldiers on both sides , " she said , " rather than to provide a factual representation of the battle . "

Irish gangsters have staged the biggest cash robbery in the history of the Republic , stealing up to € 7 million from the Bank of Ireland in Dublin 's College Green early today .
The Garda Siochana said an armed gang took the family of a Bank of Ireland worker hostage at their County Kildare home on Thursday night .
The gang forced their way into the home at Kilteel and seized the worker 's partner , her mother and a seven - year - old child .
The man 's partner was beaten before the family were taken away in their car .
The worker , who is in his 20s , was forced to drive his car to the Bank of Ireland in College Green , across from Trinity College , and get the cash .
He handed it over to the gang at the Clontarf Dart suburban rail station in north Dublin .
His family was then released in the Ashbourne area north of Dublin city .
No shots were fired but the family is said to be extremely traumatised .
Security sources in the Republic today told the Guardian that the chief suspect in the robbery was a career criminal in his early 60s based in north County Dublin .
He is out on bail on other charges .
The last major cash robbery on a similar scale took place at a security firm depot near Dublin airport more than a decade ago .
An organised Irish crime gang stole € 4 m in cash .
The largest cash robbery on the entire island remains the Northern Bank raid when the IRA stole up to £ 26 m after holding the families of two bank officials hostage .
The officials were forced to hand over sacks filled with millions in cash .
Today 's raid is a carbon copy of it , although there is nothing to suggest any paramilitary involvement in the Bank of Ireland robbery .
Ireland 's minister for justice , Dermot Ahern , is to meet with the state 's top police officer , the garda commissioner , over the robbery .
Ahern says he wants to know if security procedures at banks need to be changed or improved .
The Bank of Ireland building was the first Irish parliament in the 18th century .
How bad is the crisis going to get ?
By Tim Weber
Business editor , BBC News website , in Davos
Lehman 's collapse roiled financial markets .
36 hours in September changed the world .
When investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed , the credit crunch became a global financial crisis .
But how bad is that crisis ?
Was it wrong to let Lehman fail ?
Or was Lehman just a symptom not the cause of the chaos in the global economy ?
Tough questions , and the World Economic Forum had lined up five top experts ( including two Nobel prize winners ) to find answers .
The economists among them were Crunch Cassandras ; two or three years ago they had predicted that our financial system was headed for a huge liquidity crisis - Nouriel Roubini , Nassim Taleb and economic historian Niall Ferguson .
A pity then , a participant said , that two years ago nobody had thought of inviting them to speak at the forum .
Little wonder that this session was hugely oversubscribed , with 150 people on the waiting list and probably more than that crowding into one of the cavernous dining rooms that are the hallmark of Davos hotels .
Under Davos rules this was a closed session , to encourage frank debate .
So with a few exceptions I am not allowed to attribute quotes to individual speakers .
But I can report what was said , and this session was an intellectually stimulating eye opener - and utterly depressing ( at least economically ) .
Depression 2.0 ?
The biggest question , of course , is how bad is it going to get , and nobody - neither on the panel nor in the audience - dared to provide any cheer .
Derivatives trading is all about how to make a bonus and how to screw your client
Nassim Taleb , author and former derivatives trader
There was talk of " Depression Lite " and " Depression 2.0 " , although the experts also pointed out that it was unlikely to get as bad as the 1930s .
Back then , the US economy shrank on average 14 % a year , prices fell at 8 % a year and unemployment peaked at 25 % .
The sharp rate cuts and fiscal stimulus packages around the world would prevent a repeat , everybody agreed .
Still , warned one of the experts , the world would have to brace itself for " a best case scenario " of at least a year of recession and a " lost decade " of low growth - and most people were still in denial about this prospect .
Root causes
But what caused the crisis ?
A popular theory is that Washington is to blame for the " global cardiac arrest " , because it allowed Lehman to fail .
The panellists rejected this suggestion as " tosh " and " a myth " .
Nouriel Roubini warned of a credit crunch two years ago .
This crisis , several economists said , started two years earlier and was " bound " to lead to a financial meltdown - whether it was a bank like Washington Mutual or the likes of Lehman and other parts of the lightly regulated shadow banking system of investment banks , hedge funds and broker dealers .
" How could banks be so stupid ? , " several panellists asked , and allow things go so wrong so quickly ?
The root causes for the economic crisis were too much debt , a culture of short - term rewards for long - term risk - taking and fatally flawed mathematical risk models .
And plain old greed .
" Derivatives trading is all about how to make a bonus and how to screw your client , " said Nassim Taleb , a former derivatives trader and author of " The Black Swan , " a book about expecting the unexpected .
The result was a mountain range of " troubled assets " ( one of the great euphemisms of the crisis , one expert said ) that resulted in billion dollar losses and the need to bail out financial institutions like Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and AIG even before Lehman collapsed .
Into the hurricane Morgan Stanley , one expert ventured , was saved only because its share price bounced back when rumours emerged of Washington 's $ 700 bn bail - out package .
Two thirds of the world 's hedge funds would collapse , suggested another .
Financial institutions took on debt worth 40 times their assets - and failed to understand how risky this was .
Bank 's risk models , a prominent participant revealed , were based on one year 's worth of data .
It was , another expert said , as if a pilot was assuming that he would never fly into a hurricane , because he had n't come across one during the past year .
Bankers had no memory , another panellist said , they had forgotten about the Asian crisis in the late 1990s , the collapse of the LTCM hedge fund , and much more .
But it is too easy to single out the bankers - a banker said .
Where were the regulators , rating agencies , corporate boards and central bankers ?
What about the borrowers , who did not read contracts and had to know they could not afford these mortgages ?
And what about the shareholders and investors , who did not question the business models of the companies they owned ?

Buying a house for the first time can be an exciting , yet overwhelming time for any individual .
Aside from having its own unique set of challenges – more than ever , you want to make sure you keep enough money around in the event of emergencies .
Here are 11 money saving hacks you need to know if you are a first time home buyer .
1 . Just because you are approved for a certain amount of money does not mean you have to spend it all .
Opting for a house below your optimal approval amount is wise and practical .
It is vital you have funds left after the purchase for other bills .
2 . Look into opportunities that fit your financial situation .
For example , if you have low credit scores , research options for people in your situation to save money .
3 . Do n’t discredit a house that is older or needs some work .

LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) - A British bishop was arrested on suspicion of child cruelty after he helped his two young sons to perch on top of the chimney of their house to read a book as part of a school project .
Bishop Jonathan Blake , of the Open Episcopal Church , took pictures of his sons Nathan , eight , and Dominic , seven , while they sat on top of their two - storey home .
The children were calmly holding a book called “ The Killer Underpants ” for a school competition to find the most unusual place where a pupil had read a book .
After a neighbor alerted the police , the clergyman said he was arrested , driven away in a cage in the back of a van and kept overnight in a cell .
“ I was taken out in handcuffs in front of the whole neighborhood while my children were in tears , ” the 52 - year - old told Reuters on Thursday .
“ I was kept in the cells without any information about what was taking place from 7 p.m. until 10 a.m. the following morning .
“ I am appalled and incredulous .
I would never have imagined in a thousand years that this could have happened . ”
The children were wearing safety harnesses and got on to the chimney via a flat roof at the back of the house in Welling , southeast London , he added .
Blake said he would make an official complaint and has already contacted London police chief Paul Stephenson and Mayor of London Boris Johnson .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said : “ A member of the public reported that two small children had been left unattended on the roof of a house .
A 52 - year - old man was arrested in connection with the allegation and has since been released without charge . ”
Along with missiles and bombs , Palestinians in Gaza are being bombarded with flyers , asking them to rat out Hamas militants and flee their homes .
Palestinian Jordanian Ali Dahmash wonders where can Gazans flee to .
He writes :
On Saturday Israel threw flyers over civilians in Rafah in the south of the Gaza strip .
The flyers warned Palestinians to flee their homes .
I was wondering where those civilians can flee to .
They have no shelters , their only shelters are UN schools , Hospitals , Mosques & Churches that already have been bombed .
Israel also bombed the airport more than 6 years ago which is not accessible , the sea is blocked by Israeli battleships and the land borders have been blocked for 2 years now both by Israel and Egypt.
Simply Israel message was “ We are coming to kill you ! ! ”
Writing at American - Palestinian group blog KABOBfest , Will notes :
I have not made up mind as to whether the fliers and automated phone calls Israel 's military uses to communicate with Gazans are for PR or Psychological Operations purposes .
One thing is for sure , they are not to help any Palestinians .
He further adds :
Such communications feed the myth that the Israeli army is humane .
The internet stinks from all the forums and discussion boards where pro-Israeli drones claim the flyers and calls are actually helpful , or that they show how far the IDF would go to prevent civilian casualties .
If anything , they only remind Gazans of the callous and ruthless nature of the Israeli regime and the utter and complete disregard it has had for the fate of the Palestinians .
One of the flyers , pictured above and obtained from Electronic Intifada , addresses the inhabitants of Gaza as follows :
“ Assume responsibility for your fate !
The throwers of rockets and the terrorist are a danger to you and your family .
If you wish to provide assistance and help to your families and brothers in Gaza , all you need to do is call the number below to inform is about the location of rocket launchers and the terrorist gangs who have made of you hostages to their operations .
The prevention of disaster is now in your hands . ”
Upon learning of the flyer , Palestinian Haitham Sabbah also takes action into his own hands and initiates a campaign urging his readers to blitz the emails and phone numbers in the flyers asking Gazans to become informants with messages :
So , what can be done ?
Simply , I encourage everyone to call above mentioned number ( from your land line , mobile phone , Skype , etc. ) and say in Hebrew “ Atem Poshim , tafsiku laharog palestinayim , Palestien Meshuchreret , Aza meshuchreret . ”
The above is an oral Hebrew translation of : “ You are Criminals .
Stop Killing Palestinians .
Free Palestine . Free Gaza . ”
Alternatively , use the above mentioned email and attach one of the following photos or album link to show them the result of their war crimes in Gaza .
Meanwhile , an editor at the Palestinian Electronic Intifada took the challenge literally and actually called the number on the flyer – speaking in Arabic to an operative who identified himself as Abu Ibrahim .
Here 's a transcript of part of the conversation from Electronic Intifada :
EI : Ok , let 's talk … let me give you some of the information and then we 'll talk some more .
Do you have a pen ?
Israeli officer : Yes .
I have a pen and I 'm writing .
EI I want to give you names of the biggest terrorist organizations , not just in Gaza , but in all Palestine .
Israeli officer :
Ok , let 's see EI : Ok , the first one … Israeli officer :
You mean to tell me they 're all from Hamas ?
EI : All of them are people … you 'll see .
The first one , his name is Ehud Barak [ Israeli minister of defense ] .
Israeli officer : Ehud Barak ?
By God there 's no one like you … EI : Second , Gabi Ashkenazi [ Israeli army chief of staff ]
Israeli officer :
Do you know him ?

Graphic : Diego Aguirre IT managers should start familiarizing themselves with a new security tool -- the paint brush -- as Japanese researchers have come up with a paint that they say will block high - speed wireless signals , giving businesses a cheap option to protect their wireless networks .
The problem of securing wireless networks has been an issue for a while now .
Wi -Fi LANs with no encryption or running the obsolete WEP system , run the risk of having hackers outside the building eavesdrop on wireless LAN traffic , or simply stealing bandwidth .
However , there are a number of solutions , besides encryption , for companies wishing to secure their networks .
For example , Meru Networks said last year that it was using Wi -Fi signals to " cloak " wireless LANs and make it impossible for hackers to decipher them outside the office building .
Other methods include putting energy - efficient windows in buildings , physically blocking radio signals or even turning a building or office into a ' Faraday Cage ' using mesh metal .
However these options tend to be expensive .
But now , according to a report in the New Scientist , paint can be used to secure high - speed wireless networks .
This is nothing new though , as RF - blocking paints have been available for a number of years now .
Indeed , EM - SEC
Technologies successfully tested its own RF - blocking paint back in March 2007 to shield wireless devices and other electronic equipment within a building .
But what the New Scientist is reporting is that existing technologies are becoming increasingly obsolete as companies are now using new , higher frequencies to send data .
For example , the best wave absorbers commercially available today are only effective up to around 50GHz , whereas the latest wireless communications tend to use electromagnetic waves with a frequency of over 100GHz plus .
The Japanese researchers say they now have a paint that can block the higher frequencies .
So how does this new blocking paint actually work ?
Well , electromagnetic ( EM ) waves can only be blocked when a material 's magnetic field resonates at the same frequency as the wave .
The New Scientist says that wave absorbers are usually made from iron - rich oxides , but higher - frequency transmissions outstrip the power of iron to absorb electromagnetic waves .
This is because the standard oxide coating has a maximum resonance frequency that is outstripped at 48GHz .
But Shin-ichi
Ohkoshi's team at the University of Tokyo in Japan has now identified a new aluminium - iron oxide able to block waves with a frequency almost four times higher .
They used a sensitive magnetometer ( a scientific instrument used to measure the strength and / or direction of a magnetic field ) to confirm that a powder of the new oxide can absorb EM waves of up to 182GHz at room temperature .
According to the researchers , the composition of the new material somehow distorts the bonds between iron and oxygen from their usual shape , which they believe explains the material 's magnetic properties .
They feel that further study , would lead to identifying new metal oxides that can absorb EM waves at even higher frequencies .
And it seems that the cost of this paint will not stretch IT budgets , as aluminium and iron are abundant materials and therefore the paint will be cheap to make .
" We collaborated with DOWA Electronics , a Japanese industrial company [ to make a 100 - kilogram sample order ] , " Ohkoshi is reported as saying .
" The manufacturing cost is very cheap , around £ 10 ( $ 14 ) per kg . "
This story , " Block Wi-Fi Intruders with a Secure Paint Job " was originally published by Techworld.com .
Overall a great game !
I hope so see more updates to this , and maybe even a multiplayer ?
Someone plays as the head of a global health group , and you play as the virus .
I think it'd be a great game idea .
Dear Science
Why are we tired after a plane flight ?
Why are we tired after a plane flight ?
We have n't really done any physical activity , so why are we exhausted ?
Zonked at 30,000 Feet
Science is sitting on an airplane bound for his family in Detroit while writing this .
The air is dry and thin , as it always is on a plane .
Let 's start our speculation here .
Nearly every cell in our body requires oxygen — whether we 're on the ground or flying in a plane .
Our lungs allow our blood to grab the oxygen out of the air , by making the air we breathe in as close as possible to the blood it meets through a thin membrane .
That means warming and wetting the air until it is saturated with water .
The dry air in a plane means our lungs have to work overtime to moisten each breath .
That 's a start in answering your question .
Let 's think about air — on the ground in Seattle and on a plane .
Whether we 're on the ground or in a plane , air is made of water vapor , nitrogen , and oxygen .
Dry out the air until there is no water vapor in it , and the remainder roughly consists of about 80 percent nitrogen and 20 percent oxygen molecules .
The number of molecules per volume of air determines how thick the air is , its pressure .
Pressure is a force caused by gas molecules bashing into things — the more molecules , the more bashing and the higher the pressure , measured with a unit like torr .
Each gas in the air has its own partial pressure , the contribution to the total pressure made by its molecules ; our lungs only care about the partial pressure of oxygen .
As we go up in altitude , the air becomes thinner — with fewer molecules per volume .
At sea level , the air pressure measures at about 760 torr — 570 of which is nitrogen , 150 is oxygen .
Most airplanes are pressurized to the equivalent of about 8,000 feet , a total pressure of 560 torr and an oxygen pressure of only 100 torr — only two - thirds of the oxygen pressure we 're used to in Seattle .
In other words , the number of oxygen molecules available per breath decreases when we 're flying .
If we need the same amount of oxygen to keep our cells running , and we get less oxygen per breath , we have to take more breaths to keep everything functioning .
Test it out the next time you travel .
Count how many breaths per minute your companion makes while sitting quietly on the ground .
Later , in flight , compare how many she takes .
All that extra breathing wears us out .
The drop in air pressure on a plane is also probably why we fart so damn much when flying .
The pressurized gas in our intestines has even more reason to escape .
Wanderingly Yours ,
Science

Performance Testing SQL Server 2008 's Change Data Capture functionality
By Rob Garrison
If you have n’t read the first CDC article , consider reading that now before reading this one .
It will help lay the groundwork for what is covered here .
Introduction : CDC Performance Tests
The purpose here is to test the performance of SQL Server 2008 ’s Change Data Capture functionality .
How does it perform compared to a system with no change - tracking functionality ?
If you have read some of my recent performance test articles , much of the details below will be familiar .
This test used a different system and SQL Server 2008 only , so read the “ Test System Details ” section , and then skip down to the results .
The test framework also is updated to use a “ Common ” database that stores the run parameters and test results .
It is important to note here that the tests are performing no SELECTs .
This is because what we care about here is tracking the cost of change data capture .
Test System Details
For this test , I used this setup :
4 64 - bit Dual - Core AMD Processors
64 GB RAM
Direct - attached SCSI drives
Windows Server 2003 R2 Enterprise x64 Edition
SQL Server 2008 ( RTM )
Test Schema
Each table has a clustered primary key on the ID column .
Non-Clustered Indexes :
Vendor : non-unique index on BusinessName
Card : unique index on CardNumber , SecurityCode
Card : non-unique index on SecurityCode , CardNumber
Card : non-unique index on SecureString
Purchase : non-unique index on CardID
Purchase : non-unique index on VendorID
Test Details
The test scripts are built to mimic an OLTP workload .
There are three tables involved : Vendor , Card , and Purchase .
The “ Executive Summary ”
The tests use multiple simultaneous calls to a SQL script that calls stored procedures in a loop to first load and then insert and / or update data .
The Gory Details
The “ driver ” for this test is a simple framework I built years ago called Hummer .
It uses a . bat file to run some initial setup scripts then starts n simultaneous processes , each running the same script .
The idea is to simulate multiple clients fighting for database resources .
Each script includes an occasional call to DELAY .
This helps to allow the multiple processes to share the database resources .
It also better simulates a real OLTP workload .
There were multiple tests with different parameters .
You can see all the details in the chart below .
Let ’s look at Test Run 2 as an example .
The .bat script performs these steps :
Drop and recreate the database .
Create the tables and indexes .
Create the stored procedures .
Start 5 processes , each running the main test script .
The CREATE DATABASE script creates the Data file with an initial size of 400 MB and the Log with an initial size of 20 MB , each set to grow 10 % .
After Test Run 2 , here are the Data and Log sizes :
Basic Data : 400
Basic Log : 20
CDC Data : 400
CDC Log : 624
The main test script performs these steps :
Execute DBCC FREESYSTEMCACHE
( ' ALL ' ) .
Execute DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS .
Delay 5 seconds on start - up ( to allow all processes to start ) .
Loop 100,000 times
Read control parameters ( SP call ) .
If finished with test , stop .
( This also allows you to change the parameters or stop the test while it ’s running . )
Every 1000 loops , delay 1 second .
For the first 10,000 loops , create a Vendor record ( SP call ) .
For the first 10,000 loops , create a Card record ( SP call ) .
For the first 20,000 loops , create a Purchase record ( SP call ) .
Of every 10 loops :
0 of 10 times : read a Card record .
2 of 10 times : update a Vendor record ( see the “ UPD / 10 ” column ) .
8 of 10 times : insert a Purchase record ( see the “ INS / 10 ” column ) .
( After the first 20,000 loops , all insert or update activity is on some random record in the set . )
End loop
It is important to understand that we ’re inserting 10,000 Vendor records , 10,000 Card records , and 20,000 Purchase records per process .
So , the total number of records inserted ( in the initial set ) is 50,000 , 50,000 , and 100,000 .
The elapsed time is for the looping work only , not the database creation or any of the other setup work .
Test Parameters
Results
The attached results files include sample output files .
Remember that this is running the exact same workload on the exact same hardware .
Conclusion
The expected pattern is that using CDC is costly .
That is not surprising at all when you understand that it is recording the CDC changes in the same database as the base changes .
The average penalty for CDC with full recovery is 10.51 % .
The average penalty for CDC with simple recovery is 11.10 % .
I expected to see a pattern showing that UPDATEs were more expensive .
This did not turn out to be true in these tests .
As a side note , it is very interesting to see the performance results comparing full recovery to simple recovery .
I expected to see a fairly significant difference in elapsed times when the databases were switched to simple recovery , but that did not turn out to be true .
The average time actually went up for the simple mode tests ( by 0.69 to 1.27 % ) .
It is clear from the results that there is some variability in the numbers .
It would be nice to see a perfect increase or decrease , but there are just too many variables involved regardless of how strictly you control the test environment .
What you have to look at is patterns , and it ’s clear here that adding CDC to this workload caused an increase of roughly 10 % .
All of the code is included , so feel free to modify it and rerun the tests to suit your specific needs .

College Student Invents Affordable Solar - Powered Fridge
January 8th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
A British college student has invented a new type of solar - powered fridge that can be built entirely from household materials .
According to 21 year old Emily Cummins , the fridge works with the help of evaporation .
The fridge stays at a comfortable 6° C without using any power , and can keep perishables cool for days .
Cummins ’ fridge is made up of two cylinders , with one inside the other .
The inner cylinder is made of metal , and the water - soaked outer cylinder can be made from wood or plastic .
When placed in the sun , the sun heats the outer cylinder and water evaporates off .
Heat is removed from the inner cylinder during the evaporation process , keeping the interior of the fridge cool .
Emily Cummins is n’t the first person to design a solar fridge , but the cheapness of her design makes it ideal for poor locales .

In a move which has surprised analysts and environmentalists , the European Union will leave plans for strong takeup of biofuels sourced from food crops unchanged .
A plan has been agreed in Brussels which will see biofuels dominating Europe 's " renewable " transport quotas in coming years .
EU Observer reports that the member states , the European parliament and the European Commission reached agreement on the plan last week , and biofuel - heavy plans will move ahead largely unchanged .
It had been thought that the use of increasingly controversial food - crop biofuels would be strongly de-emphasised , and other measures such as non-food fuels and electric transport would gain prominence .
Food biofuels , most typically ethanol , are made from crops such as corn , sugar cane and sugar beet .
The growing plants absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere , reducing the overall emissions associated with such fuel .
However , the process of turning crops into useful ethanol involves significant energy use , as does the manufacture and use of fertilisers and other parts of the process .
Biofuels only reduce the amount of carbon emitted compared to fossil fuels - they can't eliminate it .
Quite apart from that , more and more concern has arisen in recent years that crop biofuels drive up the price of food and lead to starvation for poor people around the world .
Worse still , the need for more farmland to produce more crops may drive the process of deforestation .
Perhaps most damning of all , most experts agree that there just is n't enough land for developed nations to power any significant proportion of their transport using biofuels , made from food crops or not .
All the UK 's farmland would n't suffice even for the needs of the British aviation sector , and similarly the US can't fuel itself from its own farms .
But one of the primary driving factors behind the political popularity of food ethanol biofuel has been the Western farm lobby , which believes that ethanol is probably the only way for American and European farmers to stay in business in the long term .
On both sides of the Atlantic , amid the heavy farm subsidies of the EU and the US , ethanol has enjoyed strong political backing .
It seems that this backing has been strong enough to preserve the Brussels biofuel plans largely unchanged - and indeed , according to EU Observer , some new rules on carbon reductions compared to fossil fuel have been relaxed so as to permit European sugarbeet to qualify as suitably sustainable .
( Sugar beet 's status as a low - carbon fuel is questionable compared to non-EU crops like sugar cane . )
Meanwhile , the EU has corporately decide to ignore the issue of deforestation , or " indirect land - use change " , and encouragement of electric transport has been left as a choice for member states .
However , the new rules will allow " second generation " biofuels , not requiring farmland for production - for instance fuels derived from water algae or desert jatropha nuts - to count twice .
The full EU Observer report is here . ®
The World Gold Council released their quarterly Gold Investment Digest yesterday and it contained a number of very good charts including the one below that recounts the many financial market crises that drove investors away from other financial assets and into gold .
They noted that the rising price of gold was quite impressive given all the carnage that occurred elsewhere , most equity markets and many other commodities tumbling 40 - 50 percent or more for the year as the price of gold posted its eigth annual gain , up four percent .
Holdings by the ten gold ETFs around the world climbed to new record highs with another 96 tonnes purchased during the fourth quarter following a whopping 145 tonne addition in the third quarter .
As shown below , the total amount of gold in the ETFs rose to 1190 tonnes by year - end , worth more than $ 33 billion .
Note that the SPDR Gold Shares ETF ( NYSEArca : GLD ) just added another 13 tonnes yesterday after a three tonne increase on Monday bringing its holdings to 819 tonnes , by far the largest of the bunch .
Elsewhere in the report , mine production was said to be stable , up just two percent overall from a year ago with a number of countries , notably South Africa , experiencing sharp declines .
China passed South Africa last year as the world 's biggest gold producer .
De-hedging continued but will have a much smaller impact in the future as the total outstanding hedge book now stands at just 526 tonnes .
As shown to the right , during the four quarters ending in Q3-2008 , miners de-hedged a total of 368 tonnes .
Note that official central bank gold sales dropped sharply , ending up considerably below the 500 tonnes allowed during the fourth year of the Washington Agreement on Gold .
Jewellery demand rose during the third quarter ( the most recent quarter for which data is available ) and was up modestly on a year - over - year basis , however , the fourth quarter will likely show a big decline due to the worsening worsening economic conditions around the world .
As should be clear in the table , it is the increase in investment demand , not jewellery demand or industrial uses , that supported the gold price in 2008 and this is likely to continue this year .
Newswise — Teenagers who smoke could be setting themselves up for depression later in life , according to a groundbreaking new Florida State University study .
Psychology Professor Carlos Bolanos and a team of researchers found that nicotine given to adolescent rats induced a depression - like state characterized by a lack of pleasure and heightened sensitivity to stress in their adult lives .
The findings , published online in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology , suggest that the same may be true for humans .
" This study is unique because it is the first one to show that nicotine exposure early in life can have long - term neurobiological consequences evidenced in mood disorders , " Bolanos said .
" In addition , the study indicates that even brief exposure to nicotine increases risk for mood disorders later in life . "
The Florida State researchers injected adolescent rats twice daily with either nicotine or saline for 15 days .
After the treatment period ended , they subjected the rats to several experiments designed to find out how they would react to stressful situations as well as how they would respond to the offering of rewards .
They found that behavioral changes symptomatic of depression can emerge after one week of nicotine cessation and -- most surprising -- that even a single day of nicotine exposure during adolescence can have long - lasting effects .
" Some of the animals in our study were exposed to nicotine once and never saw the drug again , " Bolanos said .
" It was surprising to us to discover that a single day of nicotine exposure could potentially have such long - term negative consequences . "
The rats that were exposed to nicotine engaged in behaviors symptomatic of depression and anxiety , including repetitive grooming , decreased consumption of rewards offered in the form of sugary drinks and becoming immobile in stressful situations instead of engaging in typical escape - like behaviors .
The researchers were able to alleviate the rats ' symptoms with antidepressant drugs or , ironically , more nicotine .
Interestingly , adult rodents that were exposed to the same nicotine regimen as the adolescents did not display depression - like traits .
It is not known exactly how nicotine works on the brain and nervous system to induce these effects , but exposure has toxic effects in several brain regions and neurotransmitter systems at distinct periods of development , Bolanos said .
Because various neurotransmitter systems in the brain continue to develop throughout adolescence , the researchers theorize that nicotine may negatively influence these systems resulting in altered functionality later in life .
The study 's findings underscore the need for further research into how this process occurs .
Scientists have long known there is a connection between smoking and mood disorders , but they have not been able to say for sure that one causes the other because there are so many factors influencing human behavior .
This study provides support for the idea that smoking can induce symptoms of depression , and paradoxically , can also be a way of managing those same symptoms and enhancing the risk for addiction .
" The message to young people of course is do n't smoke and do n't even try it , " Bolanos said .
" If they do smoke , they need to be aware of the potentially long - term effects that recreational or even occasional cigarette smoking can have on their systems . "
Bolanos ' doctoral students Sergio Iniguez and Brandon Warren are the study 's lead authors .
Undergraduate and graduate research assistants Eric Parise , Lyonna Alcantara , Brittney Schuh , Melissa Maffeo and Zarko Manojlovic are co-authors in addition to Bolanos .

Warren also is supported by a Neuroscience Fellowship .

Our chief weapon is polymorphism … polymorphism and objects … objects and polymorphism .

Our three weapons are objects , and polymorphism and inheritance … and an almost fanatical devotion to contexts …
Our four…no …
Amongst our weapons …
Amongst our weaponry … are such elements as objects , po …
I ’ll come in again .
Contexts are Smalltalk ’s first - class activation records .
thisContext is the “ reserved word ” ( technically , pseudo - variable ) for the current activation record .
Try “ thisContext inspect ” and see what you get .
Then try “ thisContext inspect .
self halt ” and see what you get .
Contexts are fabulous weapons , even better programming building blocks , and horribly expensive .
How do I love contexts ?
Let me count the ways …
Contexts mean Smalltalk has had edit - and - continue debugging since the 1970’s .
Contexts allow the implemention of an exception system with no additional support from the virtual machine .
Contexts allow the implemention of dynamic binding , co-routines , tail - recursion - elimination and backtracking with no additional support from the virtual machine .
Contexts enable process persistence and migration .
Contexts allow implementation of continuations ( full , delimited / partial or otherwise ) without additional VM support ( and hence the Seaside web framework ) .
Contexts are consistent ( consistent ) with the rest of the “ objects all the way down ” system , providing activations as first - class objects .
Because they ’re there .
What does a context look like ?
The method is the code to execute .
The stack is of finite size , guaranteed by the bytecode compiler .
The sender is the caller context , providing a simple and flexible “ spaghetti stack ” scheme .
But a naive implementation has to allocate a context on each send , move the receiver and arguments from the stack of the caller context to that of the callee , and assign the callee ’s sender with the caller .
For essentially every return the garbage collector eventually has to reclaim , and every return has to nil the sender and instruction pointer fields of , the context being returned from .
Here ’s the blue book code for method activation :
activateNewMethod
| contextSize newContext newReceiver |
( self largeContextFlagOf : newMethod ) = 1
ifTrue : [ contextSize := 32 + TempFrameStart ]
ifFalse : [ contextSize := 12 + TempFrameStart ] .
newContext := memory
instantiateClass : ClassMethodContextPointer
withPointers : contextSize .
memory storePointer : SenderIndex
ofObject : newContext
withValue : activeContext .
self storeInstructionPointerValue : ( self initialInstructionPointerOfMethod : newMethod )
inContext : newContext .
self storeStackPointerValue : ( self temporaryCountof : newMethod )
inContext : newContext .
memory storePointer : MethodIndex
ofObject : newContext
withValue : newMethod .
self transfer : argumentCount + 1
fromIndex : stackPointer – argumentCount
ofObject : activeContext
toIndex : ReceiverIndex
of Object : newContext .
self pop : argumentCount +
1 .
self newActiveContext : newContext
If you want to stay with this scheme but make it faster then you could do worse than the current Squeak implementation :
activateNewMethod
| newContext methodHeader initialIP tempCount nilOop where |
methodHeader := self headerOf : newMethod .
newContext := self allocateOrRecycleContext : ( methodHeader bitAnd : LargeContextBit ) .
initialIP := (( LiteralStart + ( self literalCountOfHeader : methodHeader ) ) * BytesPerWord ) + 1 .
tempCount := self temporaryCountOfMethodHeader : methodHeader .
“ Assume : newContext will be recorded as a root if necessary by the
call to newActiveContext : below , so we can use unchecked stores . ”
where := newContext + BaseHeaderSize .
self longAt : where + ( SenderIndex << ShiftForWord ) put : activeContext .
self longAt : where +
( InstructionPointerIndex << ShiftForWord ) put : ( self integerObjectOf : initialIP ) .
self longAt : where +
( StackPointerIndex << ShiftForWord ) put : ( self integerObjectOf : tempCount ) .
self longAt : where + ( MethodIndex << ShiftForWord ) put : newMethod .
self longAt : where + ( ClosureIndex << ShiftForWord ) put : nilObj .
“ Copy the reciever and arguments … ”
0 to : argumentCount do :
[ :i | self long At : where + (( ReceiverIndex +i ) << ShiftForWord ) put : ( self stackValue : argumentCount - i ) ] .
“ clear remaining temps to nil in case it has been recycled ”
nilOop := nilObj .
argumentCount+1+ReceiverIndex to : tempCount +ReceiverIndex do :
[ :i | self long At : where + ( i << ShiftForWord ) put : nilOop ] .
self pop : argumentCount +
1 .
reclaimableContextCount := reclaimableContextCount + 1 .
self newActiveContext : newContext
The variable reclaimableContextCount counts how many contexts have been allocated that are not referenced by other objects and so may eagerly be reclaimed on return .
Whenever thisContext is referenced or a block created reclaimableContextCount gets set to zero .
On return if reclaimableContextCount is non-zero the returning context is reclaimed and reclaimableContextCount is decremented .
Again in a naive implementation pushing an object on the stack involves a store check .
David Ungar ’s Berkeley Smalltalk nilled out the stack slot when popping off an entry so that a push would only have to increase the reference count of the object pushed instead of also decrementing the count of the object overwritten .
The Squeak VM uses a generational collector so there is no reference counting but it does need to make the context a root if it is old ( in newActiveContext : ) to avoid the store - check on every push .
It also carefully protects against access beyond the stack pointer through checks in the at : and at:put : primitives so that allocateOrRecycleContext : does not have to initialize the stack with nils .
But these are all desperate attempts at mitigating the cost of a structure which for the most part is used in last - in , first - out ( LIFO ) order and only occasionally used to do the cool stuff we love it for .
So here ’s my evolution of Peter Deutsch ’s and Allan Schiffman ’s original scheme for having one ’s cake and eating it too , for providing the illusion of ever - present contexts while only creating them when necessary .
This is the fourth variant I ’ve come up with , a hybrid of my earlier schemes and Peter and Allan ’s , and like any hybrid it is vigourous and healthy 🙂
What ’s really different about my scheme , unlike Peter and Allan ’s , is that contexts do n’t get divorced when you send them a message , a cryptic comment I ’ll explain presently .
Stack Organization
The basic idea is to organize method activations using a stack discipline and to allow these to be accessed through contexts .
The stack discipline is no different to that in conventonal language implementations .
Outgoing arguments get pushed on the stack and on activation a frame is built immediately following the arguments which it references via the stack or frame pointer .
On return the frame is popped off the stack and the stack pointer and frame pointer revert to referencing the caller frame ; no different to stack management in e.g. Pascal or C .
The wrinkle is in allowing context objects to be created and manipulated as if they were conventional contexts even though they are stand - ins for underlying stack frames .
Let ’s look at some activation / return sequences to understand it properly .
Here ’s a stack which has some arguments for a send pushed on it by some already active method , it is about to send + in DateAndTime today +
( Duration weeks : 1 ) .
Here ’s the DateAndTime >>+ method :
DateAndTime methods for ansi protocol
+ operand
“ operand conforms to protocol Duration ”
| ticks |
ticks := self ticks + ( operand asDuration ticks ) .
^ self class basicNew
ticks : ticks
offset : self offset ;
yourself
When the message is sent the intetpreter looks up #+ in dateAndTime and finds the method .
To build the frame for the method the interpreter pushes its current instruction pointer and frame pointer , saving them for the eventual return , then pushes the method , a flag word and a slot to hold the frame ’s context if it ever needs one .
Finally it pushes the receiver ( again ) and initializes temporaries ( in this case just “ ticks ” ) to nil .
all of which is done by the following method
StackInterpreter methods for message sending
internalActivateNewMethod
| methodHeader numTemps rcvr errorCode |
< inline : true >
methodHeader := self headerOf : newMethod .
numTemps := self tempCountOfMethodHeader : methodHeader .
rcvr := self internalStackValue : argumentCount .
“ could new rcvr be set at point of send ? ”
self internalPush : localIP .
self internalPush : localFP .
localFP := localSP .
self internalPush : newMethod .
method := newMethod .
self internalPush : ( self
encodeFrameFieldHasContext : false
isBlock : false
numArgs : ( self argumentCountOfMethodHeader : methodHeader ) ) .
self internalPush : nilObj .
“ FxThisContext field ”
self internalPush : rcvr .
“ Initialize temps … ”
argumentCount + 1 to : numTemps do :
[ :i | self internalPush : nilObj ] .
“ - 1 to account for pre-increment in fetchNextBytecode ”
localIP := self pointerForOop : ( self initialPCForHeader : methodHeader method : newMethod ) – 1
The flag word , tells the interpreter three things , how many arguments the method has , whether the context field is valid or not and whether the frame is a method or block activation .
Each of these fields is a single byte .
The interpreter uses the args field to decide where to find a temporary variable .
The bytecode set uses push / Store / StorePopTemporary bytecodes to access both arguments and temporaries since in a context the arguments and temporaries are adjacent .
But in this stack organization the arguments are at the top of the frame and the temporaries below , so the argument count determines where to find temporaries and hence having fast access to the argument count is essential to access arguments and temporaries with acceptable speed :
StackInterpreter methods for frame access
frameNumArgs : theFP
“ See encodeFrameFieldHasContext:numArgs : ”
< inline : true >
<var : # theFP type : #’char *’>
^stackPages byteAt : theFP + FoxFrameFlags + 1
StackInterpreter methods for internal interpreter access
temporary : offset in : theFP
“ See StackInterpreter class>>initializeFrameIndices ”
| frameNumArgs |
< inline : true >
<var : # theFP type : #’char *’>
^offset < ( frameNumArgs := self frameNumArgs : the FP )
ifTrue : [ stackPages longAt : theFP + FoxCallerSavedIP + ( ( frameNumArgs – offset ) * BytesPerWord ) ]
ifFalse : [ stackPages longAt : theFP + FoxReceiver – BytesPerWord + ( ( frameNumArgs – offset ) * BytesPerWord ) ]
internalPush : object
“ In the StackInterpreter stacks grow down . ”
stackPages longAtPointer : ( localSP := localSP – BytesPerWord ) put : object
StackInterpreter methods for stack bytecodes
pushTemporaryVariable : temporaryIndex
self internalPush : ( self temporary : temporary Index in : localFP )
pushTemporaryVariableBytecode
< expandCases >
self fetchNextBytecode .
“ this bytecode will be expanded so that refs to current Bytecode below will be constant ”
self pushTemporaryVariable : ( currentBytecode bitAnd : 16rF )
The receiver is pushed also , partly for reasons of efficiency and , as we ’ll see later , to support blocks .
Pushing the receiver after the context field allows the interpreter to find the receiver at a known offset relative to the frame pointer , avoiding having to fetch frameNumArgs for instance variable access :
StackInterpreter methods for frame access
frameReceiver : theFP
< inline : true >
<var : # theFP type : #’char *’>
^stackPages longAt : theFP + FoxReceiver
StackInterpreter methods for stack bytecodes
pushReceiverVariable : fieldIndex
self internalPush : ( self fetchPointer : fieldIndex of Object : self receiver )
pushReceiverVariableBytecode
< expandCases >
self fetchNextBytecode .
“ this bytecode will be expanded so that refs to current Bytecode below will be constant ”
self pushReceiverVariable : ( currentBytecode bitAnd : 16rF )
We arrange that stacks grow down because in the JIT they definitely will .
Call , return , push and pop instructions on CISC processors ( notably x86/IA32 ) define that stacks grow downwards , and the JIT will reuse much of the StackInterpreter ’s machinery .
Whenever I talk about a frame being above another one I mean it is later , actually at a lower address , but logically above , towards the head frame and away from the base frame ; the “ hottest ” element on the stack is still called the top of stack .
Continuing with the execution once DateAndTime >>+ has pushed self ( 12 January 2009 ) it is ready to send ticks :
The pushed 12 January 2009 becomes the receiver of the new activation of DateAndTime >># ticks .
The saved instruction pointer is the pointer to the bytecode following the send of ticks .
The saved frame pointer is the frame pointer for the DateAndTime >>#+ frame , then comes the DateAndTime >># ticks method , a flag word indicating no arguments , an invalid context field and the 12 January 2009 receiver :
The ticks method will eventually compute #( 2454844 0 0 )
DateAndTime methods for private
ticks
“ Private – answer an array with our instance variables .
Assumed to be UTC “
^ Array with : jdn with : seconds with : nanos
Its return bytecode dismantles the frame , assigning the frame pointer to the stack pointer , popping off the saved frame pointer into the frame pointer , the caller ’s saved ip into the instruction pointer , removing the arguments , and pushing the result :
which is done by the following method :
commonCallerReturn
“ Return to the previous context / frame ( sender for method activations , caller for block activations ) . ”
< sharedCodeNamed : ‘ commonCallerReturn ’ inCase : 125 > “ returnTopFromBlock ”
localIP := self frameCallerSavedIP : localFP .
localSP := localFP + ( self frameStackedReceiverOffset : localFP ) .
localFP := self frameCallerFP : localFP .
stackPages longAt : localSP put : localReturnValue .
self fetchNextBytecode .
method := self frameMethod : localFP
and the bytecode after the send of #ticks in DateAndTime >>#+ pops and stores the result into the ticks temporary , leaving us where we started but with ticks holding self ticks .
Look ma , no contexts .
Context to Stack Mapping
Let ’s add closures to the mix so we can see contexts related to stack frames .
A closure has an explicit reference to its enclosing context , which in our new scheme has to be mapped to a stack frame .
Let ’s evaluate
‘ Hi ! ’ detect : [ : char| ‘!?’ includes : char ] ifNone : [ ^#unemphatic ]
Here ’s Collection >>#detect:ifNone :
Collection methods for enumerating
detect : aBlock ifNone : exceptionBlock
“ Evaluate aBlock with each of the receiver ’s elements as the argument .
Answer the first element for which aBlock evaluates to true .
If none
evaluate to true , then evaluate the argument , exceptionBlock . ”
self do : [ : each | ( aBlock value : each ) if True : [ ^ each ] ] .
^ exceptionBlock value
On activation of Collection >>#detect : ifNone : the top frame on the stack looks like this
The [ : each | ( aBlock value : each ) if True : [ ^ each ] ] needs an outerContext but it is executing within the frame activation of Collection >>#detect:ifNone :.
So when the block is created we also create a context that is a proxy for the frame ( a better reference is here ) .
If the block refers to self or an instance variable it needs to get at the receiver of the outerContext and if it executes the uparrow - return it must return from the Collection >>#detect :ifNone : frame .
To avoid chaos we need a one - to - one relationship between frames and contexts ; hence the flag in the frame which ensures we only create one context for a frame .
In this implementation we say that a frame is married to a context , and there ’s no polygamy allowed .
Given that a context could be referenced long after its frame exits we also have to detect if a context has been widowed , and convert it into a stable , but returned - from context .
As we ’ll see frames and contexts can get divorced ( although that ’s fatal for the frame ) and contexts can re-marry , but frames only marry once if at all ; clearly contexts are female , and frames are rather frail males ; no widowers here .
To implement non-local return correctly we must be able to determine if a context is single ( a normal heap context , not associated with a frame ) , married or widowed , and , if married , to locate its spouse frame .
At the least we need a pointer from the context to its spouse .
For this we use the sender field .
The sender field of a context is always either another context or nil ( ignoring wilful and inevitably fatal abuse by the programmer ; you can assign a Point , or any other object , to the sender of this Context but it ’ll end your session ) .
So we mark married contexts by storing the frame pointer of their spouse frame with the SmallInteger tag bit set in the sender field .
Frames are always word - aligned so frame pointer least significant bits are always zero .

^theContext
I think marry Frame : contains a bug in that it copies all temporaries into the spouse context but it needs only to copy the receiver and arguments .
But that ’s how the code stands today .
Mea culpa .
Before we delve into the details of divorce and widowhood , and how we hide all this matrimonial activity from Smalltalk let ’s finish activating the block within Collection >>#detect:ifNone :.
Collection >>#detect :ifNone : sends do : and in this case SequenceableCollection >># do : will activate the block :
SequenceableCollection methods for enumerating
do : aBlock
“ Refer to the comment in Collection > > do : . ”
1 to : self size do :
[ : index | aBlock value : ( self at : index ) ]
The BlockClosure >> value [ : value :…] primitives create a frame for the block , setting the “ is block ” flag , push the method and receiver in the outerContext and push any copied values .
In the block activation the receiver of the value : message , the [ ] in detect : ifNone : that do : pushed on the stack , is not the receiver ( ‘ Hi’ ) of detect : ifNone : .
If we need to marry a block activation then we can find its closureOrNil on the stack in the same position as the receiver for normal sends .
But as far as accessing self and its instance variables blocks and methods are the same ; the field following the context field is always the receiver of the home method activation .

Stack Pages
So far I ’ve left out how the stack is shared amongst Smalltalk ’s light - weight processes , and how we maintain Smalltalk ’s immunity from stack overflow .
In a context - based Smalltalk the only limit to the depth of a call chain is available heap memory in which to store contexts .
In a blue - book Smalltalk implementation infinite recursion manifests itself as a low - space condition .
Smalltalk provides light - weight processes , which are simply chains of contexts , and applications like Croquet can create thousands a second and have hundreds active at any one time .
Creating a new process involves creating a process object and a context or two .
In using a stack we need to both share it effectively between processes and keep process creation cheap .
Pater Deutsch ’s solution is to divide up the stack into pages , each page capable of holding enough contexts so that we ’re not switching stack pages all the time and few enough such that moving all the frames on the page into the heap in the form of contexts so the page can be reused does n’t take too long .
As we ’ll see with the JIT this does introduce some complications calling run-time routines on the C stack , but on balance it ’s an excellent solution and I ’m sticking with it .
So the stack is in fact composed of pages of a fixed size determined statically and quantity determined at start - up .
I ’m currently using 1024 byte stack pages , which have room for about 20 “ average ” activations , which is a little tight and so will probably move to 2048 byte pages when I tune the JIT .
Current ;y inside Qwaq we ’re using 192 stack pages .
Running on a stack page of a small size introduces three complications , stack page overflow , stack page underflow , and linking stack pages together .
We handle overflow by checking a stack Limit on every frame build .
So in full detail internalActivateNewMethod is as follows , with the added complications of passing any primitive error code and of checking for stack overflow , which is right at the end of the method :

and : [ ( self byteAtPointer : localIP + 1 ) = 129 “ long store temp ” ] ) if True :
[ errorCode := self getErrorObjectFromPrimFailCode .

primFailCode := 0 ] .
self assert : ( self frameNumArgs : localFP ) == argumentCount .
self assert : ( self frameIsBlockActivation : localFP ) not .
self assert : ( self frameHasContext : localFP ) not .
“ Now check for stack overflow or an event ( interrupt , must scavenge , etc ) ”
localSP < stackLimit ifTrue :
[ self externalizeIPandSP .
self stackOverflowOrEvent : argumentCount mayContextSwitch : true .
self internalizeIPandSP ]
On overflow we must allocate a new stack page and continue execution there , linking the new bottom - most frame ( its base frame ) to the current frame .
Likewise , return must deal with returning from a base frame and return from one stack frame to the next .
We have a mechanism for referring to stack frames , married contexts , so to link a stack page ’s base frame to the stack page beneath it we marry the top frame of the stack we ’re leaving and store this in the base frame of the stack page we ’re entering .
We mark the new stack page ’s base frame as such by giving it a null caller saved fp and use the caller saved ip field to hold the caller context , the spouse of the stack page beneath ’s top frame :
We have a linked list of StackPage objects , one for each page , that we use to keep stack pages in order of usage , along with free pages , referenced by a variable called the mostRecently UsedPage .
Each StackPage keeps track of whether a stack page is in use ( baseFP is non-null ) and what part of the page is in use ( from the first slot through to the headSP ) and what the frames are in the page ( the list from head FP chained through caller saved fp to the baseFP ) .
The interpreter ’s current stack page is called stackPage .
On stack switch we load stackLimit from stackPage ’s stackLimit .
Peter cleverly realised that one can use the stackLimit check to cause the VM to break out of execution to process input events .
The VM is set up to respond to potential input with an interrupt handler that sets the stackLimit to all ones ( the highest possible address ) so that the next stack overflow check will fail .
We also check for stack overflow on backward branch so that we can break out of infinite loops :
StackInterpreter methods for jump bytecodes
longUnconditionalJump
| offset |
offset := (((currentBytecode bitAnd : 7 ) – 4 ) * 256 ) + self fetchByte .
localIP := localIP + offset .
( offset < 0 “ backward jump means we ’re in a loop ; check for possible interrupts ”
and : [ localSP < stackLimit ] ) if True :
[ self externalizeIPandSP .
self checkForEventsMayContextSwitch : true .
self browserPluginReturnIfNeeded .
self internalizeIPandSP ] .
self fetchNextBytecode
So stackOverflowOrEvent:mayContextSwitch : checks whether stackLimit differs from stackPage ’s stack limit to see whether it should check for input and only switches to a new page if the stack pointer is below stackPage ’s real stack limit .
Of course on stack overflow we may find that there are no free stack pages , in which case the VM simply flushes all the frames
on the least - recently used page to the heap in the form of contexts .
First it ensures all frames on the page are married and then divorces them all , linking them through their sender fields just as if they were created by a context - only VM , and then reuses the page , mercilessly killing the frames there - on .
If any other stack page had the freed stack page beneath it then that stack page ’s base frame will find its saved caller context is single .
So as execution proceeeds the stack zone holds the top frames of a number of recently executed processes , overflowing the contents of older stack pages to the heap as contexts .
The only possible references into that page are from contexts which have all been divorced , so all references remain valid , except now they ’re to single contexts instead of married ones .
When the system snapshots the image all stack frames are divorced and so the image file contains only single contexts , allowing the image file to be run by a context - only VM or started up on a VM with a different number of stack pages at different addresses .
Here ’s the divorce code :

Widowhood
Given that contexts are objects they have indefinite extent ; they can be stored in instance variables , typically indirectly from blocks that are stored in various places ) and so outlive being returned from .
For example here ’s one way to create a widowed context for a block activation :
| container |
container := Array new : 1 .
#( foo ) do : [ : ignored| container at : 1 put : thisContext ] .
container
Even simpler would be
Object methods for examples
widowedContext
^thisContext
At various times , for example whenever accessing the instance variables of contexts , or on return , we need to check whether a context is single , married or widowed and act accordingly .
A single context will have a sender that is not a SmallInteger ( recall isMarriedOrWidowedContext : above ) .
A married or widowed context however may or or may not have outlived its spouse .
Since the system starts up and snapshots with only single contexts we know that all encoded frame pointers in sender fields point into stack pages .
We can easily derive the StackPage object for a stack page because each stack page is a power - of - two in size and all stack pages are contiguous .
Once we have the StackPage we can find out if it is in use or not , and if the context ’s spouse frame is in the live portion of the stack ( between baseFP and headFP ) .
If so , we can follow the frame pointer and examine the frame ’s flags and context fields .
But there is no guarantee that we ’re looking at the actual frame .
It may have been exited and overwritten by some other frame .
So we must assume that the spouse frame pointer is potentially pointing at an arbitrary position in the stack .
Note that we have to keep the current stackPage ’s headFP and headSP up - to - date because the interpreter of course uses its own localFP and localSP ( and , sigh , framePointer and stackPointer , the former being a clever performance hack that tediously causes lots of code duplication , one that the JIT can hopefully do without ) .
writeBackHeadFramePointers and externalWriteBackHeadFramePointers assign stackPage headFP and headSP from localFP & localSP or framePointer and stackPointer respectively ( see e.g. divorceAllFrames above ) .
Because the stack and the heap are disjoint there is no overlap of caller saved fp and other fields on the stack ( saved instruction pointers are also pointers but into method bytecodes ) .
So by storing the spouse ’s caller saved fp in the married context , a match implies the spouse frame pointer is to a frame at that position .
If the frame has a context context matches then we know the two are married .
If they ’re not , the frame must have exited , and so we widow the context by converting it into a context that has been returned from , .e. we nil its sender and instruction pointer fields .
Now you can see the bug in marry Frame above .
The widowed context will have a valid method , receiver and arguments ( arguments being read - only in Smalltalk ) but should n’t hold onto the temporaries that existed at the time of its creation because they could be out - of - date .
Alas Qwaq is too close to a release right now for me to dare fixing this ; I ’m going to wait a week or two .
That a widowed context does n’t hold onyto non-argument temporaries is , I believe ( and fervently hope ) the only visible difference between a pure context VM and a stack VM .
I think its fair to expect that volatile state does disappear on return , and not holding onto volatile state is good for garbage collection .
This change in semantics has never been complained about by the VisualWorks community when I introduced this scheme to VisualWorks in 1999 .
The only code I ’ve ever seen affected by this was an exception report generator that used to generate its report after the exception handler had squirreled away the context and returned .
The fix is either to generate the report in the exception handler or copy the context chain there - in .
With widowhood explained we can have a look at the full glory of return .
Return
As we ’ve seen , most of the time send and return are considerably less complicated than in the context VM .
Send is somewhat more complicated when there ’s a stack overflow .
Return is somewhat more complicated when there is a base return :

But non-local return is much more complicated .
What does non-local return do in a pure context VM ?
It walks the context chain from a block context until it finds the block context ’s home context , checking for unwnd protect contexts along the way .
If it does n’t find the home context it sends cannotReturn : and if it finds an unwnd protect it sends aboutToReturn : through : and allows the image to run unwind - protect blocks itself , otherwise it simply returns from the home context .
Using the stack , things are seriously more complicated .
In the StackInterpreter non-local return occurs in some block activation ( a frame ) and returns from the block activation ’s home context , which is some distance along the block activation ’s closure ’s outerContext chain ( its lexical chain ) .
The home context could be single , widowed or married .
If married it could be a base frame whose caller could be single , widowed or married .
If single we need to marry it to have a frame to resume execution in .
If the home ’s caller is married its spouse frame could be the head frame on its page or some interior frame .
So we could be returning within a stack page or across stack pages or across stack pages and single contexts .
First we have to walk this chain looking for unwind protects and the home context , then we have to do the return , freeing intervening stack pages .
Complicated .
So here it is .
Read the comments and hopefully it ’ll make sense .

The mutual recursion between findMethodWithPrimitive : FromFP:UpToContext : and findMethodWithPrimitive : FromContext : UpToContext : could conceivably cause the runtime C stack to overflow and should be flattened into a set of loops .
But when I wrote this I found it much easier to understand because I was riting it in Smalltalk .
I ’m not at all convinced that the code inside the VisualWorks VMs correct because , being written in C , it is not nearly as comprehensible .
Those of you who know the Squeak VM well will know there ’s a primitive terminateTo : that does something similar to the context nilling in non-local return .
It is a little simpler than non-local return ( although not much ) but it is just a variation on the same theme so I ’ll spare you .
Hiding Stack Frames
Still reading ?
Good .
Now we ’re ready for some fun .
While we ’ve organized the system around stack pages and improved performance markedly ( measurements to follow ) and prepared the ground for the JIT , we still have to hide these stack pages from the Smalltalk programmer .
We need to arrange that whever he or she accesses a context it hides its spose and always pretends to be single , whether we read or write it .
We ’ve seen how return copes with this , but what about methods on context such as
ContextPart methods for debugger access
swapSender : coroutine
“ Replace the receiver ’s sender with coroutine and answer the receiver ’s
previous sender .
For use in coroutining . ”
| oldSender |
oldSender := sender .
sender := coroutine .
^oldSender
The problem here is that the current valid state of the context lives in the frame and changing that state needs to either affect the frame or update the context after it has been divorced .
One apparently straight - forward way to handle this is to divorce contexts whenever they are sent messages and whenever the system attempts to access a context instance variable .
This is the way the VisualWorks VM handled things until I changed the scheme in 5 i in 1999 .
Married contexts ( hybrid contexts in the VisualWorks terminology ) had special classes that would cause teh send machinery to trap and “ stabilize ” ( divorce ) the receiver context .
The bytecode compiler marked methods that accessed instance variables which could be run by contexts and the JIT generated special code that would stabilize the receiver context before accessing an instance variable .
The main problem with this approach is that any kind of state access ends up divorcing a context which hurts performance and encourages a proliferation of complex primitives in the VM which try and avoid divorce replicating code that could be written in the image .
The other problem is that it is slow .
Sends to contexts trap and divorce even for read access .
Wen I introduced the scheme I ’m using here exception handling code and non-local return roughly doubled in speed .
The key in this scheme is to intercept all access to context instace variables and forward the access to the spouse if married .
In the VM the only places the state of a context are accessed outside of the frame management code for send and return and stack page management are the instance variable access bytecodes and the at : at:put : instVarAt : and instVarAt : put : primitives .
Instance variable access is very frequent so having to test for accessing a context on every instance variable access bytecode would hurt performance noticeably .
Unlike a JIT we can’t perform the text for contextness at compile time based on the class of the method being compiled ; we have to test on execution of the relevant bytecocde .
But as I alluded to in Closures Part III I added a horrible hack to the bytecode compiler to avoid testing on most instace variable accesses .
The compiler allows a class to specify special node classes for handling instance variables .
This is used by Tweak to access properties and by InstructionStream , the first superclass of ContextPart to introduce state , to handle context instance variables .

The doubleExtendedDoAnything Bytecode ( I ’m not making this up ) only needs to be used for instance variables with an offset greater than 63 , which is rare .
Since MethodContext only has 6 instance variables we only have to check for the receiver being a contex if we ’re using the doubleExtendedDoAnything Bytecode to access instance variables 0 through 5 .
Since the doubleExtendedDoAnything Bytecode has to do a lot of decoding before it computes the instance variable offset and the test is ony a compare of the computed index against the constant 6 the test is essentally free for all but use on actual contexts .

Writing is a different matter .
The one case that ’s really important for performance is assigning the sender because it is used in e.g. co-routining but also in stack unwinding and termination .
It is trivial to assign the sender of a base frame as it already refers to a context , but to assign to the sender of any other frame requires ingenuity something that Peter Deutsch and Allan Schiffman have in abundance and their solution is to split the stack into two .
The assignee and all frames above it are moved to another stack , making the assignee the base frame , rendering assigning the sender trivial .
Likewise handlng other assignment cases is done by moving all frames above the assignee to another stack , divorcing the assignee frame and assigning to the resulting single context .
Once the assignee frame is a base frame we no longer have to split its stack if its sender is assigned again .
So contexts that have their sender assigned often migrate to the bottom of stack pages , allowing the StackInterpreter to keep up with a context interpreter when co-routining .

It turns out that moveFrames In : through : toPage : is useful for one more function that really helps performance , stack overflow .
Consider what happens in the execution of bench Fib :
Integer methods for benchmarks
benchFib
^ self < 2
ifTrue : [ 1 ]
ifFalse : [ ( self –1 ) benchFib + ( self –2 ) benchFib + 1 ]
If the initial argument is larger than the number of activations of nfib that can fit on the remaining room in the stack page a stack overflow will occur , and probably soon thereafter a base return back to the original stack .
At some point the system will thrash doing overflowing sends and underflowing returns .
When we first started using the StackInterpreter inside Qwaq bench Fib for large N would do well but benchFib for small N would do badly and the problem was overflow / underflow thrashing .
The simple fix is to increase the number of frames moved on each successive overflow from the same page .
On the first overflow we move one frame , on the second two and so on .
Soon the thrashing is taken care of because the active frames end up located on the same page .
So here ’s stack overflow .
It turns out we only need two variables to remember which page last overflowed and a count of frames to move .
StackInterpreter methods for frame access
stackOverflowOrEvent : numArgs mayContextSwitch : mayContextSwitch

Garbage Collection
Before we can have a look at measurements I need to discuss garbage collection .
There ’s not much difficulty grabae collecitng references frm stack pages .
The garbage collector simply has to traverse the frames on in -use pages .
There is a need to void stack pages that are not reachable to stop them holding onto garbage , but this also is easy .
The major problem is the Squeak VM ’s habit of running the garbage collector inside an allocation when memory runs out .
This is a feature it shares with a number of other garbage collectors in VMs and it is difficult to be emphatic enough when saying how horrible this is .
It is incredibly difficult to live with and a huge source of bugs .
Because the garbage collector can run , and hence move objects , on any allocation the VM must hold onto all unreferenced intermediate results it is using while allocating .
For example , look at the start of the basic allocation routine in the standard Squeak VM :
ObjectMemory methods for allocation
allocate : byteSize headerSize : hdrSize h1 : baseHeader h2 : classOop h3 : extendedSize doFill : doFill with : fillWord
“ Allocate a new object of the given size and number of header words .
( Note : byteSize already includes space for the base header word . )
Initialize the header fields of the new object and fill the remainder of the object with the given value .
May cause a GC ”
| newObj remappedClassOop end i |
< inline : true >
<var : # i type : ‘ usqInt ’>
<var : #end type : ‘ usqInt ’>
“ remap classOop in case GC happens during allocation ”
hdrSize > 1 ifTrue : [ self pushRemappableOop : classOop ] .
newObj := self allocateChunk : byteSize + ( hdrSize – 1 * BytesPerWord ) .
hdrSize > 1 ifTrue : [ remappedClassOop := self popRemappableOop ] .
… etc …
Because allocateChunk might cause the GC to run the classOop might move and hence the “ solution ” ( read “ slow inconvenient hack ” ) is to provide a stack to hold intermediate results ( pushRemappableOop :/ popRemappableOop ) whose contents the GC updates when it runs .
So where is the latent bug in the standard perform primitive ?
Interpreter methods for control primitives
primitivePerform
| performSelector newReceiver selectorIndex lookupClass performMethod |
performSelector := messageSelector .
performMethod := newMethod .
messageSelector := self stackValue : argumentCount – 1 .
newReceiver := self stackValue : argumentCount .
“ NOTE : the following lookup may fail and be converted to #doesNotUnderstand : , so we must adjust argumentCount and slide args now , so that would work . ”
“ Slide arguments down over selector ”
argumentCount := argumentCount – 1 .
selectorIndex := self stackPointerIndex – argumentCount .
self
transfer : argumentCount
fromIndex : selectorIndex + 1
ofObject : activeContext
toIndex : selectorIndex
ofObject : activeContext .
self pop : 1 .
lookupClass := self fetchClassOf : newReceiver .
self findNewMethodInClass : lookupClass .
“ Only test Compiled Methods for argument count – other objects will have to take their chances ”
( self isCompiled Method : newMethod )
ifTrue : [ self success : ( self argumentCountOf : newMethod ) = argumentCount ] .
successFlag
ifTrue : [ self executeNewMethodFromCache .
“ Recursive xeq affects successFlag ”
successFlag := true ]
ifFalse : [ “ Slide the args back up ( sigh ) and re-insert the selector . “
1 to : argumentCount do : [ : i | self
storePointer : argumentCount – i + 1 + selectorIndex
ofObject : activeContext
withValue : ( self fetchPointer : argumentCount – i + selectorIndex of Object : activeContext ) ] .
self unPop : 1 .
self storePointer : selectorIndex
ofObject : activeContext
withValue : messageSelector .
argumentCount := argumentCount + 1 .
newMethod := performMethod .
messageSelector := performSelector ]
Well if the perform is not understood there will be an allocation of a Message within findNewMethodInClass : , which may cause a GC , and if the new method does n’t have the right number of arguments the statements
newMethod := performMethod .
messageSelector := performSelector
may assign invalid pointers to newMethod and messageSelector .
It might bite only once in a blue moon but those are the worst kind .
Things are far worse in the StackInterpreter since any send , or assignment to a context instance variable , may cause an entire stack pages worth of contexts to be allocated as a stack page ’s frames are divorced so that the page can be reused .
It is simply intolerable to live with pushRemappableOop :/ popRemappableOop scheme .
It has to go , or at least only rear its ugly head occasionally .
The change is to maintain sufficient free space such that we can at least allocate a page worth of contexts , scheduling a GC as soon as we ’ve started eating into this reserve , but deferring the garbage collection until a safe point .
I wo n’t bore you wth the details , but there ’s a subclass of ObjectMemory called NewObjectMemory that coordinates this providing a set of eeInstantiate * methods ( for execution engine ) that the VM uses for objects allocated in the course of execution ( contexts , closures and messages for doesNotUnderstand : ) .
It then only runs the garbage collector in checkForEventsMayContextSwitch : .
The standard allocation primitives primitiveNew and primitiveNewWithArg still use the old scheme which is also provided for plugins so that they do n’t have to be rewritten , but inside the interpreter the remapBuffer is shunned entirely .
Proportions , Profiles and Prospects
This stack organization does make a difference all by itself .
The StackInterpreter is substantially faster for activation / return benchmarks and insubstantially slower for process switch benchmarks .
Here are the results of four benchmarks comparing the StackInterpreter against the standard context Interpreter .
Both are compiled using the Intel C compiler and run on my 2.16 GHz Intel Core Duo MacBook Pro .
{ [self nbody : 200000 to : t1 ] }
took 5.289 seconds
ratio : 0.69 % change : - 30.95 %
{ [self binarytrees : 15 to : t1 ] }

{ [self threadring : 10000000 ] }
took 8.263 seconds
ratio : 0.948 % change : - 5.22 %
geometric mean 0.733 average speedup - 26.74 %
These benchmarks are taken directly from the Squeak versions on the computer language shootout site ( thanks Isaac ! ! ) .
nbody is a floating - point intensive N - body simulation of the Sun , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .
Some of the speedup ( about a third ) is due to improvements in the primitive floating point code ( the use of compact class indices if you must know ) .
binarytrees is an allocation heavy binary tree creation and traversal benchmark .
It benefits both from the stack organization and the GC changes .
Chameneos is a symbolic computation that compares many pairs of objects in one of three states , the colours red , blue and yellow .
threadring is a thread benchmark that passes a token between 503 Smalltalk processes .
As you can see we get worth - while speedups for everything except threadring , and that threading is not any slower .
Running Qwaq Forums , Qwaq ’s business communications solution written in Croquet , we see about a 15 % improvement both in loading times and in frame rate .
And we ’re getting ready to release this VM to the public as I write .
I ’ll be putting a version for general consumption in a Monticello repository near you real soon now™ .

we can see where this speedup comes .
All of the context management on send and return is substantially cheaper and we see a noticeable increase in the cost of bytecode dispatch , showing that the VM has more time to do real work .
But 15 % improvement is nothing for a system that , at least for activation / return benchmarks like benchFib , is some 20 times slower than VisualWorks .
The overhead of bytyecode dispatch shows where we have to go next .
We need to execute machine code rather than interpret bytecode .
We need a JIT .
The StackInterpreter is an intermediate step after closures and before the JIT to ensure steady progress and on - time delivery of a substantially faster VM .
The essential point , of course , is that a stack organization suits the use of native call and return instructions whose use , along with in - line cacheing techniques , substantially improve send and return performance .
As you can see in my Simulate Out Of The Bochs post I ’ve already started work on the JIT and I hope to be far more current in my blog posts about it than I ’ve been on the StackInterpreter .
Apologies .
I ’m already enjoying this year immensely .
The JIT , the first I ’ve ever written in Smalltalk , is a delight .
I hope to blog about it soon .
Thanks for reading .
A large part of disposable income is spent on dining out .
When consumers have less extra cash , restaurants often feel the consequences first .
To get customers back , restaurants are trying everything they can to attract patrons .
In Denver , a restaurant opened with an attractive option for diners ; pay whatever you want for your meal .
There is no cash register , no prices listed , and no credit card machine .
Diners decide on what they want to pay , and put the money in an envelope .
This is no soup kitchen , the establishment is run by Brad and Libby Birky , and features pizza , pasta , and daily menus that are mostly organic .
In fact , most of its ingredients come from Whole Foods Market .
They serve approximately 15,000 diners per year , and “ they are making quite a bit of sales and quite a bit of money , ” according to one of the workers .
Many traditional chain restaurants are using specials and discounts as a marketing strategy to get more diners back in their locations .
TGIFridays , Ruby Tuesdays , etc. all have specials listed on WalletPop.com .
They are likely trying to avoid the fate of Bennigans , and Steak & Ale , both chains filed for bankruptcy last year .
In New York City , the signature “ hard - to - get ” attitude of many New York eateries is giving way to more customer friendly operations .
Joan Rappoport , a Manhattan event planner who lives in the West Village and eats out regularly , said that she sensed a climatic shift as early as six months ago .
“ The attitude that a number of places used to have , they do n’t have that anymore , ” Ms. Rappoport said , her tone of voice communicating equal measures bewilderment and relief .
“ That attitude of ‘ we ’re doing you a favor , ’ that frosty condescending attitude — I do n’t find that anymore .
And I ’ve experienced that change over and over again . ”
In Boston , dozens of restaurants have specials including $ 1 tacos at la Verdad and 50 cent appetizers at Masa .
In central Ohio , 57 eateries are offering complete 3 course meals for $ 20 .
Loyal patrons of neighborhood eateries , coffee joints , lunch spots , drink spots and gathering places are seeing their favorite places close , leaving them not only with one less place to eat , but often a missing reliable hangout .

Cheney : Bush 's actions legal if not impeached Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday January 4 , 2009
Print This Email This
If you do n't get punished , you did n't go anything wrong , right ?
That 's the message Vice President Dick Cheney gave in an interview with CBS '
Bob Schieffer on Sunday , suggesting that a president 's actions are legal if those actions did n't result in his impeachment .
Asked by Schieffer if he believed that anything the president does in time of war is legal , Cheney said there is " historic precedent of taking action that you would n't take in peacetime . "
Cheney referenced Abraham Lincoln as an example of another president who " suspended the writ of habeus corpus " during a war , prompting this exchange :
###
SCHIEFFER : But nobody thinks that was legal .
CHENEY : Well , no .
It certainly was in the sense he was n't impeached .
And it was a wartime measure that he took that I think history says today , yeah , that was probably a good thing to do .
###
The vice president spent much of the interview defending eight years of the Bush administration 's policies , including its surveillance and interrogation programs .
When Schieffer asked if the Bush administration had gone " too far " in its surveillance program , Cheney said no .
" I dont believe we violated anybodys civil liberties , " he said .
Cheney also urged President - elect Barack Obama to continue the Bush administrations interrogation policies .
" I would hope [ Obama ] would avoid doing what others have done in the past , which is letting the campaign rhetoric guide his judgment in this absolutely crucial area , " Cheney said .
" We were very careful , we did everything by the book , and in fact we produced very significant results . "

Obama expanding military operations in Pakistan : Report Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday February 21 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  US President Barack Obama 's administration has broadened the number of radical groups targeted by the CIA inside Pakistan by attacking a militant network seeking to overthrow the Pakistani government , The New York Times reported Saturday .
The newspaper said recent missile strikes on training camps run by Baitullah Mehsud represent a broadening of the US military campaign inside Pakistan , which has been carried out largely by drone aircraft .
Under former president George W. Bush , the United States frequently attacked militants from Al - Qaeda and the Taliban but stopped short of targeting Mehsud and his followers .
Mehsud was identified early last year by US and Pakistani officials as the man who had orchestrated the assassination of Pakistani former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , the report said .
Bush included Mehsud in a classified list of militant leaders whom the CIA and American commandos were authorized to capture or kill , according to the paper .
However , he did not do anything to implement the authorization .
But last Saturday and Monday , US missiles hit camps run by Mehsud 's network , The Times said .
The Saturday strike was aimed specifically at Mehsud , but he was not killed , the paper reported , citing unnamed Pakistani and US officials .

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
The official measure of British government debt will rise by as much as 1.5 trillion pounds ( $ 2.1 trillion ) after the Office for National Statistics confirmed Thursday it would classify Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland as public - sector entities .
That means net liabilities of 1 trillion to 1.5 trillion pounds , equal to 70 % to 100 % of gross domestic product , will be added to the measure of U.K. public sector net debt .
The change is effective from Oct. 13 , 2008 , when the government moved to recapitalize the troubled institutions .
The banks join lenders Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley , who also hold the same classification .
Economists said the change to the figures would likely exaggerate taxpayers ' exposure to bank liabilities .
A deteriorating picture for public sector borrowing is a bigger worry , they said .
The ONS , meanwhile , said figures from the two banking groups will be incorporated into data on public sector finances " as soon as is practicable , but it should be noted that they are large , complex organizations , and this may take some time . "
Public debt stood at 703 billion pounds in January or 47.8 % of gross domestic product .
The U.K. government has pumped 17 billion pounds into Lloyds Banking Group and holds a roughly 43 % stake in the company .
The government has also pumped around 20 billion pounds into RBS and will hold a roughly 70 % stake once preference shares are converted .
Economists deemed it questionable whether the metrics usually used to gauge manageable levels of public debt remain relevant when banks are brought under public control .
That 's because net debt is calculated by subtracting liquid assets from total liabilities -- and banks , by the nature of their business , carry relatively few liquid assets as a proportion of their balance sheet , said Simon Hayes , an economist at Barclays Capital , in a research note .
The measurement , meanwhile , ignores illiquid assets , such as loans to corporations and households , that do have value and will generate cash flow over time .
Also , since no government is likely to let a major bank collapse , it 's rather arbitrary whether a bank 's liabilities are included in public finance statistics , he said .
" When push comes to shove , the public finances of all major economies are vulnerable to any further deterioration in banking sector prospects , whatever the official net debt figures might say , " Hayes said .
Meanwhile , January borrowing figures showed U.K. public sector finances were in worse shape than expected , with the public sector repaying just 3.3 billion pounds in public borrowing compared to forecasts for a repayment of around 7.5 billion pounds .
That marked the smallest repayment in 14 years .
January typically sees a big repayment because it is a major month for income and corporate tax payments .
For the 2008 - 09 financial year to date , the budget deficit stood at 42.5 billion pounds at the end of January , up from 7 billion at the same point in the 2007 - 08 financial year .
Public sector net borrowing totaled 67.2 billion pounds to date , up from 23.1 billion at this point in 2007 - 08 .
The British pound was unfazed by the news , rising 1.3 % versus the dollar to $ 1.4408 in recent action .
Sterling has fallen sharply since the middle of 2008 , however , in part due to mounting concerns over the government 's deteriorating fiscal picture , economists said .
The pound traded just below $ 1.90 in late September .
Economists said the deteriorating public finance picture underlines a growing worry for the U.K. economy .
" As the deficit rises , [ Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling ] may well need to find a way of further convincing the markets of the U.K. government 's credibility - with the possibility of further future spending cuts and / or tax rises , " wrote Charles Davis , an economist at the Center for Economic and Business Research , a London think tank .

Earlier we showed you the horrifying , adult Mouseketeer - like " commercial " for Microsoft Songsmith ( do not click that ) that could drive the gentlest among us to murder .
But at least it 's inspiring a YouTube artistic explosion .
As bad as the commercial ( which stars two Microsoft scientists who are , surprisingly , not trained actors ) is , the product advertised is even worse .
You sing , and it automatically creates a tinny , childish background track that would get bottles hurled at you in any open mic in America .
It 's all part of Bill Gates ' plan to destroy cool things — in this case , music — with computers , resulting in global nerd domination .
The Times points out that the ultimate proof of this can be found in all the YouTube videos by brave pioneers who fed classic songs into Songsmith and taped the results .
What monster could promote something such as this ? :
Despite a credit freeze that ’s stunting renewable - energy projects throughout the country , 2008 was a hot year for solar power in California .
Encouraged by state rebates , Golden State residents and businesses last year installed a record 158 megawatts of photovoltaic panels on their rooftops to turn the sun ’s rays into electricity , the California Public Utilities Commission said Wednesday .
That ’s more than double the 78 megawatts installed in 2007 .
Residential demand appears to be hanging tough in the face of the shaky economy .
December saw the largest volume of homeowner rebate requests since the state launched the California Solar Initiative program two years ago .
“ I ’m encouraged to see that even in these difficult financial times we are breaking solar installation records and spurring private investment in solar projects , ” Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said in a statement .
Launched in January 2007 , the California Solar Initiative is an attempt to push photovoltaics on a mass scale in California to help cut greenhouse gas emissions and shore up the state ’s energy supply .

Funded by utility ratepayers , the program offers rebates to those who install panels on their homes and businesses .
Refunds are typically 20 % to 50 % of a system ’s cost .
Solar modules would seem a luxury in the current dismal economy .
But experts said new federal tax breaks , on top of already generous state incentives , are encouraging some Californians to take the plunge .
As of Jan. 1 , homeowners are eligible for tax credits of up to 30 % of the entire cost of their projects .
Those benefits had previously been capped at $ 2,000 per system .
Others have concluded that putting solar panels on their roofs and cutting their power bills is a safer bet than the stock market or real estate .

“ Solar customers are finding value in solar at a time when other investments may not be as attractive , ” said Molly Sterkel , program manager for the California Solar Initiative at the utilities commission , which tracks rooftop solar installations in the territories served by Southern California Edison and the state ’s other investor - owned utilities .
The figures do n’t include systems installed in the areas served by the state ’s municipally owned utilities , including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power .

The international Red Cross accuses Israeli forces today of failing to assist wounded Palestinians and of " unacceptable " delays in letting rescue workers reach a Gaza home where four small children were found alive next to their mothers ' bodies .
Rescuers had been refused permission by the Israeli army to reach the site in the Zaytun neighborhood of Gaza City for days , the International Committee of the Red Cross said .
The neutral aid group 's head of delegation for the region described the incident as " shocking . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded , " Pierre Wettach said in a statement .
" Neither did they make it possible for us or the Palestine Red Crescent to assist the wounded . "
Rescuers eventually received permission to go to the site Wednesday , four days after it was hit by Israeli shells .
They found 15 dead and 18 wounded in three houses , including the children who were too weak to stand .
The ICRC said requests to be allowed to reach other destroyed houses in this neighborhood , reportedly containing more wounded , were refused by the Israeli army .
" The ICRC believes that in this instance the Israeli military failed to meet its obligation under international humanitarian law to care for and evacuate the wounded , " the Geneva - based group said in a statement .
" It considers the delay in allowing rescue services access unacceptable . "
A spokeswoman for the Israeli mission in Geneva said she was unable to comment on the incident at this time .
Did n't get that sleek , stylish Apple iPhone for Christmas as you wished for this past year ?
Well , if you 're looking for a cheap version of the very popular handheld device , you might just be in luck : big box electronics retailer Best Buy recently announced that it will be selling a discounted refurbished version of the iPhone in hundreds of its stores .
In an announcement made yesterday , Best Buy Co. Inc. revealed that it would sell resurrected versions of the 3G iPhone for approximately $ 50 less than their brand - spanking - new counterparts .
In other words , the refurbished 8 GB model will retail for $ 149 and the 16 GB model for $ 249 .
( Source : itworld.com )
Much like their more expensive brethren , the refurbished iPhones will require customers sign up for a service contract with AT&T .
Importantly for Best Buy , the company now has a new angle for selling a device recently adopted by the all - powerful Wal - Mart .
America 's gargantuan department store retailer recently added the iPhone to their Apple stock , promising to match or beat any offers made by competitors like Best Buy or Circuit City .
Vice president of marketing for Best Buy's Mobile division Scott Moore believes the new , refurbished offering is evidence of the retailer 's adaptability to consumer demands .
" The refreshed iPhone is a great example of the depth of our offering , and clear evidence of why Best Buy is the best place to purchase a mobile phone , " he stated .
( Source : businessweek.com )
Wall Street quickly took notice of the news , with Best Buy shares climbing to $ 31.02 , an impressive 3.4 per cent jump .
The use of refurbished products is certainly an interesting move for a big box electronics store like Best Buy .
Many retailers , such as TigerDirect.com , have carved out market space by offering consumers refurbished products for less than their original price .
Given the instability of the economy and consumer spending fears , perhaps this represents a window of opportunity for struggling tech businesses .
Hey , Wall Street seems to think so .
With less than a week remaining before President George W. Bush leaves office , controversial Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury on Wednesday , 14 January 2009 issued a legal opinion finding that a memorandum from President Lyndon B. Johnson to the heads of departments and agencies prohibiting use of the polygraph in the Executive Branch except under limited conditions is without legal effect .
The summary of Bradbury ’s opinion states :
An undated four - page memorandum from President Lyndon Johnson entitled “ Use of the Polygraph in the Executive Branch ” and addressed to the heads of Executive Branch departments and agencies , which was neither issued as a directive to the Executive Branch nor understood contemporaneously to have legal effect , does not now bind the Department of Justice or other entities within the Executive Branch .
It is not clear why Bradbury , who last year testified before Congress against all evidence and reason that waterboarding is not torture , has issued such a legal opinion at this late stage .
Nor is it clear what this opinion may portend for future polygraph policy .
Bradbury ’s opinion on the Johnson polygraph memorandum is at the time of writing the only Office of Legal Counsel opinion publicly posted on the Department of Justice website for 2009 .
In related news , Russ Kick at The Memory Hole reports that the Office of Legal Counsel has in recent days released a slew of legal opinions some of which had been withheld from the public for years .
It should be noted that a 2002 research review by the National Academy of Sciences found polygraph screening to be completely invalid , concluding that “ [ polygraph testing ’s ] accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies . ”
The Bush Administration , however , completely disregarded this damning report and instead siginificantly increased federal reliance on the polygraph .
In 2008 , for example , the Defense Intelligence Agency announced a plan to greatly expand its polygraph screening program and the Department of Defense began using hand - held lie detectors in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Our fears about the wretched Serious Crime Act 2007 , and its likely use to chill political dissent and free speech appear to have been borne out .

The Register reports the chilling news that :
Police bail sysadmin in animal rights extremism probe - Colo contract prompts Serious Crime Act arrest By Chris Williams Posted in Law , 10th February 2009 15:01 GMT A Sheffield man has been released on police bail after being questioned in connection with comments posted to the activist news website Indymedia , which included the personal details of a prominent High Court judge .
Note that the controversial new Terrorism Act 2000 section 58A Eliciting , publishing or communicating information about members of armed forces etc. , brought in by the Counter Terrorism Act 2008 section 76 , does not apply to Judges , juries or prison officers who might be at risk from terrorists or serious criminals .
The man , in his 40s and thought to work as a systems administrator , was arrested on Monday and questioned for about eight hours .
He has been bailed without charge to appear at a police station in May .
His home was searched and computer equipment and paperwork seized .
The comments at the centre of the investigation were critical of Mr Justice Neil Butterfield for the landmark blackmail sentences he handed down to seven animal rights extremists last month .
One posting encouraged other Indymedia users to use the personal information to contact Butterfield and " to let this friend of [ animal testing firm Huntingdon Life Sciences ] know exactly what you think about him " .
Indymedia administrators deleted the personal information soon after it was posted , but they were contacted by Kent Police the following day requesting the IP addresses of the posters .
The Kent force carried out the original investigation that resulted in the blackmail sentences handed down by Butterfield .
Indymedia told Kent Police it does not record IP addresses .
The same day the force seized a server belonging to Indymedia and hosted at Manchester - based colocation provider UK Grid .
The Register understands that the man arrested was not responsible for either of the comments and is not an Indymedia activist or administrator .
Rather the server was hosted by UK Grid under a contract in his name , along with several others on behalf of unrelated clients .
He was arrested under sections 44 - 46 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 , which came into force on October 1 last year .
The relevant sections criminalise " intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence " , " encouraging or assisting an offence believing it will be committed " and " encouraging or assisting offences believing one or more will be committed " .
A spokeswoman for Kent Police confirmed the man was arrested on " suspicion of incitement " under the Serious Crime Act .
Indymedia has a long - standing policy of not retaining IP address logs to preserve anonymity , and the hard drive of the server taken from UK Grid was encrypted , as were the drives taken from the man 's home .
It 's understood police did not use Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) powers to demand he turn over any encryption keys .
Refusing to provide encryption keys is an offence under section 49 of RIPA and carries a prison sentence of up to five years .
Who now doubts that we are living in a Police state under this unpopular and increasingly hated repressive Labour government ?
What happened to freedom of speech on the internet or even in the mainstream media ?
Who will be next ?
If the mainstream media and the UK political blogosphere and the UK telecomms and Internet Service Provider industries do not kick up a huge fuss about this case , then the terrorists will have won , by provoking this morally weak Government into
destroying our fundamental human right of free speech .
UPDATE Sunday 15th February 2009
Some more details about this shocking case , which threatens not just our personal freedoms , but which could also to destroy important sections of the United Kingdom economy , are to be found in this blog posting by Katabasis , a friend of the arrested person :
Help wanted - A chilling landmark for civil liberties in the UK
For less than four dollars an hour , the Jewish teenagers removed furniture , clothes , kitchenware and toys from the homes and loaded them on to trucks .
As they worked diligently alongside the many policemen who had come to secure the destruction of 30 houses in two unrecognised Bedouin villages , Bedouin teenagers stood by watching their homes being emptied .
When all the belongings had been removed , the bulldozers rapidly destroyed the homes .
All those present , Jews and Bedouins , were Israeli citizens ; together they learned an important lesson in the discrimination characterising civic life in the Jewish state .
The current demolitions are part of a strategy that began with the foundation of the state of Israel .
Its ultimate objective is the Judaisation of space .
In this case , the demolitions were carried out in order to establish two new Jewish villages .
Their establishment , though , is part of a much larger plan that includes the construction of about 30 new Jewish settlements in the Israeli Negev , the seizure of Bedouin land for military needs , and the creation of dozens of single - family farms on land that has been inhabited by Bedouins since they were relocated to the region by the state in the early 1950s .
After witnessing the demolitions , a Bedouin activist asked one of the Jewish teenagers why he had agreed to participate in the eviction .
Without hesitating , the teenager replied : " I am a Zionist and what we are doing here today is Zionism . "
The teenager was not wrong .
And yet he was probably too young to recognise that even though Zionism 's major goals have not changed , the methods deployed to realise them have been undergoing a radical transformation .
While , traditionally , the state itself performed the task of Judiasing space , over the years the government has been outsourcing more and more of its responsibilities to private firms .
The teenager himself was hired by a personnel agency , which was employed by the state to carry out the job of expelling Bedouins from their homes .
The process of privatising Zionism has been slow .
For over five decades the state was the sole agent responsible for all planning of new villages , towns and cities , and only the construction was carried out by private contractors .
Now , land from which the Bedouins are being expelled is sold at rock bottom prices to big real estate moguls , who are then responsible not only for building Jewish villages and towns , but also for planning them .
The private contractors manage to garner larger returns than ever before , since the difference in price between " unplanned " land and land that has undergone " planning " is enormous .
The personnel agencies and contractors are , however , not the only heroes in the crusade to privatise Zionism .
A five - minute drive separates the two unrecognised Bedouin villages whose houses were demolished from a number of single - family Jewish farms established in the last few years .
The state gives these Jewish farmers large plots of land and connects them to basic infrastructure like water and electricity , and , in return , expects them to be part of an apparatus whose role is to contract and restrict Bedouin movement and development and to help the security forces keep an eye on the Negev 's indigenous population .
If one drives a few kilometres further and crosses the Green Line into the occupied Palestinian territories , one may notice that military checkpoints are also being privatised .
In the past year , at least five such checkpoints have been handed over to subcontractors and are currently managed by corporate warriors .
The difference between IDF soldiers and corporate warriors is that the latter operate within the gray areas of the law .
They are Israel 's Blackwater .
Thus , as this privatising trend continues the checkpoints in the West Bank , which have already earned notoriety under the management of the Israeli military , will surely become sites of more misery for Palestinians trying to pass through .
The checkpoints , though , are just a recent development in a process that has been going on for several years in the occupied territories .
In the early 1980s , the Israeli government allowed private contractors to appropriate land within the occupied territories and sell it at great profits , while the military created settler militias to help it police the Palestinian inhabitants .
These civilian militias were given military - issue personnel carriers , weapons , and communications equipment and were asked to patrol around their settlements , which , in practice , often meant policing nearby Palestinian villages .
Zionism 's privatisation does not symbolise a strategic change but rather a tactical one .
The state has been shedding some of its responsibility , while private entities have been taking on the tasks that until recently had been carried out by the government .
The major difference is that the private firms are even less liable than the state .
Hence , the use of teenagers to evict Bedouins from their homes is not only a reflection of this insidious process of privatisation , but also the unrelenting corrosion of moral accountability .
Nearly half the nation ’s presidents have been affiliated with the Episcopal or Presbyterian churches .
John F. Kennedy remains the only Catholic to have held the nation ’s highest office .
Only three U.S. presidents — Thomas Jefferson , Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson — have been unaffiliated with a specific religious tradition .

CNN report on ex-drum major John Coleman 's story , with the controversial salute .
CLEVELAND — Drum Major John Coleman , suspended six months for nodding and waving to President Barack Obama , said Tuesday that he will not return to the Cleveland Firefighters Memorial Pipes and Drums band .
" There are too many bridges burned with the pipe band , too many hurt feelings on both sides , " said Coleman , fire inspector for Cleveland Heights .
( He was never suspended from his job , as some people mistakenly believed , but from his position in the band , which is made up of firefighters from several local departments , as well as civilians )
After the suspension was reported in Monday 's Tipoff column in The Plain Dealer , the story went national and caused readers to debate the subject in the comments section of many blogs , sometimes not so nicely .
" There are some of the members of the band who would n't want me back , " said Coleman , who as the drum major was the face of the organization , leading it in parades and often interviewed by the media .
He does not play an instrument , though , an issue that some band members found unpalatable .
" I figure it 's best for the band if I leave , " he said .
Band leader Mike Engle , the pipe major , was out of town Tuesday and not available .
A statement issued by the band read : " We 're sorry to see him leave .
We are greatly disappointed that this issue has caused so much heartache .
It 's been a disheartening few days . "
Coleman first led the band in the 1993 St. Patrick 's Day Parade .
This year 's will be the first in 17 years without him in the lead .
" But I could still march in the parade with the firefighters or the Ancient Order of the Hibernians , " he said .
He 'll then have a knee replacement operation he had been putting off until after the parade in anticipation of leading the band .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
As Barack Obama gets ready to sell his stimulus plan to the country , some critics are saying that massive government spending wo n't work .
One big reason they 're skeptical : Japan 's experience in the 1990s , the country 's so - called Lost Decade .
But are they missing the real lessons ?
To review a little history :
After a stunning rise in Japan 's real - estate and stock prices in the 1980s , both bubbles burst to create a mess similar to the one the United States .
is experiencing now .
Over the next several years , the Japanese government launched several stimulus packages to jump start the economy through public - works projects and loan programs .
And yet from 1996 to 2002 , the country 's economy stalled : per capita GDP grew a paltry 0.2 % .
Conservative critics like the Wall Street Journal 's editorial board have been using Japan 's experience as evidence to be wary of stimulus packages altogether .
In an editorial last month entitled " Barack Obama - san , " the Journal listed all of Japan 's stimulus attempts , and then intoned : " Not to spoil the party , but [ stimulus spending ] is not a new idea ... How do you say ' good luck ' in Japanese ? "
However , as in any reading of history , the closer you look the more nuanced the lessons .
For many , the moral of the story is n't that Japan erred in deciding to use fiscal policy to fix their economy -- its failure was in the execution .
For one thing , there was dubious logic behind too many of Japan 's infrastructure projects .
" It was the epitome of bridges to nowhere , " says economist Ed Lincoln , director of the Center for Japan - U.S. Business and Economic Studies at New York University .
" There was apparently a $ 2 billion bridge built to an island of 800 people . "
And even before the financial crisis hit , Japan was wasting money on pork - barrel projects , so by the time the Japanese ramped up spending in the 1990s , they had run out of worthy projects to fund .
The United States , by comparison , has a long list of needy spots .
( Witness the Minneapolis bridge collapse in 2007 . )
Lincoln adds that at its peak in the 1990s , the government was spending 8 % of GDP on public works projects .
By comparison , the United States now spends about 3 % - even several hundred billion dollars in proposed projects would not get the United States to Japan 's peak .
Another lesson :
Do n't forget that the main problem in the United States right now lies with the financial sector .
And you can't necessarily spend your way out of that .
" If you have n't fixed the core problem that started it all , which is the real cleaning up of balance sheets in the financial industry , it 's gonna get you nowhere , " says Carmen Reinhart , professor of economics at the University of Maryland .
This means Obama needs to maintain focus on the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , even as he launches an ambitious stimulus package .
" As long as the finance industry is mired in this overhang of bad debt , we 're not going to get normal lending , " says Reinhart .
" And if you do n't have normal lending , many segments of the economy are paralyzed . "
Act fast
Finally , any action by the government needs to be done swiftly and decisively .
The Japanese government 's efforts were spread over several years but it was as if its leaders could n't pick one strategy and stick to it .
After passing a series of stimulus packages in the early 1990s , the economy showed signs of improving ; by 1995 , GDP was growing at roughly an annual rate of 2.5 % .
And then the government took a fateful step .
Worried about its growing debt , Japan raised its consumption tax two percentage points , to 5 % , in 1997 .
And the economy , by now also hobbled with deflation , sunk into a recession .
" When you look at the Japanese crisis , you really do n't see the drama of a collapsing economy and a big contraction of the economy and sharp increase in unemployment , " says Reinhart .
" What you see is this lingering malaise in which a very rapidly growing , buoyant economy becomes one that 's limping along . "
The trouble with any debate over Japan 's stimulus in the 1990s is that it 's impossible to know what would 've happened if the government had taken lesser action .
Many argue the situation would 've been worse .
One thing is certain : Japan still faces a mountain of debt from all its spending ; debt is now around 200 % of GDP , vs. 45 % for the U.S .
And the U.S. can count on a similar situation if it embarks on more big - government spending .
In the end , though , looking to history can yield only so many lessons .
Very few other countries have faced a comparable crisis followed by a huge government stimulus , and Japan is only one scenario .
" I think it is extremely dangerous ... to draw large lessons from one observation , " says Reinhart .
" Using the Japan example to make a bold statement about whether stimulus packages work or not I think is on very shaky ground . "

One of the worst things that has happened during this economic crisis is that capitalism itself has been attacked without mercy — even by some who generally support the free market .
Calls for more regulations , more bailouts , more Fed action , more stimulus packages , more recovery programs , and more government intervention in general can be heard from every quarter .
Not that capitalism has n't always had its share of critics — even among those who usually espouse some degree of it , like evangelicals .
In his recent book , How to Be Evangelical without Being Conservative ( Zondervan , 2008 ) , Roger Olson advocates " a highly graduated income tax combined with redistribution of wealth to the poor through education , job training , direct aid to children , subsidized day care for children of poor working mothers and fathers , and other forms of welfare . "
He rejects Robert Nozick 's belief in " small government that interferes as little as possible in the economy " for John Rawls 's " limited but active government . "
Olson recognizes that " one might argue that Rawls 's principles would also require guaranteed work with a living wage for everyone and universal entitlement to health care . "
But it should not scare us that " these social policies are often labeled ' socialism ' by conservatives . "
Socialism , according to Olson , is " just a word . "
In fact , these policies are not socialistic at all ; they are " simply adjustments to capitalism to ameliorate its tendency to widen the gap between the rich and the poor .
But rather than an adjustment , what capitalism needs is a vigorous defense .
This is true now more than at any other time since the Great Depression because all the Depression - era economic fallacies are being resurrected to try to combat the current crisis .
Fortunately , I do not need to write a defense of capitalism : that has already been done — twice — and by men more qualified than I .
These defenses of capitalism are not only vigorous ; they are uncompromising , up to date , understandable , and eminently readable .
And neither one is a textbook on economics .
The first book is The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism by Robert P. Murphy , an adjunct scholar of the Mises Institute and frequent contributor to this website .
Murphy wastes no time in his introductory chapter .
Not only does government intervention in the market trample on " freedom and individual rights , " it " often hurts the very people it presumes to help . "
It is " precisely backward " that capitalism exploits the poor for the benefit of the rich .
The problem with most modern critics of capitalism is that they " fear freedom — they fear the results of allowing people to decide their own economic affairs and letting the unregulated market run its course . "
Capitalism 's critics " think regulators and bureaucrats know better than private citizens making their own voluntary arrangements . "
In his defense of capitalism , Murphy discusses every conceivable topic : supply and demand , price controls , profits , taxes , labor laws , antidiscrimination laws , environmental issues , workplace safety , money , banking , monopolies , trade , trade deficits , outsourcing , depressions , business cycles , and interest .
Along the way he defends robber barons , middlemen , speculators , CEOs , Big Oil , and other " capitalist pigs , " while skewering unions , environmentalists , and government bureaucrats , programs , businesses , deficits , and market interventions .
After the introduction , each myth - exploding chapter can be read independently .
An added bonus is the procapitalist books we are " not supposed to read " that are mentioned throughout each chapter .
No anticapitalist myth is too sacrosanct for his sharp and witty pen .
For a more detailed look at The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism , see David Gordon 's review in the Mises Review .
Murphy 's own introduction to his book can be read here .
The second book is How Capitalism Saved America : The Untold History of Our Country , from the Pilgrims to the Present by Thomas J. DiLorenzo , one of the senior faculty of the Mises Institute and also a frequent contributor to this website .
DiLorenzo takes a historical approach but begins with two crucial introductory chapters on the nature of capitalism and the perpetrators of anticapitalism .
DiLorenzo takes us through American history — from the Pilgrims to the 2001 –2002 California energy crisis — and shows " how , from the very beginning , capitalism has been vital to America 's growth , and how excessive government interference in the economy has only exacerbated economic problems and stifled growth . "
Although the book is written chronologically , the chapters of How Capitalism Saved America ( after the introductory chapters ) can , like Robert Murphy 's book , be read independently .
DiLorenzo dismisses as Marxist propaganda the idea that capitalism is " a zero - sum game in which ' somebody wins , somebody loses . ' "
Instead , " Capitalism succeeds precisely because free exchange is mutually advantageous . "
And not only does it succeed , it is " the source of civilizations and human progress . "
Capitalism has " brought to the masses products and services that were once considered luxuries available only to the rich . "
Capitalism is not only " the best - known source of upward economic mobility , " it " actually reduces income inequalities within a nation . "
In short , capitalism alleviates poverty , raises living standards , expands economic opportunity , and enables scores of millions to live longer , healthier , and more peaceful lives .
Why then is capitalism blamed for causing monopolies , harming consumers , endangering workers , damaging the environment , causing instability , exploiting the Third World , breeding discrimination , and causing war ?
DiLorenzo believes that because there is " a widespread misunderstanding of what capitalism is , our leaders — and also much of the general public — incorrectly blame capitalism for any economic problems we face . "
This anticapitalism bias is so pervasive — in the entertainment industry , universities , private foundations , the media , and among government regulators and agencies , environmentalists , ministers — that " most businesspeople are not even capitalists . "
DiLorenzo indicts large corporations , not because they are large or because they are corporations but because " many corporations support interventionist or anticapitalist policies like trade protectionism or corporate welfare because they hope to benefit from the policies at everyone else 's expense . "
For a more detailed look at How Capitalism Saved America see David Gordon 's review in the Mises Review and my own review from the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics .
Together , these two books on capitalism are a double - barreled shotgun pointed in the face of socialism , mercantilism , protectionism , interventionism , anticapitalist myths , and every bogus idea that has passed for capitalism since Karl Marx invented the term .
Both books are sorely needed to counteract the numerous myths , distortions , and falsehoods about capitalism that appear daily in newspapers and magazines and come out of the mouths of government officials , political commentators , preachers in pulpits , and teachers in classrooms .
Although there are other important books on this subject — see the works of Mises and Rothbard , and George Reisman 's massive Capitalism : A Treatise on Economics — these two books by Murphy and DiLorenzo are the most accessible for the general reader .
They should be distributed far and wide — whatever direction the economy takes in the future .
The recent attacks on capitalism are not only wrong , they are misdirected .
One of the greatest myths about capitalism is that the US economy is a capitalistic one .
As George Reisman has well said , " Laissez - faire capitalism is a politico - economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and in which the powers of the state are limited to the protection of the individual 's rights against the initiation of physical force . "
The US economy ( now a " mixed economy " ) began its permanent decline from real capitalism with the establishment of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887 .
The Progressive Era reforms , the Square Deal , the New Deal , and a myriad of government restrictions and regulations have further severed the US economy from real capitalism .
Capitalism needs no adjustment .
It needs to be understood and put into practice .
Not only is capitalism never the cause of a financial crisis , it is always the cure .
Government intervention is never ever under any circumstances the solution to any problem , large or small , economic or otherwise .
When will men ever learn that more government is not only never the solution , it is usually part of the problem ?
Real capitalism — that is , capitalism based on secure private - property rights , sound money , the division of labor , social cooperation , freedom of contract , freedom of association , voluntary exchange , and the absence of government control , oversight , and regulation — is the answer to the current economic crisis .
Not state capitalism , not crony capitalism , not mixed - market capitalism , not fascism and interventionism under the guise of capitalism , but unfettered , laissez - faire , free - market capitalism .
The day after it received $ 6 billion in capital from the federal government , GMAC , the financing affiliate of General Motors , began aggressively trying to draw consumers back into dealerships on Tuesday .
GMAC said it would begin making loans immediately to borrowers with credit scores of 621 or higher , a significant easing from the 700 minimum score the company started requiring two months ago as it struggled to stay afloat .
And G.M. said it would offer a new round of low - rate financing , including zero percent interest on some models .
The infusion of capital from the Treasury Department late Monday was seen as critical for both GMAC and G.M. , which relies on the lender to finance car buyers and dealer inventories .
GMAC is jointly owned by Cerberus Capital Management , the private equity firm , and G.M .
The Treasury will buy $ 5 billion worth of preferred shares in GMAC as part of the $ 700 billion financial rescue known as TARP , for Troubled Asset Relief Program , and it will lend $ 1 billion to G.M. , which , in turn , will invest $ 1 billion in GMAC .
The strong yen and sluggish sales have , understandably , caused massive damage to Japan ’s main car manufacturers , with a new round of temporary closures and large job losses hinting at further hardships on the horizon .
But that ’s not say that the current crisis is confined to car makers of course , and rather surprisingly the nation ’s usually far from flaccid sex industry seems to be suffering too , resulting in that veritable mainstay of many merchants , the vibrator , being sold at apparently preposterously low prices .
Which , as stimulus packages go , is novel to say the least .
Senate Approves D.C. Voting Rights Bill With Gun Amendment
The Senate approved , by a 61 to 37 vote , the D.C. Voting Rights bill that would give the city its first ever seat in the House of Representatives .
However , the Senate did so only after adding a controversial amendement that would repeal most of the District 's local gun-control regulations , potentially throwing a wrench into the process .
The D.C. Vote bill would expand the House permanently by two seats .
One would go to strongly Democratic D.C. , while the other would go to the next state in line to pick up a seat based on population count .
For two years , that seat would be Republican - leaning Utah .
It would then pass to whichever state qualified based on Census results .
If it becomes law , the bill will expand the House for the first time since 1913 .
But it is likely to face a legal challenge that could go all the way to the Supreme Court .
The gun amendement makes the Senate 's D.C. Vote legislation significantly different from a companion bill in the House , which is expected to face a floor vote next week .
Differences between the two bills would have to be worked out in negotiations between the two chambers .
Proponents of the bill said they hoped the gun language could be removed during those talks .
The gun amendment is similar to a sweeping measure approved by the House last year that was fiercely opposed by the D.C. government .
It would limit the District 's authority to restrict firearms , repeal the D.C. semiautomatic gun ban and remove gun-registration requirements .
Opponents denounced it on the Senate floor .
" It 's reckless , it 's irresponsible , it will lead to more violence , " charged Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif . ) .
She said that approval of the amendment would be " the first step to removing all common - sense gun regulation all over this land . "
The sponsor of the amendment , Sen. John Ensign ( R - Nev ) said his goal was " to remove the tremendous barriers and burdens on law - abiding citizens " in the city who were seeking to " protect themselves in their own homes . "
He pointed to a large chart showing the D.C. murder rate over the years .
" We want the law - abiding citizens to have the arms -- not just the criminals , " he said .
Ensign charged that the D.C. goverment had n't gone far enough in reforming its gun laws since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the city 's handgun ban last year .
D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty ( D ) and D.C. Council members disagree with that conclusion .
They furiously protested the firearms amendment .
" The District of Columbia leadership is fully united in its opposition to unwarranted amendments that would dramatically damage the District 's carefully revised gun law and expose the District to great harm through the undoing of its laws , " D.C. Council President Vincent C. Gray and Council Member Phil Mendelson , chairman of the council 's public - safety commission , said in a letter to Congress released yesterday .
In a statement after the Senate 's vote , Ilir Zherka , executive director of D.C. Vote , a lobbying group , said the city has passed a " significant hurdle in our fight for full democracy for DC residents . "
But he added of the gun amendment : " If anything , this amendment has strengthened our resolve to continue to fight for the rights of Washingtonians .
Congress repeatedly treats the District as a testing ground for flawed , dangerous legislation .
This has to stop - and we 'll keep fighting to ensure that the bill signed into law is not tainted by this amendment . "
Mendelson said after the vote : " The Senate action is of huge concern because the implications are far greater than anyone can imagine .
It strips our authority .
The irony here is that on one hand they vote to give us voting representation , but on the other hand they strip any local representation in regards to our gun laws .
...
If this prevails [ in the end ] , strengthening our laws against gun violence will be constrained .
That has huge public safety implications . "

A woman who set - up a simple system to catch and purify rainwater from her rooftop says that she gathers nearly enough water to avoid using the tap in her Austin , Texas home .
Jody Grenga hopes to limit her use of tap water to only 800 gallons this month .
Her previous record , is 1,020 gallons this June , compared to the average single person in the area who uses up to 3,000 gallons a month .
Grenga ca n’t reach her goal without strong conservation techniques .
She does not water her lawn , only does laundry every three weeks , and takes most showers at Barton Springs pool after her daily swim .
Grenga uses the rainwater to supply herself , her mother , and their seven cats with drinking water .
“ I consider it liquid gold that falls out of the sky , ” she said .
“ I ’ve had one glass of tap water in the past year . ”
The rainwater is collected through pipes into 14 barrels that line the house ’s perimeter .
Grenga purchased the filtration and purification supplies at wholesale prices , so the cost of the system was limited to $ 168 .
The Austin Water Utility promotes private rain capture by selling barrels for $ 60 , a deeply - discounted price .
Last year they sold 1,500 barrels , but this year the utility says they ’ve already sold at least as many .
Despite the recent storms hitting Texas , total rainfall for the Austin area is only a little over half what it normally is this year .
But Grenga is not concerned because of her large storage capacity .
For anyone interested in building their own system , this PDF document is a helpful guide to creating rainwater barrels out of recycled materials .

Here 's an interesting fact that you may not have seen yet .
The M1 money multiplier just slipped below 1 .
So each $ 1 increase in reserves ( monetary base ) results in the money supply increasing by $ 0.95 ( OK , so banks have substantially increased their holding of excess reserves while the M1 money supply has n't changed by much ) .
Update : John Holdren , the chief scientific adviser to Barack Obama , has said drastic measures to tackle climate change using massive technological measures should be considered .
Holdren ’s statement is a “ personal opinion ” , he says , but this is the strongest statement yet from within the Obama administration that geoengineering is being taken seriously .
As we reported earlier in the year , the proposal has now moved into mainstream scientific and political thought .
IN A room in London late last year , a group of British politicians were grilling a selection of climate scientists on geoengineering – the notion that to save the planet …
Scott Coker lays out the details via AOL Fanhouse :
" We 're in dialogue with Gina , " Coker said .
" We did invite her -- through her manager -- to fight Cyborg on April 11 .
Cyborg is ready to go , and I think at some point today there will be further dialogue with Gina . " ... " My gut feeling right now is we have a shot at it , and it 's 50 - 50 , " Coker said .
" She 'd have to sign , start training camp and get going , but I think there 's a 50 - 50 shot we can make it happen .
This first fight card , we 're promoting it as the greatest card in the history of Strikeforce .
I think we 've had some good fights in our history , so we have to deliver . "
So much for tune - up fights .
Apparently , Coker is ready to make the match that EliteXC started building toward last year .
My guess is that the odds are less than ' 50 - 50 ' that this fight will take place on April 11 .
Carano has n't even signed with Strikeforce , she would probably like the benefit of a full , well planned training camp before facing her toughest test to date , and she 's been in preliminary talks with the UFC as recently as last week according to Kim Couture .
Maybe , this offer is meant merely as a signal to Carano that her signing is a top priority for Strikeforce .
My unexpert opinion is that Carano will eventually land at Strikeforce , given the exposure the promotion provides through Showtime and CBS .
Besides , they already promote female MMA and have Carano 's biggest potential opponent ( from a drawing power perspective ) locked up .
I just do n't see Carano fighting Cyborg as early as April 11 .
Then again , stranger things have happened .
“ It ’s not 1995 , ” BART ’s Web - site manager , Timothy Moore , explained .
“ A single Web site is not the endgame anymore .
People are planning trips on Google , they ’re using their iPhones .
Because we opened up our schedule , we are in those places . ”
A couple weeks after that first BART application appeared , a new trip planner went live .
This one , called iBART , was a thing of beauty .
Free , too .
It was written by two former high - school buddies — Ian Leighton , a sophomore at UC Berke­ley , and David Hodge , a sophomore at the University of Southern California .
Forty thousand people downloaded the program in just a few weeks .
“ We ’ve created competition among developers , ” Moore said , “ to see who can serve our customers best . ”
I met Moore and Leighton at a gathering in Silicon Valley called TransitCamp .
Inspired by a similar event in Toronto , the idea was to brainstorm what you might do with transit - agency data .
Nearly 100 people came .
One guy was looking to build a Web site that combined an online ride - share forum with BART arrival and departure times .
A pilot who runs an air - taxi business was hoping to mash up flight , bus , and subway schedules .
Environmental activists were seeking new ways to get cars off the street .
What does any of this have to do with the federal budget ?
Well , USAspending.gov might look like any other government Web site , but its API — that ’s Application Programming Interface — allows access to the site ’s raw data in an open , standard file format , similar to a transit feed .
( “ Wow , ” Moore said .
“ That ’s really powerful . ” )
Enterprising programmers , researchers , bloggers , or watchdogs like the Sunlight Foundation or Govtrack can grab that data and slice it , dice it , chart it , graph it , map it , or mash it up with new feeds .
It ’s not just the API that ’s a big deal , Greg Elin , Sunlight ’s chief data architect , told me .
“ It ’s the discipline an API imposes , ” he said .
To build one , an agency has to record and store data in a way that anticipates public use .
“ Data sharing is no longer an afterthought , ” Elin explained .
“ You begin with the notion that you ’re going to share information .
And you ’re going to make it easy for people . ”
( Compare that with the approach of the Federal Communications Commission , which allows only limited searching of filings and comments ; or that of the Department of Justice , which puts out data on foreign lobbying in unwieldy PDF format and binders . )
An API also encourages the release of data in real time , instead of in occasional reports , like Federal Election Commission figures , or earmark spending .
Last September , Moore added a feed that broadcasts imminent train arrivals in real time .
He ’s eager to see what people will do with it .
“ We ca n’t envision every beneficial use for our data , ” Moore told me .
“ We do n’t have the time , we do n’t have the resources , and frankly , we do n’t have the vision .
I ’m sure there are people out there who have better ideas than we do .
That ’s why we ’ve opened it up . ”
We ’d know a lot more about our government if Washington opened up the same way .

An interesting and overlooked part of President Obama ’s Executive Order on Presidential Records is that Obama has reversed a policy instituted by President Bush that allowed the release of presidential papers to be blocked .
Bush ’s executive order issued on November 1 , 2001 gave broad power and authority to a former president , vice president , their family , and descendents to indefinitely block the release of their papers for reasons of national security or personal privacy .
In effect , Bush ’s order subverted the Freedom of Information Act , and would have allowed previous administrations to hold on to their secrets forever .
Obama ’s order limits the executive privilege to presidents , and according to press release from the White House , ” The Executive Order on Presidential Records brings those principles to presidential records by giving the American people greater access to these historic documents .
This order ends the practice of having others besides the President assert executive privilege for records after an administration ends .
Now , only the President will have that power , limiting its potential for abuse .
And the order also requires the Attorney General and the White House Counsel to review claims of executive privilege about covered records to make sure those claims are fully warranted by the Constitution . ”

Obama issued this order on the first full day on the job for a specific symbolic reason .
He is saying to America that the era of secrecy is over .
He is making it clear that his administration will not only be more publicly open , but it will also follow the Constitution .
There was no justifiable reason for the Bush policy , except for the ideological belief that the American people were on a strictly need to know basis about his administration .
As a writer and a person who is a keen student of history , Obama ’s decision is not a surprise .
As a candidate Obama demonstrated a shrewd knowledge of the historic importance , and possible impact of his candidacy for the presidency .
All Americans should be thrilled with the idea that their government will be more open and accountable , not only for now , but for years to come .

Despite the fact that their keyboards are hand - cripplingly small , the " netbook " sector of computer sales continues to grow and expand .
Whether it 's the small form factor or the significantly lower price tag , these computers are appearing on shelves from almost every major manufacturer .
To keep prices low and save precious system resources , many manufacturers are preinstalling Linux on these machines .
Freescale Semiconductor ( formerly the chipmaking division of Motorola ) hopes to get in on the action , launching a new , low - cost processor they call the i.MX515 .
According to Freescale the chip is designed to power " low - power , gigahertz performance netbooks at sub -$ 200 price points " .
Sporting an ARM Cortex - A8 core , Freescale claims that the i.MX515 performs from around 600mHz to 1 GHz and provides up to 2,100 Dhrystone MIPS ( million instructions per second ) .
When it comes to memory , the chip supports mobile DDR1 in addition to DDR2 , allowing for a bit more flexibility in configuration .
What makes the i.MX515 exciting , however , is the battery life that it can potentially bring to its machines .
According to Freescale 's statistics , the chip will have the capability to power machines with up to 8 hours of battery life , with a display as large as 8.9 inches .
The company included many advanced power management features such as a dedicated , hardware - based video acceleration block , supposedly allowing for this long battery life and significantly cooling things down .
Freescale claims that there is no need for heat sinks or fans with the processor .
According to Henri Richard , chief sales and marketing officer at Freescale , any OEM that has n't yet got into the netbook space is " making a huge mistake " .
" It 's happening , it 's there , it 's real .
And if you 're not there to take advantage of it , you 're going to miss big , " the former AMD executive warned .
The real question is : how much of an offering will there be for computers in Freescale 's target price range ?
It is currently reported that Freescale will showcase a Pegatron ( ASUS spinoff ) built netbook at CES this week , and Asustech also reportedly has plans to release a sub -$ 200 computer in the coming months .
All we know at this point is that these computers will almost definitely be running Linux - these chips just can't provide enough CPU power to run any Windows operating system , including netbook standard XP .
This is a fascinating run down of an ‘ anatomy of a crash ’ from Australian car magazine Drive suggesting that the accident can be over before we ’re even consciously aware of it happening .
This is a reconstruction of a crash involving a stationary Ford Falcon XT sedan being struck in the driver ’s door by another vehicle travelling at 50 km/h .
0 milliseconds –
An external object touches the driver ’s door .
1 ms – The car ’s door pressure sensor detects a pressure wave .
2 ms – An acceleration sensor in the C - pillar behind the rear door also detects a crash event .
2.5 ms – A sensor in the car ’s centre detects crash vibrations .
5 ms – Car ’s crash computer checks for insignificant crash events , such as a shopping trolley impact or incidental contact .
It is still working out the severity of the crash .
Door intrusion structure begins to absorb energy .
6.5 ms – Door pressure sensor registers peak pressures .
7 ms – Crash computer confirms a serious crash and calculates its actions .
8 ms – Computer sends a “ fire ” signal to side airbag .
Meanwhile , B - pillar begins to crumple inwards and energy begins to transfer into cross-car load path beneath the occupant .
8.5 ms – Side airbag system fires .
15 ms – Roof begins to absorb part of the impact .
Airbag bursts through seat foam and begins to fill .
17 ms – Cross - car load path and structure under rear seat reach maximum load .
Airbag covers occupant ’s chest and begins to push the shoulder away from impact zone .
20 ms – Door and B - pillar begin to push on front seat .
Airbag begins to push occupant ’s chest away from the impact .
27 ms – Impact velocity has halved from 50 km/h to 23.5 km /h . A “ pusher block ” in the seat moves occupant ’s pelvis away from impact zone .
Airbag starts controlled deflation .
30 ms – The Falcon has absorbed all crash energy .
Airbag remains in place .
For a brief moment , occupant experiences maximum force equal to 12 times the force of gravity .
45 ms – Occupant and airbag move together with deforming side structure .
50 ms – Crash computer unlocks car ’s doors .
Passenger safety cell begins to rebound , pushing doors away from occupant .
70 ms – Airbag continues to deflate .
Occupant moves back towards middle of car .
Engineers classify crash as “ complete ” .
150-300 ms – Occupant becomes aware of collision .
An Illinois legislative committee unanimously voted Thursday to recommend that Democratic Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich be impeached based on allegations that he abused his powers and sold his office to enrich himself .
House Speaker Michael Madigan , a Chicago Democrat , predicted that the full House would impeach Blagojevich as soon as today , the first such action in state history .
If so , his trial would be held in the state Senate , with senators acting as jurors .
A Blagojevich spokesman said the governor would not heed calls to resign before the full House voted .
His press office said in a statement that the panel ’s vote was not a surprise .
“ The outcome was a foregone conclusion , especially when you consider the committee released its report hours before wrapping up testimony .
The governor believes that the impeachment proceedings were flawed , biased and did not follow the rules of law .
. . .
In all , the governor ’s rights to due process were deprived .
When the case moves to the actual Senate , an actual judge will preside over the hearings , and the governor believes the outcome will be much different , ” the statement said .

Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn , who stands to become governor if Blagojevich is removed , praised the committee vote .
“ I think given the overwhelming evidence , it was pretty clear to anyone that this is what the people of Illinois wanted , ” Quinn said .
“ The committee did what the people of Illinois felt was appropriate , and I hope that message gets through to Gov. Blagojevich . ”
Quinn said Blagojevich should look to history and do the right thing .
“ When this happened in 1974 to President Nixon , he voluntarily resigned .
I know the governor is a student of history , and now is the time for him to step aside , ” he said .

The vote by the special House Investigative Committee was 21 to 0 .
The committee based its vote on a lengthy report detailing the governor ’s alleged abuses of power , including that he expanded healthcare without legislative approval , spent state money on useless flu vaccines and refused to release government information to the public .
The list also included allegations of hiring abuses and “ pay - to - play ” activities , in which big contributors often wound up with hefty state contracts .
In addition , the report restates the federal charges against Blagojevich , including the allegation that he sought to sell the Senate seat vacated by President - elect Barack Obama .

From Jocelyn Wildenstein , a US $ 4 million monster , to – who else ? – Michael Jackson , meet these ten plastic surgery addicts , terrible examples of really bad plastic surgery gone wrong .
1 Hang Mioku : the korean plastic surgery addict who injected cooking oil into her own face
One of the most famous cases of awful plastic surgery gone wrong , Hang Mioku , a 48 year - old woman from South Korea , became so addicted to plastic surgery that she was left unrecognisable after her obsession led her to inject cooking oil into her face .
She had her first plastic surgery procedure when she was 28 .
Following operation after operation , her face was eventually left enlarged and disfigured , and the surgeons she visited refused to carry out any more work on her and one suggested that her obsession could be a sign of a psychological disorder .
So Hang resorted to injecting cooking oil into her face .
It became so grotesquely large that she was called “ standing fan ” by children in her neighbourhood – due to her large face and small body .
As Hang ’s notoriety spread she was featured on Korean TV , viewers seeing the report took mercy on her and sent in enough donations to enable her to have surgery to reduce the size of her face .
During the first procedure surgeons removed 60g of foreign substance from Hang ’s face and 200g from her neck .
After several other sessions her face was left greatly reduced but still scarred and disfigured , a true challenge for korean plastic surgery .
2 Jocelyn Wildenstein : a US $ 4 million monster
Known by the press by the nickname of “ The Bride of Wildenstein ” –a reference to The Bride of Frankenstein– , Jocelyn Wildenstein has allegedly spent almost US $ 4,000,000 on cosmetic surgery over the years , ending up as one of the worst and most famous cases of plastic surgery addiction .
But who did that happened ?
Once upon a time , in the late 70 ’s there was a beautiful women named Jocelyn Wildenstein .
Jocelyn really had it made .
She was a fresh - faced mother of two and married to an extremely rich art dealer .
That is until she caught her husband in bed with a 21 year old Russian model .
Now , any normal person would just leave her husband and take all of his money with her , right ?
Not Jocelyn Wildenstein !
Instead she decided to win back her husbands love and make herself more beautiful by going under the knife .
Well , her husband left her anyways , but Jocelyn will always have her plastic surgeon .
3 Michael Jackson : more than 10 nose surgeries
4 Pete Burns : famous singer , spent almost all of his life savings on reconstructive surgery
Does this really need to be explained ?
It ’s incredible to forget how absolutely normal Michael Jackson looked back in the 70’s and 80’s , attractive even , before turning into the sideshow freak that he is today .
He is rumored to have had more than 10 nose surgery procedures on his life .
5 Dennis Avner : the Catman
Pete Burns , former frontman of the British band Dead or Alive –famous for their single “ You Spin Me Round ( Like a Record ) ” – , has had extensive polyacrylamide injections into his lips , along with cheek implants , several nose re-shapings and many tattoos .
He revealed in early 2006 that he had spent almost all of his life savings on eighteen months of reconstructive surgery after a procedure on his lips went horribly wrong .
6 Eric Sprague : the Lizardman
Dennis Avner , also known by “ Catman ” or his native american name of “ Stalking Cat ” , has undergone incredible extensive surgery in order to look like his totem animal , the tiger .
Modifications include extensive tattooing , transdermal implants to allow whiskers to be worn , subdermal implants to change the shape of the face and the filing and shaping of the teeth to make them look more like a tiger’s .
7 Donatella Versace : a caricature of herself
Born Eric Sprague in 1972 , the Lizardman was one of the first people to have a split tongue and in some circles is seen to be wholly responsible for the recent popularity of this particular modification .
This 37 year old man has transformed himself into a reptile via 700 hours of tattooing , five Teflon horns implanted beneath the skin of his eyebrows , filing down of his teeth into sharp fangs , bifurcation of his tongue , and stretching of his septum and earlobes .
8 Jackie Stallone : facelift , brow lift , cheek implants , nose job …
Since taking over for her brother Gianni Versace , platinum blonde fashion designer Donatella Versace has gone through some drastic changes thanks to awful plastic surgery , turning herself into a caricature .
Although nose jobs are usually done to make a nose smaller , Donatella ’s has grown larger over the years .
It is also wider and flatter and slightly crooked , indicating that at least one bad nose job took place .
In addition to her big nose , Donatella also has large lips , like the trout pouts of the Hollywood divas the designer dresses .
Although the fashion icon has always had big lips , the oversized upper lip indicates that fillers , like collagen , have been used liberally .
For a 53 - year old , Donatella ’s skin is very firm , indicating a possible facelift .
She probably also uses dermal injectables like Botox to eliminate wrinkles , even when she smiles .
Her tight face is a strong contrast to the loose skin on the rest of her body .
And yes , Donatella ’s weight loss also revealed her breast implants .
Anything left ?
9 Amanda Lepore : world ’s most famous transexual
The mother of famous actor Silvester Stallone , Jackie was also famous for claiming she can talks to dogs about the future , she also once set up a psychic hotline which would charge callers for advice .
Now she ’s relatively famous for what looks like a little too much plastic surgery , as she has tried everything : facelift , brow lift , cheek implants , nose job and , of course , lip jobs .
10 Michaela Romanini : italian socialite , famous for her collagen abuse
Once a poverty - stricken young boy , Amanda Lepore ‘s countless surgeries have made her one of the world ’s most famous transexuals .
She had her first plastic surgery at the age of 15 , getting a sex change in her last year of high school , and countless surgeries after that .

HP to Use Green Batteries in Notebook Computers
December 10th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
HP fans looking to make their laptops more environmentally - friendly will soon get the chance to upgrade to Boston Power ’s next - generation Sonata Lithium-ion batteries .
The Sonata battery lasts for 1,000 charging cycles ( 3 years ) , compared to the 300 cycle limit of a conventional Li-ion battery .
The powerful battery takes only half an hour to charge up to 80 percent capacity , while conventional batteries take two hours — in other words , the new battery means less waste heat will come from your laptop .
And in case you ’re worried about toxic chemicals , the Sonata does n’t contain cadmium , arsenic , or mercury — chemicals common in laptop batteries .
The battery ’s packaging is also PVC - free .
The Sonata will be available as part of the the HP Enviro Series in early 2009 .

It is not intended to build complex interfaces with full cursor control .
It is oriented towards line - based interfaces .
In a stimulating discussion of love songs and Super Smash Bros . ( we have a crew battle tomorrow ) , my friend brought up a sensitive topic : the Friend Zone .
The mere fact that you are reading this post reveals that you have been trapped at least once in the Friend Zone ’s formidably misleading obstacles — a seemingly endless series of mind games and mind fucks .
But for the more fortunate portion of us , allow me to shed some light onto the darkness that is the Friend Zone .
The Friend Zone is what happens when you forget to let a female know that ( 1 ) you indeed have a penis and that ( 2 ) you do indeed want to stick it inside of her .
Escaping the Friend Zone is a remarkable feat .
Being trapped in the zone is the equivalent of being a gay BFF or , perhaps worse , being “ like a brother to me ! ”
In the Friend Zone , you listen to her problems , you remind her constantly that she ’s beautiful , and you treat her like a queen — because she deserves it .
Basically , being in the Friend Zone is kind of like being in a relationship , except you do n’t get any pussy .
I ’ll expand this description in a later post .
Much to partial disbelief , there are varying degrees of one ’s position in the Friend Zone .
And yes , this means that you may have a better chance at escaping the zone than your competitors .
I ’ve decided to begin my series with an explanation of these different stages .
I now present to you , the Friend Zone Scale .
Stage I : GL HF
This is by far the most difficult stage to be in .
In fact , she may be unaware of your penis .
Incidentally , she may be hanging off of someone else ’s nuts right now .
You have two choices from here : get over her or stop acting like a pussy .
You have probably known her for far too long and she simply can’t see past the history of you acting like a pussy after all of those years / months / weeks / days .
You bake or cook together .
Fully - clothed .
She told her parents that you ’re gay .
Stage II : You ’re an older brother to her
It seems that she may be using you for emotional support .
She probably just got out of a relationship or is pursuing a guy who is not paying attention to her , and she needs verification that she has self - worth .
That verification is you .
Think of it this way : I would n’t suggest getting into a relationship with someone who clearly wants a relationship with someone else .
She begged you to watch He ’s Just Not That Into
You with her and then cried about it because it reminded her of her ex .
She ’s “ not ready for a relationship . ”
Stage III : She enjoys your company
It ’s clear that you and her have had hours of conversations , both online and offline .
A relationship with you has probably crossed her mind a few times .
You ’re teetering on the border of getting into the deep abyss of the Friend Zone and peeking towards the light .
Hang in there .
You went to the Farmer ’s Market with her to buy organic apricots .
You ’ve slept in the same room together — and you were on the floor .
Stage IV : Her friends know about you
She thinks you ’d be a good boyfriend .
However , she is probably hesitating to pull you out of the Friend Zone because she does n’t want things to be “ awkward . ”
She genuinely values the friendship that you two share and thinks that you ’re a genuinely caring guy .
She gives you wake - up calls
She has put make - up on you
Stage V : She has thought about your dick
Listen , she ’s waiting for you to make a move .
If not , she ’s waiting for you to respond to her moves .
Beware of these examples , however , for they could possibly be well - disguised instances of lower stages .
What does she like to talk about ?
Is she mentioning her ex-boyfriend far too often ?
Is she complimenting your V - neck from American Apparel ?
Is she asking you questions that could possibly give you a boner should she whisper them in your ear ?
This is make or break , son .
You bake or cook together .
Scantily clad .
You ’ve slept in the same room together — and cuddled .
Stage VI : ESCAPE FRIEND ZONE NOW !
You ’ve gotten physical , buddy , and it ’s more than just holding hands .
Everyone agrees – she ’s into you .
However , you genuinely do n’t know what to do .
She does n’t recall making out with you when she was drunk ( or pretending to be drunk ) .
She sensually touches your ears , back , arms , neck or knees .
And now the question begs : HOW TO ESCAPE STAGE X ?
I hate to be a tease , but more information will be available in my next post , seeing as how I ’m still in a towel and I ’m late for that thing I need to be at .
Yes , I ’m in a towel .
As a female in a unique position of being non-ugly with boyish interests , I have had the unfortunate opportunity of friend - zoning many , many , many men .
The good news , however , is that I can now pass valuable female - perspective information onto you .
Incidentally , this is merely part one to an x-part series of the Friend Zone Dilemma .
Wearable projection computer project : Internet ‘ sixth sense ’
A group of MIT students have developed a wearable computer that projects its display onto any nearby surface , and is controlled by hand gestures and voice - recognition .
A prototype was demonstrated at TED this week , capable of projecting a watch face onto the user ’s wrist after they trace a circle over it , capturing images framed by their fingers , and pulling up information about an individual and projecting it onto them during conversation .
Video demos after the cut
When he encounters someone at a party , the system projects a cloud of words on the person ’s body to provide more information about him — his blog URL , the name of his company , his likes and interests .
“ This is a more controversial [ feature ] , ” Maes said over the audience ’s laughter .
In another frame , Mistry picks up a boarding pass while he ’s sitting in a car .
He projects the current status of his flight and gate number he ’s retrieved from the flight - status page of the airline onto the card
The students , led by Pranav Mistry , are part of the Fluid Interfaces group at MIT Media Lab ; the prototype they demonstrated consisted of a battery - powered 3 M pico- projector , a cellphone and a webcam , together with four colored Magic Marker lids worn on the fingertips .
The hardware , costing less than $ 350 , can track the lids and interpret the movements according to predefined functions , such as pulling up internet reviews of a book picked up in a store , and projecting them onto the book itself .
The technology , which has been patented , also allows mobile access to email , phone and other communication methods .
A menu can be pulled up via a preset gesture , and then shortcuts – such as tracing an @ symbol to call up email – used to access different functions .

The chart above ( click to enlarge ) shows the annual percent growth in monthly employment ( from the same month in the previous year ) since 2004 , comparing growth in the health care sector to the growth in overall total employment .
Even during the recession , health care employment continues to grow at almost 3 % annually , and there was an increase of 371,600 health care jobs in 2008 .
In contrast , overall job growth has been negative and falling since mid-2008 , with a total job loss in 2008 of almost 2.6 million .
One reason for the continuing growth in health care employment might be provided in this story : " As Retail - Based Clinics Grow , So Do Jobs for Specialty Nurses " :

A pensioner who went to a police HQ over a burglary yards away was sent home - because 14 cops there were playing poker .
Graham Hall , 69 , was told the building was shut - and a guard gave him a fridge magnet with a non-emergency number .
The former financial adviser said : " I 'm flabbergasted .
You can't even report a crime at police HQ .
" A crime was committed on their doorstep but not one person could be bothered to come out to talk to me because they were gambling .
They would rather play cards than catch criminals . "
Graham dialled the fridge magnet number and was told an officer would ring back .
He has heard nothing a week on .
The dad of four discovered the burglary at 6.45 pm at an uninhabited house he owns in Kidlington , Oxon .
A police station 300 yards away was shut because it was after 5 pm , forcing him to try the HQ 150 yards along .
A police spokeswoman said cops were at a poker contest at the HQ 's social club .
They had not been sent out to investigate straight away as it was " a non-dwelling burglary " , she added .
With Google Flu Trends , a project devoted to inferring outbreaks of influenza from search queries , Google has unwittingly hung a big sign on itself advertising services for government surveillance .
Of course , the privacy implications of search engine databases are a longstanding issue .
But the topic tends to be treated as an academic concern of privacy activists or civil libertarians - until some controversy propels it into public awareness .
The investigation itself is laudable .
In sum , an increase in people searching for queries related to flu is likely to signal an outbreak of infection .
Researchers at Google and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have written a paper on how to data - mine search logs for this purpose .
The paper states : " Harnessing the collective intelligence of millions of users , Google web search logs can provide one of the most timely , broad - reaching syndromic surveillance systems available today . "
It would be more accurate , though more disturbing , if the first part of that sentence read : " Harnessing Google 's ability to do extensive real - time monitoring of the search activity of millions of users ... "
At its core , this project is demonstrating how Google 's infrastructure can be used for tracking the population .
The technical problem is independent of social values .
In the same way that a system prohibiting reading forbidden material can be applied to sex or to political dissent , a monitoring system can be applied to the virus of influenza or the virus of democracy .
What 's especially significant here is that Google has in effect created and publicised a working prototype .
Whenever data - mining is discussed , objections are raised regarding the likelihood of false positives and the possibilities of poisoning by saboteurs .
While the researchers acknowledge such potential problems , the overall result is claimed to be useful and worthy of publication in a scientific journal .
It could all be for an extremely good cause .
But it raises the spectre of less than noble future applications .
Two privacy groups , the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) and Patient Privacy Rights , have written to Google detailing concerns focused on whether the aggregate data could be used to identify individuals .
There have been notable incidents where supposedly anonymised datasets have leaked personally identifying information .
EPIC says : " Historically , identification through aggregated data has been subject to abuse ...
Therefore , automatic , permanent , one - way anonymisation of such information is necessary . "
However , the main value of this relatively small but easily graspable individual privacy risk may be in raising awareness of the much larger but more abstract societal surveillance risk .
While people 's health concerns should certainly be treated as confidential , what 's being done here is to find methods for automated mass observation .
In effect , techniques developed to find interests for advertisers are being repurposed .
This is even more worrisome when one considers the implications for electronic health records , an area where Google has been very active - whoever gets to be a standard computerisation technology provider for the health industry will make a fortunes .
There is a standard ideological rant that it's a threat to freedom when government have large databases concerning citizens , but simply good business for corporations to have large databases regarding users .
The problem is that governments can appropriate corporate databases .
Information itself is useless without a means of retrieving and organising it .
That 's a task at which Google excels .
So a deeper problem is not even the database , but the infrastructure to process it .
Which is exactly what Google is building .
There 's no easy solution to this dilemma , as it's the sort of basic technology that can be used for good and evil .
But it 's another reason to be wary of surveillance engines .

Just out of curiosity : who did you hire in final ?
The only super geek that knows how to write unmaintainable obscure , and probably undocumented , code or another one that nicely demonstrate how to write a well architectured , easily maintainable application using only the core 20 % of java API ?
No offense , just curious to know where people think the true value is .
It was not 70 + interviews for just one position .
The interviews were done over a few years for several positions .
Asking questions like this does not decide the outcome of the interview - unless you have 2 possible candidates that are absolutely equal in knowledge and personality .
But it is interesting to see how far their knowledge goes .
However , I stopped asking questions like this a while ago because most candidates already fail at more basic java or general development questions .
Now - a - days programming seems be taught and treated like , say , plumbing , especially since the demand for cheap developers has risen due to the rise of big outsourcing companies .
If you are lucky someone has told them how to do things but very rarely they know why they should do things in a certain way .
And if you ask questions that are more about design and logical thinking rather than java technicalities most of the candidates fail catastrophically .
At least that is my experience .
DUBAI ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama said America was prepared to extend a hand of peace to Iran if it “ unclenched its fist ” and that the time was ripe for Israel and the Palestinians to resume peace negotiations .
Choosing an Arab station for his first formal TV interview as president , Obama also sought to heal U.S. ties with the Arab and Muslim world , telling them “ Americans are not your enemy . ”
During the eight - year administration of former President George W. Bush , U.S. relations with many Arab and Muslim nations were damaged by the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and Bush ’s initial reluctance to push for Israeli - Palestinian peace .
“ It is impossible for us to think only in terms of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict and not think in terms of what ’s happening with Syria or Iran or Lebanon or Afghanistan and Pakistan , ” he told the Dubai - based satellite channel Al Arabiya .
“ It is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran , to express very clearly where our differences are , but ( also ) where there are potential avenues for progress , ” Obama said .
“ If countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist , they will find an extended hand from us . ”
Iran said it awaited changes in U.S. policies toward it .
“ We are waiting for the new American administration to carry out practical changes , ” government spokesman Gholamhossein Elham said according to the ISNA news agency .
“ America should accept that it is a government , not an empire . ”
In an echo of Obama ’s comments , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signaled on Tuesday the administration ’s readiness to talk to Iran , saying Tehran had a “ clear opportunity ” to show the world it is willing to engage .

The Bush administration had pushed for new U.N. sanctions on Iran for failing to suspend a uranium enrichment program .
The United States and Western powers suspect Iran is trying to produce nuclear arms .
Iran says its plans are peaceful .
Obama , who took office on January 20 , quickly named former Senator George Mitchell as Middle East envoy .
Mitchell arrived in Egypt on Tuesday on the first leg of a regional visit .
“ Sending George Mitchell to the Middle East is fulfilling my campaign promise that we ’re not going to wait until the end of my administration to deal with Palestinian and Israeli peace .
We ’re going to start now , ” Obama said .
“ MOMENT IS RIPE ”
He said his administration wanted to begin by listening and talking to those involved without prejudging their concerns .
“ We cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what is best for them , ” he said .
“ But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people .
And that instead , it ’s time to return to the negotiating table . ”
Obama also praised Saudi King Abdullah for the Saudi - sponsored peace initiative , which offers Arab peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from Arab land occupied since 1967 and a just solution for Palestinian refugees .
“ I might not agree with every aspect of the proposal , but it took great courage to put forward something that is as significant as that , ” he said .
Obama acknowledged that the United States had made mistakes but , noting that he had lived in Muslim countries and had Muslim relatives , said he would try to restore that relationship .
“ My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy .
We sometimes make mistakes .
We have not been perfect , ” he said .
“ But ... America was not born as a colonial power , and ... the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago , there ’s no reason why we ca n’t restore that . ”
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al - Faisal welcomed Obama ’s comments to the Muslim world and commitment to Middle East peace , saying Arab states were open to U.S. views on the Saudi peace initiative .
“ Arab states , which are the ones that can decide about the initiative , have no reservations against a constructive dialogue and answering any questions from the U.S. administration about it , ” Prince Saud was quoted as saying by state news agency SPA .
Obama urged Muslims to judge him by his actions , pointing to the decision to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center , where detainees in the U.S. war on terror are held .
He said he also would begin to implement his pledge to draw down troops in Iraq .
But while Arabs have high hopes that Obama will change U.S. policies , analysts said he had yet to spell out how he would achieve a two - state solution and manage the Iraq withdrawal .
Asked about the sharp verbal attacks on him by al Qaeda leaders behind the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States , Obama said it showed “ that their ideas are bankrupt . ”

Gov. Rod Blagojevich , center , leaves his home through a back alley Wednesday a day after he was arrested on federal corruption charges .
CHICAGO  Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said Thursday she was ready to take action to remove Gov. Rod Blagojevich from office following his arrest on corruption charges .
She said her options included asking the Illinois Supreme Court to declare Blagojevich unable to serve and put in Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn as acting governor .
" I am prepared to take action , " Madigan said in an interview on CNN .
CHICAGO : Blot on pride POLITICS BLOG : Latest developments in corruption case FUTURE :
What scandal might mean for Obama Senate seat " The easiest way for us to move on in the state of Illinois is for Governor Blagojevich to do the right thing for the people and to resign , " she said .
" Now , it does n't appear that he has any inclination to do that .
Maybe things will change today or tomorrow . "
Madigan said she " wo n't wait terribly long . "
The attorney general was among a growing number of Illinois politicians trying to force the governor to step down and to strip him of the power to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by President - elect Barack Obama .
Legislative leaders have called a special session for Monday to authorize a special election .
Blagojevich was charged Tuesday with trying to sell the Senate seat , soliciting money from people with state business and pressing the Chicago Tribune to fire editorial writers who had criticized him .
Sheldon Sorosky , Blagojevich 's lawyer , said Tuesday that the governor did nothing wrong .
Quinn , the lieutenant governor , said he believes that the embattled governor will step down .
" If the governor does n't act he will be impeached , " Quinn told NBC's " Today " program .
Quinn also said that if he is installed in the office , he may pick someone to fill the vacated seat rather than wait for a special election .
On Tuesday , a spokesman for Obama said the president - elect believes that Blagojevich should step down Also on Tuesday , U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. denied involvement in the governor 's alleged attempt to sell the open Senate seat .
Jackson , son of the civil rights leader and one of several Illinois Democrats vying for the job , told reporters in Washington on Wednesday he did not offer to raise money for the governor in exchange for the Senate appointment .
James Montgomery Sr. , Jackson 's lawyer , confirmed Jackson is " Senate Candidate 5 . "
The criminal complaint cites a conversation between Blagojevich and aides in which the governor says " Candidate 5 " sent an intermediary to make the offer .
" I reject and denounce pay - to - play politics and have no involvement whatsoever in any wrongdoing , " Jackson said .
He said federal prosecutors told him he is not a target of the investigation .
CORRUPT STATES : North Dakota leads in conviction rate Fallout from the case : • Sen. Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , also called on the governor to resign and refrain from naming anyone to the vacant seat .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , in a letter , warned the Senate might refuse to seat a Blagojevich appointee .
Durbin wants the state Legislature to call a special election , even though it gives the GOP a chance at the seat .
• Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan said Obama " should immediately disclose " communications between his transition team and the governor 's office .
" Obama 's promise of transparency … is now being tested , " he said .
" This Blagojevich scandal opens up a bonanza of opportunities for Republicans in Illinois , " said retiring Rep. Ray LaHood , R - Ill .
Obama has said he had no contact with Blagojevich about the Senate vacancy .
His adviser , David Axelrod , said last month that Obama did speak to Blagojevich about the vacancy but on Tuesday stated he was mistaken and that Obama never spoke " directly " to the governor .
• Blagojevich , released on his own recognizance at a court appearance Tuesday , went to work at his downtown office .
• Bob Greenlee resigned as a deputy governor .
The complaint against Blagojevich identifies " Deputy Governor A " as someone who was deeply involved in a scheme to strong - arm the Tribune .
Greenlee 's attorney , when asked whether his client was the deputy governor , did not dispute it .
David Stetler told the Associated Press the reason behind Greenlee 's resignation " should be obvious . "

WASHINGTON --
Industries from health care to agribusiness to mining that stand to lose under President Barack Obama 's policy agenda are ramping up lobbying campaigns to derail or modify his plans .
The day after Mr. Obama formally laid out his policy goals in his first address to Congress , the former chief executive of HCA Inc. unveiled a $ 20 million campaign to pressure Democrats to enact health - care legislation based on free - market principles .
" What ...
( New York ) - Leading writers , China scholars , lawyers , and human rights advocates from around the world today are releasing a letter to Chinese President Hu Jintao urging the writer Liu Xiaobo 's immediate and unconditional release .
Liu is one of some 300 original signatories of Charter 08 , a call for the rule of law and respect for human rights in China .
A literary critic and former professor of literature , Liu Xiaobo has been held in incommunicado detention since December 8 , 2008 .
Human Rights
Watch has pointed out that the detention of Liu Xiaobo is arbitrary and violates the minimum procedural guarantees specified under Chinese law .
Over 30 signatories of Charter 08 have been questioned , summoned by the police , or put under surveillance since Liu's arrest .
" Liu Xiaobo is the most significant Chinese dissident case in a decade , " said Brad Adams , Asia director for Human Rights Watch .
" Jailing Liu might serve as a warning to other dissidents , but it would also indicate a political hardening that runs against the current aspirations of the Chinese people . "
The list of prominent signatories of the letter to President Hu includes top China academics , legal experts , and writers and Nobel prize winners , including Salman Rushdie , Umberto Eco , Nadine Gordimer , Seamus Heaney , Carlo Ginzburg , Wole Soyinka , and Hari Kunzru .
What is actually working ?
One day credit is tightening , another day itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s easing .
Whatever it is , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not materially positive enough to oil any wheel so it seems .
So , we are back to Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœbeg , borrow , spendÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ , the equation that got us into this mess in the first place .
Reality sucks sometimes ; our problem is , we are not Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœallÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ facing this same reality !
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
The EUR has fallen to a 3 - month low this morning vs. the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ MightyÃ¢â‚
¬Â greenback as traders increased their bets that Trichet and Co. will lower borrowing costs towards 1 % by spring .
The currency did not get a helping hand from S&PÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s who implied that they may cut SpainÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s top AAA long - term sovereign rating .
While the currency remains on the floor , the IMF has added fuel to the fire by stating that Europe is Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœunderestimating Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ the need for fiscal stimulus .
This has prompted Germany to spend EURÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 50b to support EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s largest economy announced late last night .
Once again we are back in Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœbear countryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ ; both equities and commodities are to be sold by investors .
Emerging market currencies continue to lose ground and Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœcarryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trades continue to perform very poorly .
The daily release of bad news is not abating and capital markets continue to price accordingly .
The US$ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.94 % , GBP - 0.91 % , CHF - 0.35 % and lower against JPY +0.07 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.69 % and AUD - 1.39 % .
The loonie remains under intense pressure as commodity prices continue to plummet across the board .
50 % of all Canadian exports are commodity based .
The currency is guilty by its association and proximity to its largest trading partner , the US .
Last weeks data revealed that the Canadian economy is entrenched in the global recession .
Economic reports revealed that Canada not unlike the US , lost - 105 k jobs in 2 - months and this has fully reversed the large late summer employment gains and puts Canadian job losses proportionately in line with its southern neighbor .
Canada ’s unemployment rate now stands at +6.6 % vs. +6.3 % .
The rise was mostly driven by job losses , but the size of the labor force also increased by +12.7 k .
Industry - wide losses in construction led the way as was to be expected .
The sector shed - 44.3 k workers as both residential and non-residential construction continues to deteriorate .
With the housing sector to continue to weaken this year , we can expect to see several more months of job declines .
With oil paring close to 7 % yesterday has traders favor selling the currency on any USD pull backs .
Consensus has the loonie trading under pressure for the remainder of this quarter and backing up towards the 1.2800 level again .
The Australian dollar fell aggressively in the O/N session after an increase in US unemployment numbers last week have signaled a deepening global recession , thus reducing demand for higher - yielding assets .
The AUD $ had comfortably pared all of last weeks gains as the price of commodities continue to trade under pressure and investors once again undertake risk aversion strategies ( 0.6706 ) .
Crude is lower O/N ( $ 36.61 down - 98 c ) .
A fear of a much deeper recession continues to undermine crude prices .
A weakening equity market and rising number of jobless workers have intensified concerns that the recession will cut fuel usage even more .
Demand destruction remains the order of the day .
Oil has been unable to retain last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s earlier gains after the weekly EIA report also took the market by surprise .
The black stuff managed to lose another 7 % yesterday on concerns that output cuts by OPEC will fail to counter a slump in demand .
US supplies have climbed in 13 of the past 15 - weeks as the economy slowed according to the EIA , last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s data showed a bigger than expected increase across the board for crude oil , gas and distillate fuel .
Inventories of oil rose + 6.68 m barrels to +325.4 m , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the highest level in 8 - months ( the market had anticipated an increase of +800 k barrels ) .
Analysts are predicting that oil consumption will drop by +1 m barrels a day as the US , Europe and Japan face their first simultaneous recessions in over 60 - years .
Contango trading has encouraged companies to increase stockpiles if they have available storage ( hence the demand for supertankers to be used as a mobile storage facility ) .
Dealers are encouraged to do so as the price of oil for delivery in 11 - months time is 33 % more than for next month .
Gas stocks rose +3.33 m barrels to +211.4 m barrels vs. an expected +1 m barrels .
Finally distillate supplies ( heat oil and diesel ) jumped + 1.79 m barrels to +137.8 m .
FridayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s jobÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s data will impede future fuel demand as it provides stronger evidence that a deepening recession is occurring globally .
The geo-political issues like the violence in Gaza and natural gas crisis , is no match for demand destruction caused by weakening economies .
Analysts anticipate that we will once again test Dec. lows of around $ 32 on the back of the North American reports been so poor .
Gold prices fell the most in nearly 2 - months yesterday as the greenback advanced vs. the EUR and plummeting energy prices have reduced demand for the yellow metal as a hedge against inflation ( $ 820 ) .
The Nikkei closed 8,413 down - 422 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,622 down - 97 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,353 down - 73 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year Treasury yields eased 13 bp yesterday ( 2.31 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Treasuries advanced especially the short end of the US curve on speculation that US government reports this week will show that US retail sales and consumer prices fell last month .

The simple and painful reality for startups in this economy goes like this :
Survive until things pick up , or die quickly and start over .
Mark Peter Davis at DFJ Gotham makes this point in his recent post , The State of Venture : The Ugly , The Bad And The Good .
In this new economic environment , access to capital will become an increasingly important differentiator .
If venture investing contracts substantially , a strong balance sheet will no longer simply be a means of staying with the pack , it will increasingly become a substantial advantage , enabling some companies to get way out in front of their competition .
Mark points out that companies with solid funding should be thinking big , albeit cautiously .
As competition falters – either showing signs of weakness or dying completely – the companies with solid balance sheets and good funding can execute more aggressively .
That means hiring top talent ( because more of it will be available ) , executing more quickly and playing a louder , more dominant market role .
Ultimately , there are n’t many companies with huge amounts of funding and great balance sheets – especially amongst early startups .
So what are the alternatives ?
Startups can die quickly
In many cases , as Mark points out , this is a blessing in disguise .
The economic downturn forces us to re-examine everything about our businesses and we might not like what we see .
At some point , you have to say , “ Enough is enough . ”
In a recent presentation by Howard Lindzon he pointed out that now is the time to shelve ideas or early stage startups that simply wo n’t work in these economic situations , and revisit them later .
Dying quickly is n’t the worst thing in the world .
Failure is n’t the end of your opportunity as a startup entrepreneur .
And oftentimes it ’s better to die a quick death versus a slow and much more painful one .
Out of the death of one startup , others will be born .
Making the decision to kill your startup is hard .
I do n’t have an easy answer for when and how to do this , although I do think it should be discussed more openly and frequently within the blogosphere , amongst startups , etc .
Startups can survive
The other option is to survive .
It certainly sounds more appealing than dying quickly , and in most cases it is .
Although survival with no chance of success is n’t really survival …
Mark makes an important point in his post :
While I believe the frontrunners will come out of this downturn positioned to win big , the story is n’t entirely bleak for the second and third tier players .
Once the end of the downturn is in sight , corporations will likely exploit the financial woes of startups to make low cost acquisitions .
The hunters will be coming .
For some entrepreneurs this could yield decent ( if not life altering ) returns .
This is absolutely true , and you can see this coming when the economy does pick up .
Of course , we ’re not quite sure when that will be , so banking on surviving as a second or third tier player is a tough bet .
Nevertheless , survival of the “ second or third fittest ” is an option ; especially if you have n’t raised huge amounts of money and can take smaller exits .
I believe this is the route for many startups at this point – especially those that are early stage and not very well capitalized .
You can grow a low cost business , focus in stability , build out some worthwhile and interesting technology , create a small but vocal fan base and survive until the economy picks up .
When it does , the big players will emerge as huge victors , but there will be other companies looking to acquire the second and third tier players to compete with the big winners .
Incidentally , Mark ’s follow - up post is also worth reading , DFJ Gotham Is Actively Investing , Others Should Too .
There are numerous reasons for venture firms to keep investing aggressively :
lower valuations means they ’ll get a bigger piece of the pie
exits are n’t really expected until 2011 - 2012 when ( we assume and hope ! ) the economy is recovering very strongly
opportunities still exist to radically shift and innovate in a number of markets ; the crappy economy does n’t change that fact
Go Big. Die. Or Survive .
In many respects now is the time where you have to make the decision – do we go big , die quickly or try and survive ( without it being a bullshit survival ) ?
The amount of money you have , the current status of your company and many other factors all play a role in making that assessment .

Enabling the SPARQL API
Heh , this was planned as a one - week hack but somehow turned into a full re-write that took the complete December .
Yesterday , I finally managed to tame the semantic bot army and today I 've added a basic RDF editor .
A sponsored version is now online at knowee .
net , a code bundle for self - hosting will be made available at knowee.org tomorrow .
Knowee started as a SWEO project .
Given the insane number of online social networks we all joined , together with the increasing amount of machine - readable " social data " sources , we dreamed of a distributed address book , where the owner does n't have to manually maintain contact data , but instead simply subscribes to remote sources .
The address book could then update itself automatically .
And - in full SemWeb spirit- you 'd get access to your consolidated social graph for re-purposing .
There are several open - source projects in this area , most notably NoseRub and DiSo .
Knowee is aiming at interoperability with these solutions .
For a webby address book , we need to pick some data formats , vocabularies , data exchange mechanisms , and the general app infrastructure : I 'm still working on a solution for access control , the current Knowee version is limited to public data and simple , password - based access restrictions .
OAuth is surely worth a look , although Knowee 's use case is a little different and may be fine with just OpenID + sessions .
Another option could be the impressive FOAF +SSL proposal , I 'm not sure if they 'll manage to provide a pure - PHP implementation for non-SSL - enabled hosts , though .
This is a quick walk - through to introduce the current version .
Log in with your ( ideally non -XRDS ) OpenID and pick a user name .
Knowee only supports a few services so far .
Adding new ones is not hard , though .
You can enable the SG API to auto - discover additional accounts .
Hit " Proceed " when you 're done .
You can specify whether to make ( parts of ) your consolidated profile public or not .
During the initial setup process , this screen will be almost empty , you can check back later when the semantic bots have done their job .
Hit " Proceed " .
The Dashboard shows your personal activity stream ( later versions may include your contacts ' activities , too ) , system information and a couple of shortcuts .
The contact editor is still work in progress .
So far , you can filter the list , add new entries , and edit existing contacts .
The RDF editor is still pretty basic ( Changes will be saved to a separate RDF graph , but deleted / changed fields may re-appear after synchronization .
This needs more work . )
The editor is schema - based and supports the vocabularies mentioned above .
You 'll be able to create your own fields at some later stage .
It 's already possible to import FOAF profiles .
Knowee will try to consolidate imported contacts so that you can add data from multiple sources , but then edit the information via a single form .
The bot processor is extensible , we 'll be able to add additional consolidators at run-time , it only looks at " owl:sameAs " at the moment .
In the " Settings " section you 'll find a form that lets you activate a personal SPARQL API .
You can enable / protect read and / or write operations .
The SPARQL endpoint provides low - level access to all your data , allows you to explore your social graph , or lets you create backups of your activity stream .
That 's more or less it for this version .
You can always reset or delete your account , and manually delete incorrectly monitored graphs .
The knowee . net system is running on the GoGrid cloud , but I 'm still tuning things to let the underlying RDF CMS make better use of the multi-server setup .
If things go wrong , blame me , not them .
Caching is not fully in place yet , and I 've limited the installation to 100 accounts .
Give it a try , I 'd be happy about feedback .

Parents Consider Legal Action After Autistic Girl , 8 , Arrested at School Parents say daughter only got violent after teachers physically restrained her .
Jan. 14 , 2008  --
The mother of an 8 - year - old autistic girl who was arrested after a scuffle with her teachers said it was horrifying to watch her daughter be led away in handcuffs from her northern Idaho elementary school .
Police in Bonner County , Idaho , charged the girl , Evelyn Towry , with battery after the arrest Friday at Kootenai Elementary School .
Even though prosecutors dismissed the case Tuesday , the family is considering legal action against the school .
They say their daughter was physically restrained to the point of causing bruises and is now tormented by memories of the incident .
Spring
Towry said she got to the school Friday just in time to see 54 - pound Evelyn -- who was diagnosed at age 5 with Asperger 's Syndrome , a high functioning form of autism -- being walked to a police car with two officers at her side .
" She started screaming ' Mommy , I do n't want to go !
What are batteries ?
What are batteries ? ' "
Towry said .
" She did n't even know what she was arrested for . "
Towry , who lives in Ponderay , said Evelyn told her that she had been refused entry into a school Christmas party that had been delayed until after the holidays because of a string of snow days , because she refused to take off her beloved " cow costume " -- a hoodie with cow ears and a tail .
Towry said Evelyn , who loves Spongebob Squarepants , told her she was put in a separate classroom away from the party , but when she tried to leave , the teachers told her to stay put .
Evelyn did not listen , Towry said , and the adults physically restrained her .
" She reacted in a violent way to the physical restraint , " Towry said .
Towry said her daughter demonstrated for her how she was held down by her arms and legs .
And Towry videotaped the thumb - sized bruises she says were left on Evelyn's legs from the incident .
" She said ' I was very scared , ' " Towry said .
" She told me she was being hurt . "
Dick Cvitanich , superintendent of the Lake Pend Oreille School District , which includes the school where Evelyn was a student , said the school called police because " there was escalating behavior that resulted in what we perceived to be an assault on staff . "
At a hearing on the case Tuesday , the prosecutor " said that he did in't think at this time it would be beneficial to pursue it becauase of her age and , of course , her condition , " Towry said .
Evelyn was at court for the hearing , but " she did n't exactly know what was going on , " Towry said .
Cvitanich said Evelyn 's outburst Friday was the culmination of a series of incidents " that demanded staff intervention . "
" It 's definitely not typical , " he said of the decision to call police on a child as young as Evelyn , " and not something we particularly want to do or like to do . "
Inappropriate Reaction From School Officials ?
The school 's response to Evelyn's outburst and the string of events that led to it were completely inappropriate , says Dr. Pauline Filipek , associate professor at the University of California , Irvine , and pediatric nurse practitioner Teri Book , who share a practice specializing in pediatric neurology .
Book , the mother of a 17 - year - old daughter with Asperger 's , said children with high - functioning autism create the illusion that they are capable of communicating in the same way as children who do not have developmental disabilities .
In reality , Book said , they may have an animalistic " fight or flight " mentality when it comes to confrontation .
Many have " tactile defensiveness , " meaning they are hyper - sensitive to any type of unwanted physical contact .
Filipek said similar incidents with autistic children are not uncommon , noting that one of her patients was recently ejected from his synagogue for attacking other children .
But charging Evelyn with battery , she said , implied that she intended to hurt her teachers when Evelyn's violent response to being restrained was a " gut - level " reaction .
" It really concerns me , to be perfectly blunt , that the school does not understand autism any better than that , " Filipek said .
Cvitanich said Kootenai Elementary School includes a mix of mainstream and special education classes for children with disabilities .
Children with severe disabilities , he said , are taught in a specialized program that has a smaller student - teacher ratio .
" They 're mainstreamed as much as possible , " he said .
Towry said her daughter did n't even meet the minimum age requirement of 10 to be booked at the county juvenile detention center .
Bonner County Police Lt. Ror Lakewold said the police report indicated the child -- who he declined to name because of her age -- " hit , kicked and spit on teachers . "
Lakewold said there was also a complaint that the child grabbed a teacher in a " sexually sensitive place , " not in a sexual way , but to cause pain .
Towry said that complaint stemmed from Evelyn pinching her teacher 's breast , but she believes Evelyn was n't aiming for any spot in particular .
She was just fighting to be let loose .
" Teachers and the principal wished to pursue charges because they felt there were ongoing problems and this was the only way to resolve it , " Lakewold said .
But Towry said her daughter thinks she got into so much trouble simply because she did n't want to take off her cow costume .
When asked what she likes best about school , Evelyn responded quickly and emphatically .
" Nothing , " she said .
" I do n't like school . "
And Towry said Evelyn wo n't be going back to Kootenai Elementary School , where she has been suspended for between two and 10 days .
" I fear for her safety and mental well - being , " she said .
They have n't decided yet if Evelyn's 6 - year - old sister , who does not have a developmental disability , will remain there or be transferred along with Evelyn .
Nothing formal has been filed yet , but she and her husband are considering legal action , Towry said .
" I would like them to learn a lesson that they should not treat children with disabilities in this manner , " she said .
There 's a lot of children with autism in the world now , she pointed out , and school officials need to learn how to properly discipline them .
Raising a Child With Asperger's
Towry said there was no indication there was anything wrong with Evelyn , the third of her four children , when she was a baby .
" All she really wanted from me as a baby was to nurse , " Towry said , adding that Evelyn spoke early , walked early and hit all of her other developmental goals either on time or ahead of schedule .
Towry said she and her husband started getting calls about Evelyn's behavior when she was in kindergarten , before they moved to Ponderay .
School officials told them the little girl would act out by making animal noises or stomping her feet .
" I guess I probably knew there was something wrong with her , " Towry said .
" When you 're a parent it 's difficult to think there 's anything wrong with your child . "
But it was n't until they moved to Ponderay and put Evelyn into kindergarten at Kootenai that they got a diagnosis .
Towry said she was called to the school on Evelyn's first day when her teacher said the girl began acting out in class , again making animal noises among other behaviors .
When the Towrys took the teacher 's recommendation and had their daughter tested , they were shocked by the diagnosis .
" It scared me , " Towry said .
" I had no idea what Asperger 's Syndrome was . "
In Towry 's mind at the time , autistic children drooled , were disconnected , did n't talk , did n't communicate .
And none of that was Evelyn .
Towry said Evelyn is n't a perfect child at home .
She sometimes gets into shoving matches or the like with her younger sister over sibling rivalry - type issues , but Towry said those situations are easily diffused with words and have never risen to the level of what Evelyn and police say occurred Friday at Kootenai Elementary School .
" She was not a bad kid , " Towry said .
When the universe was still young , they were already dying .
The first stars ever to grace the cosmos with light were brutish monsters , so the story believed by most astronomers goes , lumbering clouds of hydrogen and helium hundreds of times more massive than the Sun .
They lived fast and bright and died hard , exploding or collapsing into massive black holes less than a billion years after the Big Bang , never to be seen again .
But they might have left something behind , a buzz of radio waves emitted by high - energy particles spit from the doomed gas swirling around those black holes .
Has that buzz , a cry from the vanished ancestors of our Sun , now been heard ?
That is at least one “ wildly speculative ” explanation , said Alan Kogut of the Goddard Space Flight Center , for a mysterious radio static that seems to pervade the universe .
He led a team that discovered the signal accidentally while scanning the skies in July 2006 with a set of sensitive radio receivers called Arcade lofted 21 miles high on a balloon .
The signal manifests itself as a puzzling excess at certain frequencies of a fog of microwaves that permeates the cosmos and is probably left over from the Big Bang itself .
It suggests that something is pumping large amounts of extra energy  about six times more than can be accounted for by all the galaxies known and unknown  into the universe .
It is simply stunning that 44 states are facing shortfalls either for this fiscal year , or will come up short in 2010 or 2011 .
This puts virtually the entire country in a difficult financial situation .
It is hard to understand how the media feels that the federal government is somehow better able to get money from people than states .
The federal government ’s largest income source is the federal income tax ; yet this is income from employees in those same states were fiscal problems are running deep .
The government is also going to have a challenging time taxing someone with no job right ?
The combined budget gaps for the remainder of this fiscal year and then those of 2010 and 2011 are a stunning $ 350 billion .
This number is simply jaw dropping and Wednesday ’s horrific retail sales numbers tell us that this recession is already going to be the worst since World War II and possibly since the Great Depression .
First , let us take a look at the situation on a map :
Source : Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
You ’ll notice that the only state with a sizable population without a budget shortfall is Texas .
The rest of the country is virtually in the same predicament .
You also need to remember that many states project these figures .
That is , many are probably too optimistic in their assessments .
The retail numbers that came out today tell us that many states are going to be dealing with a horrible budget situation .
That is why in the upcoming fiscal stimulus package there is a large portion dedicated to state relief .
Looking at the data , it looks like many states are just too optimistic and are betting on the 2nd half recovery which will not happen .
This crisis runs deep and the actions taken by the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury put our U.S. dollar at risk .
If there is a run on the dollar , it will leave us as a nation with very few options .
State and local governments stand to receive $ 160 billion in federal aid with the new stimulus plan .
But you have to ask where is this money coming from ?
Printing money .
I ’ve combined the state data into a list to make it more viewable .
Let us break down the problems by state for the 2009 fiscal year :
First , 4 states with the most dire housing markets those of California , Arizona , Nevada , and Florida made the top 12 on the list .
In fact , the number one state and most populace state in our nation California has the most troubling housing market in the nation that wo n’t see a bottom for many more years .
Florida has a similar makeup to California in that it went down the path of toxic mortgages that are now going to be setting on new terms at the most dire time in our fragile economy .
Even should the states receive $ 160 billion from the historical stimulus plan , that will only address this current fiscal year .
As analyst estimate , we are expecting additional fiscal shortfalls in 2010 and 2011 which will be on par or even worse than the current situation .
Is the federal government prepared to do another major fiscal program when this occurs ?
States with Highest GDP and Largest Population in Worst Shape
In a previous article I discussed that 40 percent of our country ’s GDP comes from 5 states .
Most of the population lives in these states as well but the important thing to note is that most of these states are also running with the deepest budget problems including California and Florida .
Here is a look at employment situation in these states :
What people tend to forget is that these states have large consumers .
So with retail sales falling off a cliff , how is this going to impact workers across state lines that ship merchandise to these locations ?
We are all connected .
In fact , that is why $ 50 trillion in global wealth has evaporated since this financial crisis started .
Here are more estimates put out with the assumption that the economy improves in the second half of 2009 :
Source : Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
I really do n’t see the stock market popping back up and we are now off 9 % in only 6 sessions .
This again reinforces the notion that market volatility is supremely high in unhealthy markets .
Until market volatility stabilizes , we can expect more of the same .
Keep in mind that many states rely on state income taxes which many people are gearing up for in the next few months and states are going to find the following :
( a) Drop in personal state income tax revenues
( b) Capital gains falling off a cliff
( c) Continued weak sales revenue
This is going to stun states on the downside .
Expect states to have a fuller picture by the end of April .
In addition , many states are already exhausting unemployment insurance so instead of money coming in , it is going out .
This is a recipe for a long and prolonged recession which will be more like a minor depression .
State Income Taxes
Some states have no personal income tax which on a plus side draws more employers but also puts a noose on services for their population .
In challenging times these states have fewer revenue sources to draw upon .
Here is a list of those states with no personal income tax :
* Source : CNN Money
Then you have states with high sales taxes and these states normally bet on good times always remaining .
These states will face major gaps as we now see that retail sales falling for 6 straight months and by big drops is going to choke off another revenue stream :
So here you ’ll see a state like Texas with no personal income tax but a relatively high sales tax .
With retail sales faltering even more resilient states will start feeling the pinch .
The bottom line is the places to find money are running out .
We will need to cut back as a nation .
We simply have no choice .
Sure the U.S. Treasury and Fed can run the printing presses but this will do little good .
The fiscal situation of most 50 states are deeply troubling .
The aggregate of the 50 states is our country .
You will need to prepare for a challenging few years .
Simple things you can do is stay away from debt , think twice about common mainstream investing ideas , and save money .
These are simple steps .
Our government is still in that spending mode even though they are asking of you to be prudent .

Dogbert the financial adviser Dogbert :
You should invest all of your money is diseased livestock .
It would be unwise to invest in one sick cow , but if you aggregate a bunch of them together the risk goes away .
It 's called math .
The boss : Suddenly I feel all savvy .
In November , not two weeks after winning the election and still two months from becoming commander in chief , Barack Obama brought the government into the 21st century .
Or at least that was what we were told when he released his first Web video address as president - elect .
The clip , billed by some as a modern fireside chat , was embedded as a YouTube video on Change.gov , the incoming administration 's Web site .
Sitting in a leather chair , framed slightly off center from his chest up , Obama delivered a three - minute talk on the economic crisis , vlog style .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
The video quickly racked up hundreds of thousands of views , and within a few days hundreds of blogs were linking to it .
Obama 's foray into viral video , the story went , heralded the beginning of a new era in government communication and transparency — " Franklin Roosevelt 2.0 , " in the words of The Huffington Post .
The Washington Post proclaimed the advent of the " YouTube presidency . "
It was n't long , however , before savvy observers noted what was missing from this and other Obama videos : the chance for ordinary citizens to talk back .
The campaign initially disabled the comment function on YouTube and prevented response videos from appearing alongside .
A YouTube video without comments , some pundits groused , is more like a monologue than a chat , fireside or not .
" I do n't see how one - way messages provide any more transparency for the work of the White House or government than the current old - style radio addresses , " blogged Ellen Miller , director of the Sunlight Foundation , a government - transparency watchdog group .
" Is Obama ready , " challenged TechCrunch , " to be a two - way president ? "
Of course , Obama 's transition team had good reasons for disabling responses .
For starters , YouTube comments are typically the intellectual equivalent of truck - stop graffiti .
( When the team belatedly allowed comments a couple of weeks later , the site was flooded with insights like " USA susks . " )
Also , his team would have zero control over the potentially critical or embarrassing response videos that users would post next to the address .
The real reason , however , was that Obama was n't actually trying to have a conversation with Americans via YouTube .
Like every president before him , he was simply harnessing the latest tools to talk to them , one - way .
Technophiles who watched the campaign closely expected more , and now they are putting pressure on the White House to govern with unparalleled transparency and citizen interaction .
Dan Froomkin of the Niemen Watchdog Journalism Project and The Washington Post summed up expectations in a blog post calling for Obama to embrace " wiki culture " in which " major policy proposals have public collaborative workspaces . "
Obama has himself to blame for raising such expectations .
During the campaign , he embraced every form of social media .
At My.BarackObama.com , supporters could create profiles , talk to each other , and — by election day — plan some 200,000 offline dinners and living room fund - raisers .
Users could log in from home to get lists of swing - state voters to telephone ; this generated 3 million calls in the final four days of the race .
Those efforts were combined with massive database - crunching to identify potential voters who could be approached door - to - door by last - minute canvassers , myself included .
As for John McCain 's efforts , well , he did n't really have any .
According to Andrew Rasiej and Micah Sifry , cofounders of the Personal Democracy Forum and the blog TechPresident , Obama had four times the number of Facebook supporters , 24 times the Twitter devotees , and three times the visitors to his site in the final campaign week .
The public watched about 15 million hours of Obama campaign videos on YouTube .
Along the way , Obama collected 13 million email addresses , more than a million cell phone numbers , and a half - billion dollars in online donations .
There 's also another reason to expect a tech - driven presidency : Obama promised it .
He said he would expand government transparency by putting more data up on the Web , streaming meetings live , and letting the public comment on most legislation for five days before he signs it .
He said he would bring blogs , wikis , and social networking tools with him into the executive branch — all overseen by a new national chief technology officer .
Indeed , Obama 's transition site , Change.gov , offers glimmers of a potential digital presidency with its YouTube addresses , issue - based discussion forums , and inside - the - transition videos featuring future cabinet members responding to comments .
But turning his innovative campaign and transition into Government 2.0 wo n't be easy .
The nimble Obama startup is about to be absorbed into a stodgy , technologically backward behemoth : the federal government .
Ahead are bureaucratic obstacles the campaign never imagined , along with the political land mines that transparency brings .
Obama will have to preserve the enthusiasm of his supporters while engaging the larger group of people who either did n't vote for him or did n't vote at all .
His task is to rebuild the personal connection that supporters felt they had with Obama the candidate , assuring them that he is listening to them — without being deafened by the cacophony .
If he can do that , Obama can alter how the government engages its citizenry and accomplish what he really cares about : his own policy goals .
Building that intimacy from the Oval Office will be a delicate and complex task , and just letting " AcidTrout " respond to a YouTube address with " Who 's the black guy ? ! ? " is n't going to do it .
" One of the things that gives me ulcers is that there are a lot of high expectations , " says an Obama aide .
" But we 're going to have to change how government thinks about the Internet before we can do the things we want to do . "
Still , Macon Phillips , the campaign 's deputy director of new media , who has served in a similar role for the transition , warns : " Day one is going to be a lot different than perhaps day 100 . "
The basement of the General Services Administration building in Washington , with its maze of identical hallways and frosted glass doors , reeks of generic federal bureaucracy .
But if the new administration plans to reboot the system , it will find a pair of guides here in Bev Godwin and Sheila Campbell , cheerful doyens of the executive branch 's Web strategy .
Godwin , director of USA.gov , the federal government 's all - purpose information Web portal , and Campbell , head of the government 's Web Best Practices Team , know every manacle and chain shackling the government to the 20th century .
In a drab conference room one afternoon in late November , they discussed their optimism — and detailed their concerns .
For starters , the federal government operates more than 24,000 separate sites , many of them years out of date .
" Nobody stepped back and asked strategically , how do we do this ? "
Godwin says .
" Whenever there is a new initiative or program , they put up a new Web site . "
And the first thing they usually do on that site , she says , is post a bandwidth - hogging picture of the bureaucrat in charge .
Godwin and Campbell have been pushing government agencies to treat citizens more like customers , rebuilding their sites to help visitors do things like find loans or obtain passports — rather than serve as static repositories for press releases and personnel photos .
" At Housing and Urban Development , for example , one of the missions is to reduce homelessness , " Godwin says .
" If you go to HUD .gov , can you find shelter ?
The answer is no . "
If the government can improve itself in these little ways , they say , great .
Do n't worry about trying wild stuff , like setting up federal social networks .
Many agencies bar employees from even looking at sites like Facebook at work , much less building their own versions .
Progress has been achingly slow .
There have been some notable exceptions — like a blog on the Transportation Security Administration Web site , open to comments and manned by five agency staffers , and NASA . gov 's numerous social media initiatives , including Twitter feeds from 20 missions and projects .
But the successes are rare and isolated .
" We know that there are a lot of people advocating for more open government , " Godwin says .
" We 're saying , absolutely , put the data out there .
But I think we have to be realistic . "
For example , many of Obama 's online campaign techniques would be impeded by a collection of obscure and well - intentioned rules .
Amendments to the 1973 Rehabilitation
Act , for example , require that all government Web content be made reasonably accessible — in real time — to disabled users .
Also , six months of negotiations between the General Services Administration and Google to establish a federal YouTube channel have stalled over similarly intricate legal issues .
Meanwhile , a Clinton - era law called the Paperwork Reduction
Act requires that an agency undergo a laborious approval process any time it " surveys " more than 10 people .
The result : " Agencies tend to avoid doing these kind of surveys , " Godwin says .
Would having users submit information to a social network or wiki count as a survey ?
Nobody knows .
Even triumphs like Obama 's 2006 Google for Government bill , cosponsored with Republican senator Tom Coburn , have been caught up in red tape .
The bill led to the creation of FedSpending.org , a site allowing the public to track federal contracts and grants .
Instead of building it in - house , the Office of Management and Budget decided to license something similar from a nonprofit watchdog group , OMB Watch — for just 4 percent of what the government had expected to spend .
It was a striking victory for government efficiency , but the process behind the scenes " was extremely difficult , " says Gary Bass , executive director of OMB Watch .
After floating the idea of donating the system to OMB ( " the government can't take things for free , " Bass quickly learned ) , the nonprofit had to sign on as a subcontractor and undergo three rounds , and six wasted months , of bidding before the deal was complete .
Changes to what is effectively the president 's homepage , WhiteHouse.gov , will encounter similar obstacles .
David Almacy , a PR executive and new media consultant at Waggener Edstrom who served as the Bush administration 's White House Internet director from 2005 to 2007 , recalls that following Hurricane Katrina , he posted the transcript of a speech to the site .
In the text , where Bush had directed people to Redcross.org , Almacy helpfully inserted a hyperlink .
" Within a few hours , " Almacy says , " I got a call from the White House general counsel 's office saying I needed to take out the link . "
Some federal government Web pages , it turns out , are virtually barred from linking to nongovernmental sites to avoid the appearance of endorsing one product or organization over another .
The incoming administration is still working to assess the implications of the Presidential Records Act , the post - Nixon legislation requiring the preservation of all White House written communications .
But that means that once any page goes up on the White House site , it can't be altered , only archived and replaced , greatly slowing down the process of modifying and enhancing pages .
The Obama team was able to sidestep these kinds of troublesome rules on Change.gov , in part because , as a quasi - governmental site , it 's not subject to executive - branch restrictions .
They were able to post videos on YouTube , link to outside sites , and even publish content under a Creative Commons license , allowing it to be freely shared .
When he does arrive at the White House , Obama or his CTO can lift some of the Internet restrictions with the stroke of a pen .
Others will require congressional action or clever technology .
Even if Obama 's tech team gets a free hand to rework the federal webosphere , things can still go awry .
Take the 2006 race of Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick .
Both David Axelrod , Obama 's top campaign strategist , and David Plouffe , his campaign manager , worked for Patrick , a little - known candidate who used Internet - driven grassroots support to win .
In a precursor to My.BarackObama .com , the Patrick campaign placed the state 's voter list on its
Web site , allowing its supporters to download phone numbers and call neighbors .
" We believed in people 's ability to organize themselves and get involved , " says Charles SteelFisher , who ran the campaign 's Web operation .
No We Can't Barack Obama wants to transform the way the White House connects with the public .
But there are plenty of obstacles standing in his way .
A Ban on Endorsements Since the government cannot endorse commercial private organizations , some federal Web pages cannot link externally .
Restrictions on Revisions The Presidential Records
Act requires the preservation of all written communications , which limits Web page modification .
Survey Rules
A detailed approval process is required to " survey " more than 10 people .
Soliciting user input may fall into this category .
Access for the Disabled The Rehabilitation
Act requires that all government Web content be made reasonably accessible to those with disabilities .
The US Constitution The First Amendment 's prohibitions on restricting speech may limit the federal government 's ability to filter user comments .
Purchasing Rules Federal agencies must follow contracting rules when they make commercial software purchases costing more than a certain amount .
License Agreements
The Feds can't draw on content from sites like YouTube that require terms - of - service agreements based on state laws .
After the election , the governor 's team launched DevalPatrick.com to keep supporters engaged .
On a MyIssue page , registered commenters could propose , comment on , and vote for legislative ideas .
But the administration was immediately blasted when a database feature designed to verify Massachusetts residency was alleged ( incorrectly ) to reveal unlisted phone numbers .
The privacy flap lured a collection of trolls and conspiracy theorists to the site , crowding out earnest discussion on gambling bills and income taxes with 9/11 chatter and religious debates .
Critics , meanwhile , said that Patrick 's efforts were less about engaging the public than about running a permanent online campaign .
Eventually Patrick 's
Web site recovered , developing a more sophisticated way of moderating comments and creating forums around the governor 's plans to reduce property taxes and add public kindergarten programs .
The site also allowed people to create grassroots communities to work on issues they cared about .
Still , the public is n't exactly burning up the site :
The leading vote - getter , a bill to promote fathers ' custody rights in divorce cases , had just 1,100 tallies as of mid-December .
Offshore wind power , meanwhile , was losing , 16 votes to 15 .
Obama 's team has moved carefully as it transitions from campaigning to governing .
Between two wars and an economy in shambles , building an Oval Office social network has not topped the priority list .
" Day one , do we need a White House My.BarackObama ?
I do n't think so , " says the Obama aide , who was required by the transition press office to speak anonymously .
" It 's more important to step back and ask , what are the goals for the White House ?
And I think that making the government more accountable and transparent is more important than getting people to act . "
To that end , the transition team served up small accountability stuff first .
Change .gov supplemented Obama 's weekly YouTube addresses with periodic videos from inside the transition process , everything from staff meetings to vlog - type updates from advisers .
In early December , Obama 's public director of liaison and intergovernmental affairs announced — via video — a Change.gov feature called Your Seat at the Table , through which the transition would post every document received from every interest group and outside person throwing it advice .
Users were allowed to comment next to the documents , while the Open for Questions feature let them submit and vote on questions for the transition team .
The latter experiment illustrated the double - edged nature of feedback when the Senate - seat - selling scandal involving Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich broke .
Supporters began flagging related questions " inappropriate , " and then Obama staffers buried the queries .
ABCNews.com jumped on the story and the apparent hypocrisy .
Obama Transition Web Site ' Open for Questions ' — Except on Blagojevich read the headline .
NEW YORK - Watch out Las Vegas : New York City wants to become the new No. 1 place to tie the knot .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg has given City Hall 's famously gritty marriage bureau a gleaming makeover , with fewer lines , more space to take photographs , video screens to monitor wait times , and wedding chapels with gauzy curtains and walls painted in muted tones .
And in case the newlyweds - to - be forget any essentials , the space features a shop that sells flowers , disposable cameras , tissues , hairspray , and sparkly fake diamond rings for $ 9 each .
The sleek 24,000 - square - foot space opens officially on Monday , replacing a grubby , cramped , poorly lit office .
It is designed to put some glamour into City Hall weddings while bringing more tourism dollars to the city .
" We want to be the wedding destination of the world , " said Deputy Mayor Patti Harris .
In 2008 , the city issued nearly 70,000 marriage licenses , and is set on competing with places like Las Vegas , which tops the list .
There may be an opening now , though , as business appears to be dropping there .
Clark County , where Las Vegas is located , issued 95,888 licenses in 2008 - its lowest number in 15 years , according to figures provided by a county spokesman .
Couples seeking to say their vows before the city clerk in New York will now do so in an ornate lower Manhattan building that dates to 1929 .

2008 will go down in history as the worst global market for countless investments since the Great Depression .
It was significant even with the late rally which occurred after the November bottom .
What this signifies is that market volatility a sign of a very unhealthy marketplace will continue in 2009 .
Yet the more important point to consider is that the Federal Reserve headed by Ben Bernanke and the U.S.
Treasury which will be under new leadership soon , have been showing no signs that they are interested in preserving the value of the U.S. Dollar ( USD ) .
This is n’t simply a conjecture but is based on facts .
When Ben Bernanke was quoted as throwing dollars from helicopters what he meant is he had no regard for maintaining the actual value of the USD .
What he was discussing is battling the menace that is deflation .
Bernanke is an expert regarding the Great Depression .
I ’m not sure that when he took the Federal Reserve chairman position did he realize he was actually going to have to face a situation which would put his theory into practice .
What we are facing is deflation and we have not seen prices drop this fast since the Great Depression :
That is why we are already dealing with the prospect that this recession will have deep impacts like nothing we have seen since World War II .
The fact that consumer prices have been falling over the past 4 months is significant .
This is not a one month event .
We have seen incredible drops over this time :
August 2008 : -0.1
September 2008 : 0.0
October 2008 : - 1.0
November 2008 : - 1.7
The major question is will this continue .
Most of the recent historical drops have to do with the bubble in oil bursting and automotive sales simply falling off a cliff :
* Source : Suddendebt.blogspot.com
The above chart in automotive sales is extremely telling .
Sales have fallen off a cliff .
What has occurred is we have spent our future today .
That is , we have enough cars floating in the marketplace to satisfy years of demand .
That is something that is being missed with the auto bailouts .
One part is yes , American automakers have missed the boat in creating cars people want to buy .
Yet the bigger problem is people simply have no money to buy any additional cars unless more unhealthy credit is extended .
This is something that the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve would love to see happen .
Every action they have taken comes at the cost of individual financial success .
They are purposely making it useless to save money .
At least , that is the psychological warfare they are trying to do .
How so ?
First , you drive interest rates so low that it is almost pointless to save :
The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at historical lows for this entire decade .
Alan Greenspan was the first to take rates to historical lows and was only beaten by his predecessor in Ben Bernanke .
This is problematic .
One primary reasons the housing bubble took off for so many years was the fact that credit was flooded into the system .
This of course came at the expense of the U.S. Dollar :
Since 2000 the USD has fallen by nearly 20 percent .
That is significant in terms of a country ’s currency .
As you will also notice in the chart above , we had a bounce from recent lows that has increased the value of the USD by roughly 10 percent .
Why the sudden jump ?
The fact that the USD was up in 2008 is by no means any help by the Federal Reserve or U.S. Treasury .
The reason the USD rallied last year was the destruction of the decoupling myth .
What it turned out was other countries around the world had equally bad or even worse balance sheets than the US .
So a flock to safety occurred .
In dire times the USD still holds that throne .
Even with negative rates on treasuries , people still felt the need to store their money in the USD .
During this time Ben Bernanke manipulated the effective funds rate to go from 3.94 percent in January of 2008 to our recent zero percent .
We have never seen it this low since the Great Depression .
Keep in mind that it would be very simple for our government agencies to increase the value of the USD .
All they would need to do is to raise rates to attract more capital in the system .
Capital , not devaluing the currency .
But that is the least of their worries .
What they want is for people to spend more and more .
That is why credit and debt is flooding the system :
This is an important chart .
First , the U.S. consumer is tapped out .
They are carrying roughly $ 14 trillion in debt with auto loans , student loans , mortgage debt , and credit card debt .
The spike highlighted in red above is banks keeping additional funds in excess reserves .
This is money that they can lend without putting their reserve limits at risk .
Yet they are not .
Why ?
Look at the blue line .
If you were a bank , would you lend to a consumer market with nearly $ 14 trillion in debt ?
Of course not .
Yet the Federal Reserve somehow thinks this is the solution to our problems .
Give banks which were at the center of creating this mess access to more funds at the expense of taxpayers .
The Fed is already pushing the limits on its own books putting nearly $ 3 trillion of questionable assets on its books .
This housing bubble has its roots in 1979 and only took off starting a decade ago .
From every early indication we are getting , the Fed is determined to keep this gig going .
What this means , is hard assets like gold will probably have another positive year .
By the way , gold was another winner in 2008 even after tanking .
The reason for gold is more basic .
Where else will people store their money .
In zero percent treasuries ?
Globally ?
Under the mattress ?
It seems like gold will be one of the few last spots .
The Fed and U.S. Treasury seem to indicate further policies that will slam the dollar .
Yet here is another problem .
Other global central banks are doing the same thing which almost negates our own actions .
The race to zero interest rate policy has started .
The U.S. Treasury and Fed which have a responsibility in protecting a stable dollar are set to destroy it .

Politics is not the only realm that makes strange bedfellows :
WSJ : In the race to train America's " green - collar " work force , a group composed mostly of former Los Angeles gang members on parole is an early participant .
Their training is funded by Homeboy Industries , a Los Angeles nonprofit that helps people with criminal pasts find employment .
President Barack Obama has made the production of renewable energy one of the pillars of job creation .
All sorts of people are now rushing to acquire skills to launch careers in the budding sector .
For years , Homeboy Industries put former felons to work at a bakery and cafe it runs in East Los Angeles .
Last summer , founder Greg Boyle , a Jesuit priest , was approached by a supporter about the idea of preparing them for the green economy .
Because job - placement for ex-convicts is especially difficult in a recession , " I leapt at the opportunity , " says Father Boyle , who started Homeboy two decades ago .
See how the training works :
Det var mycket funderande fram och tillbaka innan jag kunde bestämma mig för destination , men till sist valde jag Malapascua .
Filippinerna bjuder ju på miljontals öar , och var och en är säkert en paradisö , men jag kan ju inte vara överallt på en gång .
Malapascua ligger strax norr om Cebu , en lite större ö i Filippinerna .
Flyget gick till Cebu , och därifrån tog jag taxi till staden Maya , där det finns en färja som går till Malapascua .
Man kan åka buss också men den resan tar 4,5 timme , och med taxi tog det bara halva tiden .
Men , vill man spara pengar tar man bussen .
Det går en färjetur var trettionde minut , och överresan med den enkla färjan tog också cirka en halvtimme .
Jag bodde på hotell Hippocampus , som hade fantastiskt trevlig personal och säkert öns bästa mat .
Jag la till lite , och tog ett dyrare rum , för luftkonditioneringens skull .
Hotellet ligger precis på stranden , och som gäst fick man låna gratis solstol .
Jag valde Malapascua främst för snorklingen , men det är ocks å ett paradis för den som vill ha sol och bad .
Ön är liten , bara en kilometer bred och två kilometer lång .
Här finns , med andra ord , inte alla de bekvämligheter man hittar på många andra turistöar , och man kan till exempel inte ta ut pengar på ön .
Läs Vagabonds artikel om Filippinerna för att får en bättre bild och bli inspirerad .
Det finns gott om god mat på ön , inte bara på mitt hotell , och en favorit blev Angelinas fantastiskt goda pizzor , på Angelinas Beach .
Men nu var det ju snorkling och dykning som lockade mig , och här fanns massor av olika dykcenter , som både erbjöd möjligheten att ta dykcert och att få uppleva spännande djur och korallrev .
Tresher Sharks hade jag ju hört talas om , och jag fick faktiskt se dem , livs levande , under en dykning Monad Shoal , där de brukar hålla till .
Denna dykning var något utöver det vanliga på fler sätt än att jag verkligen fick se ” sharks ” .
Här ute dyker man nämligen tidigt på morgonen , och kommer tillbaka lagom till frukost .
Jag gjorde ocks å ett så kallat kvällsdyk , där mandarinfiskarna var den största attraktionen .
This is an experiment .
Throughout the year 2009 I will be trying to " blog " the Paris Peace Conference , discussing the events of the conference , the background , and the consequences .
Comments and recommendations are most welcome .
Bioware , the developer of popular action RPGs such as Knights of the Old Republic , Jade Empire , and Mass Effect , will be discussing the content for its upcoming Mass Effect 2 at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco this March .
According to the GDC 2009 schedule , the details about the game will actually deal with the new level creation process that Bioware has been utilizing during their development cycle : " Lessons learned from Mass Effect lead to a detailed description of the new level - creation process , and graphical examples of a level illustrate its progression through the necessary phases .
The discussion also examines how BioWare is currently implementing this process using elements of Scrum and Lean Development . "
While the lecture is intended for game designers , it seems almost certain that it will be attended by a significant number of the gaming press corps , as details about the second entry into the Mass Effect trilogy have been nonexistent to this point .
It also seems certain that many of the press will try to uncover if more controversial material is to make an appearance , something which Bioware has been extremely quiet about .
Congratulations to Michael Hardman , one of the four founding members of Camra , appointed an MBE ( that ’s Member of the Order of the British Empire for my overseas readers ) in the New Year ’s Honours List “ for services to the Campaign for Real Ale and the brewing industry ” .
Since Michael has probably done more , in his way , to promote the cause of good beer in Britain than almost anyone else alive or dead , and yet remains remarkably little known even in the UK , an MBE is the least recognition he could get from his country for 37 years of service to the national drink , with Camra , with Young & Co as the London brewer ’s long - serving PR man and , until very recently , as PR man for Siba , the independent small brewers ’ organisation in the UK .
An MBE is what they give you for being school lollipop lady * .
Without the pioneering efforts of Michael Hardman , first chairman of Camra , first editor of What ’s Brewing , Camra ’s newspaper , editor of the Good Beer Guide from its second edition in 1975 , when it became a proper , professional effort , to 1977 , there would probably , today , be fewer than half a dozen small breweries in Britain making cask ale , less than a thousand pubs selling it , and there certainly would n’t be the 550 or more new breweries in the UK that drinkers can currently enjoy , all direct beneficiaries of the good beer movement that Michael Hardman helped push - start .
Without Michael Hardman the careers of both Michael Jackson and Roger Protz would probably have been very different .
Certainly Michael Jackson would n’t have received the publisher ’s commission to write the World Guide to Beer in 1977 without the market for such a book provided by the rocketing interest in beer in the UK that Camra put the match to .
Subsequently that book seems to have been an enormous inspiration to the pioneers of the microbrewery movement in the United States .
Roger Protz replaced Michael Hardman as publications editor at Camra with plenty of experience as a journalist but no experience in beer writing and , I think it would probably be fair to say , not much more than an ordinary drinker ’s knowledge of beer , but speedily proved up to his brief .
Without Michael Hardman , too , I would never have become a beer historian and you would n’t be reading this blog : my career as a digger into the beery past started with a request from the editor of the Camra Hertfordshire pub guide in 1979 for me to write something about old breweries to fill up the guide ’s back pages
It was n’t far to travel from writing about old breweries to writing about the beers they once produced .
But if Camra had n’t existed , I would n’t have made the first step .
Drink a New Year ’s toast to Michael Hardman MBE – Mighty Beer Enthusiast .
Before I spotted Michael ’s award I was going to write about this being the 100th post on the Zythophile blog , a small landmark , and perhaps not much to show for 18 months of beer blogging , when others post three or four times as often .
Still , hits are running at a rate two or three times greater than they were a year ago , though some of those hits are definitely from people who are n’t really after what I ’m offering .
I ’m sorry for the disappointment given to whoever arrived here via the search query “ mature Latin dating ” earlier this month .
I hope the person who asked Google “ what is a zythophile ” worked out the answer .
( Balding fat middle - aged bearded beer geek , actually . )
I ca n’t imagine what the person whose search query was “ ipa customer complaint website ” was after : maybe they wanted to complain their IPA had n’t really been on a four - month sea journey to Kolkota ?
And I ’d love to know why there was a surge in search queries around December 7 for “ hop telephone exchange ” – was Southwark ’s former HOP telephone code the answer to a quiz question somewhere ?
Others have done excellent round - ups of 2008 – Pete Brown ’s is very good , as usual , and I endorse 120 per cent his plea for people to stop going on about the death of the pub .
Let ’s see 2009 as the year we all make everybody realise how much vibrancy and excitement there is in the pub scene .
That vibrancy comes through particularly in the equally vibrant British ( and English language - in - Europe ) beer blogging scene .
It was particularly good to see this year an “ electronic media ” section in the British Guild of Beer Writers awards , since easily the best , most informative , most useful , most entertaining and most exciting beer writing is taking place in blogs .
( And doubly or trebly so when what is happening elsewhere in beer “ journalism ” is so often disappointing . )
I hope I ’ve indicated through the year one or two of the developments in brewing that I ’ve found particularly admirable : more British brewers are starting to realise the thrills of experimenting , of charting new courses through the seas of beer .
I feel confident there ’s plenty to look forward to in 2009 .
Certainly I ca n’t see any reason to stop blogging yet .

WASHINGTON 
The prospects of a government rescue for the foundering American automakers dwindled Thursday as Democratic Congressional leaders conceded that they would face potentially insurmountable Republican opposition during a lame - duck session next week .
At the same time , hope among many Democrats on Capitol Hill for an aggressive economic stimulus measure all but evaporated .
Democratic leaders have been calling for a package that would include help for the auto companies as well as new spending on public works projects , an extension of jobless benefits , increased food stamps and aid to states for rising Medicaid expenses .
But while Democrats said the stimulus measure would wait until President - elect Barack Obama takes office in January , some industry experts fear that one of the Big Three automakers will collapse before then , with potentially devastating consequences .
Despite hardening opposition at the White House and among Republicans on Capitol Hill , the Democrats said they would press ahead with efforts to provide $ 25 billion in emergency aid for the automakers .
But they said the bill would need to be approved first in the Senate , which some Democrats said was highly unlikely .
CRAZY PEOPLE ….
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) gave a speech on the Senate floor yesterday , complaining not only about the government stimulus , but the process by which the stimulus was put together .
“ This [ is ] not remotely close to what we could have done if we had sat down in a true bipartisan fashion and found a better way . ”
Similarly , John McCain said the bill should have been “ bipartisan , ” and it does n’t count that the package is drawing support from Democrats and Republicans .
Republican leaders said the compromise remained a bloated , wasteful spending bill , and they derided the scant GOP support as fig - leaf bipartisanship .
“ You can call it a lot of things , but you ca n’t call it bipartisanship , ” said Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) .
The Weekly Standard ‘s Fred Barnes added , “ Republicans got nothing in the bill . ”
First , it ’s amusing to see Republican leaders redefine words .
Democratic leaders and the White House negotiated for days with several Republican senators , and made painful and unnecessary cuts just to earn their support .
This , however , is n’t “ true ” bipartisanship , presumably because the far - right is still unhappy .
Second , President Obama spent a considerable amount of time and energy engaging congressional Republicans directly , soliciting ideas , making changes , and hearing them out .
To hear GOP leaders tell it now , Democrats deserve blame for not incorporating more failed right - wing ideas into the package .
( Including hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts was n’t enough to satisfy Republican demands . )
The goal , they insist , should be making the failed minority party happy , not rescuing the economy in a time of crisis .
And third , it ca n’t be stated enough that negotiating with people detached from reality is fundamentally impossible .
Obama came to the table stating a simple truth : given the circumstances and exhausted options , the economy needs a government stimulus .
He was prepared to have good - faith discussions over how much should be spent , where it should be invested , how quickly , etc .
In response , 90 % of the Senate Republican caucus rejected the very idea of a government stimulus , while a leading House Republican said it was time for the failed minority party to emulate the “ insurgency ” tactics of the “ Taliban . ”
For weeks , their ideas fell on deaf ears because they did n’t make any sense at all .
As John Cole explained this week , “ I really do n’t understand how bipartisanship is ever going to work when one of the parties is insane . ”
Between sanity and craziness , there is no common ground .
Now that the government has spent nearly $ 1.4 trillion to stabilize the financial system , economists and policy makers — and the president - elect — are trying to figure out how much must be invested in a stimulus package to stop the recession , and what that money should be spent on .
The size of a possible stimulus plan rises as the economy contracts , and that is happening at a 4 percent annual rate , according to current estimates , or eight times as fast as it was this summer .
Just offsetting that contraction requires a federal infusion of at least $ 400 billion , many economists calculate .
And even that would not restore a healthy economy .
“ The hope is that the next stimulus package will be large enough to move the economy from big negatives to zero growth , ” said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ That is the benchmark today : zero growth . ”
President - elect Barack Obama has not stated what the stimulus plan might cost , though Congressional leaders have cited figures of $ 500 billion and higher .
Mr. Obama has given a hint , though .
He speaks of a recovery that would generate 2.5 million jobs in the first two years of his administration .
That would require not just zero economic growth , but a fairly robust expansion — a swing in effect from the present 4 percent contraction to a growth rate of 2.5 to 3 percent a year .
A man risked his life to save four deer .
Rockport Reservoir starting icing over last Friday .
Yesterday , two deer fell into the ice and did n't make it .
Today , four out of six were saved .
Wildlife officials determined it was too dangerous to go after the remaining two .
Joe Donnell and his family thought they were going skiing today , but when work called they made a change of plans .
And it was all caught on camera by Donnell 's daughters .
Donnell with Utah State Parks and Recreation is trained for ice rescue , but this was his first real try .
So he got in his waterproof ice suit , strapped into a 500 foot rope and walked out onto the lake .
He said , " I 'd grab it by its hind legs and yell pull , and those guys pulled me to shore with the deer .
They were kicking at me .
They were trying to They did n't like me being out there .
They were screaming and yelling and kicking . "
One by one , the group of nearly 10 pulled the deer onto shore .
Two of the six deer had to be left in the middle of the lake .
Donnell said , " The ice conditions are changing so bad right now .
It 's above freezing .
The last trip I did , I probably could 've fallen through at any time .
" The Division of Wildlife Resources hopes the remaining deer will walk off the ice themselves tonight , but they 're not counting on it .
Bruce Johnson with the DWR said , " They try to walk out across .
They eventually lose their traction and can't stand up anymore .
Their legs go out from under them .
They 're left trying to gather their feet up from under them and the ice is too slick .
They can't . "
Still , everyone involved considered it a success .
And Donnell 's daughters certainly have a great story to tell to their friends .
Rachelle Donnell said , " It 's pretty cool because not many people get to do that every day , so we 're pretty lucky .
"
If the deer are still on the lake tomorrow , the DWR and the Summit County Sheriff 's Office will reconsider another rescue effort if it 's safe enough .
One of the most significant testimonies implicating the top Bush administration officials in torture and homicide is public now .
The bipartisan Senate Armed Services Committee report says that higher ups including the President himself in the Bush administration “ share much of the blame ” for detainee abuse at Abu Gharaib prison in Iraq , Guantanamo Bay and in secret CIA prisons .
These abuses are in addition to the two wars that have resulted in the death of around a million people in Iraq and Afghanistan .
These revelations are nothing new in essence .
The report only confirms that the abuse of detainees in US custody cannot simply be attributed to the actions of a few bad apples acting on their own .
It emphasises that senior officials solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques , altered the law to create the appearance of their legality , and authourised their use against detainees .
Torturing a prisoner to death was excusable .
In fact , inventing , authorising and implementing new policies of torture led to promotions .
It is a pity that US officials and leaders , charged with defending the Constitution , undermined its sanctity and abused international conventions and laws for political compulsions .
As the report says , an executive summary signed by President Bush in February 2002 , states that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to the US war on Al Qaeda , and the suspects captured in Afghanistan were not entitled to prisoners of war status or legal protections .
So what the world witnessed was saffron - clad detainees in the far away island of Cuba , being held and tried on supra- legislative assumptions , and horrifying tales of degrading treatment of the ones being held in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Under the pretext of interrogation , the US servicemen and officials committed the worst form of human rights violations .
Conveniently dubbed as another ‘ heart attack ’ , hundreds of detainees were left to die under the force of baton and boots .
The ingenuous forms of torture documented such as : ridiculing a detainee , interrogating in an offending language to elicit provocation , stripping , punching and kicking , keeping handcuffed for days and nights , and prolonged sleep deprivation — leave one in a state of shock and awe .
The administration officials have repeatedly demonstrated shocking arrogance and disregard for the rule of law and the principles of justice and fairness enshrined in the US constitution .
The Senate report only reflects the extent of damage America ’s reputation has suffered as a democracy and law - abiding nation .
In other words , this is an indictment of the Bush administration .
The incoming administration of Barack Obama cannot ignore what has happened , and what has been documented in the Senate report .
Closing of Guantanamo Bay and many such secret prisons worldwide will be the first step to restore the world ’s trust in America .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
I need to take a break from all the gloom in the markets and economy for an Andy Rooney - esque rant .
Indulge me .
I do n't know about you .
But I 'm sick of all the Facebook hype .
For the record , I am not on Facebook , and the recent fuss about privacy does n't affect me -- I 'm not a disgruntled user with an axe to grind .
What I do n't get is how Facebook has become such a phenomenon .
Our sister publication Fortune even recently published a story about the company called " How Facebook is taking over our lives . "
It 's a great story ... even though Facebook has n't taken over my life .
Do n't get me wrong .
I realize some people swear by Facebook .
I understand its addictive charms .
My wife is a recent convert and she loves it .
Also , I am by no means a Luddite .
I break out into cold sweats if I have n't checked my BlackBerry for more than 10 minutes .
I believe that the invention of the DVR is proof that some supreme deity exists .
And I even sometimes use my BlackBerry to program my DVR .
But I honestly do n't have the time to commit to Facebook .
My job , especially since the implosion of Lehman Brothers in September , keeps me insanely busy .
And after sitting at a computer typing all day , the last thing I want to do when I get home is sit in front of another computer so I can upload photos to my Wall and read 25 random things about a high school classmate I have n't spoken to in 18 years .
I also do n't feel the need to constantly update an entire network of friends about the daily minutiae of my life .
My brother recently harassed me over the phone about why I was n't on Facebook .
My response was , " You want my status update ?
I 'm about to hang up on you . "
I may be in the minority .
The Facebook universe is now 175 million users strong .
But how is this company ever going to generate meaningful revenue and post profits from this massive user base ?
Popularity 's nice , but profits are cooler
In the Fortune story , there is a chart showing how quickly Facebook got to 150 million users compared to other technologies such as the iPod , cellphone and television .
While it 's impressive that it took Facebook only 5 years compared with 7 years for Apple to " sell " 150 million iPods , who has the better business model ?
Facebook merely signed up people to use their service ... for free .
Apple sold a product ... and a pretty pricey one at that .
What 's more , Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) makes money when people buy music from iTunes for their iPod .
Facebook board member and Netscape founder Marc Andreessen said on an appearance on PBS ' " Charlie Rose " show this week that if it wanted to , Facebook could start monetizing its user base immediately by selling more ads .
But how much money would it really make ?
The site already has some advertising .
But are they effective ?
I argue that Facebook or any social network can never truly be a major generator of ad revenue .
Users of Facebook like the site because it allows them to easily connect and communicate with friends .
It 's the 21st century version of Ma Bell .
By that very token , how happy would you be if you had to listen to an ad when you picked up the phone before you were able to get a dial tone ?
Even if users tolerate ads on Facebook , I 'm not sure they 'd actually click on them .
Why Facebook is n't Google
Facebook is a completely different animal than the other Web wunderkind it is often compared to : Google .
The beauty of Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) is that , despite all its efforts to diversify , it really is all about searching for information .
If I go to Google to find the best airline fares to Buenos Aires , a sponsored search result may actually be helpful as opposed to being obtrusive .
If I go to Facebook to try and top my friends ' best score in Scramble , I 'm there to freaking play Scramble .
Even a " contextually relevant " ad for Boggle is going to irritate me .
Yeah , Facebook may be " stickier " than Google .
But I 'm not hanging around waiting for an ad .
I 'm also skeptical about Facebook 's plan , unveiled earlier this month , to offer user information to companies so they can target specific users for online polls .
For one , it sounds like another privacy backlash waiting to happen ... similar to the Beacon service Facebook launched in 2007 .
With Beacon , Facebook partnered with online retailers that would track a users ' credit card use .
So if you bought something online , friends in your network could see that .
Problem was that when Facebook set it up , all users were automatically enrolled in Beacon .
Not a smart move .
After an unsurprising uproar , Facebook changed it so users had to opt-in .
Also , do n't most people hate consumer research polls ?
When is the last time you decided it was a good idea to waste 15 minutes of your life happily chatting with a telemarketer ?
To me , Facebook seems to be growing for growth 's sake without a plan for making money .
And that 's really risky in a recession as bad as this one .
Not only is Facebook faced with the prospect of ad spending declining this year ; it also has to likely deal with the rising costs to manage the increased amount of data as it signs on more and more users .
So while I applaud Facebook for its ability to attract a loyal base of users , I just do n't get how it will ever be a financial success .
The Fortune story closed by saying that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg does n't want to sell to Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) because he wants to build the next Microsoft .
But Bill Gates did n't become one of the wealthiest men on the planet by giving away operating systems for free now did he ?
If you want to make an impression at a board meeting or a Congressional hearing these bearish days , make a harrumphing noise and employ the figure of speech now sweeping the economic world : “ But what about the fat tail ? ”
This is another way of asking “ How come all you geniuses did n’t realize the risk you were running ? ”
Embarrassed witnesses and recently fired C.E.O. ’s explain that the distribution of values and risks long beloved by managers , credit - rating agencies and securities analysts turned out to be not so normal after all .
To comprehend what fat tail is in today ’s media wringer , think of a bell curve , the line on a statistician ’s chart that reflects “ normal distribution . ”
It is tall and wide in the middle — where most people and things being studied almost always tend to be — and drops and flattens out at the bottom , where fewer are , making a shape on a graph resembling a bell .
The extremities at the bottom left and right are called the tails ; when they balloon instead of nearly vanishing as expected , the tails have been designated “ heavy ” and , more recently , the more pejorative “ fat . ”
To a credit - agency statistician now living in a world of chagrin , the alliterative definition of a fat tail is “ an abnormal agglomeration of angst . ”
In an eye - popping Times Magazine article last month titled “ Risk Mismanagement , ” Joe Nocera , a business columnist for The Times , focused on the passionate , prescient warnings of the former options trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb , author of “ The Black Swan ” and “ Fooled by Randomness , ” who popularized the phrase now in vogue in its financial - ­statistics sense .
Nocera wrote : “ What will cause you to lose billions instead of millions ?
Something rare , something you ’ve never considered a possibility .
Taleb calls these events ‘ fat tails ’ or ‘ black swans , ’ and he is convinced that they take place far more frequently than most human beings are willing to contemplate . ”
Ex - gitmo guard who saw ' torture ' calls co-workers ' psychotic ' Jeremy Gantz

As the Guantanamo Bay detention center reached its seventh birthday this week , a U.S. veteran said he witnessed cell beatings , forced head shavings and interrogation tactics -- including sleep deprivation , floor shackles and loud music -- while guarding detainees there .
" It 's torture , " Chris Arendt , who worked at Guantanamo when he was 19 , told the BBC in this video .
" It 's a means of extracting information that I did n't even believe these people probably had .
It 's a means of making their lives more miserable . "
Arendt , who joined the U.S. military when he was 17 , testified at the Winter Soldier Hearings in Washington D.C. last March .
Wearing an Iraq Veterans Against the War sweatshirt , Arendt told the BBC that many people he worked with at the camp thought of their Guantanamo posting as " vacation . "
" ... This was the opportunity that they 'd always wanted , to be violent and awful people ... because they are genuinely psychotic .
And for others , it 's just a job , " Arendt said .
For years , the Guantanamo prison has inspired global protests against alleged U.S. human rights violations .
President George W. Bush has said he would like to close the camp , but his administration has been unable to find countries willing to accept many Guantanamo detainees .
President - elect Barack Obama has said he will close the prison and prosecute many Guantanamo detainees in the United States .
On Thursday , the U.S. military admitted that 25 Guantanamo detainees -- or 10 percent of the prison 's captives -- have starved themselves for weeks and are being fed through tubes in their noses .
Human rights groups have called the practice of force - feeding hunger strikers " inhumane and unlawful . "
Thirty detainees are currently on a hunger strike .
In testimony during the Winter Soldier Hearings last year , Arendt said : " There were methods [ in place at Guantanamo ] to make certain that we got around to torturing these people . "
The U.S. Department of Defense has said its policy is " to treat detainees humanely . "
That rain you ’ve been having ?
It does n’t really help much .
California is still in the midst of a serious drought .
We Australians can empathize -- and we can also offer some advice .
Last year , the southeast corner of the northern Australian state of Queensland , where I live , entered its 10th year of drought -- officially the worst period on record .
Australia is the driest inhabited continent on Earth , but until recently that was never a huge problem for the 90 % of us who live in coastal cities and towns .
We ’d always thought of dry spells as the farmers ’ problem .
But as the recent drought dragged on , fruit and vegetable prices began to rise .
Then public parks went from green to brown .
Finally , even city folk began to talk about drought .
Advertisement
In May 2005 , restrictions were imposed on things like watering gardens , washing cars and filling pools .
After that , I could only water the vegetable patch in my backyard with a bucket , and then only three times a week after 7 p.m. on my allotted days .
Despite the regulations , by mid-2007 our drought had become deeply alarming .
The reservoirs that supply the state ’s three most populous areas -- Brisbane , the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast -- were at 16 % of normal .
The water authority , having instituted all possible outdoor restrictions , had no choice but to take water saving into people ’s homes -- where the majority of water is used .
It became personal .
The authority set a target of reducing average daily water use from 80 gallons a person to 37 gallons ( or 140 liters ) a person .
The plan was to keep the 37 - gallon target in place until the combined level of the reservoirs serving the region went back up to 40 % of normal .

Officials developed a relatively cheap social marketing campaign , with the aim of getting people to think about individual water use .
Ads promoted simple things , such as taking four - minute showers and turning off the tap while brushing your teeth .
Crucially , the program set targets , and for the first time put gallon figures on the amount of water used in car washing , toilet flushing and other activities .
Before the drought and Target 140 , as the program was called , my wife , two sons ( ages 8 and 11 ) and I routinely wasted water .
Our faucets dripped , our sprinklers ran , we washed our cars and hosed our driveway without a second thought .
Now the radio was awash with talk of water and how to conserve it .
Reservoir levels became the subject of everyday conversation .
Advertisement
Just two weeks into Target 140 , average daily per-person use dropped from 80 to 32 gallons .
The water saved was equivalent to bringing a desalination plant online -- overnight .
In the United States , people use an average of between 100 to 150 gallons a day , depending on whose statistics you use , so you ’d have a little more cutting to do .
But it was surprisingly easy .
At my house , water - saving fever caught on quickly .
We made sure to only do full loads of dish and clothes washing , we bought a four - minute shower timer , and we used a $ 15 government - funded , one - off plumbing service to fix leaking faucets and install water - saving shower heads .
We took advantage of generous government rebates to install rainwater tanks and gray - water systems .
It was discouraging to watch the garden die and our green lawn turn to dust .
But then so did everybody else ’s .
In fact , healthy gardens raised eyebrows and suspicions .
We tracked our progress in our water bill , which displayed household usage on a bar graph , along with our suburb ’s average and the overall city average .
Advertisement
There were some isolated neighborhood tensions and even the odd case of tank theft , but collectively , residents saved about 148 billion gallons of water under Target 140 , which ran through July .
The typical household saved about 190,000 gallons .
Fifteen months into the program , we got unexpected rains that took the reservoirs to the required 40 % level , and the target was adjusted up to 45 gallons a person a day , where it remains .
But longer - term behavioral change seems to have occurred , and daily use has stabilized at 38 gallons a person .
Not surprisingly , water authorities from California and Georgia are interested in this unique , target - style program , as are the water boards of Israel , Singapore , South Africa and the Netherlands .

We reformed our water - wasting ways , and I ’m betting Californians could do the same .
“ Target 38 " has a certain ring to it , do n’t you think ?

A terminally - ill 13 - year - old girl has persuaded a hospital to abandon legal action that could have forced her to have a potentially life - saving heart transplant against her will .
Hannah Jones , who suffers from a rare form of leukaemia , told doctors that she believed the treatment was too risky and that she would prefer to enjoy her remaining days in the company of family and friends .
But in complex right - to - die case , her local hospital began High Court proceedings to temporarily remove her from her parents ' custody to allow the transplant to go ahead .
Hannah was required to plead her case to a child protection officer , who persuaded the hospital to back down .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Last night , her father Andrew , an auditor , said : " I do n't know exactly what Hannah said but it must have been powerful enough to convince some very high - up people that she was right .
It is an incredible thing for a young person who has been through such a lot to have the bravery to stand up for her rights .
We 're so very proud of our little girl . "
The family has now received a letter from the hospital insisting that it always puts a patient 's " best interests " first , but which stops short of an apology .
Hannah , who was diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of five , was given a high - strength drug to kill off the infection that also caused a hole to develop in her heart .
Her family had to decide whether to continue the treatment – which would have wiped out the cancer but possibly further damaged her heart – or stop and hope that the amount administered was sufficient .
They chose the latter , and , so far , the leukaemia has not returned .
But Hannah has been left with severe heart damage that requires treatment with a combination of drugs and a special pacemaker .
After being told the only solution was a transplant , Hannah decided against it because there was a strong chance she would not survive the procedure and , if she did , the leukaemia could return .
The new heart would also last only 10 years at best and she would need constant drug treatment .
In the end she decided to return home to Marden near Hereford and her brothers and sisters – Oliver , 11 , Lucy , 10 , and four - year - old Phoebe , under the expert care of her mother , a specialist nurse .
But the family later received a telephone call from the child protection officer at Hereford Hospital warning they would apply for a High Court order to forcibly remove Hannah because her parents were " preventing her treatment " .
The next day the officer arrived at their home and interviewed Hannah in her bedroom .
After the meeting Hannah 's views were conveyed to barristers at the High Court who decided to abandon the case .
Mr Jones , who praised the doctors treating her , described the hospital 's action as " outrageous " .
He said : " Hannah had been through enough already and to have the added stress of a possible court hearing or being forcibly taken into hospital is disgraceful . "
Hannah can now only move around briefly before becoming short of breath .
She was too weak to speak about the case yesterday , but a spokesman for Hereford Hospital said the decision to consider legal action was ultimately the responsibility of the primary care trust .

Saudi Arabia to donate $ 1 billion to rebuild Gaza
The Saudi king said Monday his country will donate $ 1 billion to help rebuild the Gaza Strip after the devastating Israeli offensive and told Israel that an Arab initiative offering peace will not remain on the table forever .
King Abdullah ’s comments at an Arab economic summit in Kuwait City were his first since Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas declared a fragile cease - fire to halt three weeks of violence in Gaza that killed more than 1,250 Palestinians .
“ Israel has to understand that the choice between war and peace will not always stay open and that the Arab peace initiative that is on the table today will not stay on the table , ” said Abdullah during a speech .
The initiative , which was first proposed by Saudi Arabia in 2002 and relaunched in March 2007 , offers Israel collective Arab recognition in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from territory it occupied in the 1967 war , the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and a just solution for the problem of Palestinian refugees .
Israel initially rejected the initiative in 2002 , but in the past year has said it could be a starting point for discussion .
“ The position of the Israeli government is that the Arab peace initiative remains a basis for dialogue between Israel and the Arab world , ” said Israeli spokesman Mark Regev .
“ And we continue to be willing to negotiate with all of our neighbors on the basis of that initiative . ”
But progress toward finalizing a peace deal has been slow , especially after Hamas seized Gaza from its rival Fatah in June 2007 , creating a rift between the two main Palestinian factions .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ’ faction , Fatah , controls only the West Bank .
Arab hard - liners discussing Gaza at a gathering in Qatar last week called for putting the peace initiative on hold , a more radical position than the one outlined by Abdullah .
Syrian President Bashar Assad has proclaimed the offer already dead and proposed Monday that the Arab summit adopt a resolution declaring Israel a “ terrorist entity . ”
The Arab world has struggled to come up with a unified response to the Gaza crisis — with strong Hamas supporters like Iran and Syria facing off against U.S. allies like Egypt , Jordan and Saudi Arabia .
The Saudi king called on Arab countries to end their rift Monday and invited the leaders from Egypt , Qatar and Syria to his palace for lunch after the summit ’s opening session .
Abbas on Monday rejected any talk of abandoning the initiative , saying the only option that Arabs have is to make peace with Israel .
“ The Arab peace initiative did not carry the seeds of its demise , ” said Abbas at the Kuwait summit .
“ It was our shortcomings . ”
Arab League chief Amr Moussa told the summit that Arab countries would have to come up with an alternative if they decided to abandon the initiative .
“ The situation can not take just freezing or suspending ( the initiative ) , ” said Moussa .
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , meanwhile , pushed Israel to respond to the Arab initiative , saying “ peace in the Middle East is an imperative that cannot be delayed . ”
But prospects for Arab - Israeli peace seem dim following Israel ’s offensive in Gaza to halt Hamas rocket fire into its territory .
The death and destruction enraged many Arabs and further strained relations between Israel and the Palestinians .
Abdullah criticized the Israelis for using excessive force in Gaza , saying the Jewish holy book called for “ an eye for an eye and did not say an eye for the eyes of a whole city . ”
The king said his country ’s $ 1 billion donation for Gaza would go to a proposed fund Arabs are setting up to rebuild the seaside territory .
“ I know that one drop of Palestinian blood is more valuable than the treasures of the world , ” said Abdullah .
But it remains to be seen whether Arab expressions of sympathy for the citizens of Gaza translate into actual funds to rebuild the city .
Arabs have often criticized Israel for the plight of Palestinians , but pledges of financial support have not always materialized .
Also Monday , Turkey ’s top envoy for the Middle East offered to mediate between Hamas and Fatah to forge a consensus necessary to a lasting Gaza cease - fire .
The rival factions have been unable to come up with a power - sharing formula since Hamas won 2006 parliament elections .
“ Palestinian reconciliation is a must in order for peace to be lasting , ” Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters .
“ If that is achieved , then the road to peace will be opened . ”
France , which has played an active role in efforts toward ending the Gaza offensive , also urged convening an international conference toward eventually creating a Palestinian state .
Foreign Ministry spokesman Eric Chevallier said in an online briefing Monday that “ an international conference should be quickly organized ” for launching “ a dynamic for negotiations ” on creating a Palestinian state .
He gave no other details .
AUSTIN , TEXAS — With Intel ’s Nehalem - based Xeons gathering like a storm on the horizon , AMD today gave the first working demonstration of its potential counterpunch : a six - core Opteron processor code - named “ Istanbul . ”
Istanbul is a fairly straightforward upgrade over current ‘ Shanghai ’ Opterons : a 45 nm processor with 6MB of L3 cache that fits into a Socket F - style motherboards , only with six cores rather than four .
As a result , the upcoming Istanbul - based Opterons will serve as drop - in upgrades for existing Socket F systems .
The chips will take advantage of the same 2P , 4P , and 8P infrastructure as today ’s Opterons , with HyperTransport and two channels of DDR2 memory per socket .
AMD has previously stated that Istanbul processors will become available in the second half of this year , and the firm has n’t yet provided any more specific guidance about when to expect Istanbul - based systems .
However , the presence of working silicon would seem to indicate that Istanbul Opterons could be introduced much earlier in that broad “ second half ” time - frame than originally anticipated .
AMD showed us several demonstrations of Istanbul silicon in action .
The first was a simple showing of Task Manager on the Windows Server 2008 desktop , in which the utility showed activity indicators for each of the 24 cores in a quad - socket system .
Simple , yet impressive for what it indicated .
The second demo was conducted on a dual - socket system with 12 cores .
The main OS was Windows Server 2008 , but the system also hosted three separate virtual machines : one each for Windows Server 2003 , Red Hat Linux , and SLES 11 x64 .
Each VM had four cores dedicated to it .
The third demo was the most interesting for a couple of reasons .
First , because it was intended to show how Istanbul can serve as a drop - in upgrade for Socket F systems .
The only requirements : the system must support split power planes , and it must have a BIOS upgrade to operate with the new processors .
Second , the demo was impressive because it included a performance test .
Two otherwise - identical systems were situated side by side : one with a quartet of Shanghai Opterons , the other with four Istanbul chips .
Both systems were running with HyperTransport 3 active — a capability coming soon to Shanghai Opterons but not yet available in current products .
To illustrate the performance difference between the two boxes , the AMD tech ran a Stream benchmark .
The 16 - core Shanghai system produced throughput numbers in the range of 25,000 MB/s .
The 24 - core Istanbul box , by contrast , hit about 42,000 MB/s .
The tech then swapped the processor - and - memory daughtercards between the two boxes , and of course , the performance characteristics moved with them .
That ’s one heck of an in - place upgrade , but the bigger question may be :
Why the huge performance gain with the addition of more cores , given that Stream is typically considered , at least partially , a bandwidth - bound benchmark ?
And why the magnitude of the gain , with only 50 % more cores and ( although they were not disclosed ) likely lower per-core clock frequencies for Istanbul ?
Part of the answer , it seems , may be a feature new to Istanbul that AMD calls HT assist ( presumably for HyperTransport assist ) .
This feature is what the company calls a probe filter ( and may more commonly be called a snoop filter ) that functions to reduce traffic on socket - to - socket HyperTransport links by storing an index of all caches and preventing unnecessary coherency synchronization requests .
Current Opteron systems use a broadcast - based probe protocol , sending probe requests to all sockets .
Istanbul , instead , either knows that no probes are required or is able to do a directed probe to a single socket .
( Although it may still use broadcasts in certain , specific situations . )
Istanbul ’s probe filter stores its data in the processor ’s L3 cache .
The amount of cache space dedicated to probe filter storage , AMD says , will be configurable in the BIOS , and the more space dedicated to probe filter storage , the more granular its operation will be .
AMD did n’t handicap the exact performance impact of HT assist for us , but the quad - socket Stream test may have been an extreme case .
The probe filter capability will be unique to the six - core Istanbul and will not be incorporated in a future revison of Shanghai .
However , with fewer cores , Shanghai Opterons will be able to reach higher clock speeds within the same power envelopes as Istanbul , and AMD expects the clock frequency advantage to somewhat offset the lack of a probe filter .
Regardless , one would expect Istanbul to be especially popular in systems with four or more sockets , where coherency traffic is a thornier issue and HyperTransport bandwidth is at a premium .
AMD plans a full lineup of six - core Opterons based on Istanbul , including low - power HE versions and high - performance SE models , all within the customary Opteron power and thermal envelopes .
Although the percentage of server installations that take advantage of the drop - in upgrade opportunity is relatively small — AMD estimates it at around 5 % — the firm hopes that tighter IT budgets and a strong value proposition might prompt a change in habits among some IT decision - makers .
Beyond that , AMD expects system vendors to treat Istanbul very much like any other new Opteron speed grade , with a much easier qualification path than an all - new product .
That should mean fairly quick and widespread adoption of six - core Opterons among vendors shipping Shanghai - based systems today , if all goes as planned .
Bernard Madoff , the disgraced Wall Street trader accused of conning clients out of $ 50 bn ( £ 33 bn ) , had $ 173 m in signed cheques on his office desk when he was arrested , which prosecutors say shows he sought to keep assets from fleeced investors .
In a filing in a federal court in New York today , prosecutors argued the 100 cheques are further evidence Madoff should be jailed pending trial .
" The only thing that prevented the defendant from executing his plan to dissipate those assets was his arrest by the FBI on December 11 , " prosecutors argued .
Assistant US attorney Marc Litt argued that if Madoff remains free he cannot be trusted not to disperse his assets because he perpetrated a " scheme that required the defendant to lie routinely to thousands of people and a scheme which has caused extraordinary damage to individuals , families , and institutions all over the world . "
Madoff remains under house arrest in his luxurious $ 7 m Manhattan apartment .
US Magistrate Judge Ronald Ellis must now decide whether to remand Madoff to jail .
Madoff 's attorneys argue he is not a threat and should remain free .
The revelation came as the Serious Fraud Office announced it is opening an investigation into Madoff 's UK operations .
Police said the investigation would focus on " UK victims and any criminal offences that might have been committed in the UK " .
" We will work closely with other law enforcement agencies to discover the truth behind the collapse of these huge financial structures .
And we again ask for help from ex-employees and others , " the SFO director , Richard Alderman , said .
The decision comes after the SFO was handed an interim report by Grant Thornton , the accountancy firm acting as the provisional liquidators of Madoff 's UK operations .
The SFO said it was liaising closely with law enforcement counterparts in the US and with the City of London police .
It has appealed for investors or other stakeholders involved with the Madoff UK businesses to get in touch in the hope that they might shed light on the trader 's dealings .
Madoff is accused of running a fraudulent pyramid scheme in one of the largest cases of financial corruption in US history .
Long considered a pillar of the Wall Street community , he was arrested on 11 December after allegedly confessing to his sons that his fund was a " giant Ponzi scheme " .
He was later placed under curfew and ordered to wear an electronic tag .
The 70 - year - old faces a jail term of up to 20 years and a £ 3 m fine .
In addition to preparing the cheques , prosecutors say Madoff posted several packages of jewellery - including 13 watches , a diamond necklace , an emerald ring , two sets of cufflinks , a diamond Cartier watch , among other valuables totalling more than $ 1 m - to family members and friends in contravention of an order freezing his assets .
Government officials have recovered much of the jewellery .
The jewellery mailings show Madoff's " willingness to disobey an explicit court order " , even an order to appear in court .
They also allege he planned to distribute more than $ 200 m to friends and family when he realised the scheme was unravelling .
The list of people allegedly defrauded by Madoff include the American film director Stephen Spielberg , the US actor Kevin Bacon , and Nicola Horlick , the UK asset manager dubbed " superwoman " .
Scores of banks , charities , and hedge funds worldwide have said they lost money invested with Madoff .
The Spanish bank Santander , which owns Abbey , Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley , has admitted a loss of £ 2.1bn , and HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland are nursing losses .
Madoff was registered with the Financial Services Authority , along with his two sons , brother and six other employees of Madoff Securities International , a proprietary trading operation based in London which insisted it was " not in any way part of " the New York firm .
The financier set up a company in the US with barely $ 5,000 almost 50 years ago .
He maintained it as a family operation with its unique selling point that it would be a reliable and trustworthy haven for investments in turbulent times .
In an illustrious career , Madoff chaired the Nasdaq stock exchange and even served as an adviser to the US regulator , the securities and exchange commission .

Your Insurance Rates Just Went Up
This article about insurance payments for Reiki appeared on a Reiki website .
A major concern among Reiki practitioners has been the inability to bill client 's insurance companies for treatments .
However , today there are avenues available to the practitioner .
A nurse who practices Reiki and wishes to bill an insurance company for a treatment may use the diagnostic code 1.8 - Energy Field Disturbance .
The diagnostic code may only be used by nurses and is recognized by the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association .
The bill should be accompanied with a separate sheet setting forth the assessment , diagnosis , planning , implementation and evaluation .
This information may be found in the Official Newsletter of the American Holistic Nurse 's Association ( Vol. 15 - No. 4 , April 1995 )
Energy Field Disturbance is defined as a disruption of the flow of energy surrounding a person 's being which results in disharmony of the body , mind and / or spirit .
Defining characteristics of EFD are - temperature change ( warmth and coolness ) , visual change ( image / color ) , disruption of the field ( vacant , hold , spike , bulge , movement ( wave , spike , tingling , dense , flowing ) , and sounds ( tones / words ) "
It goes on to explain how you can game the system to get payment for these treatments .
Is n't it interesting that nurses get to use this diagnosis and doctors do n't ?
I thought there was only one science .
Either " energy field disturbances " exist or they do n't .
And there 's not a shred of evidence that they exist outside the imagination of energy practitioners .
According to Edzard Ernst , the world 's first professor of alternative medicine , in Trick or Treatment ,
Reiki is a popular form of spiritual healing , but it has no basis in science .
The trial evidence fails to show its effectiveness for any condition .
Despite this lack of evidence , they continue to claim beneficial , sometimes miraculous , health effects for ALL health conditions .
Reiki has had a positive affect [ sic ] on all forms of illness and negative conditions .
This includes minor things like head or stomach aches , bee stings , colds , flu , tension and anxiety as well as serious illness like heart disease , cancer , leukemia , etc .
The website Q and A asks if Reiki is a religion and answers no .
" Although Reiki energy is spiritual in nature , Reiki is not a religion . "
Maybe not , but it does require belief in a lot of pretty weird ideas .
According to Bob Park in his book Superstition , if it 's not science , it 's superstition .
And Reiki sure is n't science .
Read these definitions of rei and ki and see what you think - does this sound like science , religion , or superstition to you ?
Rei can be defined as the Higher Intelligence that guides the creation and functioning of the universe .
Rei is a subtle wisdom that permeates everything , both animate and inanimate .
This subtle wisdom guides the evolution of all creation ranging from the unfolding of galaxies to the development of life .
On a human level , it is available to help us in times of need and to act as a source of guidance in our lives .
Because of its infinite nature , it is all knowing .
Rei is also called God and has many other names depending on the culture that has named it .
Ki is the non-physical energy that animates all living things .
Ki is flowing in everything that is alive including plants , animals and humans .
When a person 's Ki is high , they will feel strong , confident , and ready to enjoy life and take on it's [ sic ] challenges .
When it is low , they will feel weak and are more likely to get sick .
We receive Ki from the air we breath , from food , sunshine , and from sleep .
It is also possible to increase our Ki by using breathing exercises and meditation .
When a person dies , their Ki leaves the physical body .
Ki is also the Chi of China , the prana of India , the Ti or Ki of the Hawaiians , and has also been called odic force , orgone , bioplasma and life force .
You learn to do Reiki by receiving an " attunement " from a Reiki master .
And it works long - distance :
By using a picture of the person you would like to send Reiki to or by writing the person 's name on a piece of paper or simply by thinking of the person and also activating the distant symbol , you can send Reiki to them no matter where they are .
They could be hundreds of miles away , but it makes no difference .
The Reiki energy will go to them and treat them .
You can also send Reiki to crisis situations or world leaders and the Reiki energy will help them too .
They even have a World Peace Project .
It does n't seem to be working very well .
If their claims were true , they could easily have won Randi 's million dollars : why have n't they even applied ?
( That 's a rhetorical question : I think we can all guess why . )
This is all so silly it's hard to believe a hard - nosed insurance company would countenance it .
Should insurance companies reward patients for being superstitious ?
I do n't think so .
At any rate , it 's not fair to make you and me foot the bill for other people 's delusions .
If they insist on paying for this nonsense , how about offering two levels of insurance , a cheaper one for people who want science - based medical care and a more expensive one for the gullible .

Many said before the festivities that they did not have tickets and would be happy to catch a mere glimpse of the nation 's first African - American president .
Some spectators were more than a mile from the swearing - in ceremony , watching on giant TV screens erected along the National Mall .
At St. John 's Episcopal Church , where the Obamas kicked off a packed day , 9 - year - old Laura Brueggeman waited with her mother , Wendy , and father , Jeff , of Bethesda , Maryland .
The affable crowd tried to let shorter onlookers and children to the front for better views .
" I want to see Obama .
I think that would be really cool .
I could tell all of my friends that I got to see him , " the youngster said .
Security was tight in Washington .
However , no arrests related to the inauguration were reported as of Tuesday evening , an FBI spokesman said .
The ceremony also drew celebrities like Dustin Hoffman , Denzel Washington and Steven Spielberg .
" It 's beyond the dream .
We 're just here feeling it with the throngs of people .
It 's amazing grace personified , " Oprah Winfrey said , sitting next to actor Samuel L. Jackson .
Obama and congressional leaders formally bade farewell to Bush , and the now - former president took a presidential jet to Midland , Texas , shortly afterward .

China has launched a legal bid to stop the sale of two 18th Century bronze statues at a Paris auction .
Beijing says the relics were looted 150 years ago and should be in a museum .
The sculptures - a rabbit 's head and a rat 's head - are part of a collection belonging to fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent , who died in 2008 .
The auctioneering house , Christie's , has not commented on China 's demand .
The bronzes are expected to sell for 10 m euros ( £ 8.8 m ; $ 12.6 m ) .
Chinese lawyer Liu Yang told the French news agency AFP that papers had been filed late on Thursday to pull the items from the sale .
" Yesterday we applied to the court in Paris for an injunction to stop the sale of the bronzes through our lawyer in Paris , we are now waiting for the reply from the court , " Mr Liu said .
The Associated Press said judges would probably rule on the case on Monday morning , just hours before the auction is due to start .
' Offensive to China '
China says the animal heads were part of a collection of 12 looted from the Old Summer Palace in Beijing in 1860 when it was sacked and burnt by French and British armies during the Second Opium War .
The animals represent the Chinese zodiac , and adorned a fountain built for the Emperor Qianglong .
China has managed to track down five of the other statues , which are now displayed in a Beijing museum .
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said selling the two heads " offends the Chinese people and undermines their cultural rights " .
Christie's has said that Yves Saint Laurent acquired the items legally and insisted earlier this month that the sale would go ahead .
The two bronzes are part of a three - day auction of hundreds of artworks belonging to the late designer - described as one of the best art collections in the world .
Just recently , we mentioned Copeland Casati in regards to the launch of Green Cabin Kits , but I thought it was high time to take a look at her SIPs home under construction near Appomattox in Central Virginia .
The home is actually a prototype of the Casa Ti house kit designed by architect David Day .
Designed to be off - grid , net - zero energy , and modern , the home has 1200 square feet of space with three bedrooms .
Right now , the exterior is pretty close to complete ( sans natural landscaping ) , but when done the home will have radiant heat , rainwater collection , the benefits of passive solar design , and on - site solar energy , etc .
Copeland tells us that without the systems , the home is so efficient that on a cold winter day , you can walk inside to a cozy 60 degrees or so .
That 's one of the benefits of SIPs construction … make sure to follow the progress and costs of Copeland 's home through completion , or buy a green house kit for yourself .
We 'll check back when everything is done and complete with the stamp of being lived in .

In 2002 , the president of the National Federation of the Blind asked Kurzweil about portable reading technology ; though his reading machine had gotten smaller , it still resided on a desktop .
" There 's a lot of printed material that you do n't want to bring back to your desk - or you can't - like a sign on a wall or a bank ATM display , " Kurzweil says .
In the decades that followed , much of the scanning and speech technology Kurzweil developed evolved into the scanners and scanning software now built into many printers and PCs .
Burlington - based Nuance Communications Inc. sells several software products originally created by Kurzweil to convert printed documents into text .
Kurzweil released his first reading machine , developed in partnership with the National Federation for the Blind , in 1976 ; on the day it was unveiled , TV anchor Walter Cronkite used its speech synthesizer as he signed off the air .
The device could scan printed pages , decipher the letters , and speak the words aloud .
It was about the size of a washing machine and cost $ 50,000 .
Stevie Wonder bought the first production model , Kurzweil recalls .
The software that translates the text in high - resolution digital photos into speech is made by KNFB Reading Technologies Inc. in Wellesley Hills .
It was developed by Ray Kurzweil , the local inventor who has been coming up with technological breakthroughs for the blind since the mid-1970s .
But as with many of his innovations , Kurzweil plans for the software to be useful - perhaps incredibly useful - to sighted users in a few years from now .
" At work , I can take a picture of two different documents to figure out which is which , " says Smith , who works for John Hancock .
" At home , if I 'm making chili , I can take a picture of a can to make sure it 's the kidney beans before I open it . "
Smith developed a degenerative eye disease when he was 18 , and he is now legally blind .
It has been about two decades since he could read a restaurant menu independently .
He first heard about the phone on a podcast series called " Blind Cool Tech " and took out a low - interest loan to buy it .
But then it becomes apparent what 's unique about Smith 's phone :
A flash goes off when he snaps a picture of the menu , and a few seconds later , his phone has translated the page of text into speech , and started reciting the options through his earpiece at a rapid clip .
When Peter Alan Smith pulls out his phone in a crowded Back Bay restaurant , there 's no clue that his Nokia is by far the most expensive mobile phone in the entire place .
He has about $ 2,400 in software loaded onto the $ 600 device .
Kurzweil predicted a pocket - size reading machine was only about six years away .
Kurzweil and the federation began collaborating to develop the necessary software .
It had to be smart enough to interpret a photo taken at any angle , in any sort of lighting , with random images sometimes in the background .
An interim device , released in 2006 , married a Canon digital camera with a personal digital assistant ; it sold for $ 3,500 .
The cellphone version debuted earlier this year .
It works only on a Nokia N82 phone , which features a built - in 5 - megapixel camera , with flash .
The camera offers spoken feedback to the user as to whether it has captured the entire page .
After about 20 or 30 seconds of processing the image and turning it into text , it starts speaking .
The standard phone with software sells for $ 2,145 , but also includes a talking GPS system , and the ability to read any Web page to its user , among other features .
( It 's also good at identifying the denominations on printed money . )
James Gashel , vice president of business development for KNFB Reading Technologies , is also a user of the device .
" I do n't use it to read books , " he says , " but I use it for the daily mail , business cards , and brochures .
I was at a Catholic men's retreat over the weekend , and I used it to read the schedule . "
Gashel says there are about 1.3 million blind people in the United States ; since February , the company has sold " thousands " of the readers , he says .
But the population of dyslexics is about three times larger .
A new version of the mobile phone reader will soon be available that is targeted to them .
" These are people who can see print , but have difficulty tracking from word to word , " Gashel says .
" So this new version of the software helps people whose problem is that they get lost in a series of words on a page . "
Still more intriguing is how the phone might assist other users .
A prototype in Kurzweil 's lab is able to photograph a document in any of seven different languages and translate it into English , Kurzweil says he has demonstrated it in public appearances , taking a photo of text in French and having the phone read it in English .
It sounds a bit like Douglas Adams 's fictional Babel fish - a universal translator .
" We call it ' snap and translate , ' " he says .
How soon will it be available ?
" Two or three years , " says Kurzweil , adding that he is talking to cellphone manufacturers .
" We also have a prototype of speech to speech translation , where you can speak in one language and have it come out in another , " he says .
" Right now , that requires a bit more computation than a cellphone can support , " though he notes that phones are getting more powerful each year .
As it turned out , Smith did n't really need to have his phone read the menu to him last month at the Parish Cafe .
He had been to the restaurant several years ago and remembered eating a tasty steak sandwich .
So that 's what he ordered , and we spent the meal talking about his experiences running the Boston Marathon and his tandem cycling hobby .
He says he uses the reader several times a day , about equally at home and at work .
He told me he 's amazed by what the KNBF software can do - " it 's a portable eye , essentially " - but that he 's hoping the cost will come down , so more blind and visually impaired people can afford it .
" The cost is prohibitive , " he says .
Gashel says , " I think the cost of the phone will come down as the product expands in terms of who it can reach .
The bigger the customer base , the more we can bring the price down . "
Still , he says , $ 2,100 is n't that expensive when it comes to technology for the blind .
He says he recently purchased a personal digital assistant that can render phone numbers and appointments in Braille , for $ 4,500 , and also paid $ 5,500 for a flat - screen TV .
" And I ca n't even see it , " he quips .
" But the people who come to my house seem to like it . "

Last month , Mr. Milani , 57 , placed his house , in the North Druid Hills neighborhood , a few miles northeast of downtown , on sale for $ 9.88 million .
A prominent builder of McMansions in a city that once could barely consume enough of them , Mr. Milani has fallen on financial hard times as the demand for real estate has waned .
Twice he has narrowly avoided foreclosure on his home .
Although he recently sold five houses , he is losing money on five other unsold ones and must repay multiple loans .
The notion of someone selling a replica of the presidential mansion  possibly to a buyer in Dubai  is both humorous and painful to Atlantans , who are enduring one of the country ’s highest foreclosure rates , which they attribute , in part , to policies that come from the real White House .
The forced sale of one of the city ’s most expensive homes , owned by someone who made his fortune in homebuilding , makes clear the widespread nature of the real estate collapse .
“ The housing crisis has affected people at all income levels , ” said Mary Norwood , a member of the Atlanta City Council .
“ This has been devastating to the whole economy . ”
Ever wondered how can a baby chimp become smarter than a human child ?
Well all they need is love , according to researchers .
A new study has revealed that in the first nine months after birth , chimpanzees can be smarter than human babies , if they get special " mothering " though people have the edge later in life , the Daily Mail reported .
In fact , the researchers at University of Portsmouth , have based their findings on an analysis of tests of cognitive ability , which they carried out on human and chimp babies .
They gave 46 baby chimps the same cognitive tests given to human babies , measuring how they reacted to emotional stimuli such as sound and objects , and found that those who are put on a special course of emotionally based , loving care from zookeepers were more cognitively advanced than human children of the same age given loving care by their natural parents .
But humans took over after the age of nine months , the study found .
Lead researcher Professor Kim Bard said : " Those given responsive care were less easily stressed , less often attached to ' comfort blankets ' , had healthier relationships with their caregivers and were less likely to develop stereotype rocking .
According to the researchers , the study proved that young chimpanzees , like humans , need emotional support as well as physical support to become " well - adjusted " adults .
" The study acted as a stark warning that looking after just an infant 's physical needs was likely to result in a kid who 's maladjusted , unhappy and under- achieving .
The attachment system of infant chimpanzees appears surprisingly similar to that found in human infants .
" Early experiences , either of warm , responsive care - giving or of extreme deprivation , have a dramatic impact on emotional and cognitive outcomes in chimpanzees and humans , " she said .
Chimps are the closest living relatives to humans and both evolved from a common ape ancestor some five million years ago .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
What a turnaround for the American Dream !
According to a report released Wednesday , the real estate market bust and stock market declines have carved a huge chunk out of the assets of baby boomers .
So much home equity has been lost that 30 % of boomers , aged 45 to 54 , are underwater in their homes , according to " The Wealth of the Baby Boom Cohorts After the Collapse of the Housing Bubble . "
The report , released by D.C. - based think tank the Center for Economic and Policy Research , also found that 18 % of boomers aged 55 to 64 would owe money at close if they sold their homes .
The CEPR also found that people who were renting homes in 2004 will have more wealth in 2009 than those who were owners .
That 's true for all five wealth groups the study analyzed , from the poorest to the wealthiest .
" The collapse of the housing bubble , which led to the current recession , has already destroyed almost $ 6 trillion dollars in housing wealth for homeowners , " said report co-author Dean Baker .
" This reality is compounded by the recent collapse of the stock market .
Many baby boomers will only have Social Security and Medicare to rely on in their retirement . "
Three cases
Boomers between 45 and 54 have lost 45 % of their median net worth , leaving them with just $ 80,000 in net worth , including home equity , according to the report .
Older boomers have fared marginally better .
Those between 55 and 64 have lost 38 % of their net worth , leaving them with $ 140,000 .
But this group is rapidly nearing retirement age and they have few working years left to make up the losses .
To come up with their estimates Baker and co-author David Rosnick analyzed the assets of boomer - headed families and projected their wealth through September 2009 .
They used data from the November 2008 Case - Shiller 20 City Price Index as well as the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finance - a survey of the balance sheet , pension , income , and other demographic characteristics of U.S. families put out by the Federal Reserve .
The authors then factored in stock and housing market changes since then .
Baker and Rosnick presented their findings by income group under three scenarios they considered most likely :
House prices remain at November 2008 levels ( the latest data they had ) ; house prices fall by 5 % from November levels ; or house prices fall by 15 % .
In all three cases , the vast majority of these families will have lost a substantial portion of their net wealth compared with 2004 .
" We 've always boasted about how mobile we are as a society , " said Baker , " but this can make us a lot less mobile . "
A better deal
Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital , an investment firm specializing in overseas investments and a noted bear on housing market issues , thinks there 's a good chance home prices will continue their steep decline .
" Real estate has to be priced like any other goods , " he said .
" Home prices have to reflect the economic reality .
You buy for shelter , not to make money .
You do n't need to own a house .
I 'm a perfect example . "
He has rented for years and reports that the owners of his current home , after subtracting for property taxes and insurance , are receiving a cash - flow return on their investment of less than 1 % .
" Real estate is overpriced if owners get just a 1 % return , " he said .
Baker pointed out that the stock market and home equity losses magnify the importance of safeguarding programs like Social Security and Medicare , the twin safety nets that could provide a higher portion of retirement support than many boomers originally bargained for .
" Now that tens of millions of families have just seen much of their wealth disappear , " he said , " it is especially important to pursue policies that ensure retirement security for those on the brink of retirement . "

The object of a Top Bar Hive ( TBH ) is to be easy and cheap to construct , easy to work and having natural sized cells .
A Kenya style ( sloped sides ) is so that the combs are more naturally strong and less likely to break and collapse when they are full of honey .
This hive worked very well with no comb collapses .
The small combs are easy to handle and not nearly as fragile as large free hanging combs .
The pictures are , from left to right : Kenya style Top Bar Hive being constructed .
The sides are one by twelves 46 1/2 " long .
The bottom is a one by six 46 1/ 2 " long .
The ends are one by twelves 15 " long .
None of the boards is ripped or beveled .
They are just cut for length and nailed together .
The sides are spread to where they fit the ends and the ends are nailed .
I ended up using deck screws on the end because when I pried the bars over I would pry the end off of the hive .
With bees .
The top bars are ripped from one bys with a beveled comb guide glued and nailed on .
You can see a bar on top of the hive on the right end .
The brood nest is 1 1/4 " wide bars and the honey is 1 1/2 " wide bars
These bars are 15 " long .

The entrance to the KTBH is just the front bar back from the front at least 3/8 " The top sets on top of a 3 / 4 " top bar so the entrance is 3/4 " high and 3/8 " wide and is really just the gap in front of the first bar .

Tanzanian Top Bar Hive Long medium depth hive .
This one has top bars in it instead of frames .
On the right is comb from long medium top bar hive .
The entrance is just a propped up migratory cover and the front bar back 3/8 " from the front .
The advantage to this one is that standard medium frames fit in it so if it needs resources from one of my other hives I can get a frame of brood that fits .
Also , I can start one with some frames of brood from one of my other hives ( which are all mediums ) .
I have n't seen any more attachment with this hive than the sloped sides .

Comb Measurements
Just to show some measurements .
Here is a brood comb from my Kenya Top Bar Hive .
To measure , start at the 10 mm mark and count over 10 cells .
Looks like 4.7 cm for ten cells to me .
That 's 4.7 mm .
The second one shows how to measure cell size across ten cells .
Notice I started at 10 cm because it's hard to say precisely where zero is .
Left to right : natural comb , blowup of natural comb , Dadant 4.9 mm , Dadant normal brood .
FAQs Question : Some people say that TBH 's do n't winter well in cold climates .
Do they ?
Answer : I have them in Nebraska and others have them places as cold as Casper Wyoming .
I have heard only one report from anyone keeping bees in top bar hives that they do n't overwinter well in cold climates .
Other than that , I have only heard it from people who have not attempted it .
It is a good plan to get the cluster to one end at the beginning of winter so they can work their way to the other end over winter .
If they are in the middle they may work their way to one end and starve with stores at the other end .
The bigger problems are having top bar hives in very HOT climates and yet people seem to do that as well .
I have the most problems on the over a hundred degree F days ( 38° C ) when I have comb collapses .
Question : Top Bar Hives were developed in Africa right ?
So it 's a tropical hive ?
Answer : Actually they were developed in Greece thousands of years ago , and then used in many other places .
But the real concern seems to be that there is a belief that bees wo n't move horizontally .
Obviously this is not true .
I 've seen hives in hollow horizontal branches , I 've seen them in floors , and I 've overwintered them in Horizontal hives , both TBHs and Langstroth frame hives .
Bees do tend to only move in one direction when clustered and have trouble changing direction in a cluster in the cold .
But they do n't seem to care if that direction is horizontal or vertical .
Trough hives ( chest hives , or whatever else you wish to call a horizontal hive ) have been kept in Scandinavian countries for centuries .
According to Eva Crane horizontal hives are now and have always been the most popular form of hive from Scandinavia to the tropics .
" It makes very little difference whether the hives are made so as to occupy a perpendicular or horizontal position , i.e. , whether their height be greater than their length , or whether their length be greater than their height .
The bees know how to accommodate themselves to circumstances .
They enter and inhabit a perpendicular hollow trunk just as well as a horizontal hollow branch of a tree . " -- Jan Dzierzon , Rational Bee-Keeping , 1882 English edition , pg 47 Question :
Without a queen excluder how do you keep the queen out of the honey ?
Answer : I do n't use a queen excluder on regular hives either .
The queen is not looking to lay all over the place .
When you end up with brood in honey supers in a Langstroth hive it 's because one of two things has happened .
Either the queen was looking for a place to lay some drone brood , which you did n't allow in the brood nest because of either culling it or using only worker foundation ; or the queen needed to expand the brood nest or swarm .
Would you rather they swarm ?
The bees want a consolidated brood nest .
They do n't want brood everywhere .
Some people try to have some capped honey as their " queen excluder " .
I do the opposite .
I try to get them to expand the brood nest as much as possible to keep them from swarming and to get a bigger force to gather the honey .
So I add empty bars in the brood nest during prime swarm season .
Question :
How do you harvest the honey from a top bar hive ?
Answer :
You can either do crush and strain or you can cut it for comb honey .
If you really want to , Swienty has an extractor that will work with top bar hives .
But if you only have a few hives an extractor is seldom worth the expense .
Question : Some people say a top entrance lets the heat out .
How do you do your entrances ?
Answer :
In any hive ( top bar or otherwise ) I think a top entrance in the winter is always a good plan .
It lets out the moisture and cuts down on condensation .
Heat is seldom the problem , condensation is the problem in winter .
A top entrance will let it out .
Mine are all JUST top entrances .
The reason I went with them was the skunks .
My first TBH have a bottom entrance and the skunks were a serious problem .
After going to the top entrances they have ceased being a problem .
My entrances are simply the gap at the front of the hive between the first bar and the front wall .
No holes to drill .
Question : Does a KTBH have less attachments than a TTBH ?
Answer :
In my experience no .
I only know of one TBH beekeeper who actually seems to think so .
Most have had the same experience as I have , which is that they do little attachment either way .
Question :
How do you treat for Varroa in a top bar hive ?
Answer : I do n't .
I depend on the smaller natural cell size .
But you could put a hole in and use oxalic acid vapor or you could drizzle oxalic acid or you could use powdered sugar .
Question :
How do you feed a top bar hive ?
Answer : Since I usually only feed for emergencies , dry sugar on the bottom ( if it 's not screened ) works fine .
Spray it with a little water to get them interested in eating it and to get it clumped so the house bees do n't carry it out .
You could use a baggie feeder on the bottom or , if you build it to take Langstroth frames you could put a frame feeder in or , if not , you could build one to fit .
The long mediums I can use most anything that could be used on a regular hive .
In the long medium I 've usually used frame feeders with floats in them .
Question :
What is different about the management of a top bar hive or long hive ?
Answer :
The most important concept to grasp with any natural comb hive is that one good comb leads to another in the same way that one bad comb leads to another .
You can not afford to not be paying attention to how they start off .
The most common cause of a mess of comb is leaving the queen cage in as they always start the first comb from that and then the mess begins .
I can't believe how many people want to " play it safe " and hang the queen cage .
They obviously can't grasp that it is almost a guarantee of failure to get the first comb started right , which without intervention is guaranteed to mean every comb in the hive will be messed up .
Once you have a mess the most important thing is to make sure the LAST comb is straight as this is always the guide for the NEXT comb .
You can't take a " hopeful " view that the bees will get back on track .
They will not .
You have to put them back on track .
This has nothing to do with wires or no wires .
Nothing to do with frames or no frames .
It has to do with the last comb being straight .
The need for frequent harvesting to keep space in the honey area open .
The need for empty bars in the brood nest during prime " reproductive " swarm season to expand the brood nest more and prevent swarming .
The need to have the cluster at one end of the hive at the beginning of winter ( at least in Northern climates ) so they do n't work their way to one end and subsequently starve while leaving stores at the opposite end because of indecision .
This is easily done by simply moving the bars containing the cluster to one end and putting the bars they replaced at the other .
With the entrance on the end this is almost never a problem .
With the entrance in the middle you are almost guaranteed to have this problem .
The need to handle combs more carefully .
You need to be aware of the angle of the comb with the earth .
Anytime you get flatways with a comb that is very heavy it 's likely to break .
Keep the combs " hanging " in tune with gravity .
You can flip them over but you have to rotate them with the flat of the comb vertical and not horizontal .
You also need to check for attachments to walls , floor and other combs before you pull a comb out .
Cut these attachments first if they are there .
Question :
Which makes more honey ?
A top bar hive or a Langstroth hive ?
Answer :
It comes down to management differences .
If you have the TBH where you can get to it easily and you check it weekly during a heavy flow and manage their space by harvesting frequently , I think it 's about even .
If the TBH is in an outyard and you do n't get there often or even if it's in your backyard and you do n't get there often , the Langstroth will probably make more honey .
While a TBH takes more FREQUENT manipulation it does not take more labor as you do n't have to lift and move boxes around when doing inspections .
Question : Can I put a screened bottom board on my TBH ?
Answer :
You can .
But I would n't leave the whole thing open as this will be too much ventilation .
Question : How can you have too much ventilation ?
Is n't ventilation a good thing ?
Answer :
Of course in the winter , too much ventilation means too much heat loss .
But even in the summer the bees are cooling the hive by evaporation , so on a hot day the inside of the hive may be cooler than the outside air .
So too much ventilation could result in the bees being unable to maintain a cooler temperature inside .
When wax heats up past the normal operating temperatures of a hive (> 93 F ) it gets very weak and combs can collapse .
Question : On Langstroth hives you often have a top and bottom vent to get sufficient ventilation .
Should I provide cross ventilation in my TBH ?
Answer :
Bees seem to have more trouble ventilating a vertical hive with no vent at the top .
They have to force dry air ( which wants to go down ) up to the top and hot moist air at the top ( which wants to go up ) , back down and out the bottom .
It 's sort of like walking 20 miles to school , uphill both ways .
So a top vent or top entrance in a vertical hive seems to be very helpful as it allows the hot moist air out the top which sucks the dry air in the bottom .
With a horizontal hive , this is not an issue .
They just move the air in a circular fashion in one side and back out the other side and out the door .
Sort of like a nice level walk with no hills .
This seems to work well .
With cross ventilation ( such as a front and back vent or entrance ) the wind may blow through the hive and that may be a bad thing .
Question : Do n't I need a landing board on the entrance ?
Answer : No .
Have you ever seen a bee tree with a landing board ?
Landing boards just give mice a place to jump on to get in the hive .
It 's not needed at all for the bees and is , in my opinion , counterproductive because of mice .
Question :
What 's the optimum length for a TBH ?
Answer :
In my experience , something around four feet seems to be good .
Less is difficult to keep them from swarming .
More is hard to get the bees to occupy the whole length .
Brother Adam 's research on bees and hives shows the maximum long hive he encountered was five feet long .
Question :
Why can't I make all the bars the same width ?
Answer :
You can .
But regardless of what you do , the bees wo n't build all the combs the same width , so it 's difficult to keep them on the bars .
If you want to build them all the same width , I 'd make them all 1 1/4 " wide and make a lot of 1/ 4 " spacers to put in between when the bees decide to make fatter combs to get them back in the center of the bars .
Question :
What 's the best comb guide ?
Answer : Except for the wax filled groove , there 's nothing wrong with any kind of commonly used guide from a strip of foundation waxed in a groove to a triangular guide , but there are advantages and disadvantages .
In my opinion the one with the most advantages and least disadvantages is the triangular wooden guide .
The bees follow it the most reliably and attach it the most solidly .
I like a wax starter strip the least as it's fragile and hot weather can cause them to fall off .
I think the least reliable would be dribbling a bead across a plain bar .
This is at best a slight suggestion and as a guide it is often a complete failure .
Question :
Do I have to put wax on the wooden guide ?
Answer : No .
I not only do n't put beeswax on the wood comb guides , I do n't recommend it .
The wax you put on the guide will not be attached as well as what the bees will attach the comb .
So it actually weakens the connection to dip the edge of the guide in beeswax .
In my experience , the bees will not follow the guide any better or worse with or without the wax .
Question : Can I build a slatted rack into my TBH ( or any other fancier piece of equipment ) ?
Answer : Of course .
But to me the most attractive thing about a top bar hive , aside from not having to lift boxes , is its simplicity .
I prefer to keep it as simple as practical .
Question : Did n't the Langstroth hive take over from the Top Bar Hive because it was superior ?
Answer : I 'd have to say that Europeans and Americans never had top bar hives until very recently .
The Greeks had them hundreds if not thousands of years ago and still do today , but Americans were not looking for an improvement over a top bar hive as they had never seen or heard of one at the time the Langstroth came out .
They were looking for an improvement over a log gum ( in the US ) and the skep ( in Europe ) .
And a top bar hive is a huge step above either .
A top bar hive solves all of the same problems that the Langstroth does ( removable comb ) with less cost and less work to build .
It gives someone with very basic tools an scrap lumber a way to get a moveable comb hive for next to nothing , if not nothing .
The Langstroth did not displace the top bar hive .
The Langstroth has never been in any competition for acceptance with the top bar hive until quite recently .
And so far the Langstroth is losing ground .
Why a top bar hive ?
Why not a top bar hive ?
It seems a lot of people get into top bar hives with a lot of misconceptions .
They seem to think that a top bar hive is “ natural ” and there is no other way to have a natural hive of bees .
I ’m not exactly sure where this comes from , but I suppose part of it is that a typical top bar hive has natural comb and a typical Langstroth hive has foundation .
But I have seen top bar hives done with foundation , and I have thousands of foundationless frames in Langstroth hives .
So if your only reason for going with a top bar hive is to get natural comb , you have other alternatives .
Another is the belief that the shape is more natural .
I ’d have to say any shape is natural .
I ’ve seen bees in soffits , gas tanks , walls of houses , floors of houses ... bees are n’t particular about the shape .
I see nothing more or less natural about a top bar hive .
Another is that you want a horizontal hive .
But you can build a horizontal Langstroth hive .
I have a few and they do just as well as the top bar hives .
I think the real reason for a top bar hive is that you can build it from scraps for next to nothing AND you get the above benefits , to wit : natural comb , ( with both natural cell size and clean chemical free wax ) no boxes to lift ( horizontal ) .
If you want all of these in one combination , then a top bar hive is for you .
Reasons you might not want a top bar hive .
A top bar hive , because it has a limited and fairly constant space , requires more frequent interventions to manage it well .
This is not a problem when it ’s in your back yard and you ca n’t wait to get into the hive .
But it ’s very inconvenient if it ’s somewhere further away where you have to drive there .
Proponent or opponent ?
I have been accused of being a top bar proponent most often .
I consider myself neither a proponent nor an opponent .
I have several and enjoy them a lot .
I tell how to build and manage one here for that reason .
But if all you want is natural comb , I ’d recommend a Langstroth with foundationless frames .
If all you want is to get natural comb and no lifting , then I ’d put foundationless in a horizontal Langstroth hive .
If you also want to be able to build it easily and cheaply I ’d recommend a top bar hive .
Typical mistakes I see newbees make with TBH :
They buy a nuc for a TBH that cannot take Langstroth frames .
If you want bees on something other than the cells size or frame size your nucs are available in , then you should buy a package .
Yes , you ’ll find some “ chop and crop ” videos out there that make it look easy to take a nuc and chop it down to a top bar .
Keep in mind these are ideal conditions ( wax comb and not plastic which is more likely in your nuc , maybe no wires , or very fragile ones etc. ) with an expert doing the work .
You will most likely not be so lucky and if you ’re a beginner you will ( and should ) be very intimidated by this undertaking .
Probably the newbee 's logic is someone told them nucs were better without considering the other ramifications .
For some reason the magazines and books seem to assume that everyone wants bees in ten frame deep Langstroths .
They hang the queen cage and get a first messed up comb because of the queen cage .
They will always build the first comb from the cage and subsequent combs parallel to that one .
So you have now doomed every comb in your hive to be messed up .
Hanging the queen cage to “ be safe ” , is not “ being safe ” .
Direct release her .
Yes , they MIGHT abscond , but in my experience they will do it with or without the queen .
Typically they like the one next door better and leave that one there anyway .
They buy or build a TBH that is far too small .
You only have a limited space to work with and no supers to add on , so if you start with a very small TBH it will swarm .
Constantly .
You need to start with a large one and manage the space well .
They are afraid to fix messed up comb .
One bad comb leads to another .
One good comb leads to another .
If you have bad comb , wishful thinking will not fix the next comb .
It will be messed up unless you make the last comb a straight one by whatever means is necessary .
Having a frame you can tie a comb into is good to have .
Then you can always create a straight comb .
Another solution is to find a straight comb and put it at the point they are building comb and put the messed up comb at the front ( assuming you do n’t tie it into frames or remove it ) .
Empty bars between drawn brood combs will keep them busy building straight combs .
Just do n’t spread them too thin .
They need to be able to fill that gap with festooning bees quickly .
They harvest all the honey and there is no fall flow and no drawn comb for the bees to put stores in .
I would harvest only a little at a time during the flow and try to leave them plenty for winter .
This requires a bit of forethought and you probably are not aware how fast conditions can change .
To take an old gun saying “ aim small miss small ” .
If they lose a hive they blame something that is handy , like that it ’s a top bar hive , or something they did , which may or may not have made a difference .
Hives die sometimes .
Sometimes they cold starve ( starve with stores in the hive ) .
Sometimes they starve ( starve with no food in the hive ) .
Sometimes they just dwindle in the fall or end up queenless after a swarm .
Try to be objective about what might be the problem .
If they outright starved , then you harvested too much or did n’t feed enough .
But some things are beyond your control and all the above issues happen in Langstroth hives just as much as Top Bar Hives .
These are n’t so much limited to top bar hives , but seem to be common issues with newbees trying to be natural , which includes people going to top bar hives :
They wo n’t feed at all .
Feeding is not a “ right or wrong ” kind of thing .
It is the kind of thing that should be done for the right reasons and avoided for the right reasons .
Flows are hard to predict and even the bees fail at it sometimes .
If you never feed they will starve sooner or later .
Feed when you have a reason .
If you want natural bees then try to manage them so you do n’t have to , but if you mess up and harvest too much or the fall flow fails , feed them .
There is nothing productive about letting them starve .
Feeding might be unnatural , but harvesting their honey is too .
You may have created the problem .
Related to this is you should have a plan on how to feed them .
It may take some work and time to implement some of the plans , so have a feeder in mind and make sure you have it on hand .
They wo n’t smoke at all because they think it upsets the bees .
Of course this is backwards .
What upsets the bees is when you open a hive with no smoke or far too much or far too hot of smoke .
The right amount of smoke is a proven thing since man first started to work with bees .
Contrary to popular belief , I do not think it makes them think their house is on fire .
It simply interferes with their sense of smell .
If it really made them think their house were on fire , then you would be able to get them to abandon their home because of it .
I have never been able to produce enough smoke to make them abandon their home .
I have , however been able to make enough to asphyxiate them .
Of course that is hundreds of times more smoke than needed to calm them .
Michael Bush Copyright 2006 by Michael Bush Bush Bees Home
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- A Russian billionaire and former KGB agent is buying a controlling stake in the venerable Evening Standard , the London newspaper announced Wednesday .
The Evening Standard was sold for the token sum of £ 1 .
Alexander Lebedev , 49 , already owns the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta , one of the few pro-democracy newspapers in Russia .
Lebedev is buying the Evening Standard for £ 1 , or $ 1.38 , a spokesman for the deal told CNN .
While it sounds like a steal , the purchase price is more symbolic than reflective of the paper 's worth .
With it , Lebedev also assumes the unprofitable paper 's debts .
The Standard reported it is the first time a Russian business magnate and former member of a foreign intelligence service has owned a British title .
Lebedev told The Guardian newspaper this month that he read the Evening Standard when he was a spy working at the Soviet Embassy in London in the late 1980s .
" I had to read every newspaper , " he told The Guardian .
" I had to read the FT ( Financial Times ) , The Guardian , Standard , and the Daily Mail . "
Lebedev said the Standard was " a very good newspaper " with some " brilliant journalists . "
The oligarch said he had no intention of interfering in British politics and vowed a hands - off approach , telling The Guardian , " My influence would be next to zero . "
Top management of Daily Mail and General Trust ( DMGT ) , which is selling its controlling interest to Lebedev , said the move ensures continued investment in the 182 - year - old paper .
" We believe that the agreement announced today is in the best interests of the staff and our shareholders , " said Martin Morgan , chief executive of DMGT .
" The investment planned by Mr. Lebedev secures the future of the paper . "
Lebedev owns 49 percent of Novaya Gazeta together with former Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev .
A journalist from the newspaper was killed Monday in Moscow when she tried to intervene in the fatal shooting of a Russian human rights lawyer , Russian media reported .
In addition to owning Novaya Gazeta , Lebedev is also chairman of the board of the National Reserve Corporation , which is the majority shareholder in National Reserve Bank , one of Russia 's largest .
Lebedev also owns 30 percent of Russian airline Aeroflot and shares in finance and energy companies , including Russian energy giant Gazprom .
After serving in the Russian parliament , the Duma , Lebedev formed a new political party last September .
The Independent Democratic Party of Russia campaigns for legal and economic reform , a stronger role for parliament , and the expansion of Russia 's independent media .
Lebedev is purchasing the Evening Standard with his son , Evgeny , 28 .
" The Lebedev family is delighted to be investing in the Evening Standard , " Lebedev said in a statement .
" We are strong supporters of a free and independent press and we greatly admire the Evening Standard as an iconic publication with its pedigree of fine journalism and commentary . "
Evgeny Lebedev already has hefty business dealings in London and elsewhere in Europe .
He owns stakes in several London restaurants , he runs a men's fashion company that has shows at Paris Men 's Fashion Week , and he has interests in hotels in Italy , France , and Switzerland .
Forbes Magazine listed Alexander Lebedev as the world 's 358th - richest person last year , worth $ 3.1 billion .
Forbes said Lebedev made most of his money through investments in banking and insurance companies and in Aeroflot .

Scheduled to appear in Portsmouth District Court on Feb. 17 , Eric Rieseberg , 59 , of 300 Wentworth Road , New Castle , is charged with class A misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct and criminal threatening .
The disorderly charge alleges that on Nov. 4 , 2008 , Rieseberg said to attorney Ryan Russman , " You �re a f-ing ( expletive ) and words to provoke a violent reaction , " according to the complaint by New Castle Police Chief James Murphy .
The threatening charge alleges Rieseberg " put another person in fear " when he crossed Route 1B in New Castle , entered Russman�s " personal space " and raised his voice , yelled , shook his arms and hands " in a manner which appeared to nearly strike ( Russman ) in the face " and " leading him to fear physical contact . "
The controversy began on the morning of Nov. 4 , when Rieseberg was in his yard removing political signs that were planted there without his permission , according to documents filed by Rieseberg�s attorney , Stephen Jeffco .
While Rieseberg pulled the signs , Jeffco reported to the court , Russman walked past with his leashed dog and began yelling , " What are you doing ?
You can�t do that .
Who do you think you are ? "
Rieseberg responded by asking , " Who the ( F - ) are you ? " according to Jeffco .
At that point , Jeffco wrote , Russman " forced his business card onto " Rieseberg , " who was taken back believing Russman was attempting to solicit him as a client " .
After reading the card , Rieseberg said , " Ryan Russman , you are a ( F- ing expletive ) , " according to Jeffco .
Police reports indicate Russman immediately phoned police to say he felt threatened .
A statement by Russman filed with the court says he was " quite nervous and frightened and believed he was about to strike me . "
According to a statement by witness Debbie Orloff , she was riding her bicycle in the area when she saw Rieseberg holding a pile of Democratic political signs , standing in " a menacing posture " and yelling at Russman .
In a motion to the court , Chief Murphy said Rieseberg�s " language combined with physical gestures and in the context of the incident shows that the ( F -) word is used to provoke physical violence . "
" His use of the language , " Murphy wrote , was " not an exercise in free speech . "
In response , Jeffco filed a motion stating he conducted an internet search of the F - word and found 663 million uses " within ten seconds " and results running the " gamut from nouns , adjectives to strong emphatic . "
No ordinary person would have been provoked into violence under the circumstances , Jeffco reported , adding , " Ryan Russman is not an ordinary person in that an ordinary person would not have placed his nose in other people�s business without expecting that behavior to provoke a response . "

Jewish insurgency against Nazi Germany in German - occupied Poland during World War II
Not to be confused with the 1944 Warsaw Uprising
The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising [b ] was the 1943 act of Jewish resistance in the Warsaw Ghetto in German - occupied Poland during World War II to oppose Nazi Germany 's final effort to transport the remaining ghetto population to Majdanek and Treblinka death camps .
After the Grossaktion Warsaw of summer 1942 , in which more than a quarter of a million Jews were deported from the ghetto to Treblinka and murdered , the remaining Jews began to build bunkers and smuggle weapons and explosives into the ghetto .
The left - wing Jewish Combat Organization ( ŻOB ) and right - wing Jewish Military Union ( ŻZW ) formed and began to train .
A small resistance effort to another roundup in January 1943 was partially successful and spurred Polish resistance groups to support the Jews in earnest .
The uprising started on 19 April when the ghetto refused to surrender to the police commander SS - Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop , who ordered the burning of the ghetto , block by block , ending on 16 May .
A total of 13,000 Jews died , about half of them burnt alive or suffocated .
German casualties were probably fewer than 150 , [ citation needed ] with Stroop reporting 110 casualties [ 16 killed + 1 dead /93 wounded ] .
It was the largest single revolt by Jews during World War II .
The Jews knew that the uprising was doomed and their survival was unlikely .
Marek Edelman , the only surviving ŻOB commander , said their inspiration to fight was " to pick the time and place of our deaths " .
According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum , the uprising was " one of the most significant occurrences in the history of the Jewish people " . [ 6 ]
Background
Corner of Żelazna 70 and Chłodna 23 ( looking east ) .
This section of Żelazna street connected the " large ghetto " and " small ghetto " areas of German - occupied Warsaw .
Warsaw Ghetto Map , 15 October 1940
In 1939 , German authorities began to concentrate Poland 's population of over three million Jews into a number of extremely crowded ghettos located in large Polish cities .
The largest of these , the Warsaw Ghetto , collected approximately 300,000 – 400,000 people into a densely packed , 3.3 km2 central area of Warsaw .
Thousands of Jews died due to rampant disease and starvation under SS - und - Polizeiführer Odilo Globocnik and SS - Standartenführer Ludwig Hahn , even before the mass deportations from the ghetto to the Treblinka extermination camp began .
The SS conducted many of the deportations during the operation code - named Grossaktion Warschau , between 23 July and 21 September 1942 .
Just before the operation began , the German " Resettlement Commissioner " SS - Sturmbannführer Hermann Höfle called a meeting of the Ghetto Jewish Council Judenrat and informed its leader , Adam Czerniaków , that he would require 7,000 Jews a day [ 7 ] for the " resettlement to the East " . [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
Czerniaków committed suicide once he became aware of the true goal of the " resettlement " plan .
Approximately 254,000 – 300,000 ghetto residents died at Treblinka ( most murdered outright ) during the two - month - long operation .
The Grossaktion was directed by SS - Oberführer Ferdinand von Sammern - Frankenegg , the SS and police commander of the Warsaw area since 1941 . [ 10 ]
He was relieved of duty by SS - und - Polizeiführer Jürgen Stroop , sent to Warsaw by Heinrich Himmler on 17 April 1943 . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
Stroop took over from von Sammern - Frankenegg following the failure of the latter to pacify the ghetto resistance . [ 13 ]
When the deportations first began , members of the Jewish resistance movement met and decided not to fight the SS directives , believing that the Jews were being sent to labour camps and not to their deaths .
But by the end of 1942 , ghetto inhabitants learned that the deportations were part of an extermination process .
Many of the remaining Jews decided to revolt . [ 14 ]
The first armed resistance in the ghetto occurred in January 1943 . [ 15 ]
On 19 April 1943 , Passover eve , the Germans entered the ghetto .
The remaining Jews knew that the Germans would murder them and they decided to resist to the last . [ 16 ]
While the uprising was underway , the Bermuda Conference was held by the Allies from 19 – 29 April 1943 to discuss the Jewish refugee problem . [ 17 ]
Discussions included the question of Jewish refugees who had been liberated by Allied forces and those who still remained within German - occupied Europe . [ 18 ]
The uprising
January revolt
On 18 January 1943 , the Germans began their second deportation of the Jews , which led to the first instance of armed insurgency within the ghetto .
While Jewish families hid in their so - called " bunkers " , fighters of the ŻZW , joined by elements of the ŻOB , resisted , engaging the Germans in direct clashes . [ 19 ]
Though the ŻZW and ŻOB suffered heavy losses ( including some of their leaders ) , the Germans also took casualties , and the deportation was halted within a few days .
Only 5,000 Jews were removed , instead of the 8,000 planned by Globocnik .
Hundreds of people in the Warsaw Ghetto were ready to fight , adults and children , sparsely armed with handguns , gasoline bottles , and a few other weapons that had been smuggled into the ghetto by resistance fighters .
[ 3 ]
Most of the Jewish fighters did not view their actions as an effective measure by which to save themselves , but rather as a battle for the honour of the Jewish people , and a protest against the world 's silence . [ 16 ]
Preparations
Two resistance organizations , the ŻZW and ŻOB , took control of the ghetto .
They built dozens of fighting posts and executed a number of Nazi collaborators , including Jewish Ghetto Police officers , members of the fake ( German - sponsored and controlled ) resistance organization Żagiew , as well as Gestapo and Abwehr agents ( such as Judenrat member Dr Alfred Nossig , executed on 22 February 1943 ) . [ 20 ]
The ŻOB established a prison to hold and execute traitors and collaborators . [ 21 ] Józef Szeryński , former head of the Jewish Ghetto Police , committed suicide . [ 22 ]

On 19 April 1943 , on the eve of Passover , the police and SS auxiliary forces entered the ghetto .
They were planning to complete the deportation action within three days , but were ambushed by Jewish insurgents firing and tossing Molotov cocktails and hand grenades from alleyways , sewers , and windows .
The Germans suffered 59 casualties and their advance bogged down .
Two of their combat vehicles ( an armed conversion of a French - made Lorraine 37L light armored vehicle and an armored car ) were set on fire by the insurgents ' petrol bombs . [ 23 ]
Following von Sammern - Frankenegg 's failure to contain the revolt , he lost his post as the SS and police commander of Warsaw .
He was replaced by SS - Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop , who rejected von Sammern - Frankenegg 's proposal to call in bomber aircraft from Kraków .
He led a better - organized and reinforced ground attack .
The longest - lasting defense of a position took place around the ŻZW stronghold at Muranowski Square , where the ŻZW chief leader , Dawid Moryc Apfelbaum , was killed in combat .
On the afternoon of 19 April , a symbolic event took place when two boys climbed up on the roof of a building on the square and raised two flags , the red-and - white Polish flag and the blue - and - white banner of the ŻZW .
These flags remained there , highly visible from the Warsaw streets , for four days .[ citation needed ]
During this fight on 22 April , SS officer Hans Dehmke was killed when gunfire detonated a hand grenade he was holding .
When Stroop 's ultimatum to surrender was rejected by the defenders , his forces resorted to systematically burning houses block by block using flamethrowers and fire bottles , and blowing up basements and sewers .
" We were beaten by the flames , not the Germans , " survivor Marek Edelman said in 2007 ; he was deputy commander of the ŻOB and escaped the ghetto in its last days . [ 25 ]
In 2003 , he recalled : " The sea of flames flooded houses and courtyards .
...
There was no air , only black , choking smoke and heavy burning heat radiating from the red - hot walls , from the glowing stone stairs . " [ 26 ]
The " bunker wars " lasted an entire month , during which German progress was slowed . [ 27 ]
While the battle continued inside the ghetto , Polish resistance groups AK and GL engaged the Germans between 19 and 23 April at six different locations outside the ghetto walls , firing at German sentries and positions .
In one attack , three units of the AK under the command of Captain Józef Pszenny ( " Chwacki " ) joined up in a failed attempt to breach the ghetto walls with explosives . [ 28 ]
Eventually , the ŻZW lost all of its commanders .
On 29 April , the remaining fighters from the organization escaped the ghetto through the Muranowski tunnel and relocated to the Michalin forest .
This event marked the end of significant fighting .
At this point , organized defense collapsed .
Surviving fighters and thousands of remaining Jewish civilians took cover in the sewer system and in the many dugout hiding places hidden among the ruins of the ghetto , referred to as " bunkers " by Germans and Jews alike .
The Germans used dogs to detect such hideouts , then usually dropped smoke bombs to force people out .
Sometimes they flooded these so - called bunkers or destroyed them with explosives .
On occasions , shootouts occurred .
A number of captured fighters lobbed hidden grenades or fired concealed handguns after surrendering .
There were also clashes at night between small groups of insurgents and German patrols at night .[ citation needed ]
On 8 May , the Germans discovered a large dugout located at Miła 18 Street , which served as ŻOB 's main command post .
Most of the organization 's remaining leadership and dozens of others committed mass suicide by ingesting cyanide , including Mordechaj Anielewicz , the chief commander of ŻOB .
His deputy Marek Edelman escaped the ghetto through the sewers with a handful of comrades two days later .
On 10 May , Szmul Zygielbojm , a Bundist member of the Polish government in exile , committed suicide in London to protest the lack of action on behalf of the Jews by the Allied governments .
In his farewell note , he wrote :
I cannot continue to live and to be silent while the remnants of Polish Jewry , whose representative I am , are being murdered .
My comrades in the Warsaw Ghetto fell with arms in their hands in the last heroic battle .
I was not permitted to fall like them , together with them , but I belong with them , to their mass grave .
By my death , I wish to give expression to my most profound protest against the inaction in which the world watches and permits the destruction of the Jewish people . [ 29 ]
The suppression of the uprising officially ended on 16 May 1943 , when Stroop personally pushed a detonator button to demolish the Great Synagogue of Warsaw .[ citation needed ]
Besides claiming an estimated 56,065 Jews accounted for ( although his own figures showed the number to be 57,065 ) and noting that " The number of destroyed dug - outs amounts to 631 , " in his official report dated 24 May 1943 , Stroop listed the following as captured booty :
7 Polish Rifles
1 Russian Rifle
1 German Rifle
59 pistols of various calibers
Several hundred hand grenades , including Polish and home - made ones .
Several hundred incendiary bottles
Home - made explosives
Infernal machines with fuses
A large amount of explosives , ammunition for weapons of all calibers , including some machine - gun ammunition .
Regarding the booty of arms , it must be taken into consideration that the arms themselves could in most cases not be captured , as the bandits and Jews would , before being arrested , throw them into hiding places or holes which could not be ascertained or discovered .
The smoking out of the dug - out by our men , also often made the search for arms impossible .
As the dug - outs had to be blown up at once , a search later on was out of the question .
The captured hand grenades , ammunition , and incendiary bottles were at once reused by us against the bandits .
Further booty : 1,240 used military tunics ( part of them with medal ribbons - Iron Cross and East Medal )
600 pairs of used trousers
Other equipment and German steel helmets
108 horses , four captured in the former Ghetto ( hearse ) Up to 23 May 1943 we had counted :
4.4 million Zloty ; furthermore about 5 to 6 million Zloty not yet counted , a great amount of foreign currency , e.g. $ 14,300 in paper and $ 9,200 in gold , moreover valuables ( rings , chains , watches , etc. ) in great quantities .
State of the Ghetto at the termination of the large - scale operation : Apart from 8 buildings ( Police Barracks , hospital , and accommodations for housing working - parties ) , the former Ghetto is completely destroyed .
Only the dividing walls are left standing where no explosions were carried out .
But the ruins still contain a vast amount of stones and scrap material which could be used .
Sporadic resistance continued and the last skirmish took place on 5 June 1943 between Germans and a holdout group of armed Jews without connections to the resistance organizations .

23 - 25 Niska Street
13,000 Jews were killed in the ghetto during the uprising ( some 6,000 among them were burnt alive or died from smoke inhalation ) .
Of the remaining 50,000 residents , almost all were captured and shipped to the death camps of Majdanek and Treblinka .
Jürgen Stroop 's internal SS daily report for Friedrich Krüger , written on 16 May 1943 , stated :
180 Jews , bandits and sub-humans , were destroyed .
The former Jewish quarter of Warsaw is no longer in existence .
The large - scale action was terminated at 20:15 hours by blowing up the Warsaw Synagogue .
...
Total number of Jews dealt with 56,065 , including both Jews caught and Jews whose extermination can be proved .
...
Apart from 8 buildings ( police barracks , hospital , and accommodations for housing working - parties ) the former Ghetto is completely destroyed .
Only the dividing walls are left standing where no explosions were carried out . [ 31 ]
According to the casualty lists in Stroop 's report , German forces suffered a total of 110 casualties – 17 dead ( of whom 16 were killed in action ) and 93 injured – of whom 101 are listed by name , including over 60 members of the Waffen - SS .
These figures did not include Jewish collaborators , but did include the " Trawniki men " and Polish police under his command .
The real number of German losses , however , may be well higher ( the Germans suffered about 300 casualties by Edelman 's estimate ) .
For propaganda purposes , the official announcement claimed the German casualties to be only a few wounded , while propaganda bulletins of the Polish Underground State announced that hundreds of occupiers had been killed in the fighting .

According to Raul Hilberg , " the number cited by Stroop ( 16 dead , 85 wounded ) cannot be rejected out of hand , but it is likely that his list was neither complete , free of errors , nor indicative of the German losses throughout the entire period of resistance , until the absolute liquidation of Jewish life in the ghetto .
All the same , the German casualty figures cited by the various Jewish sources are probably highly exaggerated . " [ 33 ] [ 34 ]
Other historians such as the French L. MacLean[citation needed ] endorse the accuracy of official German casualty figures .
On the other hand , the Stroop report vastly exaggerated the actual losses ( and strength ) of the resistance .[ clarification needed ]
The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was the largest single revolt by Jews during World War II . [ 35 ]
Aftermath
Warsaw Ghetto area after the war .
Gęsia Street , view to the west
After the uprising was over , most of the incinerated houses were razed , and the Warsaw concentration camp complex was established in their place .
Thousands of people died in the camp or were executed in the ruins of the ghetto .
At the same time , the SS were hunting down the remaining Jews still hiding in the ruins .
On 19 April 1943 , the first day of the most significant period of the resistance , 7,000 Jews were transported from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka extermination camp . [ 36 ]
Many purportedly developed resistance groups , and helped to plan and execute the revolt and mass escape of 2 August 1943 .
From May 1943 to August 1944 , executions in the ruins of the ghetto were carried out by : [ 37 ]
Officers of the Warsaw SD facility and the security police , under the supervision of Dr. Ludwig Hahn , whose seat was located in Szuch Avenue ;
Pawiak staff members ;
KL Warschau staff members ;
SS - men from the Third Battalion of the 23rd SS Regiment and the Police ( Battalion III / SS - Polizei Regiment 23 ) , commanded by Major Otton Bundtke . [ c ]
Both open and secret executions carried out in Warsaw were repeatedly led by SS - Obersturmführer Norbert Bergh - Trips , SS - Haupturmführer Paul Werner and SS - Obersturmführer Walter Witossek .
The latter often presided over the police " trio " , signing mass death sentences for Polish political prisoners , which were later pronounced by the ad hoc court of the security police . [ 38 ] [ 39 ]
In October 1943 , Bürkl was tried and condemned to death in absentia by the Polish Resistance 's Special Courts , and shot dead by the AK in Warsaw , a part of Operation Heads that targeted notorious SS officers .
That same month , von Sammern - Frankenegg was killed by Yugoslav Partisans in an ambush in Croatia .
Himmler , Globocnik and Krüger all committed suicide at the end of the war in Europe in May 1945 .
The General Government Governor of Warsaw at the time of the Uprising , Dr. Ludwig Fischer , was tried and executed in 1947 .
Stroop was captured by Americans in Germany , convicted of war crimes in two different trials ( U.S. military and Polish ) , and executed by hanging in Poland in 1952 , along with Warsaw Ghetto SS administrator Franz Konrad .
Stroop 's aide , Erich Steidtmann , was exonerated for " minimal involvement " ; he died in 2010 while under investigation for war crimes .
Sturmbannführer Hermann Höfle who helped carry out the July 1942 Grossaktion Warsaw committed suicide after being arrested in 1962 .
Walter Bellwidt , who commanded a Waffen - SS battalion among Stroop forces , died on 13 October 1965 .
Hahn went into hiding until 1975 , when he was apprehended and sentenced to life for crimes against humanity ; he served eight years and died in 1986 .
SS Oberführer Arpad Wigand who served with von Sammern - Frankenberg as SS and Police Leader in Warsaw from 4 August 1941 to 23 April 1943 was tried for war crimes in Hamburg Germany in 1981 and sentenced to 12.5 years in prison ; died 26 July 1983 .
Walter Reder reportedly served in the SS Panzer Grenadier Training Battalion III ; he served a jail sentence in Italy from 1951 to 1985 for war crimes committed in 1944 in Italy , and died in 1991 .
Josef Blösche was tried for war crimes and executed in 1969 .
Heinrich Klaustermeyer was tried for war crimes in 1965 and died in 1976 .
The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 took place over a year before the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 .
The ghetto had been totally destroyed by the time of the general uprising in the city , which was part of the Operation Tempest , a nationwide insurrection plan .
During the Warsaw Uprising , the Polish Home Army 's Battalion Zośka was able to rescue 380 Jewish prisoners ( mostly foreign ) held in the concentration camp " Gęsiówka " set up by the Germans in an area adjacent to the ruins of former ghetto .
These prisoners had been brought from Auschwitz and forced to clear the remains of the ghetto . [ 40 ]
A few small groups of ghetto residents also managed to survive in the undetected " bunkers " and to eventually reach the " Aryan side " . [ 41 ]
In all , several hundred survivors from the first uprising took part in the later uprising ( mostly in non-combat roles such as logistics and maintenance , due to their physical state and general shortage of arms ) , joining the ranks of the Polish Home Army and the Armia Ludowa .
According to Samuel Krakowski from the Jewish Historical Institute , " The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising had a real influence ... in encouraging the activity of the Polish underground . " [ 42 ]
A number of survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , known as the " Ghetto Fighters " , went on to found the kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta 'ot ( literally : " Ghetto Fighters ' " ) , which is located north of Acre , Israel .
The founding members of the kibbutz include Yitzhak Zuckerman ( Icchak Cukierman ) , who represented the ŻOB on the ' Aryan ' side , and his wife Zivia Lubetkin , who commanded a fighting unit .
In 1984 , members of the kibbutz published Daphei Edut ( " Testimonies of Survival " ) , four volumes of personal testimonies from 96 kibbutz members .
The settlement features a museum and archives dedicated to remembering the Holocaust .
Yad Mordechai , a kibbutz just north of the Gaza Strip , was named after Mordechaj Anielewicz .
In 2008 , Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi led a group of Israeli officials to the site of the uprising and spoke about the event 's " importance for IDF combat soldiers " . [ 43 ]
In 1968 , the 25th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , Zuckerman was asked what military lessons could be learned from the uprising .
He replied :
I do n't think there 's any real need to analyze the Uprising in military terms .
This was a war of less than a thousand people against a mighty army and no one doubted how it was likely to turn out .
This is n't a subject for study in military school . (...)
If there 's a school to study the human spirit , there it should be a major subject .
The important things were inherent in the force shown by Jewish youth after years of degradation , to rise up against their destroyers , and determine what death they would choose : Treblinka or Uprising . [ 44 ]
On 7 December 1970 , West German Chancellor Willy Brandt spontaneously knelt while visiting the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes memorial in the People 's Republic of Poland .
At the time , the action surprised many and was the focus of controversy , but it has since been credited with helping improve relations between the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries .
Many people from the United States and Israel came for the 1983 commemoration . [ 45 ]
The last surviving Jewish resistance fighter , Simcha Rotem , died in Jerusalem on 22 December 2018 , at age 94 . [ 46 ] [ 47 ]
Opposing forces
Jewish
From right : Małka Zdrojewicz , Bluma and Rachela Wyszogrodzka captured after offering armed resistance .
Two Jewish underground organisations fought in the Warsaw Uprising : the left wing Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa ( ŻOB ) founded in July 1942 by Zionist Jewish youth groups within the Warsaw Ghetto ; [ 48 ] and the right wing Żydowski Związek Wojskowy ( ŻZW ) , or Jewish Military Union , a national organization founded in 1939 by former Polish military officers of Jewish background which had strong ties to the Polish Home Army , and cells in almost every major town across Poland . [ 49 ] [ 50 ]
However both organisations were officially incorporated into the Polish Home Army and its command structure in exchange for weapons and training . [ 51 ]
Marek Edelman , who was the only surviving uprising commander from the left - wing ŻOB , stated that the ŻOB had 220 fighters and each was armed with a handgun , grenades , and Molotov cocktails .
His organization had three rifles in each area , as well as two land mines and one submachine gun . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]
Due to its socialist leanings , the Soviets promoted the actions of ŻOB as the dominant or only party in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , a view often adopted by secondary sources in the West . [ 50 ]
The right - wing faction ŻZW , which was founded by former Polish officers , was larger , more established and had closer ties with the Polish resistance , making it better equipped . [ 19 ] [ 56 ]
Zimmerman describes the arms supplies for the uprising as " limited but real " . [ 57 ]
Specifically , Jewish fighters of the ŻZW received from the Polish Home Army : 2 heavy machine guns , 4 light machine guns , 21 submachine guns , 30 rifles , 50 pistols , and over 400 grenades for the uprising . [ 58 ]
During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , ŻZW is reported to have had about 400 well - armed fighters grouped in 11 units , with 4 units including fighters from the Polish Home Army .
Due to the ŻZW 's anti-socialist stand and close ties with the Polish Home Army ( which was subsequently outlawed by the Soviets ) , the Soviets suppressed publication of books and articles on ŻZW after the war and downplayed its role in the uprising , in favour of the more socialist ŻOB .
More weapons were supplied throughout the uprising , and some were captured from the Germans .
Some weapons were handmade by the resistance ; sometimes such weapons worked , other times they jammed repeatedly .
Shortly before the uprising , Polish - Jewish historian Emanuel Ringelblum ( who managed to escape from the Warsaw Ghetto , but was later discovered and executed in 1944 ) visited a ŻZW armoury hidden in the basement at 7 Muranowska Street .
In his notes , which form part of Oneg Shabbat archives , he reported :
They were armed with revolvers stuck in their belts .
Different kinds of weapons were hung in the large rooms : light machine guns , rifles , revolvers of different kinds , hand grenades , bags of ammunition , German uniforms , etc. , all of which were utilized to the full in the April " action " . (...)
While I was there , a purchase of arms was made from a former Polish Army officer , amounting to a quarter of a million złoty ; a sum of 50,000 złoty was paid on account .
Two machine guns were bought at 40,000 złoty each , and a large amount of hand grenades and bombs . [ 59 ] [ 60 ]
Due to the nature of the conflict and that it took place within the confines of German - guarded Warsaw Ghetto , the role of the Polish Home Army was primarily one of ancillary support ; namely , the provision of arms , ammunition and training . [ 56 ] [ 61 ]
Although the Home Army 's stocks were meager , and general provision of arms limited , [ 56 ] the right - wing ŻZW received significant quantities of armaments , including some heavy and light machine guns , submachine guns , rifles , pistols and grenades . [ d ]
Polish
The Polish Home Army also disseminated information and appeals to help the Jews in the ghetto , both in Poland and by way of radio transmissions to the Allies , which fell largely on deaf ears .
[ 62 ] [ citation needed ]
During the uprising , the Polish Resistance units from the Polish Home Army [ 2 ] and the communist Gwardia Ludowa[ citation needed ] attacked German units near the ghetto walls and attempted to smuggle weapons , ammunition , supplies , and instructions into the ghetto .
The failure to break through German defences limited supplies to the ghetto , which was otherwise cut off from the outside world by a German - ordered blockade . [ 28 ]
In mid-April at 4 am , the Germans began to liquidate the Warsaw Ghetto , closed down the remnants of the Jews with a police cordon , went inside tanks and armored cars and carried out their destructive work .
We know that you help the martyred Jews as much as you can , I thank you , my countrymen , on my own and the government 's behalf , I am asking you to help them in my own name and in the government , I am asking you for help and for extermination of this horrible cruelty .

The command of the Home Army ordered its sabotage units , Kedyw , to carry a series of actions around the walls against the German units under the code name Ghetto Action . [ 64 ]
Between 19 and 23 April 1943 , the Polish resistance engaged the Germans at six different locations outside the ghetto walls , shooting at German sentries and positions and in one case attempting to blow up a gate . [ 66 ]
The Polish Home Army fought in 4 units with the ŻZW in Muranowska Street having climbed into the ghetto via secret tunnels dug by the ŻZW .
A National Security Corps unit commanded by Henryk Iwański ( " Bystry " ) reportedly fought inside the ghetto along with ŻZW and subsequently both groups retreated together ( including 34 Jewish fighters ) to the so - called Aryan side .[ 67 ] [ dubious – discuss ]
Several ŻOB commanders and fighters also later escaped through the tunnels with assistance from the Poles and joined the Polish underground ( Home Army ) . [ 62 ]
From April 24 , daily patrols against Germans near the ghetto , aimed at eliminating the Germans and training our own ( Home Army ) branches - up to now without own losses .
Some Germans were eliminated every day .

On the other hand , despite Polish fighters joining the struggle , some survivors criticized gentile Poles for not providing sufficient support .
In her book On Both Sides of the Wall , Vladka Meed , who was a member of the left - wing ŻOB , devoted a chapter to the insufficient support from the Polish resistance . [ 69 ]
Indeed , records confirm that the leftist ŻOB received less weaponry and no fighters from the Polish Home Army , unlike the right - wing ŻZW with whom the Home Army had close ties and ideological similarities . [ 19 ] [ 52 ] [ 57 ]

Ultimately , the efforts of the Jewish resistance fighters proved insufficient against the German occupation system .
According to Hanna Krall , the German task force dispatched to put down the revolt and complete the deportation action numbered 2,090 men armed with a number of minethrowers and other light and medium artillery pieces , several armored vehicles , and more than 200 machine and submachine guns . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]
Its backbone consisted of 821 Waffen - SS paramilitary soldiers from five SS Panzergrenadier reserve and training battalions and one SS cavalry reserve and training battalion .
The other forces were drawn from the Ordnungspolizei ( Orpo ) order police ( battalions from the 22nd and 23rd regiments ) , Warsaw personnel of the Gestapo and the Sicherheitsdienst ( SD ) intelligence service , one battalion each from two Wehrmacht ( Heer ) railroad combat engineers regiments , a Wehrmacht battery of anti-aircraft artillery , a detachment of multinational ( commonly but inaccurately referred to by the Germans and Jews alike as " Ukrainians " [ 70 ] ) ex-Soviet POW " Trawniki - Männer " auxiliary camp guards trained by the SS - Totenkopfverbände at Trawniki concentration camp , and technical emergency corps .
Several Gestapo jailers from the nearby political prison Pawiak , led by Franz Bürkl , volunteered to join the " hunt " for the Jews .
A force of 363 officers from the Polish Police of the General Government ( so - called Blue Police ) was ordered by the Germans to cordon the walls of the ghetto .
Warsaw fire department personnel were also forced to help in the operation . [ 31 ]
Jewish policemen were used in the first phase of the ghetto's liquidation and subsequently summarily executed by the Gestapo . [ 23 ]
Stroop later remarked : [ 13 ]
I had two battalions of Waffen - SS , one hundred army men , units of Order Police , and seventy - five to a hundred Security Police people .
The Security Police had been active in the Warsaw Ghetto for some time , and during this program it was their function to accompany SS units in groups of six or eight , as guides and experts in ghetto matters . [ 71 ]

His casualty lists also include members of four other Waffen - SS training and reserve units ( 1st SS Panzer Grenadier ; 2nd SS Panzer Grenadier ; 4th SS Panzer Grenadier ; 5th SS Panzer Grenadier Training Battalions ) .
Polish police came from the Kommissariarts 1st , 7th and 8th .
There is also evidence that German Police of the SSPF of Lubin took part in the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto Jews , as did the I Battalion of the 17th SS Police Regiment .[ citation needed ]

When you think of wintry precipitation , you probably think of snow , sleet or maybe freezing rain .
But it ’s likely that the word “ graupel ” does n’t come to mind .
Although it sounds more like a German dish than a weather event , graupel is a type of winter precipitation that 's a mix of snow and hail .
Graupel is also known as snow pellets , soft hail , small hail , tapioca snow , rimed snow , and ice balls .
The World Meteorological Organization defines small hail as snow pellets encapsulated by ice , a precipitation halfway between graupel and hail .
How Graupel Forms
Graupel forms when snow in the atmosphere encounters supercooled water .
In a process known as accretion , ice crystals form instantly on the outside of the snowflake and accumulate until the original snowflake is no longer visible or distinguishable .
The coating of these ice crystals on the outside of the snow is called a rime coating .
The size of graupel is typically under 5 millimeters , but some graupel can be the size of a quarter ( coin ) .
Graupel pellets are cloudy or white — not clear like sleet .
Graupel forms fragile , oblong shapes and falls in place of typical snowflakes in wintry mix situations , often in concert with ice pellets .
Graupel is also fragile enough that it will typically fall apart when touched .
Graupel Versus Hail
To tell the difference between graupel and hail , you simply have to touch a graupel ball .
Graupel pellets typically fall apart when touched or when they hit the ground .
Hail is formed when layers of ice accumulate and are very hard as a result .
Graupel commonly forms in high - altitude climates and is both denser and more granular than ordinary snow , due to its rimed exterior .
Macroscopically , graupel resembles small beads of polystyrene .
The combination of density and low viscosity makes fresh layers of graupel unstable on slopes , and some layers result in a high risk of dangerous slab avalanches .
In addition , thinner layers of graupel falling at low temperatures can act as ball bearings below subsequent falls of more naturally stable snow , rendering them also liable to avalanche .
Graupel tends to compact and stabilize ( " weld " ) approximately one or two days after falling , depending on the temperature and the properties of the graupel .
The National Avalanche Center refers to graupel as a " Styrofoam ball type of snow that stings your face when it falls from the sky .
It forms from strong convective activity within a storm ( upward vertical motion ) caused by the passage of a cold front or springtime convective showers .
The static buildup from all these falling graupel pellets sometimes cause lightning as well . "
" It looks and behaves like a pile of ball bearings .
Graupel is a common weak layer in maritime climates but rarer in continental climates .
It 's extra tricky because it tends to roll off cliffs and steeper terrain and collect on the gentler terrain at the bottom of cliffs .
Climbers and extreme riders sometimes trigger graupel avalanches after they have descended steep terrain ( 45 - 60 degrees ) and have finally arrived on the gentler slopes below ( 35 - 45 degrees ) — just when they are starting to relax .
Graupel weak layers usually stabilize in about a day or two after a storm , depending on temperature . "
South Africa followed their test series win over Australia by replacing them at the top of the ranking , taking one day series 4 - 1 with a 39 - run triumph .
They chose to bat in Perth and was anchored in a calm 97 from 117 balls by Hashim Amla , who shared 118 in 23 overs with AB de Villers , who was 6 0 of 71 .

Mark Boucher and Dale Steyn and bowling attack
Still set on the big pictures , Gibbs departed in the next over the edge to the middle of his back vippedør again .
Amla rose at regular six large cuts Ben Hilfenhaus , but Neil McKenzie fell in the first over from James Hopes also trying to advance down the pitch .
The great partnership , followed contained only four boundaries , all of them to de Villiers , but helped create a strong platform .
De Villiers clearly marked entry and the need to expand and sacrificed their Wicket in over 37 laps in the deep mid-Wicket , while Amla fell three short of the first century of the series when he feathered game , a hostage to the user make a late cut .
Duminy selected destroyed Mitchell Johnson over the middle of it for six to 20 came out for the 45th over and added to the wild in the next two overs from Bracken which 92 came from the last 10 and a rigid target was posted .
Ponting made a fas t start as usual with two typical liquid drives through since early in his innings of Tsotsobe .
But they would be his only limits that Debutant continued premium vippedør Australia captain , who top - edge a short trip and wicketkeeper De Villers drove back to the bag matched chance .
Michael Clark fell in the next over , trying to go out from Morne Morkel only ball to glimpse of a bat in pieces .
Tray comes David Warner , who has chosen destroyed Morkel down the ground for four in the third course , flat - batted the paceman over the mid-Wicket for six .
But after reaching 22 , he was rejected for the most unfortunate way to Mike Hussey is the correct drive comes back to the timber , so Parnell and diving Warner was well out of their country .
The Hussey brothers together , but the required run-rate still rose to more than seven per over , because no limit was scored in more than 14 overs .
Home fans had hoped for a partnership of the scope of Amla and de Villiers , but it ended at 69 when David ran innocuous appearance off - spin of Duminy just short covering .
It resulted in Brad Haddin with 167 needed at a rate of 8.1 per over , but increasingly combative Hussey Rode his luck to reach a bold 50 from 72 balls .
Hussey moved down the pitch to flick full Duminy throw bounce rate of four 34 above , only the eighth of the innings , but when the drinks were taken at the end of the course , the requirement was 144 from 16 - nine per over .
Having survived a difficult chance when Botha could not keep a running back from cover , Hussey was batting power play with 37 overs gone , and 131 still needed .
With only three men are allowed outside the circle Hussey tried its best to expedite the launch Tsotsobe over mid-off for six and passes a full shed behind square for four .
But the young sailors had Audacity to send a slower ball , and it completely fooled again to turn back leg stump .
An eventful over cost 19 ended with a huge six over mid-Wicket of Haddin left 108 needed from 66 balls .
The vigilant Botha bowled hope but Haddin fourth four played their fifth ODI fifty from 39 balls .
Albi Morkel injured his leg after a collision with Vaughn van Jaarsveld chase one over the edge in depth , but that does not dampen spirits in South Africa , which was quickly removed again as amiable Tsotsobe appealed for a return catch from Johnson almost as after -- trodde replay confirms a clear dismissal .
Tsotsobe held a catch - all address link to head to Oust Haddin and give Parnell a weed girl and replacement Steyn took the winner 's catch of the bowling of Morne Morkel .

Robotic Suit For Farmers
In Japan
A robot suit for farmers has been demonstrated by Researchers at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology .
I guess you can retire your robomule now .
In the farming robotic exoskeleton picture shown below , a person wearing the suit picks radishes using a wearable assistance machine equipped with eight motors and 16 sensors .
The robotic exoskeleton weighs about 55 pounds and is designed to help elderly farmers who need a bit more support for their legs and joints .
The suit shown is a prototype ; it is expected that the suit will be commercially available in 2 - 3 years for a cost of about $ 5,000 .
The earliest reference to the exoskeleton idea is this non-powered rigid metallic clothing from Edmund Hamilton 's classic 1932 story A Conquest of Two Worlds .
Earth 's scientists solved the problem to some extent by devising rigid metallic clothing not unlike armor which would support the interior human structure against Jupiter 's pull .

Science fiction fans have been thinking about exoskeletons for a long time , from the Hamilton example shown above to Heinlein 's powered suit to more stylish versions like William Gibson 's polycarbon exo .

As congressional negotiators labored over the giant financial bailout plan last week , business leaders saw little to applaud in more than a few of the ideas under discussion , including one that proposed changing the nation ’s bankruptcy laws to make it easier for homeowners to downsize troubled home mortgages .
On Sunday , when the head - butting ended and the dust cleared , a well - funded coalition of banking and mortgage industry lobbyists had reason to celebrate .
The final bill included no changes in federal bankruptcy laws .
Americans who take out loans to purchase cars , boats and even investment properties can file for bankruptcy protection and have a judge restructure their payments .
But that ’s not the case with their home mortgages .
Since 1978 , bankruptcy laws have prohibited judges from adjusting loans on a “ principal residence . ”
Some Democrats had called for the bailout bill to change bankruptcy laws to permit such restructuring as a way to offer something for Main Street America .

But those proponents -- major labor unions , consumer groups and other pillars of the Democratic Party establishment -- proved no match for a coalition that included the American Bankers Assn. , the Mortgage Bankers Assn. and the National Assn. of Home Builders .
Starting with a core of Republicans who adamantly opposed any such change , the coalition persuaded key Democratic leaders in Congress that pushing the idea could doom the rescue effort and endanger the whole economy .
So successful was the effort to portray the bankruptcy idea as a deal breaker that Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , while campaigning in Florida last week , said he thought the proposal was meritorious but did not belong in the emergency bailout bill .
Some analysts saw Obama ’s statement as a practical recognition of political reality : Republicans would never accept the bankruptcy provision , and the bailout plan was too important to the economy to jeopardize .
The Illinois senator ’s position drew cheers from business and banking lobbyists and from Republicans .

Consumer and labor advocates consider Obama a friend , but his statement rankled .
They say that current law has made it more difficult for homeowners to work their way out of difficult financial straits and that a change in the rules would have eased the crisis for all concerned .
The skirmish was part of a larger war waged on Capitol Hill over the last decade .
For years , banking and credit interests fought to make it more difficult for consumers to apply for bankruptcy protection and finally won in 2005 , when Congress passed a bankruptcy revision bill .
But the seven - year battle was so expensive and memorable that advocates were reluctant to reopen any aspect of the issue , especially in the midst of an emotion - charged debate over the financial crisis .
To the backers of the change , Obama ’s statement was an enormous disappointment .
In their view , Obama and the congressional leadership missed an opportunity to amend the bankruptcy code in a way that could have resolved a big part of the current crisis .

“ The heart of the current problem is the foreclosure crisis , ” said Maureen Thompson , legislative director for the National Coalition of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys , which worked with labor and consumer groups pushing the proposal .
“ It is the foreclosures that caused this economy to go into a tailspin . ”
A modification of the bankruptcy law passed in the late 1970s “ would allow people to stay in their homes , make their loan payments , stabilize families , neighborhoods and the real estate market , ” Thompson said .
The business lobbyists countered that modifying bankruptcy law in this fashion would create “ a rush to bankruptcy courts across the country , ” as Joe Belew , president of the Consumer Bankers Assn. , put it in a letter sent to members of the Senate last week .
The Senate version of the bill had included the proposed change .
Republicans on Capitol Hill argued that altering bankruptcy law would raise costs for consumers and businesses and create a boon for trial lawyers , who generally back Democrats .
One e-mail from the business coalition to lawmakers warned that inclusion of the bankruptcy provision would exacerbate the current situation .

“ Authorizing write - downs of mortgages by bankruptcy judges will increase the risks of mortgage lending at a time when the market is already struggling and this will harm consumers by increasing the cost of credit and reducing its availability , ” said the e-mail written jointly by the bankers lobby , the home builders lobby , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others .
Although modification of bankruptcy laws was rejected , the compromise bill approved Sunday contained language encouraging help for homeowners .
Thompson said that provisions to help homeowners were little different from voluntary homeowner protections already in place .
“ My view is that the plan included in the bill is not likely to be effective or fair , ” she said .
“ They missed a real opportunity to help homeowners ” and the nation .
Some in the coalition backing the change have indicated they will nonetheless support the bill .

“ I will reluctantly hold my nose and support this package , ” said Terence O’Sullivan , president of the Laborers ’ International Union of North America , who says his members are livid at the idea of using tax dollars to bail out Wall Street .
The failure to include a bankruptcy law modification “ does n’t sit well with me , ” he said .
“ The bankruptcy provision was a big one for us . ”

Project management is the craft of applying limited resources of time , money , and knowledge to produce a desired result .
We talk too infrequently about limited resources in the free software world .

At first glance , Dan is nothing more than a crappy version of Ryu or Ken ; kind of like an anti-Akuma .
His fists lack any real power , his flashiest move is a super - taunt and nothing , but nothing , is more humiliating than being defeated by one of the piddly little fireballs that whiff out of existence mere inches from his hand .
Above :
Do not be like Cyclops .
Do not EVER be like Cyclops
The thing is , for all his weaknesses he ’s one of the most fun Street Fighter characters to play as .
Sure , Ryu or Guile might be able to kick Bison ’s ass a lot faster , but Dan ’s spirit is unbreakable and his charms are many .
His special moves are a blast to play around with , and once you figure out how to make them work for you – instead of just lamenting how they ’re not as cool as Ryu or Ken ’s – they ’re actually pretty effective .
Whether it ’s an added layer of challenge for experienced players , a way to annoy and humiliate your opponents or just an overtly goofy fighting experience , Dan has a lot to offer .
And while it might not seem that way , he ’s gone through a lot of changes on the road from Street Fighter Alpha to Street Fighter IV .
Let ’s look at them now .
Above : Dan had to wait nearly 14 years before he could be this awesome
Dan did n’t actually appear in Art of Fighting , of course , but SNK ’s off - brand Street Fighter clone was the basis for his unique look and demeanor .
For some reason , the brains behind Street Fighter seem to have taken more offense from AoF than from any of SNK ’s numerous other knock - offs , and zeroed in on its two heroes – gi-clad Ryo Sakazaki and ponytail enthusiast Robert Garcia – in particular .
Above : Ryo and Robert set the stage for their bastard offspring
Ryo provided the outfit ( later turned a mocking shade of pink ) and the moves – the short - range fireball , weak dragon punch and flying flail - kick – while Robert ’s douchebag smirk and ponytail were the basis for Dan ’s face .
Dan ’s personality , meanwhile , came from Ryo ’s hyperactive little sister Yuri .
Above :
This ought to look familiar
These three were apparently the would - be challengers that made Capcom snap .
Before long , a character would be added to the Street Fighter pantheon that basically amounted to Capcom going , “ HEY SNK THIS IS YOU DUHHH DUHHH DUHHH . ”
Above : DUHHH
Above : Horrible Engrish courtesy of our vague memories of SNK ’s early ‘ 90s translations
Some of his fans might not realize this , but Dan ’s ignominious beginnings predate the Street Fighter Alpha series by at least a year .
Sure , his name maybe was n’t Dan yet , and his gi was orange ( much like Ryo’s ) , but the sad figure whose face Sagat is clenching in this piece of official Street Fighter II art is unmistakably Dan .
Above : Seriously , just look at him .
After seeing Dan ’s first real appearance , you could be forgiven for thinking he was just another experimental palette - swap of Ryu .
Casual players probably would n’t even see playing as him as anything other than a chance to play as Sagat ’s underpowered punching bag .
Above : Again , the gi might be orange , but that ’s clearly Dan
There was n’t anything to clearly indicate he was supposed to be a joke , apart from maybe the crappy fireball and reliance on taunts .
He even had Ryu ’s voice , and the ponytail looked a little more like Ken ’s than Robert Garcia ’s .
Not much of Dan ’s bizarre personality showed through , either – this Dan was all business .
In terms of his appearance , he looked a little younger and softer than the Dan we ’ve come to know , although apart from the lack of bushy eyebrows it ’s hard to tell the difference between this and his later incarnations .
Above : First appearance of the Gadouken , aka The Worst Fireball Ever
This was also the beginning of Dan ’s story ; years earlier , Sagat flew into a rage and murdered Dan ’s father after the elder Hibiki blinded him in one eye during a fight .
Dan , naturally , wants revenge , although his idea of revenge does n’t seem to extend beyond defeating Sagat in a fair fight .
He would n’t achieve that goal in Street Fighter Alpha , but his weird loser ’s luck would change dramatically in the sequel .
Above : Bison has a rare talent for understatement
Not only did Dan stop being a secret character in the second Alpha – he was right there in the friggin ’ intro , exploding into gamers ’ hearts and minds in a way none of the other characters could .
This was also where Dan ’s appearance came together more cohesively , creating a look that the bushy - eyebrowed , slightly overweight goofball would stick with for a good chunk of his career .
Above : HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW , ASSBUTTS !?
Looks aside , Dan actually got his own voice this time around , enabling fans to hear him screaming , among other things , “ OYAJI ! ” ( Japanese for “ dad ” ) for the first time .
Alpha 2 was also , to the best of our knowledge , the first time he started using Yuri Sakazaki ’s thumbs - up , hips - at - 45 - degrees “ YOYUUSU ! ” pose as a victory stance .
Above : Nope , the Gadouken has n’t improved any
It was also in Alpha 2 that Dan ’s character and narrative really started to take shape .
After being denied a canon confrontation with Sagat in Street Fighter Alpha , Dan finally got his wish and faced down the killer who ’d presumably ruined his childhood .
Street Fighter canon states that Sagat , regretful of his actions , threw the fight and let Dan win .
That sure seems like the only way a weakling like Dan could overcome a towering hulk like Sagat , but whatever the case he was too overjoyed to notice how hollow his victory was .
And rather than simply accepting the fulfillment of his quest , Dan immediately let the victory go to his head .
Convinced of his superior talents , Dan founds the Saikyo dojo and begins to teach his own self - taught , mostly worthless martial art to the world .
Or , failing that , to any poor sap who ’ll sign up .
A pink gi is included with membership .
This is only the beginning of Dan ’s real history .
It ’s also where things start to get weird .
At an expert meeting about the future of broadcasting I attended a month or two ago ( as mere observer , obviously ) , one participant simply observed that “ the broadcasting era is over ” .
Not that broadcasting itself will stop , but the era in which it is the primary , central means of disseminating and receiving information and entertainment is over .
An exceedingly smart guy , he waxed a little all too rhapsodically for my taste about what this meant .
In an effort to impress the import of the developments on a group of mostly aging , European veterans of old - media policy , he sketched how participatory , democratic online media infrastructures will win an “ epic battle ” with the traditional ‘ command and control ’ infrastructure of broadcasting .
Which is all fair enough , but reminded me a little too much of those glory days of the 1990s , when visionary internet philosophers declared the dawn of a new age of democratic empowerment .
Remember how the net would remodel society into bottom - up communities that would change the very nature of nations and democracy ?
To some extent , of course , we did eventually – ten to fifteen years on – come to witness that the net can transform how democracy works , at least in the US : Dean , Obama , etc .
But post- national , bottom - up democracy is still a long way coming , and in the meantime the logic of corporate capitalism has firmly reaffirmed itself on a commercialised net .
In defense of idealistic visions , individual users do time and again show that , whichever corporate overlord owns the means of publication , so to say ( YouTube , Facebook , Blogger , Flickr ) , they create most of the content and interaction in ways they never could with newspapers or TV – and pioneer ever new ways to do so .
They generate today ’s mash - up culture , the corporations merely chase after the results , buying up or clamping down accordingly .
The meeting belatedly acquainted me with the notion of digital natives , coined back in 2001 by Marc Prensky ( even their brains are different , did you know ? ) : the new generation of consumers who grew up with the Internet , video games and cellphones .
Roughly speaking , that ’s everyone born after 1980 .
In case you missed it , a Pew report released just before Christmas appears to show these digital natives truly coming into their own .
First off , the Internet has overtaken newspapers as main source of news :
40 % say they get most of their news about national and international issues from the internet , up from just 24 % in September 2007 .
For the first time in a Pew survey , more people say they rely mostly on the internet for news than cite newspapers ( 35 % ) .
Television continues to be cited most frequently as a main source for national and international news , at 70 % .
( To be fair , Kevin Drum does have a point when he qualifies the findings : “ Obviously this is slightly misleading , since internet largely means newspaper web sites , but it ’s still [..] a bellwether statistic . ” )
Secondly , among those under 30 – the purported digital natives – the net has caught up with television as well :
For young people [..] the internet now rivals television as a main source of national and international news .
Nearly six - in - ten Americans younger than 30 ( 59 % ) say they get most of their national and international news online ; an identical percentage cites television .
In one year time , the proportion between TV and Internet as main source of news for young people went from 68 / 34 to 59/59 .
Digital natives are digital !
As much as the findings seem to confirm the point , though , they arguably also implicitly undermine it .
This is , after all , the generation whose defining distinction , when compared to “ digital adaptives ” like me , was that they never needed to adapt to the new media in the first place , because they ’ve lived in a digital , online world all along .
That they are , as Prensky put it , “ native speakers ” of the Internet , socialized in “ the twitch - speed , multitasking , random - access , graphics - first , active , connected , fun , fantasy , quick - payoff world ” of the web .
And yet they seem to be very much adapting still .
After all , in 2006 and 2007 just a third of 18 - 29 year olds listed the Internet as a main source of news and information .
It ’s only this year that the big push to 50 % + came .
And that ’s America ; I assume developments in Europe are lagging .
In the end , I suppose , whether we ’re “ digital immigrants ” , adaptives or natives , we ’re all still journeying down the same road .
The road to a post - broadcasting era of networked information , in which a much broader range of voices has the opportunity to present themselves and find an audience – but it also becomes ever easier to simply avoid views and perspectives you do n’t agree with .
Rumors have circulated all day that Megan Fox would be replacing Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft in the next Tomb Raider action flick .
We went straight to the top to find the answer .

Sorry dreamers - the lovely Fox is n't planning to don the slinky jumpsuit .
A spokesperson for Megan
Fox denied the rumors to io9 , saying , " She 's not involved in the movie at all . "
I know this is a huge upset to many of you , because who knows how many more thigh holsters Jolie would be willing to strap on , and we totally agree with the idea of putting Fox into Croft 's boots .
She 's got the prerequisite attitude , lips and hips .

Latino Review first leaked the story from Europa Press in Spain that Megan Fox was indeed the next in line to don the long Croft pony tail .
There 's no director attached , and I 'm not even sure if a third has been greenlit , but Fox does look the part and her success from the Transformers movies means she could finally have her own big name character that could lead to future sequels .
The article says that they 're looking to shoot in 2010 with a release date of 2011 .

As of right now Fox is not the next Croft , but that does n't mean we can't start a grass - roots campaign to get her in .

Even the existing 5 per cent target fails to adequately represent just how severe crowding is on CityRail 's trains , according to the review conducted separately by the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal ( IPART ) last month .
" As crowding on trains varies significantly across the lines of the network , IPART considers this network - wide measure provides little insight , " the tribunal said in its review of CityRail 's accountability standards .
" Passengers are likely to view CityRail 's reported performance against this indicator with scepticism if it bears little relationship to their own experience . "
If the regulator endorses the new measure , which equates to one in six trains being overcrowded , CityRail will immediately meet its publicly reported target in what is its worst - performing category of customer service .
In 2005 , CityRail relaxed its definition of an on - time train to one that arrives at a station within five minutes of its schedule .
Overcrowding on the rail system has become the biggest political problem of the state 's transport portfolio , as thousands of people each week are left behind on platforms or have trouble getting off the train before the doors close .
IPART says the network - wide measurement is inadequate , let alone the proposal to relax it by a further 12 per cent : " For example , in 2007 , average load factors on the Western , Main North and Illawarra lines were 130 per cent .
Maximum load factors on these lines were 180 , 160 and 170 per cent respectively . "
The average train in the morning peak on the Western Line carries 130 per cent of seating capacity .
Almost half of services during the busiest 60 minutes of the peak carried in excess of crush load .
The tribunal has urged the Government to report crowding on a line - by - line basis : " IPART considers that the service contract should set a target for the percentage of trains in peak periods with a load factor above 135 per cent for each train line . "
Transport Minister David Campbell was considering the recommendation as a new service contract was drafted for CityRail .
" Of course having appropriate targets is important but I 'm focused on improving services for commuters and crowding is an issue for them , " he said .
" But crowding issues are caused by increased patronage , and that among other things , shows confidence in our rail network is improving . "
But the ITSRR reliability report for 2008 reveals RailCorp is intending to relax its standards .
" During 2007 - 08 RailCorp proposed to amend the target to ' not more than 17 per cent ' , " the report said .
Spokesman Paul Rea said " RailCorp is seeking a target that takes into account increasing patronage " .
" Our recently launched Customer Charter reflects our goal to optimise train timetables and available network infrastructure to help manage crowding , " Mr Rea said .
The January reprieve is now official .
Deciding if it ’s also enduring is the question .
For now , beggars ca n’t be choosy .
Inflation at this juncture , however spare , is good news .
Wholesale and consumer prices rose last month , as we expected they would .
The deflation war is n’t over , but there ’s reason to think that it can be won .
Even so , winning will take time and setbacks are likely .
For now , let ’s recognize that consumer prices rose last month , just as they did for wholesale prices .
The reason , as we explained yesterday for the pop in producer prices , was the rebound in energy .
CPI advanced 0.3 % in January , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported .
That ’s the first monthly rise in headline inflation since July .
Energy was no small source of the increase .
The energy component of CPI jumped 1.7 % , after falling for five months running .
We ’ve been opining in recent months that energy prices would n’t keep falling forever .
That ’s obvious , of course , although it ’s a point worthy of fresh attention in the middle of a deflationary storm .
To the extent that demand and supply for oil , gasoline and other fuels are approaching equilibrium suggests that one of deflation ’s key allies will soon stop dragging prices down generally .
Calling bottoms is difficult , of course , if not impossible , so we must be cautious about forecasting when the energy - based deflation momentum will end .
That said , given the dramatic declines since last summer , it ’s not unreasonable to predict that energy prices overall are likely to find their cyclical lows over the next 6 - 12 months , perhaps sooner .
Meanwhile , so - called core inflation ( CPI less food and energy prices ) is showing hints that maybe , just maybe , stabilization is near , as our chart below suggests .
That ’s encouraging because it suggests that the general price decline may be bottoming out sans any assistance from the energy market .
Among the areas that posted price increases last month : apparel , medical care , and food and beverages .
In addition , housing prices were flat last month , according to CPI data , which represents progress in this climate .
Prices moving sideways generally would be welcome these days , but even that thin reed of good news remains vulnerable to the forces of selling and retrenchment .
Much depends on how consumers will react in the coming months , and that in turn depends on the labor market .
Unfortunately , it ’s still too early to call a top in the job less momentum .
Yesterday ’s weekly update on new filings for unemployment was unchanged for the week through February 14 .
But the level of jobless claims remains far too high at this point to extend any comfort .
That said , history suggests that new filings may be near their highest levels .
Of course , that ’s based on the last few business cycles , which pale with the depth of the current ills .
In short , it ’s still unclear if the recession monster ’s momentum is rising or falling .
In any case , the consumer is still unapologetically defensive and it ’s any one ’s guess how long that will last .
By one estimate , the immediate future does n’t look promising on that front .
Consumer sentiment on future spending plans in the next three months continues to deteriorate , according to the ChangeWave survey of 2,701 U.S. consumers was conducted February 2 - 9 , 2009 ( see chart below ) .
Certainly there are tough times ahead , and probably a few more big surprises .
But let ’s be generous and assume that prices generally stop falling in the month ’s ahead .
That ’s helpful , and essential .
But the trend also takes away another leg for stimulating consumer purchases .
Given the new - found penchant for saving and delaying consumption , one could argue that winning the deflation war will have some near - term blowback effects on growth .
There ’s no way around that scenario , nor is there any way to soft pedal the risk .
That does n’t change the fact that nipping deflation in the bud is still priority one , regardless of the cost .
Once that ’s confirmed , the long , hard slog of firing up economic growth can begin in earnest .
Alas , that ’s going to be a much longer and tougher job than beating back deflation .
But first things first .

I usually lie about my age because I can , Skip , because I can but for this post , I have to come clean : I ’m 41 years - old , so I ’m old enough to remember white flight , which was roaring in the late 1960s and early 1970s when I was a little kid .
Back then all white liberalsmy parents included were in agreement about white flight :
It was a bad thing , and white people who fled the cities because they did n’t want to live in racially mixed neighborhoods were bigots .
( My family stayed put in our Chicago neighborhood as it went from predominantly Irish to mostly Mexican . )
Liberals screamed and yelled at white folks who fled cities for the ‘ burbs .
Those white folks were were assholes and they contributed mightily to the decline of US cities in the 60s , 70s , and early 80s .
Then something strange started happening in the 1980s .
White folks started moving back into the cities some moved into racially mixed neighborhoods ; some moved into predominantly minority neighborhoods .
This trend has only picked up steam over the last twenty years .
And many of the same white liberals who condemned white flight are just as angry at the white folks who are moving back into the cities .
When white people moved away in the 50s , 60s , and 70s , they were guilty of white flight .
And when white people came back , they were guilty of gentrification .
Danny Westneat has a column in the Seattle Times today about gentrification although he does n’t use the word .
He makes some good points about the cluelessness of white people who get angry at African Americans who express any reservations at all about white folks moving in to traditionally black neighborhoods .
“ People should be welcome to live where they want to without regard to their skin color , without being regarded as ‘ invaders , ’ ” wrote Mark Hovila of Lake Forest Park .
Asked Ben Dobbs : “ Could you imagine an article such as yours with roles reversed ? ” … OK , I ’ll play along .
Let ’s reverse the roles .
Not just the skin color  the roles .
Suppose whites had been shunted via redlining into one of the most run-down parts of Seattle .
Then , 40 years later , suppose some wealthy and connected African Americans began buying up the land , putting up megahouses , running the community councils and dominating the PTAs .
It ’s a great point the anger in the African American community as the Central District integrates is completely understandable .
But African Americans are no longer shunted into just one neighborhood in the city Westneat cites a UW study that shows that the city is less racially segregated now than it was 30 years ago so the anger , while understandable , ca n’t really be regarded as legit .
Or as something that can be accommodated .
( More affordable housingyes , yes , yes .
But can anything be done to ensure that the Central District remains majority black ?
And do we once again think we ’re talking about race when what we ’re really talking or should be talking about is class ? )
But even if he did n’t use the word , without a doubt many white liberals who read Westneat ’s column today including some of my co-workers , I suspect shook their heads and thought , “ Oh , gentrification is terrible !
Terrible !â 
So I ’d like to get this on record :
White people ca n’t be assholes when they flee the cities and assholes when they return .
Pick one and stick to it , but you ca n’t argue both points .
I get annoyed when I hear the same people / same types of people who complained about white flight back in the 60s and 70s complaining about gentrification today .
Jan. 23 , 2009  --
Not long ago , saying goodnight to his mom and dad was nearly impossible for 3 - year - old Rhett Lamb .
In a case that baffled doctors , Rhett was awake nearly 24 hours a day .
" His body would give out but his mind would n't ; he 'd still be awake , " said Rhett 's mom , Shannon Lamb .
" He 'd still be alert .
It was extremely scary . "
One of the side effects of Rhett 's lack of sleep was bad behavior .
" He was in a bad mood all the time , " Lamb said .
" He could n't play , he did n't interact with other children .
His frustration level was so high , and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse .
He could n't communicate with anyone .
It was heartbreaking . "
Rhett 's temper got so bad he would hit his mother , even giving her black eyes .
" He would hit you , he would bite you , he would head butt you and anything else around him , and you did n't know from one minute to the next what was going to happen , " she said .
Rhett 's dad David Lamb said , " It was like he was losing his mind and there was nothing we could do to help him . "
The Lambs , who live in St. Petersburg , Fla. , arranged opposite work shifts so one of them could stay home and take care of Rhett .
" You get to the point where you can't function anymore and you can't think straight , and you get up in the morning and you take a shower to go to work and you drive to work and you 're a robot , " Shannon Lamb said .
" You are an absolute robot .
And then you dread coming home ' cause you know it 's the same thing . "
Finally , a Diagnosis
After dozens of doctors ' visits and years of conflicting opinions , Rhett was finally diagnosed with a rare brain condition called chiari malformation .
Once diagnosed , doctors were able to perform a risky surgery that offered a 50 - 50 chance Rhett would be able to sleep normally for the first time .
Rhett Up to Speed
Dr. Gerald Tuite , a pediatric neurosurgeon at All Children 's Hospital in St. Petersberg , made an incision from the base of Rhett 's skull to the top of his neck to remove bone around the brain stem and around the spinal cord , producing more space and reducing the pressure .
The surgery was a success .
Rhett was finally able to sleep through the night , and his behavior improved dramatically .
Because of the disease , he was functioning at the level of an 18 - month - old and could n't even speak .
But in a matter of months , he has almost caught up to his peers , and for the first time in his life , he is interacting with other children .
It 's a time the Lambs thought would never come .
" You could n't give him a hug or touch him or anything , and now he walks through the door and wants a big hug , " Shannon Lamb said .
" And it 's heartbreaking at this point because you just look at him and think , ' This is something I never thought I would have . ' "

The closing of Sister Ray Records on London ’s Berwick St. ( the same block made famous on an early Oasis album cover ) is naturally a saddening development for those of us who value independent shops in this time of increasing corporate market domination .
“ Another adversary swallowed by the faceless overlords , ” we ’re preprogrammed to say .
And it is sad , just like any time a hole - in - the - wall bakery , crafts store , locksmith , or whathaveyou has to pack it in due to a dried - up revenue stream .
These businesses are tough work to maintain , and it ’s admirable to do so in the face of Internet and corporate competition .
But an excellent post on UK blog Harry ’s Place makes an argument for why the pity party should n’t carry on too long .
I ’ll let the writer , identified only as Brett , tell it like it is :
I do n’t think [ the store ’s closing ] has anything to do with digital downloading , which predictably is cast as the chief villain in the Q piece .
So , here ’s some tough - love for Sister Ray : Your shop is too dark .
Your prices are stupidly high and your staff are unfriendly .
There , I ’ve said it .
Sister Ray does not invite you in .
The shop seems dark and stuffy .
The surly staff seem disinterested in your custom .
A friend used the word “ sneering ” when I brought the subject up recently .
I was a frequent shopper at Sister Ray during the year I lived in and around the UK capital , so naturally I ’m sad to see a good store go , particularly one where I bought many cheap copies of more London - friendly fare like the Pogues ’ Rum , Sodomy and the Lash .
But Brett has it right , and not only with regards to the problems of this specific shop , which was indeed dark as night and closed too early .
Rather , the greater problems that Brett identifies plague innumerable small businesses that seem simultaneously flustered by the marketplace ’s ongoing changes and too frightened to actually shake up their own approach .
Namely , they try too hard to woo demographics that do n’t care and not enough time focusing on the ways in which in - store shopping will always trump the Internet :
When shops like Sister Ray identify downloading [ … ] as the problem ( “ Young people consider it ‘ uncool ’ to pay for music ” they ’re quoted as saying in Q … ) it is obvious who they see their target market as .
“ Cool young people ” .
Well frankly , fuck the cool young people .
If they ’re the demographic turning to downloads , then stop catering for them .
Cater rather to merely semi-cool people in their late 20s , 30s and - gasp - the over 40s .
In other words , stop running after an audience that has been raised not to appreciate you , and start enticing the people that love the kind of shopping you provide .
Naturally , these people will be more obsessive collector - types , which is perhaps a seemingly small demographic but a loyal one .
Treat these people well and they will reward you with unmatched customer loyalty .
You see the same problem in many independent bookstores that put the New York Times bestsellers right near the entrance , as if those same books were n’t always available for less money at the nearby Barnes & Noble .
Why not take some risks and present customers ( all of whom are readers , mind you , whereas a portion of all B&N clientele is just there for lattes and greeting cards ) with a couple oddball choices , also at a discount ?
This kind of personalized expertise is exactly the kind of thing that little stores can do well and the Internet ca n’t do at all .
As it happens , London has a number of stores that do just this , notably Foyle ’s Books and Fopp Records ( to name a couple from my own limited experience ) , both of which are expertly stocked , brightly lit , and incredibly rewarding to browse .
When Brett correctly identifies “ lack of imagination and a myopic inability to identify opportunities ” as the ultimate reasons for Sister Ray ’s death , he sends a much - needed shot across the nose to likeminded stores .
To wit :
There will always be people who value your services , and you must either maximize this group ’s enjoyment of your store or die .
Just like Sister Ray did .

When Kellogg announced it would not renew its endorsement contract with Olympic medalist Michael Phelps after a photo of the athelete smoking pot surfaced , it may have cost the food company its sterling reputation , reports company reputation index Vanno .
Out of the 5,600 company reputations Vanno monitors , Kellogg ranked ninth before it booted Phelps .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
One in three toys tested was found to contain toxic chemicals such as lead , flame retardants and arsenic , according to a report issued Wednesday by an environmental group .
Researchers for the Michigan - based Ecology Center tested more than 1,500 popular toys for lead , cadmium , arsenic , PVC and other harmful chemicals .
They said they found that one - third of the toys contain " medium " or " high " levels of chemicals of concern .
" Our hope is that by empowering consumers with this information , manufacturers and lawmakers will feel the pressure to start phasing out the most harmful substances immediately , and to change the nation 's laws to protect children from highly toxic chemicals , " said Ecology Center 's Jeff Gearhart , who led the research , in a written release .
The group said it selected toys and children 's products that attempted to represent a cross section of the most popular items used by U.S. children .
Researchers bought the toys at chain stores including Target , Kmart , Toys R Us , Babies R Us , TJ Maxx , and Wal - Mart , as well as drug stores , dollar stores , on - line retailers and independent toy stores , according to the HealthyToys.org
Web site , where the report was posted .
The toys were purchased at stores in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti , Mich . ; Oakland , Calif . ; and Albany , N.Y .
The group 's
Web site said that the sampling was not random or intended to be representative of all toys on the market .
The toys were tested using a handheld X - ray fluorescence ( XRF ) device that uses x-ray fluorescence spectrometry to detect chemicals like lead , cadmium , chlorine , arsenic , mercury , tin , and antimony .
A group representing the toy industry was critical of the report .
" The Toy Industry Association finds the report from Healthytoys.org is misleading to consumers , at best , " according to a statement on the company 's Web site .
" The truth is toys are a highly regulated industry that has been subject to even more intense scrutiny - from industry , retailers , government and consumer organizations - in the past 18 months , " the association said in its statement .
" TIA members are always working hard to ensure that toys sold in the U.S. meet or exceed all safety standards - so consumers can be confident in the safety of toys . "
Gearhart said HealthyToys.org , which he says is a project of the Ecology Center , encourages retailers to be responsible in what kinds of products they sell .
But he said manufacturers are ultimately responsible for maintaining the safety standards of the toys they make .
He said manufacturers should be more aggressive that minimal requirement in testing toy safety .
" The manufacturer will test to meet regulatory standards , " said Gearhart .
" Complying with regulatory standards should be the baseline . "
In February , new regulations from the Consumer Product Safety Commission will make some of the toys now available for purchase illegal to sell , according to a press release from the group .
" Many of the products that are on our high concern list are ones that will have difficulty complying with the new standards that come into play in February - but not all of them , because we are looking at more restrictive screening that what the toy industry does , " said Gearhart .
The study found lead in 20 % of the toys tested .
In 3.5 % of the toys , or 54 items , levels of lead exceeded the federal recall level for paint , 600 parts - per-million .
The number of toys that showed more than 600 ppm of lead decreased by half from 2007 , when 7 % of the toys tested were found to have more than 600 ppm of lead , according to Gearhart .
Also according to the study , children 's jewelry is 5 times more likely to contain lead above the toxic 600 ppm -level than other toys .
In particular , the report mentioned that several Hannah Montana brand jewelry items tested high for lead .
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children 's toys have less than 40 parts - per-million of lead .
The levels of lead detected in " many " of the toys was " significantly " above those guidelines , according to the release .
The study does not associate country of origin with the presence of toxic chemicals .
According to the release , 21 % of toys from China and 16 % of toys from all other countries had detectable levels of lead .
Of the 17 toys made in the United States that were tested , 35 % had detectable levels of lead .
A U.S. - made Halloween pumpkin pin had 190,943 ppm of lead .
The report found that 62 % of the tested products - or 954 items - contain low levels of chemical concern .
And 21 % of the products tested - or 324 items - contained no toxic chemicals to be worried about .
Ecology Center , a nonprofit group , said the study was conducted with several partners .
The results were posted at HealthyToys.org .

CamlPDF 0.4 Released
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/edec98d697b4dd2b#
I 've just updated CamlPDF to version 0.4 : http://www.coherentpdf.com/ocaml-libraries.html
The biggest change is that this release now compiles with Microsoft F Sharp as well as with OCaml .
Some major non-compatible changes have been made to the low - level API , due to our experience of building large software with the library .
These should be the last such changes , at least to the basic modules .
One of the changes is that many functions which used to take a Pdf.pdfdoc and return another one now modify the document in - place .
This is rather un-idiomatic for a functional library , but threading all the documents through complicated functions in code using CamlPDF became wearying .
There are several new modules : PDFSpace ( Parsing Colourspaces ) PDFText module extended for more encodings and better text extraction Cff ( Parse Type 1 fonts and convert to Type 3 ) PDFMarks ( Bookmark handling - unfinished ) PDFAnnot ( PDF Annotations - unfinished ) PDFGraphics ( Structured graphics - unfinished - included only because Cff uses it This release is about a third faster in general than the last one , due to profiling under .
NET .
Many bug fixes are included , and extra facilities for dealing with malformed PDF files .
CamlPDF is in commercial use in our Command Line PDF Toolkit and PDF Toolkit for .
NET .
Building with OCamlMkLib

Thanks to those who helped me here - I finally settled on a modified version of what 's given in 18.8 in the manual .
Here are the new files :

Conditional compilation wrt OCaml version ?
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/c22ffa51bd7fbbc3#
Working on Batteries , we 're faced with a few places where we'd like to perform conditional compilation depending on the version of OCaml being used .
We could probably do this with Camlp4 , cpp , Autoconf hackery , etc. -- but first , we need to decide on which of these options we 'll adopt .
Any suggestion ?
There is optcomp : https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/optcomp/
http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/repos/optcomp/optcomp/README
The example in README should talk to you directly .
If you are interested in using ocamlbuild you can have a look at ocamlbuild - ctools : http://dvide.com/labs/ocamlbuild-ctools/
I added extensions to ocamlbuild using a syntax like normalfile .o [ mytag , myothertag , ~notthistag ] conditionalfile .o .... this is done in a .cprog file that lists all files to include , but that same could be done with other similar files e.g. . mllib
Also , I added multi-variant builds so the same build can handle multiple build targets based on tags - for example debug and release builds .
Multivariant builds work by adding tags in the filename : myfile.variant_release , mingw.o
Most of this could be integrated into ocamlbuild , but ocamlbuild is not very actively maintained as I understand .
Tail calls in the JVM and the OCamlJava project
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/80d88a5df82886dd#
For anyone who missed it , there has been a very interesting development in JVM land .
Arnold Schwaighofer claims to have the first working implementation of tail calls on the recently open sourced Hotspot Java compiler : http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/mlvm-dev/2009-January/000331.html
Given the existence of the OCamlJava project , this should be of great interest to the OCaml community because it might pave the way to even better numerical performance and easier parallelism with simple interop to rich libraries and so forth .

I never say never , but I can't see waiting months and years for Chrome to " catch up " to Firefox and then switch .
Why should I ?
By then we will be on Firefox 4 , and Chrome can spend another year " catching up " .
Who knows , Chrome may catch up and speed by Firefox with some new killer features we can't envision today , but so far I do n't see any real sign of that in the short term .
I 'm happy with Firefox and the only selling point I see with Chrome right now is the separate processes for each tab concept , which is nice but will probably be in the next major version of Firefox , Safari , Opera and IE as well .
Other than that feature I do n't see any reason to switch to Chrome .
The 3.1 beta of Firefox with the revamped javascript engine is just as fast , and I have hundreds of extensions / addons to choose from already .
I noticed something weird on Google Suggest .

German science ministry demands environmental assessment before nutrient dumping can begin .
The Polarstern may not be able to conduct its ocean fertilization experiment .
AWI
The German science ministry has suspended a planned Indo–German ocean fertilization experiment in the Southern Ocean , and asked the German research institute behind it to commission an independent assessment of the study 's environmental safety .
A 48 - strong international team on board the Polarstern , an icebreaker operated by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research ( AWI ) , will reach its destination in the Scotia Sea by the end of this week .
The scientists had planned to dump their cargo of 20 tonnes of iron sulphate over a 300 - square - kilometre study area to induce an algal bloom .
Stimulating algal growth with extra nutrients is believed to be one possible way of sequestering carbon dioxide from the air .
But environmental groups claim that the experiment , called LOHAFEX , would violate a moratorium on ocean fertilization that Germany brokered last May ( see ' Ocean fertilization experiment draws fire ' ) .
The technique is controversial because its likely effects on marine ecosystems are uncertain .
Studying these effects is the main rationale for LOHAFEX , the sixth iron- fertilization experiment in the Southern Ocean since 1993 .
Karin Lochte , director of the AWI , told Nature last week that the German environment ministry , which has now asked the science ministry to take action , had not raised any objections when it was initially informed about the plans last year .
The AWI insists that the experiment is completely harmless to the environment , and fully in line with the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity .
The institute plans to provide an independent environmental assessment of the experiment within the next ten days , and hopes that the science ministry will then give the go - ahead for fertilization to begin .
" We had n't expected such an avalanche of protest , but I hope we can still keep to our schedule , " says Ulrich Bathmann , a biological oceanographer at the AWI .
" It 's very unfortunate that LOHAFEX is lumped together in an undifferentiated way with industrial - waste - dumping activities , with which it has absolutely nothing in common . "

Obi-Wan Kenobi Star Wars Cake – Geeky Cake of the Week
Natasha hand - made the incredible likeness of Obi-Wan Kenobi atop this fondant - covered Star Wars cake of vanilla sponge , vanilla buttercream , and strawberry jam .
I only hope that my features are done such justice when a figure of me–inevitably –one day adorns a strawberry - jam cake .
Just make sure there ’s plenty of fondant available to recreate my humongous biceps or whatever .
And by “ biceps , ” I mean “ head . ”
From Natasha :
The cake was for a little boy called Harry , for his 6th birthday .
He is a massive Star Wars fan .
I get nervous doing cakes like these because I know how geeky boys and men can get .
I did a Yoda cake first and my husbands comment was “ If he held his light sabre like that it would cut off his hands ! ”
But Harry was delighted .
Yes , a firm grasp of basic lightsaber mechanics is frequently dismissed as “ geeky . ”
But I bet you ’ll start to think of it as “ common sense ” after the first time you mishandle an energy - bladed weapon .
Mm-hmm .
Now excuse me while I push my horn - rimmed glasses up on my nose .

As Elizabeth Wurtzel herself says , " If you are looking for antisemitism , you can find it anywhere " .
But just because paranoia is allowed by some to reign supreme over all other emotions , that does n't make the leap from fact into fiction a legitimate one ; hence the rest of her heartfelt argument is , ultimately , rendered utterly redundant by her doing so .
The first of the many false premises she peddled in her piece is the idea that Israel should be collectively judged alongside the worst dictatorships , rather than ( as Israel itself would like to be seen ) in the company of societies such as those of western Europe and the United States .
When Israel was created , the hope was not that it should sink to the level of the worst regimes across the world , but rather emulate the nobler traits of the enlightened nations .
That it has , by and large , failed in its attempts to do so does not instantly turn any critic of Israeli policy into a rabid antisemite , any more than an anti-Bush protester is by definition a hater of the entire American people .
Israel 's shocking lack of adherence to democratic values , its inequitable treatment of its non-Jewish citizens , and the never - ending subjugation of the Palestinians under its control deserves condemnation at every juncture ; not to do so would be to abet decades - old injustice in one of the most fractious regions on earth .
Voicing opposition to Israel 's policies vis a vis Operation Cast Lead is an entirely understandable , and acceptable , reaction for opponents of the offensive , both inside and outside Israel .
Despite a large majority of Israelis supporting the operation , there are daily protests against the war within Israel , in which hundreds of Jewish Israelis take part – yet , by Wurtzel 's reckoning , that would render those same Jews as self - hating antisemites for daring to exercise their democratic right and criticise their government 's actions .
Turning abroad , when British and American troops invaded Iraq , there was a massive outpouring of opposition in both the UK and the US , by a public utterly at odds with their leaders ' actions : did Wurtzel look for , and find , antisemitism latent in those protests ?
And , if not , then why suggest that the latest round of anti-war protests are fuelled by antisemitism rather than seeing them as simply an extension of the global movement against the mass - bombing , and collective punishment , of civilians ?
Of course , amongst the thousands of demonstrators worldwide , there have been some pretty reprehensible expressions of support for Hamas war criminals , as well as some out and out antisemitic sloganeering .
Nothing can excuse such occurrences , and the perpetrators of such offences deserve to be roundly castigated for their actions .
But Wurtzel is n't concerned with individual hate crimes ; rather , she sees any rally in opposition to the Israeli war machine as fundamentally antisemitic , even if all that those taking part in the protests are doing is calling for negotiations over war – because , in her eyes , focussing on Israel at all is equivalent to seeking the downfall and demise of the world Jewry in its entirety .
What is occurring in Gaza has , rightly , spread outrage throughout the world ; whilst many ( myself included ) believed , and continue to believe , that Israel 's citizens have the right to live free from rocket barrages and terror attacks , there is no doubt that the savagery and scale of Israel 's response has overstepped the mark and wrought intolerable suffering on innocent Palestinians .
Just because Hamas promote indiscriminate slaughter of civilians does not mean that the IDF must stoop to their level in return .
Criticising Hamas does n't make one Islamophobic – so why should protesting IDF actions mean that those speaking out are falsely tarred with the brush of antisemitism ?
Perhaps the worst part of her attack on anyone daring to criticise Israel is her duplicity when it comes to blurring the boundaries between Jews and Israelis .
It 's OK for Wurtzel to pretend that Israel is just a collective mass of Jews all anguishing and agonising over every military move like six million Woody Allens , but woe betide anyone else who portrays Israel as being intrinsically linked to Judaism and the Jewish people .
She can't have her angel - food cake and eat it .
If people falsely claim that Israeli policy is a manifestation of Jewish values and Jewish thinking , it is precisely because people like Wurtzel give them the opportunity to do so with such conflations as this .
As do Aipac and the other lobby groups which purport to represent the Jewish people , yet in fact – by blindly promoting an agenda of Israel right - or - wrong – do immense damage to international Jewry 's reputation and safety with their aggressive campaigning .
Muslim leaders around the world have been quick to distinguish between being anti-Israel and antisemitic , in an effort to encourage their followers to demarcate between legitimate protests against the Israeli government and unconscionable attacks against Jewish schools , synagogues and individuals .
Wurtzel could learn a lot from their stance , if only she was n't so deeply embedded in her siege - mentality bunker .

Four exhausted children have been discovered cowering in a house next to the bodies of their mothers by staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross , which yesterday accused the Israeli military of " unacceptable " delays in allowing medics safe access to injured Gazans .
The Red Cross workers found the children , who were so weak they could not stand , sheltering next to the bodies of their mothers in a house in Zeitoun , southeast of Gaza City .
Another man was found alive , but again too weak to stand .
At least 12 corpses were lying on mattresses .
In another house nearby they found 15 survivors , several of whom were wounded .
There were three more bodies in a third house .
On Wednesday , a Palestinian volunteer with the Red Crescent who was in the same convoy described seeing dozens of dead bodies .
Among those killed on Monday when the houses were shelled were three boys , all from the Samouni family .
The Red Cross said Israeli soldiers were posted 80 metres away and had several positions nearby , including two tanks .
It was a shocking incident , said Pierre Wettach , head of the Red Cross delegation for Israel and the Palestinian territories .
" The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation , but did not assist the wounded .
Neither did they make it possible for us or the Palestine Red Crescent to assist the wounded . "
The Red Cross had been asking the Israeli military to allow them access to Zeitoun since Israel 's ground invasion began on Saturday , but only a three - hour lull in the fighting on Wednesday allowed them to make the dangerous journey .
The Red Cross said Israel had breached international humanitarian law by not allowing access to the wounded and said it " considers the delay in allowing rescue services access unacceptable " .
The criticism of Israel 's operation came as the UN , which gives food and aid to about 750,000 Gazans , said it was suspending all its aid work in the Gaza Strip after its staff and compounds came under attack by the Israeli military .
Two drivers in a clearly marked UN convoy were killed yesterday by an Israeli tank shell .
The Israeli military has attacked two UN schools , killing more than 46 Palestinians sheltering inside .
Another 35 bodies were pulled from the rubble in areas across Gaza City yesterday during another three - hour lull in the fighting .
The Palestinian death toll after nearly two weeks of the Israeli bombing offensive now stands at about 750 , with about 3,000 injured , and the figure is rising rapidly as more buried bodies are uncovered .
John Ging , Unrwa 's director of operations in Gaza , said the decision to suspend activities was " heartbreaking .
This is a very very difficult decision for us to make as the population here really needs our help . "
He said the accumulation of incidents meant the UN had " lost confidence in the mechanism that 's there .
We are perfectly prepared to take the reasonable risks in this conflict zone , but something has to change .
The verbal assurances have run out in terms of credibility . "
Three Israeli soldiers were killed yesterday , bringing the death toll on the Israeli side to 13 , three of whom were civilians .
As the conflict deepened , striking evidence from Red Cross medics and from Palestinian witnesses revealed that one of the worst incidents of civilian killings happened in Zeitoun .
The area had been surrounded by large earth walls dug by Israeli troops , making it impossible to bring in ambulances .
Medics on Wednesday took out 18 wounded and 12 others who were exhausted on the back of a donkey cart .
More wounded are believed to be still sheltering in houses nearby .
Under international humanitarian law both the Israeli military and Palestinian armed groups must do everything possible to search for , collect and evacuate the wounded , the Red Cross said .
Attacks on medical staff , hospitals and vehicles are prohibited .
But more than 20 medical staff have already been killed in Gaza by the Israeli military .
In a written response the Israeli military did not address the detailed criticisms but said Hamas , the Islamist movement that controls Gaza , " deliberately used Palestinian civilians as human shields " .
It said it would investigate any serious allegations about the military 's conduct .
Israeli air strikes destroyed several houses in the town of Rafah , on Gaza 's southern border , after leaflets were dropped warning residents to leave the area , which said : " Hamas uses your houses to hide and smuggle military weapons . "
Around 5,000 Palestinians fled their homes and took refuge in two UN schools that had been set up as shelters .
As the fighting continued yesterday , there seemed little willingness on the Israeli side to halt its military operation .
Ehud Olmert , the prime minister , travelled to the military 's Gaza division headquarters and said there was still more fighting to come .
He said the bottom line was for quiet to prevail in southern Israel .
" To this we have not yet arrived and the IDF has not yet been asked to carry out everything necessary in order to do so ; the decision is still before us , " he said .
For the first time in the conflict , the violence took in northern Israel .
Four rockets were fired from southern Lebanon into the town of Nahariya , injuring two people at a nursing home .
A small Palestinian faction was believed to be behind the attack , but it did not appear to herald a regional escalation of the conflict .
In brief
• Four children found in weak state next to the bodies of their mothers and other corpses in house in Zeitoun
• UN suspends all aid work in Gaza after two of its drivers in clearly marked convoy are shot dead
• 35 bodies pulled from rubble in several areas across Gaza City during pause in fighting
• Palestinian death toll now close to 750 , with about 3,000 injured
• Red Cross says delays in allowing rescue services access to dead and wounded are unacceptable
• One Israeli soldier killed yesterday , bringing Israeli casualties to 11 , including three civilians
• Israeli air strikes destroy houses in Rafah , causing 5,000 Palestinians to flee their homes
• Four rockets fired from southern Lebanon into Israel , believed to be the actions of a Palestinian faction

HINOJOSA :
MEET LESLEE UNRUH ... SHE FOUNDED THE ALPHA CENTER IN 1984 BUT MOST PEOPLE NOW KNOW HER AS ONE OF THE MOST POTENT PRO - LIFE ACTIVISTS IN THE STATE ...
UNRUH HAD AN ABORTION HERSELF IN THE 1970'S. AND WHILE SOME MIGHT THINK THAT BANNING ABORTION IS AN ATTACK ON WOMEN'S FREEDOM , UNRUH SAYS SHE WANTS TO BAN ABORTION PRECISELY TO PROTECT WOMEN'S FREEDOM .
UNRUH :
This freedom , sexual freedom is costing women and their lives .
Where 's the sexual freedom ?
There is none .
Because those of us who have suffered through the abortion , we 're not gonna be silent anymore .
We 're gonna speak up and we 're gonna tell the truth .
Because abortion hurts women .
Silent no more .
[...]
UNRUH :
I 've been that woman .
There is no freedom after an abortion .
You carry an empty crib in your heart forever .
There 's no freedom .
HINOJOSA :
And so , when you hear people saying , " Someone like Leslie is trying to actually take away women 's rights and taking away their freedoms --"
UNRUH :
I 'm giving women freedom .
We are giving back the women what they really want .
This is true feminism .
This woman is " giving " women back their freedom by taking away their right to abortion .
She 's smiling , upbeat , cheerful and sunny --- the all - American gal .
And to me , she seems downright otherworldly .
I do n't know what she 's talking about .
She 's babbling incoherently .
[...]
If you are n't listening closely , the cadence of her speech makes it sound like she is perfectly reasonable .
But she might as well be speaking in another language for all the sense it makes .
UNRUH :
I think there should be no abortions in my state .
HINOJOSA :
So to get to that point , you want to prevent unwanted pregnancies .
UNRUH :
Yes .
HINOJOSA :
And people might say , " Well , the way you prevent unwanted pregnancies is through contraception . "
UNRUH :
No .
It 's wrong .
We do n't need , we do n't have a shortage of condoms in this country .
We should not be worshipping condoms .
Let 's start just telling the truth .
HINOJOSA :
But when some people say that truth might be , Leslee , that by limiting the information , by limiting access to contraception , that you may -- you may unintentionally be contributing to more unwanted pregnancies --
UNRUH :
No .
I think it 's -- by " limiting " is all spin .
Let 's quit making people think that everybody can go out there and just as long as they have a condom , they 're safe .
They 're not safe emotionally .
They 're not safe physically .
Let 's just start telling the truth .
When I saw an anti-abortion activist appear on NOW a couple of weeks ago I was struck by how deeply and profoundly dishonest she was :
BRANCACCIO :
The head of Kansans for Life , Mary Kay Culp has a good reason for watching the big story in Washington this week .
Appeals court judge Samuel Alito did not trip up in any grotesque way this week .
The conventional wisdom that dictates these things signals that Alito will soon occupy the swing seat on the Supreme Court .
And his rulings could shift the court 's position on hot - button issues like abortion .
It 's just that kind of shift on the court that Mary Kay Culp and her group in Kansas have been hoping for .
BRANCACCIO : Thanks for coming in .
MARY KAY CULP : Thanks for having me .
BRANCACCIO : Well , looks like Samuel Alito is going to get this .
That must , given all the work you 've done over these years , make you happy .
MARY KAY CULP : I am glad that President Bush 's nominee looks like he 's going to make it on the court .
Whether or not it 's going to make me happy from a pro-life point of view , I think that remains to be seen .
BRANCACCIO : Why are you being tentative ?
He --
MARY KAY CULP : Well , he looks like he 's a real careful -- a real careful , thoughtful , analytical guy , and I like that .
And -- because I 'm a little tired of this being portrayed as if he has an agenda , that all of a sudden , poof is going to happen if he gets on the court .
BRANCACCIO : Agenda being getting rid of Roe v. Wade ?
MARY KAY CULP : Exactly .
I do n't think that that 's going to happen .
And if it does , all it means is that the issue comes back to the states .
BRANCACCIO : But , with all the work that you 've been doing in Kansas for all these years , do n't you think that if it becomes a State 's matter that in Kansas like that ( SNAP ) you 'll get rid of abortion ?
Huh ?
MARY KAY CULP : No . I do n't .
Unh-uh .
I do n't think that 'll happen in the states .
But , what can happen is a real discussion .
What can happen are committee hearings in your Senate and your House where witnesses are called -- witnesses who have had abortions -- witnesses on both side of the issue .
And , it can be heard — the most frustrating thing about Roe is that it just slammed the door .
When you try to get a State law passed even to regulate just a little bit , or partial birth abortion , anything , a legislator will tell you -- " Well , you know -- we can't do that under Roe versus Wade anyway . "
BRANCACCIO :
But you must be encouraged about the way things are going with Samuel Alito ?
All right , I 'll encourage you then .
MARY KAY CULP : Okay .
BRANCACCIO : You know -- Pat Buchanan ?
MARY KAY CULP : Uh-huh .
BRANCACCIO : My favorite conservative commentator .
MARY KAY CULP : Yes .
Uh-huh .
BRANCACCIO : He said with Alito -- here 's the quote from this week .
MARY KAY CULP : Okay .
BRANCACCIO : " Roe could go .
George W. Bush is one Justice away from succeeding where Nixon , Ford , his father and even Ronald Reagan all failed . "
MARY KAY CULP : That would be - one Justice after Alito .
BRANCACCIO : One Justice after Alito .
MARY KAY CULP : Unless -- not with Alito .
Yeah .
BRANCACCIO : So , it 's gettin ' there .
MARY KAY CULP : Right .
BRANCACCIO : I do n't understand how Kansas would n't -- ban abortion quit quickly after that .
What do you know about the state of that debate in your state ...
MARY KAY CULP :
It is n't that .
It 's just that I know how the political system works .
Then you can have real discussion .
Then every -- both sides are gonna get aired , and if the media 's fair about it , both sides are gonna get aired .
That -- you know , that 's a question .
But at least democracy will have a chance to work on it .
But , that does n't necessarily mean anything either way .
But , well , I do know what might happen in Kansas .
We have late term abortions in Kansas , and we 're known for having late term abortions in Kansas .
Those , yes , we might be able to get rid of right away .
BRANCACCIO : But , really there are two questions here .
There 's the political calculation that I did ask you about .
Do you think that Roe v. Wade 's going to be overturned and therefore abortion will become illegal ?
You do n't think so .
But , what about your goal ?
Would it make you happier ?
Is this your vision of America where abortion is illegal .
MARY KAY CULP :
It would be nice to know that tomorrow morning no knives are gonna be taken to unborn babies .
That 'd be a nice thing .
But , in order for that to happen and for it to -- to stay in place , I mean , if you just boom turn it around -- without people really understanding the issue , it 's not as -- certainly not as satisfying as it happening for the right reasons .
Because , the media in this country becomes unafraid to actually hear both sides of this issue , ' cause that has n't been the case for 30 years .
It 's been getting better .
But , really it 's kind of an interesting dynamic , because -- I did n't notice really a change until a partial birth abortion issue came along in Congress , and that really earns you a lot of credibility .
And , then people start to look and listen .
And , as we got stronger politically , it 's really -- it 's amazing how a political win really can draw peoples ' attention to an issue .
BRANCACCIO :
You know , Mary Kay , from your discussion , though , there are a lot of people who do not like abortion , who want to reduce the number of abortions I America --
MARY KAY CULP : Uh-huh .
BRANCACCIO :
But are very concerned about an America where if a woman chooses to do this for whatever complicated reason that they have that choice .
You could have some of these States deciding based on a different Supreme Court , " We are gonna outlaw it . "
And , that means if you got the money , you go to another state .
If you do n't got the money and your poor , terrible things could happen .
MARY KAY CULP :
You know , terrible things are happening right now -- terrible things .
But , nobody knows about 'em , because nobody 's really looking at the other side of this issue .
Terrible things can happen on both sides of this issues , if it 's recognized for what it is and the way it impacts a woman 's life and impacts society .
And that 's what I think we need to look at .
There are a lot of mainstream Americans out there that care about this issue .
It is n't -- you know -- people can stereotype us and call us names if they want to .
You know what ?
We do n't care , because there 's just more and more of us , and we 're having more of a political effect .
And , I hope we 'll get some credibility with the media only so that we can look at these issues in a -- in a real way .
BRANCACCIO : Well , Mary Kay Culp , Kansans for Life , thanks for coming in to help us understand where you 're coming from and possibly understand where the ascent of Samuel Alito came from .
MARY KAY CULP : Thank you for allowing me to come .
I appreciate it .
That woman who believes that abortion is the killing of babies with knives is one slick political operator .
She knows that this is n't about any dialog .
She knows that Alito will vote to overturn Roe .
She knows that the minute Roe is overturned a whole bunch of states will make it illegal .
She is lying about all of that .
Why in the hell is it necessary for some woman from Kansas not to tell the truth about her cause or her goals ?
What is she so afraid of ?
Why does the born again conservative president have to phone in his support instead of appearing proudly and openly before his pro-life supporters ?
If this is an issue of deeply felt morality that all Americans are having difficulty dealing with , why can't they just admit openly that they want to outlaw abortion ?
We know why :
Only 25 percent of those polled said they believe the precedent should be overturned , while 66 percent said they believe Roe should stand .
Could someone please inform the Democrats that when 66 percent of the public agrees with you on an issue that you can feel confident that you are not losing elections because of that issue ?
Pro-life people even at the state level are savvy political con artists who are pretending to be more powerful than they are while lying about their goals .
They are operating from a position of weakness not strength .
Anybody in politics who is fooled by this crap should be fired .

The very definition of " choice " precludes absolutism .
There is no pro-choice advocate in the country who does n't believe that any woman has the right to bear a child if she chooses .
They would never require any individual to have an abortion .
In fact , many pro-choice peoplewould not choose to have an abortion and the vast number of them have children .
But recognizing the inherent complexity of the beginning of life , the cooperative and sometimes competing interests involved and the autonomy of the person in whose body the fetus lives , pro-choice people do not presume to make such a personal and intimate decision for another .
I honesty do n't know how less absolute that can be .
As Armando points out , Douthat 's thesis is typical of the kind of mendacious nonsense you commonly get from the " pro-life " side .
They do not operate in good faith .
( Just last week a comprehensive review of decades of studies showed that one of the most common talking points of the past decade or so --- that women who have abortions suffer from depression -- is simply not based on any scientific data . )
And they are cunning and wily , constantly moving the goalposts .
wrote a post a while back about a famous pro-life activist named Leslee Unruh , who was interviewed on NOW by Maria Hinojosa .
I think she illustrates the kind of thinking we are dealing with :
Here 's another post , featuring a different anti-choice zealot from Kansas , during the Alito hearings :
These people get a lot of credit for being honest , good hearted citizens motivated out of moral compulsion .
But very often they are conniving liars who go to great lengths to hide their real agenda .
They are not honest brokers who are willing to hash out a compromise .
They insist that women not be allowed to have abortions , period , and all that babble is designed to get them to that end , no matter what .
Pro-choice advocates do n't care if there is never another abortion as long as it is what individual women choose for themselves .
The pro-choice movement never says that women must have abortions , use birth control or otherwise do anything they do n't choose to do with their own bodies , including having as many children as their bodies can bear if that 's what they want to do .
The " pro-life " movement , on the other hand , uses slick public relations techniques to further their agenda of forcing women to give birth against their will .
And then they turn around and say that the pro-choice people are absolutists .
It 's maddening .
And I 'm getting very , very tired of hearing Democrats repeat this crap .
From Clinton to Obama and everywhere in between , this issue has been used as a bargaining chip , only to have the other side move the goalposts each time and and continue to demagogue them as advocates of immoral baby killing .
( For all his trouble , Obama is routinely referred to as an advocate of " infanticide " among these people . )
I 'm sorry that people disagree on this .
I wish we did n't .
But the ball is in the court of the anti-choicers .
They refuse to accept the compromise that has been written into law stating that abortions can't be easily obtained after the first trimester and more recently can't be obtained at all after the second .
That 's a compromise and a very real and serious one .
And it 's not enough .
In fact , nothing will be enough until abortion is outlawed .
And then they will begin the war on condoms in earnest .
In fact , they 've already started .
Sadly , I wo n't be surprised in the years to come to see the Democratic party offer up abortion rights as a " compromise " so that women might keep their right to birth control .
That 's where this is headed .
They take pride in making such chump deals , pretending like they are profiles in courage .
( I say pretending because for the most part they know exactly what they are doing --- in this case , they clearly want to get this * icky * issue off the table if they can .
I see no real commitment to it on a philosophical basis except among a few elected women who are far outnumbered --- oh , and the American people . )
Co-founder Biz Stone told Marketing : ' We are noticing more companies using Twitter and individuals following them .
We can identify ways to make this experience even more valuable and charge for commercial accounts . '
He would not be drawn on the level of charges .
Stone said it could also create revenue - generating features to tap into the way brands use Twitter as a hybrid marketing and customer - service tool .
But Bob Pearson , vice - president of communities and conversations at Dell , said : ' If it becomes complicated and costly , our instinct would be to move elsewhere . '
Robin Grant , managing director of social media agency We Are Social , said Twitter could charge for display ads or to access customer information for marketing .
Responding to a Marketing Twitter post asking whether they would continue to use the service if charged , brands were unconvinced .
However , DVD and game rental company LoveFilm said : ' It depends - on price , demand and what else is around . '
Stone insisted Twitter would not charge individual users .

What Goes Around Comes Around :
The Washington Times notes today that many of the recipients of federal bailout funds are also major political donors :
Many of the large American companies that received billions of taxpayer bailout dollars by pleading that they did n't have enough money to lend to customers were , at the same time , spending millions of dollars dispatching lobbyists to influence the federal government .
A Washington Times review of lobbying disclosure reports found that 18 of the top 20 recipients of federal bailout money spent a combined $ 12.2 million lobbying the White House , the Treasury Department , Congress and federal agencies during the last quarter of 2008 .
For instance , the government bought $ 3.4 billion in American Express Co. stock on Jan. 9 as part of an aid package .
In the last quarter of 2008 , the company spent more than $ 1 million on federal lobbying .
The print version of the story also included a chart that listed all of the lobbying expenditures by TARP recipients , but I do n't see that chart in the on - line story .
General Motors spent about $ 6 million in lobbying funds over the last two quarters of 2008 .
Although that seems like a lot of money , it is a drop in bucket compared to the payback that they have received .
BB&T were notable ( as is often the case ) on the chart because they made no lobbying expenditures ( and my impression from what I 've read is that they apparently were a bank that was strong - armed into taking TARP funds even though they did n't want them ) .
Meanwhile , the President of Merrill Lynch has been fired from his position at Bank of America as it has been reported that he accelerated " year - end " executive bonuses to get them paid out before the B of A merger became final -- and subsequent request for government TARP funds .
He also spent $ 1.2 million to redecorate his office last year .
It really does make me wonder sometimes how these guys can sleep at night .
Once the pork - barrel stimulus plan is finalized I expect we 'll see a whole new interesting chart on the links between political contributions and stimulus expenditures .
Could you describe your
program ?
The global customer advocacy program supports Genesys ’ global Sales organization , including LATAM , APAC , and EMEA .
The program itself is located in North America and dare I say Canada because that 's where I 'm based — but really everything is run out of North America .
Today , we operate under Marketing .
That is a very recent change ; up until about a month ago , we were under Sales Operations .
Even though now we reside in Marketing , our sole focus is Sales .
Our program lives in Salesforce because everything lives in Salesforce .
Our sales team lives in Salesforce , and that 's where ReferenceEdge lives , which is awesome from my point of view .
Our program offers three different paths that our sales team can take to find and request a reference .
The easiest path is through the peer - to - peer request feature in ReferenceEdge , where the account executive who owns the reference relationship solely manages the request .
Nine times out of 10 times , I do not get involved in those .
It 's the second path that I get involved in ; those trickier , hard - to - find , one - off references for which you really do n't have a big pool ; you might not have any .
So those are the ones that I get pulled into .
We then have the third path for when executive advocates are needed .
Our Customer Engagement Team manages this type of reference request .
Their responsibility is to foster the relationships that we have with our C - level contacts .
So , our program goes from the simplest — peer - to - peer — all the way up to managing those C - level relationships .
And they all factor into what we put into ReferenceEdge .
Who are your internal stakeholders ?
As far as our focus , it ’s Sales .
We also have stakeholders within Marketing — PR , analyst relations ; and the RFP team .
For example , the RFP team itself does not use ReferenceEdge , as we made it the responsibility of the account executive to find references for RFPs .
If they ca n’t find what they need through a Reference Search , the RFP team can come to the reference team , and we will work together .
What were your top challenges before ReferenceEdge ?
Well , one major challenge was identifying which accounts we could reach out to at any given time , and prior to ReferenceEdge , things were housed in Excel files .
We all know how quickly Excel files go out of date .
You keep references in your back pocket and one day , " Oh , this company 's no longer a customer ! ? "
I was still seeing that back in 2016 when I first joined in this role , and I said , " Wait a second — why do you have an Excel file when we have this really awesome tool that 's in Salesforce based on information that account executives and the Sales teams put into Salesforce ? "
People were like , " Oh , well , we do n't know how accurate it is . "
I said , " Well , it 's as accurate as the information you put in .
And more accurate than that spreadsheet — just sayin . ”
The information in ReferenceEdge is continually updated .
The information that 's there is relevant , and it 's current .
Since launch , what has changed in terms of your company ’s reference practices ?
First , we no longer use spreadsheets that become out of date quickly .
The filters within Reference Search allow us to customize each search and provide the current references at the time of the request .
We now have a single source of truth for reference information company - wide .
And , of course , better reporting capabilities with standard reports through ReferenceEdge , which allows us to report on various factors such as revenue influenced by reference activity .
Since the launch , how has your job changed ?
When I first joined , my responsibility was really to maintain the tool — so managing the information that was in ReferenceEdge and focusing on the data that the account executives see .
Now , my role is more strategic .
The majority of reference requests are peer - to - peer , which allows me to focus on getting new accounts into the reference program to help take the burden off of those customers that are the “ go to ” accounts for everyone .
It also allows me to help with the unique reference requests as well .
What feedback have you gotten from stakeholders ?
Leadership ?
We have the buy - in all the way up to my VP level .
Their thinking is , " Yeah , this is it — ReferenceEdge houses our reference information . "
So , when anyone , anywhere in the company , looks for reference material , this is where they find it , and this is the team they come to ; they come to the reference team .
I know the sales leadership — they get it as well .
The tool works for them .
I jump on weekly sales calls just as a friendly reminder , " Hey , remember , the reference team is here for you .
You know , we have this tool .
We get you 're busy ; we 're here to help you . "
When a request comes in , and an account executive says " Hey , I 'm looking for this third - party integration " , I can say , " You know what ?
I have this , this , and this for you .
And guess what ?
Two of them are in the tool .
So , I 'm now going to walk you through how to find this yourself . ”
They ’re hesitant at first : “ Oh , but I 've never done it before . "
I tell them , “ It 's okay .
It 's easy .
Let me walk you through it . "
And then realize , " Oh , it actually is easy . "
I use these opportunities to foster relationships with the account executives .
What aspects of ReferenceEdge do you value the most ?
Beyond the peer - to - peer request feature , another unique point is the Influitive integration with ReferenceEdge we ’ve had since 2015 .
I 'm very happy to say that the custom - built API that we 've had starting in 2015 is now a standard integration within Influitive which allows transparency to our advocates as well as to our sales team .
That 's a pretty exciting integration for us because we use a points system for advocates .
If you do a reference activity for us , you earn points , and we 're always being asked : " How many points do I have ? "
Having Influitive integrated completely to ReferenceEdge , there 's no having to do anything twice .
When it happens on one side , it happens on the other side .
For our users , having no additional logins or credentials is key to adoption — everybody 's in Salesforce ; nobody wants to have to remember another login ; nobody wants to have to click another window when they already have something open .
The out - of - the - box reporting is awesome .
For me , Salesforce reporting is complicated ; I still have a big learning curve .
But having those out - of - the - box reports is terrific .
I can see the last active date on a specific reference profile and tie it back to revenue or see how many peer - to - peer versus managed requests we have and all that stuff .
Another benefit is that ReferenceEdge is entirely scalable .
We went through a pretty big acquisition in late 2016 .
ReferenceEdge was able to scale with our bigger sales team as well as increased reference accounts .
I was very excited to see that we could scale , and it really was n't painful ; it just happened .
I have tell you , the mapped attributes — 100 % valuable .
It could not be easier to go in and see , " Hey , there 's a new picklist field I could use in the Search function .
Oh , my goodness .
Mapped — done . "
How do you measure program success ?
Success is definitely assessed by the company in terms of revenue influenced .
We measure how many wins have reference activity tied to them .
Personally , I look at how many peer - to - peer requests come in that I did n't have to support .
It keeps growing each year .
Another thing that we 're tracking this year is the number of [ reference request ] emails that go out — when we see someone send a mass email to All Sales , " Hey , I 'm looking for a reference " and I think , " Did you really just send a mass email asking for a reference ?
Are you new ?
Get to training ! ” Everybody 's set in their ways sometimes .
I know learning new software , whether it be Salesforce or changes to Word or Excel , some people do n't take to the change .
So , when we see the reduction in those types of emails , that 's also a success .
How does Point of Reference service compare with other vendors with whom you work ?
My account director is awesome .
Every day , she goes above and beyond .
When I send her those wacky questions where I think , " I feel I should know this , but I 'm going to ask it anyway . "
She 'll never come back and say " Oh , well , on page 20 of the user guide … "
No , she gives me the answer , she gives me a screenshot — it 's awesome .
I have worked with the executive team for different things , most recently related to our integration with Influitive .
The team , as a whole , is phenomenal .
I 've said this many times , and I 'll keep saying it , that they 're not just a vendor ; they 're really a partner .
And you know , my success is their success is my success again when I suggest a product enhancement and they 're like " Yeah , that 's pretty cool " and then it makes it into a release .
They listen — it 's awesome .
Honestly , sometimes , even when a situation is n't a ReferenceEdge issue , they still step up and provide suggestions .
They might say , “ Did you think of looking at this or looking at that ? "
And you know what ?
I had n't , because Salesforce is huge .
They help me , when a technical situation comes up , they put it into terms that I understand so then when I need to go to a Salesforce admin , I can ask intelligent questions .
And not very many vendors will do that — if any .
My experience with other vendors has been , " Oh , well , sorry — we do n't handle that . "
The fact that Point of Reference is there to support us is phenomenal .
I attended the hate - Israel rally held in London ’s Trafalgar Square on Saturday , January 3 .
Some may say I am nuts ; I like to think I am showing a little of the same courage that Israeli soldiers are now displaying as they go into the hell of Gaza .
My late mother was a WAC in World War II , as was my aunt , who served with the army of occupation in Japan .
My sister is a tough cookie and we even have a female cousin who , family lore has it , fought for Trotsky and was shot by a firing squad .
My late father marched on Harrisburg when blacks were not allowed into a civil engineering organization .
So , DNA pumping away , in I marched .
I witnessed crowds of very angry white , middle - class , respectable Britons wearing keffiyahs and piling onto the Tube from the very start of the Northern Line in faraway Barnet .
As my train approached Charing Cross station I realized that if I had identified myself as sympathetic to Israel ’s plight I might have been attacked .
In Trafalgar Square itself thousands of even angrier people milled about ; young men in keffiyahs chanted epithets against Zionists , their fury accompanied by placards with Stars of David superimposed on swastikas and slogans denouncing genocidal , war criminal Israel .
There were Jews for Justice for Palestinians and hundreds of communists , socialists , and revolutionaries who in their youth had all lived on kibbutzim but who now hate the “ imperialist Jewish state . ”
One priceless poster said “ Let Iran Have Nuclear Weapons . ”
I challenged the owner that the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament opposed all nuclear weapons and he bellowed down at me — he a big fella , me a tiny Ashkenazi blob — that the region had to protect itself against Israel .
Another choice piece of posterdom bore a pronouncement about the Arabs being starved because of Israeli produce being farmed .
I reminded its perpetrator that there are over a million Arabs living inside Greater Israel and that the reason why they do n’t all run to escape to the West Bank and Gaza is that they have a pleasant life with a wage , a mosque , freedom of the press , and the right to conduct business .
One non-Muslim stall holder who was banging on at me about the oppression inside Israel was lost for words when I explained that in Haifa and Jaffa I have seen Jewish and Arab retirees playing cards in Arab - run cafes .
A British gentleman selling soaps from Nablus tried to explain oppression with a poster of “ disappearing Palestine ” and that “ these are from the West Bank ” ; I reminded him that Rabin had given back Nablus and Bethlehem and that Begin had given back the Sinai .
Of the scores of leaflets and books being sold in the Square one stood out : entitled “ The Nakba ( Catastrophe ) ” and written by Anne Alexander and John Rose , it tells us that “ the ethnic cleansing of Palestine ” involved the founding fathers of Zionism exporting European fascism and creating a colonial hub in Palestine .
With the little matter of the Holocaust being far less important than “ Zionist land grabbing , ” this screed informs us that the Zionists of 1947 were planning a “ ruthless assault ” on the Arab population of the region .
What is interesting is that this narrative reiterates the issue that dominates the current discourse in Britain : why is it that so many Arabs always die and so few Jews ?
This was asked of me in the Square .
I replied : “ Okay , if you are unhappy that so few Jews are dying right now , start by killing me . ”
Monographs like this spend page after page asserting that the creation of Israel was the worst catastrophe inflicted on the world in modern times .
Imagine the uproar if someone produced a work about the “ catastrophe ” of the creation of the Islamic state of Pakistan during partition in the same year that Israel was created , when a million Indian Hindu , Sikh , and Muslim souls died in brutal violence .
The atmosphere at the January 3 rally , at which visceral speeches about the evil , murderous , criminal , genocidal Zionist entity were delivered hour after hour by what seemed to be endless streams of angry British protesters — former Mayor Ken “ I would never have created an Israel ” Livingstone and Jewish comedian Alexei “ I am ashamed ” Sayle among them — became incendiary when a speaker invited the crowd to march to the Israeli embassy in Kensington .
Next to me several young Muslims in green Hamas scarves wielding large sticks were booked by the police .
Later a large crowd of some 5,000 infuriated protesters descended on the Israeli consulate , burned Israeli flags , and hurled missiles whilst another crowd threw hundreds of shoes at Downing Street .
It was a gloriously sunny midwinter day so in Portsmouth , Glasgow , Exeter , Edinburgh , Bristol , Liverpool , Norwich , Hull , Tunbridge Wells , Leeds , Manchester , Newcastle , Swansea , York , Caernarfon , Bradford , and Sheffield angry citizens cried out against “ Zionist oppression , ” demanding boycotts of Israeli goods .
They brought along their children so they would learn early about the “ Zionists stealing the land in 1948 and driving the entire populations of Arabs out of their homes . ”
I reflect for a moment :
On July 7 , 2005 , three London underground stations , each over a hundred years old and undamaged until then even by Hitler ’s Blitzkrieg , were bombed by British Muslims angry about the Iraq War .
On July 21 , 2005 , Anglo - Muslims set about a plot to blow up more buses but were arrested when their devices failed .
In 2006 and 2007 various spectacular bomb and “ airline liquid explosive ” plots were foiled by the brilliant British intelligence services , and in June 2007 devices that would have caused devastation in London ’s West End had they not failed to detonate were placed near crowded nightclubs .
That same weekend British Muslims , including an NHS doctor , tried to blow up Glasgow Airport .
Did the British government crack down on militant organizations and jail masses of Muslims ?
No .
Instead the public discourse was filled with angst about the “ rage ” amongst young British jihadists .
Families of those killed in the July 7 bombs expressed their own despair at the Iraq situation .
What am I getting at ?
That Israel should have “ deep public discourse ” about the rage of Hamas extremists and not bomb Gaza rocket installations ?
No .
What I am saying is that there is a truly frightening and medieval hatred of the Jewish state erupting in Britain that tells me the following :
1 ) It does not matter that Muslims are killing Muslims every day across the globe but it does matter to these angry crowds that Jews are killing Muslims in Gaza .
2 ) It does not matter that Zimbabwe is on its knees but it does matter that “ apartheid Israel is committing a genocidal crime . ”
3 ) The Palestinians , funded with billions from the EU , USA , and countless other organizations , nevertheless languish in perpetual poverty , but their noisy supporters across the globe are accusing Israel of generating a “ holocaust , ” a comparison the gallant Peter Whittle of New Culture Forum finds disgusting and shameful .
4 ) The hatred in the faces of the people I saw at the Gaza rally is a manifestation of years of distorted coverage of the story of the region that has now culminated in attacks on Jewish targets in London .
I can already hear the anti-Zionist movement saying , “ Aha !
You prove our point !
Britain showed admirable restraint in not retaliating after the terror attacks but Israel commits war crimes when homemade rockets are lobbed into Sderot . ”
Frankly , many Britons would have liked to have seen severe measures taken against radical groups but even the Blair government was lamentably lenient .
At the rally one demonstrator argued with me that Britain never bombed Northern Ireland even when attacks were killing soldiers and civilians on mainland Britain ; I argue that the tiny state of Israel has been fighting an existential battle for 60 years in war after war against hostile neighbors bent on its annihilation , and that most of the world sees it as a pesky conurbation of Jews whom it wishes would fall into the sea .
As Anglo - Jewry battens down the hatches amid an already worrying wave of attacks and as I read the pulsating words of Phyllis Chesler and Nidra Poller , I am reminded of this New Year ’s Eve. Across London fireworks entertained us but as they ignited my thoughts turned to the people of southern Israel , living in terror since it vacated Gaza .
My 95 - year - old friend in Ramat Gan , always fearless since she left Germany 75 years ago , rang me and expressed an uncharacteristic terror of the attacks from Hamas .
In 1985 when Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode bombed the houses of MOVE , a radical group he wanted eradicated , Alice Walker said that when one bomb falls it lands on all of humanity .
Yes , true .
But the beleaguered , hardworking people of the Jewish state founded in the ashes of Auschwitz deserve a future rid of violence and hatred , just as the Arabs of the region deserve a livelihood devoid of corruption , primitive oppression , and perpetual radicalism .

Rescue workers have found the bodies of all eight snowmobile riders who were buried under two avalanches in western Canada 's Rocky Mountains .
The incident , which happened on Sunday near Fernie , British Columbia , followed days of heavy snow in the region .
One avalanche buried a group of seven men - another four who went to help were buried by a second slip .
Three men managed to pull themselves free .
The last of the bodies was found soon after the search resumed on Tuesday .
Trained teams with dogs then began a search at the scene , police said .
The three men who pulled themselves from the snow tried to find their companions but had to give up because one was injured and they feared another slide , he said .
One of them went out with rescue teams on Tuesday to search for Mr Bjarnason .
Mr Roberts told a news conference that nobody , especially the survivors , was to blame for the accident .
" Do n't blame yourself .
It 's an act that happens , " he said .
Some 27 inches ( 68 cm ) of snow have fallen in the region in recent days .
Forecasters had warned that the danger of avalanches remained high - hampering the search effort .
( CNN ) --
He had a rough life during the Ice Age , walking around with a couple of broken ribs and a possibly cancerous lesion on his jaw before dying at a young age .
Assistant lab supervisor Trevor Valle discusses the teeth and lower jaw of Columbian mammoth fossil " Zed . "
Now , at least 10,000 years later , visitors in Los Angeles can see the remains of " Zed , " a Columbian mammoth whose nearly intact skeleton is part of what is being described as a key find by paleontologists at Los Angeles ' George C. Page Museum .
Zed was discovered at a construction site in the heart of Los Angeles .
An earth mover helping to build an underground parking garage near the L.A. County Museum of Art uncovered the mammoth 's skull , according to project director Christopher Shaw .
" The skull was hit and shaved off ... by a scraper , " Shaw told CNN Thursday .
" We do n't know just how smashed up it is , but it 's fairly intact because it 's a huge jacket we put it around . "
The mammoth 's fossil was found along with 16 other deposits at the site that paleontologists " tree - boxed " along with the surrounding dirt , creating 23 massive crates weighing between 5 and 53 tons that were then lifted out intact .
Zed 's remains were encased in a plaster jacket .
The construction was being monitored by a consulting firm because the site is so close to the La Brea tar pits -- a site that has yielded between 3 million and 4 million fossilized bones .
Construction on the parking garage began in 2006 but it took two more years for all the recovered materials to be handed over to researchers at the Page Museum , who began analyzing the various fossils in June , Shaw said .
" It 's very exciting for us because each one of these ... could be different ages in the past 10,000 to 45,000 years , " Shaw said .
John Harris , the head curator of the Page Museum , publicly announced the finding of " a whole new treasure trove of fossils " on Wednesday .
He described it as " the most important discovery " for the museum " of the last 90 years . "
Shaw said the announcement was made to " create interest " in the museum 's discovery .
Among the most interesting items is likely to be Zed , who is believed to have died in his late 40s .
Mammoths are thought to have had an average lifespan of about 60 years .
Not all of Zed 's remains have been cleaned off and analyzed .
" Right now we have opened the plaster jacket of four sections that were excavated , including vertebrae and ribs and pelvis , one tusk and the lower jaw , " Shaw said .
" It will take another six to 12 months to open everything . "
Shaw said both of Zed 's tusks were found intact , which is very rare .
" Previously , we 've found mammoths but the tusk material was very poorly preserved , " Shaw said .
" It 's very exciting to us to have these two complete , beautifully preserved tusks . "
The excitement generated by Zed and the rest of the paleontological find could help boost the Page Museum 's attendance and funding , which is key as many museums are seeing their attendance dry up during the recession .
" The cleaning of Zed can be viewed inside the museum inside the ' fishbowl ' -- a windowed area -- as parts of his bones are being cleaned , " Shaw said .
" So people come to see us and we 've constructed small exhibits .
It will attract a lot of people and that will help our funding situation . "
Researchers hope to have the entire skeleton on display by next year .
Shaw said it is unique to have such a major fossil find in the heart of an urban center like Los Angeles .
" I 've always said we 're kind of spoiled here in Rancho La Brea , " he said .
" It 's not like going to the Gobi Desert where you can't take a shower for weeks . "
While the process of cleaning and analyzing the fossils is very intricate and time consuming , Shaw said it is a rare experience for researchers to come in to work and not know what they will discover that day .
" Every day we come to work , we 're uncovering things that have n't seen the light of day for 40,000 years , " he said .
" It 's an exciting thing that we 're doing just that . "

Greek police say they face growing public hostility after the recent riots A Greek riot policeman has been left seriously injured after being shot in central Athens .
Greece 's police chief says bullet cases matched the Kalashnikov rifle used in another attack on police in December .
The officer , 21 - year - old Diamandis Matzounis , was part of a unit guarding the culture ministry when the pre-dawn attack took place .
Last month Greece saw its worst riots in decades after the fatal shooting by police of a teenager in Athens .
A huge manhunt is under way , following the latest attack .
A number of people have been taken in for questioning .
' Gunmen spotted '
The victim was on a life support machine on Monday after spending five hours in surgery .
He lost several litres of blood after being hit in the body and the leg , and is described as being in a critical condition .
The officer had apparently spotted the gunmen and warned his colleagues shortly before he was hit .
Greece 's police chief , Lt Gen Vassilis Tsiatouras , said an automatic rifle and a handgun were used , and that a hand grenade was also thrown during the attack .
He said the rifle was the same as that used on 23 December , when two gunmen hidden within the grounds of Athens University opened fire at a riot police bus as it passed by .
None of about 20 police on board the bus at the time were injured .
A group calling itself Popular Action claimed to be behind that attack .
But General Tsiatouras played down suggestions that the shootings were carried out by a terrorist organisation , saying he thought they were the work of a group of people who had " lost their senses " following the police killing of 15 - year - old Alexis Grigoropoulos .
Daily attacks
The incident took place in the Exarchia district , close to where Grigoropoulos was shot last month .
His death sparked weeks of clashes between rioters and security forces .
The policeman accused of shooting the teenager has been charged with murder .
The BBC's Malcolm Brabant in Athens says police have been subjected to almost daily attacks from rioters since Grigoropoulos was killed .
Our correspondent says there is a fear that the current vehement anti-establishment climate in Greece may lead to a resurgence in domestic terrorism .

From OLPC
Alex Belits ( alias Teapot ) has released a customized version of Ubuntu Intrepid ( 8.10 ) for the OLPC XO .
This is an easy - to - setup , easy - to - use desktop operating system for the XO based on the rock - solid foundations of Ubuntu .
It is ideal for G1G1 adult donors who would like to have a real desktop environment instead of Sugar or for children who are already used to more traditional computers .
When Ubuntu is installed , the Sugar installation is not affected .
The whole OS boots / runs comfortably from the SD card .
If the SD card is removed and the machine is restarted , you boot into Sugar .
Sugar may also be booted without removing the SD card by holding down the " O " game key while powering up the XO .
It also has the most important power management features of Sugar so the XO can be used like a real laptop with it .
XO specific customizations
Deep suspend / resume works for closing / opening the lid
Automatic shallow suspend is supported by a custom script which activates shallow suspend if there is no user input and there is no high load on the system .
This script can be easily activated / deactivated according to the needs .
This can be used for ebook reading or browsing .
Similar to advanced power management of Sugar .
Custom desktop theme with XO - friendly colors ( green...etc )
Battery state of charge indicator works and charge percentage is included in the default desktop toolbar
Dedicated arrow buttons ( left side of the screen ) mapped as direction buttons ( so can be used when browsing for example )
Game buttons are mapped as ( Home / End , Page Up / Down ) , so these can be used for browsing or reading .
Screen rotation with the dedicated button ( below the arrow buttons ) is functional .
Notable features
Xfce desktop preconfigured with GDM , so the user gets a graphical login and desktop without extra setup .
This desktop environment is suitable for the resources of the XO and advanced enough to work with .
Automatic login can be easily set - up with the GDM configurator , so if you want you can get directly into the desktop if you want ( less secure but more comfortable )
Synaptic and GDebi are installed by default so newbies can install extra software by the GUI
Web browsing : Firefox 3.0.4 ( installed by default but not very snappy ) , the latest version of Firefox ( offering improved performance over FF3.0 ) can be installed via optional instructions below , or Opera 9.6 can be easily installed ( starts much faster than Firefox , smaller memory footprint )
PDF capable : ePDFViewer by default , or Evince can be installed easily with Synaptic .
These are very capable PDF viewer programs .
Flash capable : Flash v10 works in Firefox and Opera ( after installing the plugin with Synaptic ) .
Flash - enhanced websites seem to render correctly .
Flash games and videos are too slow , but simple flash applets work .
Watching YouTube videos is supported with a dedicated download / watch program ( TubeWatcher ) .
( This is because Flash video playback is not fast enough to be enjoyable from within the browser ) NOTE : Changes to the YouTube website now prevent TubeWatcher from functioning .
Java capable : Java JRE 1.6 u10 works without issues ( after installing with Synaptic ) .
Azureus works ( advanced , Java based Bittorrent client ) .
FBReader ( advanced ebook reader ) can be installed with Synaptic .
All other Ubuntu Intrepid tested applications can be installed and used ( AbiWord , Gnumeric , OpenOffice...etc )
Mplayer is installed by default .
VLC
Player can be installed easily and plays good - quality movies smoothly
Pidgin installed by default
Skype 1.3 works with headset ( downloaded from skype.com , installed from package , audio device set correctly : see solutions )
Swap file can be easily created , so larger applications can be run on the 256 Mb physical RAM of the XO .
A 256Mb swap is recommended for OpenOffice .
The above install can fit to a 2GB SD card but you wo n't have too much free space remaining .
A 4GB SD card is recommended .
Not supported
The XO cannot hibernate like a normal laptop ( that would further reduce inactive power consumption compared to deep suspend ) .
However , suspend to ram ( deep suspend ) works and results in low power loss while the XO is not in use .
Wacom driver for an external USB tablet is not installed .
Requirements
You will need at least a 2GB SD card and a 1GB USB memory device .
A 4GB or larger SD card is recommended to provide adequate space for applications and data .
An unlocked laptop .
Obtain a Developer Key for your XO : http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activation_and_Developer_Keys
Upgrade your OLPC OS to at least version 8.2.0 : http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Release_notes/8.2.0
Upgrade your OLPC Firmware to at least to the version q2e18 ( should be installed automatically with OS 8.2.0 ) : http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Firmware_q2e18
Obtain the customized Ubuntu Intrepid via BitTorrent ( from http://mars.illtel.denver.co.us/~abelits/torrents/OLPCFiles-intrepid-20081130.tar.bz2.torrent) and place the .bz2 file on a USB memory device .
BitTorrent on XO
If you do not have another computer with a BitTorrent client installed , you can install BitTorrent on the XO under Sugar and use it to download the file .
Open Terminal and type :
sudo yum install bittorrent
Do not attempt to download the file to your XO 's internal NAND flash memory , as the file is very large and you 're going to have to copy it to a USB device anyway for installation .
Connect a USB drive .
Start the BitTorrent client and download the file to the USB drive .
cd /media /${DEVICE} bittorrent - curses $ {URL}
... where $ {DEVICE} is the filesystem mount point where your USB drive is mounted , and $ {URL} is the link to the .torrent file above .
Installation Procedures
Boot your OLPC into Sugar and start the Terminal activity .
Caution :
It is recommended to copy and paste all of the following commands into Terminal rather than typing them , as mistakes may render your system nonfunctional .
Connect the USB drive .
Do NOT insert SD card yet .
The process will fail if the SD card is already inserted .
Open Terminal and type
mount | grep / dev/sd
It may take a few seconds for the USB drive to be noticed .
Repeat until it returns a line like this :

Update system
sudo aptitude update
Start Terminal and complete the configuration :
sudo aptitude safe - upgrade sudo aptitude reinstall ssl - cert sudo aptitude clean sudo / etc / init.d / cups start mkdir . mplayer echo -e ' vo=sdl
framedrop=1
lavdopts=skiploopfilter=all:fast=1 ' > . mplayer / config exit
Optional Steps
Manage your updates
You can type in terminal :
sudo apt - get install update - manager
Change your password with this terminal command :
passwd
Enter olpcolpc as the current password , then enter the new password you intend to use twice .
Changing the password does not change the password for the network manager keyring .
The keyring password will still be olpcolpc .
rm .gnome2/keyrings/login.keyring
will remove the old keyring .
A new one will be created the next time you connect , allowing you to choose a new password .
Install any other packages / software you desire ( gimp , inkscape , msttcorefonts , flashplugin - nonfree , OpenOffice.org , etc. ) Certain Firefox extensions such as flashblock , adblock and noscript are very helpful on the XO .
After installing flashplugin - nonfree , run
sudo ln -s /etc/alternatives/firefox-flashplugin /usr/lib/firefox-addons/plugins/flashplugin-alternative.so
and install flashblock extension ( the usual way , from the browser itself ) .
Upgrade the included Firefox 3.0 to the latest version , which performs considerably faster on the XO .
Use Synaptic Package Manager under the System menu to install the " libstdc++5 " , " libnotify - bin " and w3 m " packages .
Download the Ubuntuzilla .deb package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ubuntuzilla/files/ubuntuzilla/ubuntuzilla-4.6.1-0ubuntu1-i386.deb and install by double - clicking .
Close Firefox .
Open terminal and type
ubuntuzilla.py
Answer the " y/ n " questions to install the latest version of Firefox .
Adding the " Default Full Zoom Level " extension will enable you to specify a default zoom level for browsing .
Adjust your clock :
Set your OLPC to the correct time zone :
sudo dpkg - reconfigure tzdata
If your clock is still not set correctly , set it manually with
sudo date 102413252009
( the format is MMDDhhmmYYYY )
or set the clock automatically by synchronizing with a time server :
sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org
You can make a swap file to improve performance in certain situations .
In this example it 's a 256MB file , so you need at least 256MB of free space on the SD card :
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap.bin bs=1 M count=256 sudo chmod 600 /swap.bin sudo mkswap /swap.bin sudo swapon /swap.bin
If you want to remove it , disable swap first :
sudo swapoff / swap.bin sudo rm /swap.bin
To re-enable swap after each reboot , run
sudo swapon / swap.bin
To automatically enable swap every time the system boots , add the following line to /etc / fstab file :
/ swap.bin none swap defaults 0 0
To tell the system to swap as little as possible to reduce flash wear , add this to /etc/sysctl.conf
# Swap as little as possible vm.swappiness=0
Use
sudo nano filename
to edit those files and be very careful -- wrong entries can render your system unbootable ) .
To use aggressive power saving mode ( suspend on inactivity ) :
sudo touch /etc/xo- suspend / aggressive
and rebooting will enable it
sudo rm /etc/xo- suspend / aggressive
will disable it
Enable automatic login to the desktop :
Go to " Settings > Login Window " and enter your password .
Choose " Xfce Session " as the Default session .
Bring up the Security tab and select Enable Automatic Login .
Note :
You will still be prompted for your keyring password to connect to your network every time you log in , which pretty much defeats the purpose of enabling automatic login .
You can eliminate the keyring password as well , but that requires storing all of your passwords in plain - text .
This is not recommended , but if fully automatic login is more important to you than password security , delete your existing keyring with :
rm .gnome2/keyrings/login.keyring
The next time you reboot and connect to an encrypted network , you 'll be prompted for the network password .
You will then be prompted to create a keyring .
Leave both password boxes blank and click " Create . "
Confirm that you want to store your passwords unencrypted by clicking " Use Unsafe Storage . "
Warning : Anyone who gains physical or remote access to your user account files can now see all of your passwords .
To back up your Ubuntu installation :
Boot into Sugar by holding down the " O " game key while turning on your XO .
Release the game key when directed .
Connect a USB memory device .
Open the terminal and type
su df
Note where the USB and SD are mounted .
The SD is at / media / OLPCRoot and the USB should be / media / USB - device - name .
Then type
cd /media/OLPCRoot tar cvzf / media / USB - device -name/file-name.tgz ./
This is a lengthy process and will take some time to complete .
The exact time required depends upon the contents of your SD card .
You can give your tgz file any name you want .
To restore your backup to the same SD card , use the Sugar terminal to enter
su cd / media / OLPCRoot tar xvzf / media / USB - device - name/ file-name.tgz ./
To restore your backup to a new SD card , follow the same procedures you used to install Ubuntu for the first time , but substitute the " tar xvzf filename " command above for the " tar xvjf filename " in Teapot 's installation instructions .
For proper operation of a mobile device to access wireless broadband , the ppp package is missing and the olpc user has to be added to the dip group :
sudo apt - get install ppp sudo usermod - G dip - a olpc
Now the NetworkManager Applet should work just find with many mobile handsets connected via USB , i.e. Sony Ericsson K600 or K800 series .
Just configure your network operators connection settings there and connect like a WLAN .
Tips and Tricks
To enable the monochrome 200dpi " reader " mode , press the Frame key in the upper - right corner of the keyboard .
The Bulletin Board key ( between the volume control keys and the Frame key ) is mapped as F11 , which toggles between fullscreen and windowed - mode for many applications .
Fixes
If the mic light of the XO is always illuminated , un-check the " V_REFOUT enabled " box in the sound control panel and in the terminal type
alsamixer -V all
Navigate with the arrow keys to the last entry and set it to " MM " by pressing " m " .
Press Esc to quit .

So we ’ve been talking about social media as way to bring in traffic and build community .
All of our discussions on the blog , BlogTalkRadio Insider and our forums are terrific and yielding great results .
But it occurred to me we have a wealth of information in the BlogTalkRadio vault .
We have interviews with Chris Brogan , Guy Kawasaki , Jeremy Owyang , Robert Scoble and many other leaders in this field .
With that in mind , I thought it might be cool and useful to bring out each expert ’s greatest hits .
Today , we ’re going to start with someone I had the pleasure of meeting last fall at BlogWorld Expo ’09 , Chris Brogan .
What impresses me about Chris is that he puts on no airs , the same regular guy you see on Twitter or his blog , is the same regular guy you get in person .
That he really knows his stuff is the icing .
Chris Brogan is no stranger to BlogTalkRadio .
Here are his greatest hits :
In December 2007 , Chris joined Alan Levy to talk about social media and social networking .
Kris Smith sat down with Chris Heuer and Chris Brogan at SXSW interactive last year , to talk about the current state of social , new and emerging media .
John Havens interviewed Chris in October 2007 to discuss community issues and marketing in a pitch averse environment .
In December 2007 John Havens and Chris chatted about transparency and using Twitter as a way to increase a businesses transparency .
Innovations Insider ‘s first show in August 2008 featured a discussion with Chris on how companies are using social media as a channel to reach new audiences and how social media can help organizations reach their business goals .
Oh , look !
John Havens features another discussion with Chris Brogan who was joined by Fast Company ’s Lynne D. Johnson and lijit ’s Ronald Lewis .
( It ’s looking more and more like a man crush , John )
Chris visited with Talking HR in December to discuss social media and business .
In August 2008 , John Lawlor spoke with Chris Brogan & David Alston about the results of their TWebinar.com project .
When Chris visited with Ron Hudson in October , 2008 , he spoke about how to use social media and social networks to build relationships and deliver value .
Chris joined Jim Turner on BlogWorld Expo Radio in October , 2007 .
Just another way to learn from the best on BlogTalkRadio .

The infamous Everquest 2 lying survey continues to make waves , as newly uncovered results reveal that the MMO has five times more bisexual women than the general populace .
Advertisement
The data used in the original survey has been pared down a bit for this new report , which studies gender difference amongst the unnaturally fit EQ2 populace .
Along with echoing previous findings ( females generally getting more into the games than men ) , lead researcher Scott Caplan of the University of Delaware explains that women who play MMO games are those more - likely to reject gender stereotypes .
This conclusion is supported by the gathered data , indicating five times the amount of bisexuality among women in the game as compared to the general population .

Wow .
That 's a lot of physically fit bisexual women milling about , is n't it ?
It 's as if they polled the population of any given college town .
" These are not people who are following strict gender stereotypes , " said Prof Caplan .
" I think that the game itself is right now a very non-traditional activity for women , and so I think what you would find in this population are going to be people who are in other ways less traditional than the majority population . "

Of course i have to stress once again - these are the results of a voluntary study in which participants received a free in - game item for participating , so I can't really see how they can even begin to pretend that they tallied accurate results .
If I was told to complete a study in order to receive a free in - game item , I 'd complete that puppy so fast that I might have wound up one of those hardcore bisexual raider women .
Think about that before you start fantasizing about that hot wood elf you saw running about Qeynos .

LDAP ( Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ) is basically a way of organizing information and providing access to it .
It 's commonly used for user , service and machine information , and it 's incredibly useful .
The Linux version is OpenLDAP .
It will handle authentication as well as information ( so the password aspect of login as well as looking up who the user is , where his home directory is , and so on ) .
However , it 's not as secure as it could be  by default connections are unencrypted , so your password is being sent out in the open .
LDAP organizes information and provides access to it .
Kerberos is designed to handle authentication .
Separate they are useful ; together they offer a powerful and secure solution .
Previously , you could deal with this using SSL tunneling , but that has been deprecated since the retirement of LDAP v2 ( in 2003 ) .
TLS is another option , but even using that , LDAP still has security problems .
For security , your best option is Kerberos .
Kerberos is specifically designed to handle authentication .
It will not do the information lookup that LDAP does .
It avoids password security problems and enables single - sign - on ( a very useful feature ! ) .
So the ideal situation is to use both Kerberos and LDAP : one for authentication and one for information organization and access .
In fact , they do play quite nicely together , but information about on how to achieve this is limited .
If you do want to set them up , check out this two - part article I wrote ( requires registration but is free ) a while back which is still relevant .
You can also get more information from the LDAP and Kerberos web pages .
During the holiday season , I was reminded of the old myth that suicide rates increase over the holidays .
This medical myth has been debunked numerous times and it was one of the topics covered in a recent BMJ story about medical myths .
For many years , people believed this myth because they felt that the depression worsens when depressed patients see other happy and celebrating with friends and family .
Plus , in many areas , the winter seasons may lead to more rain , cloudy weather , and gloomy days for people who may be susceptible to seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) .
So how about suicide ?
How often do depressed patients commit suicide ?
And what prompts depressed individuals to the verge of suicide ?
This is a very complex topic that has no simple explanation .
A few years ago , the FDA added suicide warnings to common anti-depressants .
This included drugs like :
Prozac ( fluoxetine ) ,
Zoloft ( sertraline ) ,
Paxil ( paroxetine ) ,
Luvox ( fluvoxamine ) ,
Celexa ( citalopram ) ,
Lexapro ( escitalopram ) ,
Wellbutrin ( bupropion ) ,
Effexor ( venlafaxine ) ,
Serzone ( nefazodone ) , and
Remeron ( mirtazapine ) .
This is a very long list of extremely common medications .
When this happened , people asked , “ Why do anti-depressants increase the risk of suicide ? ”
Many different theories emerged , but this did not stop clinicians from prescribing these common agents for patients suffering from depression or anxiety .
This warning was also considered very ironic since severely depressed patients are the ones who may commit suicide , yet they are the ones who need to be treated with anti-depressants .
So how do you treat suicidal patients if the treatment may increase the risk of suicide ?
Many people wondered whether the drugs really increased suicide , or if the increased suicide was simply an association without causation .
This matter still seems to be quite controversial among healthcare professionals .
If you ’re going to treat patients who are very suicidal with any type of drug , there is a high chance that some of them may still commit suicide .
More recently , the FDA added suicide warnings to anti-epileptic drugs .
These agents are used to treat patients with seizure disorders ( epilepsy ) .
They are also used to treat certain types of nerve - related pain , also called neuropathy .
Anti-epileptic agents are often used to treat certain migraines .
Not sure which drugs fall into this class ?
Maybe you ’ve heard of some of these :
Tegretol ( carbamazepine ) ,
Klonopin ( clonazepam ) ,
Depakote ( divalproex ) ,
Depakene ( valproic acid ) ,
Zarontin ( ethosuximide ) ,
Peganone ( ethotoin ) ,
Felbatol ( felbamate ) ,
Neurontin ( gabapentin ) ,
Lamictal ( lamotrigine ) ,
Vimpat ( lacosamide ) ,
Keppra ( levetiracetam ) ,
Mesantoin ( mephenytoin ) ,
Celontin ( methsuximide ) ,
Trileptal ( oxcarbazepine ) ,
Dilantin ( phenytoin ) ,
Lyrica ( pregabalin ) ,
Mysoline ( primidone ) ,
Gabitril ( tiagabine ) ,
Topamax ( topiramate ) ,
Tridione ( trimethadione ) , and
Zonegran ( zonisamide ) .
You may have also heard of suicide risks associated with the popular smoking cessation drug Chantix ( varenicline ) .
In February 2008 , the FDA issued a public health advisory about the risks of suicide associated with Chantix .
So what ’s next ?
Will more psychotropic medications get a suicide black box warning ?
What about non-psychotropic medications ?
If the suicide warning gets added to so many different medications , then people may start ignoring the warning if it ’s everywhere .
How often do people read the Surgeon General ’s warning on cigarette packs ?
That warning is ubiquitous .
However , is it effective ?
Do people actually pay attention to that warning , or do they ignore it since they ’ve seen it so many times ?
How are healthcare professionals supposed to prescribe drugs that have a suicide black box warning ?
How are patients supposed to react to such warnings ?
This is a very confusing topic right now , and I ’m eager to see what happens in the next few years as the FDA evaluates suicide association with other drugs .

The average gentile could never have gotten away with what MADOFF is doing because you have to have your people in place in government to help you commit the act .
So do n't consider it genius .
its just a criminal that is part of an organised crime tribe that knows how to play the system for their own enrichment .

An Ontario , New York , man last Friday won the dubious distinction of being the first person arrested under the 2005 Combat Meth Epidemic Act .
According to a DEA press release , William Fousse was arrested for purchasing cold tablets containing more than nine grams of pseudoephedrine within a one month period .
Busted for Bronkaid
Under the Combat Meth Act , passed with little scrutiny when it was attached to a bill renewing provisions of the Patriot Act , chemicals widely used as cold remedies or other non-prescription medicines that can also be used in home meth manufacture , such as ephedrine , pseudoephedrine , and phenylpropanolamine , are now " scheduled listed chemical products . "
Products containing these chemicals are now kept behind the counter .
In order to purchase them , one must show identification and sign a log book at pharmacies .
DEA and state and local law enforcement monitor those logbooks to see if anyone is buying amounts over the limit .
" This is a first for DEA , " crowed DEA Western New York Special Agent in Charge John Gilbride .
" DEA 's focus is to dismantle clandestine methamphetamine labs and trafficking organizations and to also monitor the products that are illegally used to produce methamphetamine .
DEA is committed to keeping our communities safe from the dangers of methamphetamine production and abuse .
Today 's arrest is a warning to those who violate the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act . "
Fousse is alleged to have purchased more than 400 Bronkaid tablets containing a total of more than 29 grams of ephedrine during the month of January -- more than three times the legal limit -- at one pharmacy and to have purchased a like amount at two others .
It was a call from the first pharmacist to the DEA 's Buffalo office that set the wheels in motion .
DEA agents visited Fousse at his home on February 13 .
According to a police affidavit , Fousse said he was unaware of the law , was not selling the pills to meth cooks , and was using the stuff himself .
That was not good enough for the DEA and federal prosecutors .
He faces a May 1 court date .
Perhaps this has been going on for a while , but I 've never noticed it before .
YouTube users often create an original video using their favorite popular song as the audio .
I 'm afraid that they wo n't be able to do that much longer , since YouTube has started muting videos that use unauthorized copyrighted music ( and that pretty much means all user - created videos . )
You can see some examples here , here and here .
The official notice from YouTube under the video says the following :
" This video contains an audio track that has not been authorised by all copyright holders .
The audio has been disabled . "
If YouTube starts being thorough about this , you can expect to see a significant percentage of all YouTube videos muted .
The implications are a bit different than with removing copyrighted professionally produced content , like an official music video ; we 're talking about tens of thousands of fan made videos , funny spoofs , remixes and the like being pretty much destroyed , and I 'm guessing users will be less than thrilled about it .
Thanks to Aniq Rahman for the tip .
It was a little before 8 at night when the breaker went out at Emily Milburn 's home in Galveston .
She was busy preparing her children for school the next day , so she asked her 12 - year - old daughter , Dymond , to pop outside and turn the switch back on .
As Dymond headed toward the breaker , a blue van drove up and three men jumped out rushing toward her .
One of them grabbed her saying , " You 're a prostitute .
You 're coming with me . "
Dymond grabbed onto a tree and started screaming , " Daddy , Daddy , Daddy . "
One of the men covered her mouth .
Two of the men beat her about the face and throat .
As it turned out , the three men were plain - clothed Galveston police officers who had been called to the area regarding three white prostitutes soliciting a white man and a black drug dealer .
All this is according to a lawsuit filed in Galveston federal court by Milburn against the officers .
The lawsuit alleges that the officers thought Dymond , an African - American , was a hooker due to the " tight shorts " she was wearing , despite not fitting the racial description of any of the female suspects .
The police went to the wrong house , two blocks away from the area of the reported illegal activity , Milburn 's attorney , Anthony Griffin , tells Hair Balls .
After the incident , Dymond was hospitalized and suffered black eyes as well as throat and ear drum injuries .
Three weeks later , according to the lawsuit , police went to Dymond 's school , where she was an honor student , and arrested her for assaulting a public servant .
Griffin says the allegations stem from when Dymond fought back against the three men who were trying to take her from her home .
The case went to trial , but the judge declared it a mistrial on the first day , says Griffin .
The new trial is set for February .
" I think we 'll be okay , " says Griffin .
" I do n't think a jury will find a 12 - year - old girl guilty who 's just sitting outside her house .
Any 12 - year - old attacked by three men and told that she 's a prostitute is going to scream and yell for Daddy and hit back and do whatever she can .
She 's scared to death . "
Since the incident more than two years ago , Dymond regularly suffers nightmares in which police officers are raping and beating her and cutting off her fingers , according to the lawsuit .
Griffin says he expects to enter mediation with the officers in early 2009 to resolve the lawsuit .
We 've got calls in to the officers ' lawyer ; we 'll let you know if we hear something .
Update : This is from the officers ' lawyer , William Helfand :
Both the daughter and the father were arrested for assaulting a peace officer .
" The father basically attacked police officers as they were trying to take the daughter into custody after she ran off . "
Also ,
" The city has investigated the matter and found that the conduct of the police officers was appropriate under the circumstances , " Helfand says .
" It 's unfortunate that sometimes police officers have to use force against people who are using force against them .
And the evidence will show that both these folks violated the law and forcefully resisted arrest . "

WASHINGTON 
Over the years , several presidents have been forced to ponder the delicate ( and sometimes unpleasant ) question of whether to move the in - laws into the White House .
Ulysses S. Grant shared space with his father - in - law , who grumbled and squabbled with other relatives , historians say .
Harry S. Truman lived with his mother - in - law , who declared that she knew “ dozens of men better qualified ” to preside over the Oval Office .
On Friday , the transition team of President - elect Barack Obama confirmed that his 71 - year - old mother - in - law would be moving , at least temporarily , into the grand residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave .
While Grant and Truman might have been forgiven for gritting their teeth at such a prospect , Mr. Obama has said he will be delighted to have his wife ’s mother , Marian Robinson , join the first family in Washington .
After all , Mrs. Robinson , known as a loving , tough - minded matriarch who rarely shies from speaking her mind , has been the bedrock of the Obama family .
During the presidential campaign , she retired from her job as a bank secretary to care for the Obama girls , Malia , 10 , and Sasha , 7 , while their parents were on the road .

It 's a choice not many people would have made .
Patrick Rosario saw the chance to stop a pair of criminals and took it .
Rosario was home alone , walking in the basement when he heard a strange noise he could n't ignore .
" I heard a bang , and I 've never heard anything like that in my house .
You could slam the door and it would n't be as loud as that bang was , " he said .
He then heard footsteps , and he could tell they did n't belong to his wife .
" I was n't really worried until I heard running , " he said .
With his heart pounding , Rosario ran up the basement steps and peeked under the door .
Disbelief then sunk in . " ' I 'm getting robbed ' -- that 's literally going through my head , " he said .
Rosario saw burglars ransacking the house , dragging his flat - screen TV , electronics and his wife 's jewelry box to the front door .
Rosario quietly ran out the back door .
Then he spotted the crooks ' getaway car .
It was sitting empty with the engine still running .
That 's when he decided to make a move .
Rosario jumped in the crooks ' car and drove off .
Then he called 911 .
Operator : 911 , what are you reporting ?
Rosario : Somebody 's broken into my house .
Operator : I 'm sorry ?
Rosario : Somebody 's broken into my house !... I just drove their car away .
They 've got nothing .
Operator : Their car ?
Rosario : Yeah , I know .
I stole their car .
Operator : OK , you can now be charged for that , so stop .
Rosario never got to see the look on the burglars ' faces when they realized their plan was foiled .
He was long gone .
Operator :
They 'll be a little confused when they come outside .
Rosario : I hope so .
That was kind of the point .
The men fled , leaving behind all the loot .
" They did n't get anything .
We 've got fingerprints .
They lost their van , " Rosario said .
And Rosario got the satisfaction of knowing that for once , it was the burglars who got bungled big time .
" It was a good feeling , I 've gotta say , " he said .
Rosario was greeted with high - fives from responding deputies , but he admits taking the getaway car was n't the safest move .
Rosario has since invested in a new alarm system .
The burglars remain on the loose .
A description was not available .
Yes .
Okay .
Pride ; hope ; history ; immense joy ; inexpressible relief .
Yes .
Sure .
Absolutely .
But also this .
I was watching the Inauguration , with pride and hope and history and joy and relief .
And the message I kept hearing was , " We are one country .
This country belongs to everybody in it .
Everybody has a voice .
Everybody has a part to play .
Everybody 's experience matters .
" Everybody -- except you .
" Everybody except you and the roughly 15 % of Americans who do n't believe in God .
" Not you .
You 're not part of this .
This is n't for you . "
Yes , yes , I know .
I know what you 're about to say .
Yes , Obama said the word " non-believers " in his speech .
He said , quote :
" For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength , not a weakness .
We are a nation of Christians and Muslims , Jews and Hindus — and non-believers . "
And yes , that was pretty neat .
As far as I know ( does anyone know for sure ? ) , this was the first time that a President 's inaugural address said anything about non-believers in a positive , inclusive way .
I 'm not going to underestimate that .
He said it , and it was pretty darned cool .
A milestone , even .
He said it once ... in a speech , one of a series of speeches over the inaugural ceremony , that over and over again hammered home the message , " This is God 's country . "
From Rick Warren 's icky opening invocation :
" Almighty God , our father , everything we see and everything we can't see exists because of you alone .
It all comes from you , it all belongs to you .
It all exists for your glory .
History is your story .
" The Scripture tells us Hear , oh Israel , the Lord is our God ; the Lord is one .
And you are the compassionate and merciful one .
And you are loving to everyone you have made . "
and :
" ... when we forget you [ God ] , forgive us .
When we presume that our greatness and our prosperity is ours alone , forgive us . "
and :
" I humbly ask this in the name of the one who changed my life , Yeshua , Isa , Jesus , Jesus ( hay - SOOS ) , who taught us to pray , Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name , thy kingdom come , thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven .
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us , and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil , for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever .
Amen . "
Do I need to point out what 's wrong with this ?
Do I need to point out how grotesquely inappropriate it is -- in a massive and public government ceremony , addressed both to and on behalf of a secular nation populated by people of many faiths and many people of no faith -- to assert that everything that happens comes from God and belongs to him ?
To assert that there 's something wrong / needing of forgiveness about " forgetting " God and claiming our achievements for ourselves ?
To not only invoke a prayer on behalf of the whole country , but to do so in a specific prayer that comes from his particular religious tradition , in the name of his particular god ?
Ew .
Okay .
Moving on .
We have the closing benediction from Rev. Joseph Lowery .
A much , much better speech than Warren's , and one which , when you take the God stuff out of it , I have little to argue with and a tremendous amount to be inspired by .
But we still have this :
" Thou , who has by thy might
Led us into the light ,
Keep us forever on the path , we pray .
Lest our feet stray from the places , our God , where we met thee ;
Lest , our heart drunk with the wine of the world , we forget thee
Shadowed beneath
Thy hand ,
May we forever stand
True to thee , O God , and true to our native land . "
and :
" We pray now , oh Lord , for your blessing upon thy servant Barack Obama , the 44th president of these United States ... "
and :
" We thank you for the empowering of thy servant , our 44th President ... "
and :
" Let us take that power back to our homes , our workplaces , our churches , our temples , our mosques , or wherever we seek your will . "
So again , we have the message : It 's God who directs us towards goodness .
It 's really bad to " forget " that .
We -- as a country -- should stand true to God .
( Yes , I know that those words are from " Lift Every Voice and Sing , " the song considered to be the Negro National Anthem , with an important and powerful history in the African American community and the civil rights movement .
I get the value and meaning of using this song in the inaugural ceremony .
But there are plenty of other lyrics from this song that do n't frame the United States as a Christian nation , and that do n't chastise non-believers for their non-belief . )
Plus we have the unsettling notion that Obama is God 's servant .
Sorry , but no .
Obama is our servant .
Yours , mine , ours .
He is the public servant of the people of the United States of America .
It is to us , and to the Constitution , that he owes his allegiance .
Not to God .
And plus we have the very unsettling message that " we " includes people who go to churches , temples , and mosques , people who seek God 's will in an assortment of places ... but " we " does not include people who do n't seek God 's will at all .
" We the people " does not include people who do n't believe in God .
And then .
Most importantly .
From Obama 's own Inaugural address :
" ... the God - given promise that all are equal , all are free , and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness . "
and :
" This is the source of our confidence -- the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny . "
and :
" ... and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God 's grace upon us , we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations . "
No .
No , no , no .
The promise of equality and freedom and opportunity was not given to me by God .
My confidence is not given to me by God .
God 's grace is not upon me .
No .
Finally , of course , the enormous elephant in the room :
We have the very fact that this inauguration was opened and closed with a prayer .
The fact that Sunday 's inaugural concert was opened with a prayer .
The fact that the oath of office was sworn on a Bible , and concluded -- unrequired by the Constitution -- with the words , " So help me God . "
The fact of the insistent repetition of the phrases " God bless you " and " God bless the United States . "
The fact that God was all over this inauguration like a cheap suit ; the examples I 've cited here , while the most egregious , were really just a drop in the bucket .
Completely regardless of the content of these prayers and invocations , we have the unquestioned assumption that religion and prayers and repeated references to God and faith should have a significant part -- indeed , any part whatsoever -- in the ceremonies of our government .
We have the unquestioned assumption that the prayers of a church belong in the single most important ceremony of our state .
Look .
You can't spend all day talking about how God 's grace is upon the nation , and how everything that happens comes from God , and how equality and freedom and opportunity are promised to us by God , and how the elected leader of a democratic country is God 's servant , and how forgetting God is a sin that requires forgiveness -- and then mention once that some of the people making up the strong patchwork of this country are non-believers -- and call that real inclusivity and recognition of non-believers .
Any more than you can spend all day talking about how same - sex couples should n't be allowed to marry , and non- discrimination laws should n't be expanded to cover sexual orientation , and LGBT people should n't be allowed to serve in the military -- and then say , " Oh , no , I 'm not homophobic . "
Am I being churlish ?
Should I just be happy about the mention of non-believers ?
Should I just be happy about this little baby step towards full recognition of atheists as actual citizens of this country , citizens with the same rights and responsibilities , the same expectation of respect and passion to contribute , that everyone else in this country has ?
Maybe .
For the record : I am thrilled that Obama is President .
I 've said it before , and I will say it again : Thrilled .
I 'm thrilled because I care about torture , and global warming , and the economy , and the war , and education , and science , and our standing in the world at large .
I 'm thrilled because I care about our country 's history and future , and I 'm awestruck at what Obama 's election means about who we 've become and what we can be .
And I am thrilled because I care about secularism ; because Obama is a Constitutional scholar , and I think he has potential to be one of the best advocates for secularism and separation of church and state that the White House has seen .
But I am done with this .
I am done with repeated references to God and religion in official government events .
I 'm not just done with it because this is supposed to be a secular , non- sectarian country , founded on ( among other things ) the idea of the separation of church and state .
I 'm not just done with it because I think the very presence of religion in politics makes for a toxic mess , with policy debates based not on observable evidence , but on unsubstantiated dogma .
I 'm done with it because , when Presidents and other official representatives of our country and our government insist that this is God 's country , the implicit -- if unintentional -- message is that , if you do n't believe in God , this is not your country .
Screw that .
This is my country , too .
Officials were counting the dead in a central Nigerian city yesterday after two days of violent clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs .
Nearly 400 bodies are reported to have been received at the main mosque in Jos , while there are also expected to be a significant number of Christian casualties .
Thousands of people fled their homes in the city after rival mobs burned houses , shops , and several churches and mosques in the worst sectarian violence in the country since 2004 .
Witnesses said sporadic gunfire could still be heard yesterday morning , as the army patrolled the city following a 24 - hour curfew , during which soldiers had orders to shoot on sight .
" The situation ... is gradually returning to normal , " Brigadier Emeka Onwuamaegbu told Agence France - Presse .
" There 've not been any cases this morning of any destruction or violence . "
A police spokesman said there were " many dead " but there has been no official confirmation of the number killed .
The violence was triggered by elections in Plateau state , where Jos is the capital .
It sits at the fertile crossroads between Nigeria 's Christian south and Muslim north , and has a history of religious strife .
The mainly Christian - backed People 's Democratic party , which currently holds federal power , was reported to have won the poll - the first in Jos in more than a decade - on Thursday .
But supporters of the All Nigeria People 's party , which has strong Muslim support , suspected vote - rigging after the official results were not posted at the ballot counting centres .
Clashes between gangs of Hausa Muslims and mostly Christian Beroms began on Thursday night and continued into Saturday afternoon .
Security forces were deployed from neighbouring states to try to quell the violence .
Patrolling on foot and in armoured personnel carriers , the soldiers detained more than 500 people .
The road from the north was blocked and flights to the city cancelled .
Local religious and ethnic leaders made appeals for calm on the radio .
Murtala Sani Hashim , who was responsible for registering bodies brought to the main mosque in Jos , said yesterday that the tally of the dead was 367 .
The Jos University Teaching Hospital had received 25 bodies , and 154 injured people .
" Gunshot wounds , machete injuries - those are the two main types , " said Dr Aboi Madaki , the hospital 's director of clinical services .
Dan Tom , a Nigerian Red Cross official , said some bodies had not yet been cleared off the streets .
" Over 10,000 people have been displaced from their homes and are now seeking refuge in churches , mosques , and army and police barracks , " he said .
Communal violence in Nigeria , which has a roughly equal population of Christians and Muslims , is often inflamed by the country 's rough politics .
Local elections are always tense because state authorities control huge budgets .
But competition for resources at an individual level is often the main cause of clashes .
In Nigeria 's " middle belt " , tensions have been simmering for years between mainly Christians and animist minority groups , regarded as indigenous to the area , and Hausa settlers and migrants from the Muslim north .
In 2001 , 1,000 people died in sectarian fighting in Jos .
An Australian woman has been charged with murder after allegedly setting her husband 's genitals on fire because she thought he was having an affair .
Prosecutors told the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Monday that 44 - year - old Rajini Narayan confessed to neighbors that she set her husband on fire on 8 December after she saw him hug another woman .
She was initially charged with endangering life and arson but the charges were upgraded to murder after her 47 - year - old husband , Satish Narayan , died from his injuries last week .

Prosecutor Lucy Boord said Narayan told neighbours she was a " jealous wife " but she had n't meant to kill him when she doused the sleeping man 's genitals with an alcohol - based solvent and then set him on fire .
Boord quoted Narayan allegedly saying : " I just wanted to burn his penis so it belongs to me and no one else ... I did n't mean this to happen . "
The husband jumped out of bed and knocked over the bottle of alcohol , causing the fire to spread and resulting in 1 million Australian dollars ( $ 715 million ) of damage to their town house and an adjacent property , the Adelaide Advertiser reported .
Narayan was remanded in custody for psychological assessment and will reappear in court Friday .
She has been charged with murder , arson and three counts of endangering life , as the couple 's three children were at home during the incident .

Last week I was surprised to receive a press release from Fortune Magazine announcing the publication of their annual list of “ 100 Best Companies to Work For ” .
( How did they find me ?
Was it from the post I wrote blasting their Gen - Y expert ? ) .
This instantly stirred up some negative feeling on my part because frankly ,
I think “ Best Places To Work ” lists are a HUGE SHAM !
Why do I feel this way ?
Because I once worked for a company that would routinely end up on these “ Great Places to Work ” lists and let me tell you , it was anything but great .
My company ’s placement was more a testament to how skilled our PR person was at promoting the company than a true representation of the company ’s quality of life .
However , most of the publications who publish these types of lists boast about how comprehensive their survey criteria are .
For example , here is what was listed in the Fortune press release :
“ To select the “ 100 Best Companies to Work For , ” FORTUNE works with Levering and Moskowitz of the Great Place to Work Institute — a global research and consulting firm with offices in 30 countries — to conduct the most extensive employee survey in corporate America .
More than 81,000 employees from 353 companies responded to the 57 - question survey created by the Institute .
Two - thirds of a company ’s score is based on the survey , which is sent to a minimum of 400 randomly selected employees .
The remaining third is based on the Culture Audit , which includes detailed questions about demographics , pay and benefits , and open - ended questions on philosophy , communication and more . ”
Note how only “ two - thirds of a company ’s score is based on the survey ” of its employees , while the extra third is based on some nebulous “ Culture Audit ” which is most likely a buzzword - infested love fest where management and HR get together in one room and espouse how they promote “ work - life balance ” and “ family - friendly ” policies ( when in reality , they probably offer neither ) .
If a company offers such great perks and benefits , would n’t it show through in an employee survey ?
I remember one such survey I was forced to take on behalf of my company ( and when I say “ forced ” I mean they mass emailed us every week to “ remind ” us to vote and put up fliers all over the office about the survey .
They even posted them in the bathroom stalls ! ) , where I literally gave them negative values ( on a scale of 0 – 5 ) and they still managed to make it onto a “ Best Places To Work ” list .
And this was after my company “ extended ” the deadline to vote because they did n’t even garner the 50 % response rate on the survey needed to submit to the publication .
It ’s also interesting to note how many companies made it onto Fortune ’s list who are now suffering from mass layoffs .
In my home - state of Washington , 2 of the 6 “ Best Corporate Headquarters ” based in Washington ( Microsoft and Starbucks ) just announced massive layoffs .
Other struggling companies that made it onto the Top 100 list also included Whole Foods Market and eBay .
Are layoffs not considered to negatively impact employee morale or company perks , bonuses and performance ?
So when it comes to “ Best Companies To Work For ” lists , I take the advice of Brazen Careerist , Penelope Trunk :
“ You can forget the lists .
The bar is so low to get on the lists that which company is on and which company is off is statistically irrelevant . ”
Are you ready to go to jail for what you believe ?
Would you stand up to the Pentagon by engaging in non-violent civil disobedience to protest torture ?
Two men of faith who have done so , who have walked the same road of Mohandas Gandhi and Rev. Martin Luther King , are Franciscan Louis Vitale and Jesuit Stephen Kelly .
They were 75 and 58 , respectively , when they were jailed .
They submitted themselves for arrest in November , 2006 , as they knelt in prayer in the driveway at the U.S. Army Intelligence Center and School at Fort Huachuca , Arizona .
Ft. Huachuca has been described as the source of the torture manuals used at the infamous School of the Americas .
Writing about his experience in " Sojourners , " an ecumenical Christian magazine , Father Vitale says he and Father Kelly had " hoped to deliver a letter opposing the teaching of torture " to those in charge and to speak with enlisted personnel about the base ’s " illegality and immorality . "
Sadly , for the military as well as for themselves , they were arrested and sentenced by a Tucson , Ariz . , magistrate to prison for five months .
Both have since been released .
In the Imperial County jail in California , Father Vitale made a discovery , that he had nothing more to fear : " we discover the path of resistance : a vocation that we must follow in the midst of empire to overcome the oppression of our brothers and sisters . "
" I realize this stance in my solitary cell ... as the steel doors clang shut , there is freedom to surrender to God and this universe .
There is freedom to be open to the creative call of compassion toward our global community . "
Apparently , it was difficult for Father Vitale to acknowledge the reality " that ours is a nation that tortures . "
He chastises his country because it " has retracted the binding commitment it made when it signed the 1975 U.N. declaration on torture . "
That Declaration in Article I defines torture as " any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official ... "
Father Vitale was disturbed by the photos he saw of torture perpetrated at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , such as " hangings , electric shock , beatings , waterboardings , and other extreme physical and psychological procedures , ” procedures he says were “ spelled out in memos emanating from the White House . "
These tortures have been used in prisons not only in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay , but also in prisons to which the U.S. renders prisoners in Syria , Egypt , Morocco , and other countries .
Father Vitale says he and Father Kelly were motivated to protest at Fort Huachuca by the death of Alyssa Peterson , a young U.S. Army interpreter who was trained there .
" After just two sessions in the cages , she objected and refused to participate in the harsh interrogation techniques being used --- techniques the Army now refuses to describe and records of which have been destroyed , " Fr. Vitale writes .
" She became distraught and was sent to suicide prevention training , only to commit suicide shortly thereafter , " Father Vitale added .
Father Vitale says he would like to know why Maj. Gen. Barbara Fast of Fort Huachuca , formerly chief of military intelligence in Iraq stationed at Abu Ghraib " has never been reprimanded nor prosecuted for her command failure to prevent it . "
He is also concerned that Brig .
Gen. John Custer , who succeeded Fast in charge of Fort Huachuca , allegedly integrated " into standard practice " the techniques elsewhere he learned at Guantanamo .
Father Vitale said when he was in prison he thought about how " Jesus boldly challenged every barrier to the well - being of all , fearlessly breaking the innumerable taboos , customs , and laws that dehumanize , destroy , or diminish human beings , especially the rejected , the feared , the despised .
His life and vision has illumined for me the obligation to say ' no ' to injustice and ' yes ' to love in action . "

I have a mate .
He 's a bad influence .
When he and I get together , we 're positively chaotic .
This episode tells of a time shortly after he was blessed with his first child .
Sit back and enjoy .
So my mate lives on a fairly remote farm .
Not served by regular trash pickup , he is quite canny with his rubbish .
Once their little crotchfruit came along , however , he and the missus quickly ( within three days ) tired of terry - towelling nappies , and bought disposables .
All was fine for four months .
To deal with the disposables , he simply tossed them into a 55 - gallon oil drum outside the house .
Well , the inevitable happened and one day , the drum was full .
This happily coincided with a hot autumn day , a visit from yours truly , and less happily , after quite a lot of beer had been drunk .
What to do , what to do ?
Burying ?
Nope - not biodegradable .
Ca n't take it to the tip , we 're all too pissed .
No more drums , so can't start another load .
I know ; let 's burn it !
It 's , after all , a metal oil drum .
That 'll work great !
Ah , but the drum is full - to the very brim - with sh*tty nappies .
So Dumb and Dumber dug out a drill and cut a hole about a foot from the bottom of the drum .
We then dribbled , over the course of the next two hours , five ( FIVE ! ) gallons of petrol into the top of the barrel .
Then - and we both thought we were SO very clever - we used some detonation cord , and ran it through the hole in the bottom of the drum to light the petrol from the base of the fire .
Now - picture this in slow motion - the following things happened .
The det cord lit .
The burning ACME - like spark travelled prettily along the cord .
It vanished into the freshly cut hole in the drum .
There was a rumbling sound .
That was the oh - no - second .
We turned around and began to run .
Behind us there was a sort of squishBOOM sound as the tragically explosive mixture of petrol and festering , rancid nappies exploded .
So here 's what happened next .
It turns out that ( who knew ? ) 55 - gallon oil drums are stronger than nappies , especially when the top of the drum is missing .
When you ignite a tightly packed drum full of nappies from the bottom , you have created a superb nappy cannon .
As we found out .
After the squishBOOM , there was a louder FLOOOOOOM sound .
I looked over my shoulder to see a huge tongue of fire leaping out of the drum , and balls of fire above that .
The balls of fire turned out to be flaming , shit filled nappies - which flew about 300 feet into the air and then started raining down on the house , the cars , the tractor , us and everything else .
We also found out that stamping on them to put them out is n't nice .
The smell was truly incredible .
Some of those nappies had been festering throughout a British summer , at the bottom of the nappy cannon .
The sound of the molotov shittails thumping down around us , along with the smell of roasting piss , shit and rotten nappy will stay with me forever .
The final crowning glory was when his wife came out of the farmhouse , looked around at the still - unfolding carnage , muttered " fucking hell " and went back inside - not knowing that at least 30 flaming balls of shite were setting fire to the roof above her head .
We eventually got the fires put out , with not too much damage to property , but I was banned for a LONG time . ( , Fri 13 Feb 2009 , 0:56 , 24 replies
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger unveiled a plan Thursday for a steep sales tax increase , new levies on alcoholic drinks and the oil industry , and deep cuts in services to wipe out a budget shortfall that is expected to swell to more than $ 24 billion by mid-2010 .
The linchpin of the plan is the sales tax increase -- 1 1/2 cents on the dollar -- that could raise $ 10.8 billion through fiscal 2009 - 10 .
In Los Angeles County , where voters Tuesday appear to have passed a separate half - cent sales tax hike to fund transit projects , the rate would shoot up to 10.25 % .
The statewide sales tax rate is now 7.25 % .
Republicans , who blocked a smaller increase proposed by the governor last summer , immediately vowed to resist his latest plan .
The plan also calls for extending the sales tax to appliance and furniture repairs , vehicle repairs , golf fees , veterinarian services , amusement parks and sporting events .
Schwarzenegger proposed a 9.9 % tax on the extraction of oil within the state , the expansion of sales tax to some services and a 5 - cent - per - drink tax on alcohol .
His plan also includes a $ 12 increase in annual vehicle registration fees .

The rash of tax proposals comes as California is again headed toward a cash crisis .
Administration officials said the state will not have the funds it needs to cover its bills by March if action is not taken quickly .
The state is starved for cash as the economy continues its downward slide and the stock market plunge takes its toll on income tax collections .
“ We are living in a different world now , ” Schwarzenegger said at a Capitol news conference .
“ We have a dramatic situation and it takes dramatic solutions . ”
His solutions include a number of significant spending reductions , the biggest of which is an immediate $ 2.5 - billion cut from schools and community colleges .
And state workers would be required to take a day off without pay each month , as well as to sacrifice two of their state holidays .
And the governor proposed canceling dental insurance for poor adults on the state ’s MediCal program and lowering subsidies to the aged , blind and disabled .
California ’s welfare subsidies also would be reduced .

Schwarzenegger opened an emergency session of the sitting Legislature on Thursday to deal with the budget shortfall .
Lawmakers will have until the end of the month to take action .
The new class of lawmakers , elected Tuesday , will take office Dec. 1 .
Legislative leaders expressed little optimism that the state could bolster its finances by month ’s end .
Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) and Senate leader Don Perata ( D - Oakland ) said it was Schwarzenegger ’s responsibility to find Republicans who will vote for taxes .
A tax increase requires a two - thirds majority of the Legislature , meaning at least eight GOP lawmakers under the current makeup of the Assembly and Senate .
The governor was unable to round up GOP votes for the smaller tax hike he proposed last summer .
And no Republicans stepped forward Thursday to support the latest plan .
“ Raising taxes is the worst thing we could do right now .
It will devastate an economy that is hanging on by a thread , threaten jobs and hurt working families , ” said a statement by Assembly Republican Leader Michael Villines of Clovis and Senate Republican leader Dave Cogdill of Modesto .
Advertisement
Assembly Budget Committee Vice Chairman Roger Niello ( R - Fair Oaks ) said any tax increase would “ prolong the recession . ”
The governor , however , said he was confident that some GOP lawmakers would come around .
“ Everyone here has gotten a wake - up call ” as revenue has plunged , he said .
“ We are running out of money . ”
Schwarzenegger , who has repeatedly said during his tenure that the state ’s problem is overspending , not a revenue shortage , reversed course Thursday .
The stock market declines , soaring unemployment and the housing bust , he said , are crippling cash flow and more tax revenue is essential .
Advertisement
Democrats embraced that message but balked at the governor ’s proposed spending cuts , saying they would be too big a blow to the state ’s poor and middle - class .
Neither they nor Republicans offered their own plan to close the $ 24 - billion budget gap .
Many of the new taxes and program cuts the governor wants have been proposed before and rejected by lawmakers or voters .
Taxes on oil companies , nickel - a- drink proposals , extending the sales tax to services and events , and a statewide sales - tax hike have all stalled at the ballot box or in the Legislature in the recent past .
Deep cuts to schools were recently fought off by educators , who are preparing to fight again .
State Supt. of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell said Schwarzenegger ’s latest proposal would cause a “ catastrophic disruption in our schools and harm to our students in the middle of the school year . ”

Public employee unions are also gearing up .
“ He is unfortunately again using the budget crisis to attack the hard - working men and women who are California ’s economic engine , ” said Courtni Pugh , executive director of the Service Employees International Union ’s California State Council .
And advocates for healthcare for the poor are mobilizing too .
The latest proposals are familiar to them , including the plan to eliminate dental , vision and podiatry coverage for many recipients of Medi-Cal , the state ’s healthcare program for the poor .
The governor ’s plan to require some adults who earn 72 % to 100 % of the federal poverty level to pay for a portion of their Medi-Cal coverage is also not new .
Advertisement
“ He ’s saying that a family of three making $ 14,000 a year would be too rich to get basic Medi- Cal coverage , ” said Anthony Wright , executive director of Health Access of California , a consumer advocacy group .
The governor is also proposing to cut grants to welfare recipients and the disabled , food stamps and some medical programs for legal immigrants who are not yet citizens .
And he again has recommended scaling back the state ’s In - Home Supportive Services program , which provides personal assistance to the elderly , blind and disabled in their homes .

Hi Bing visitors !
Like this post ?
Hire me for social media consulting .
Social media mimics real relationships — in many cases .
Would you do the following within real face - to - face relationships ?
Jump on the friendship bandwagon without properly introducing yourself ?
Consistently talk about yourself and promote only yourself without regard for those around you ?
Randomly approach a friend you barely talk to and simply ask for favors — repeatedly ?
Introduce yourself to another person as “ Pink House Gardening ? ”
If you answered yes to any of these questions , you may need a refresher course on social media etiquette — and perhaps real - life etiquette also .
Here are some egregious sins that you must not perform on social media sites .
Avoid these violations and learn how to manage and maintain online relationships on a variety of popular social media sites .
Facebook
Adding users as friends without proper introductions .
If you ’re looking to make friends , tell people who you are .
Do n’t assume they know you — especially if they , well , do n’t .
Abuse application invites and consistently invite friends to participate in vampire games .
Many call this spam .
Abusing group invites .
If your friends are interested , they ’ll likely join without your “ encouragement . ”
And if they do n’t accept , do n’t send the group request more than once by asking them to join via email , wall post , or Facebook message .
Turning your Facebook profile photo into a pitch so that you can gather leads through your Facebook connections .
Thanks , but no thanks .
Facebook is about real friendships and not about business — at least not to me .
Using a fake name as your Facebook name .
I ca n’t tell you how many people have added me and their last name is “ Com ” or “ Seo . ” ?
I ’m not adding you unless you can be honest about who you are .
Once upon a time , Facebook deleted all of the accounts that portrayed people as business entities or things .
I wish Facebook would employ the same tactics yet again , because I ’m not adding a fake identity as a friend .
Publicizing a private conversation on a wall post .
In case it is n’t obvious , Facebook wall posts are completely public to all your friends ( unless you tweak your privacy settings ) .
Private matters should be handled privately : via email or even in Facebook private messages .
Tagging individuals in unflattering pictures that may end up costing your friends their jobs .
Avoid the unnecessary commentary also , especially on your childhood pictures that portray your tagged friends as chubby and not so popular .
Further , if your friends request to be untagged , do n’t make a stink of it .
The image above was taken last night and represents the number of pending requests I have on Facebook .
If you ’re one of the pending friends , you may have violated one of the above rules .
Otherwise , see this post .
That said , there ’s one other rule that some individuals follow .
I know this is n’t the case for all individuals , so your mileage may vary :
Forgetting that some individuals wo n’t network with you on a “ personal ” space like Facebook without knowing who you are , even with the proper introduction .
If you ’re looking to establish a professional relationship with someone , consider LinkedIn .
Otherwise , consider building up a rapport with an individual before randomly adding them as your friend .
Some people require face - to - face meetings before they invite you into their private lives .
After all , Facebook was a tool that college students were using before it was open to the public , and some still use it as a purely personal and not a professional tool .
LinkedIn is still seen as the more professional of the two .
Considering the above example , I pose a question on Facebook etiquette :
Is it appropriate to let these requests sit in pending mode or to reject the friends outright ??
In many instances , these requests are probably better off sitting indefinitely ( and it ’s healthier than the rejection ) .
Plus , in the future , you may want to end up responding to that friend request positively .
Twitter
Following a user and then unfollowing them before they have a chance to follow back .
Or unfollowing them as soon as they follow you .
Mass - following everyone so that you can artificially inflate your numbers .
Then , you use that number as a success metric for influence .
And maybe then you submit a press release about it .
Consistently using your Twitter stream for nothing but self - promotion and ego .
Profy highlights this phenomenon quite well .
Requesting that your friends Retweet your Tweets on a consistent basis .
This is much more bothersome when the request comes via IM or email and not on Twitter itself .
The bottom line :
If your content is good enough to stand on its own , it will be Retweeted .
There is no reason to make a personal request .
( And if it does n’t stand on its own , it usually does n’t need to be retweeted . )
Not humanizing your profile .
Twitter is also about real relationships .
Add an avatar and a bio at the minimum .
Let people know who you are .
To take it a step further , make it easy for people to contact you outside Twitter if necessary .
This is especially important if someone on Twitter needs to reach you but ca n’t direct message you since you ’re not following them !?
If they ’re making the effort , it ’s probably because they really want to talk to you .
( Was it something you said ?
Usually . )
Streaming only your blog ’s RSS feed on Twitter .
( If you ’re following anyone like this , feel free to take my advice and unfollow them right now .
They wo n’t engage with you , so why engage with their narcissistic self - promotion ? )
Using Twitter to repeat personal and confidential correspondence .
If you ’re not happy with the way an email communication progressed about a private matter , take it up with the person who you were emailing to square things away .
Certainly , do n’t broadcast your dissatisfaction with the turnout to your entire Twitter audience .
It looks unprofessional for you and makes you appear untrustworthy .
Leverage your Twitter connections to send spam via direct messages to those who follow you .
Two days later , you may wonder why they do n’t follow you anymore .
Abusing Twitter hashtags during a crisis .
It ’s a shame that Mumbai happened , but this was not the opportunity to capitalize on your CRM software .
Using your Twitter feed as a chat room for conversations that are exclusive in nature and not as a broadcast medium .
It ’s nice that Twitter empowers you to use the @ symbol to talk directly to individuals , and that ’s fine in moderation .
As a friend recently said to me , “ I ’m tired of my Twitter feed being a [ private ] conversation between person X , person Y , and person Z. ”
Why do n’t the three of you get a room ?
[ Update : Since this particular tidbit had some follow - up discussion , I summarize this point from @cheapsuits : “ The tweeps that talk everyday to each other about banalities gets old . ” ?
The emphasis here is on “ chat rooms ” that exclude other individuals in conversations that do not provide value .
At all .
Ever .
I think we all would agree about that point !
I also added some new points in italics to clarify . ]
LinkedIn
Gathering all the email addresses of users you are connected to — even locating email addresses of LinkedIn Group managers — and utilizing this mailing list to promote your own company or service off - site .
In a specific case , I manage a few Linked In groups so my email address is far more visible on the site than I ’d like .
I ’m not connected to the Linked In individual who spammed me , but he still took the liberty to use my email address for his personal gain in a completely unsolicited fashion .
Perhaps this individual lost sight that LinkedIn is a professional network and not a spam facilitator .
Even so , recipients should still be required to opt in .
Asking for endorsements from individuals you do n’t know or that did n’t do a good job in your employ .
Writing a recommendation for someone and then firing them just a few days later .
Social News ( Digg , Sphinn , Mixx , Reddit , Tip’d , and a whole load of related sites )
Submitting only your own articles and posts to social media sites .
Consistently “ taking ” ( asking for votes ) but never giving back .
Social news is about reciprocal relationships .
Even if the people you are asking votes of will never actually ask you for votes , a random IM that pops up that says “ Digg this for me ” is far more obtrusive than saying “ hey , how ’s it going ? ” and having a real conversation first .
Shouting the same story repeatedly to your friends .
Can we say spam ?
( And if you are still being shouted at repeatedly , why have n’t you unfriended the offenders ? )
Submitting a story to a social news site that is completely off - topic .
It ’s important to understand the communities you contribute to and to understand the rules of the sites that you target .
Your story about celebrity cell phones simply does not belong on financial social news site Tipd , no matter how you try to spin it .
And when I , as a moderator , tell you that that the submission is not appropriate for the audience especially as it has no relevancy to the subject matter of the site , do n’t argue with the decision .
Using the comments field to drop links , especially to related submissions that were made after the fact .
On social sites where buries are public ( though professional in nature ) , assume that it ’s personal .
In a recent instance , a “ bury ” on a popular social site upset the submitter so much that he resorted to an unprofessional attack on the person who buried the story by blogging about her .
Sadly enough , the bury reason ( which was public for all to see ) was not at all about the writer of the post but was about the content itself .
In social media and in relationships in general , you should be disagreeing with the statement .
That means that you should n’t be assuming they ’re talking about you as the person who made the statement and that the statement is a reflection of a character flaw .
They did n’t like what you said and disagreed .
Grow from it .
Do n’t turn it into something personal when it clearly is n’t .
FriendFeed
Using the service completely for self - promotion .
If you ’re going to claim your social media profile on that totally awesome service , either do n’t share your feeds at all or interact on a semi- consistent basis .
Please ?
FriendFeed is a service but it ’s also a community .
Cross - post on all social sites using a site like ping .
fm .
I do n’t need to see the same message from you on Twitter , FriendFeed , your Google Talk status , your Facebook feed , and on your dog ’s scrolling LED collar .
Keep the spam broadcasts to a minimum .
It ’s obvious on FriendFeed when this facility is abused .
YouTube
Asking someone repeatedly to watch your crummy video , subscribe to your channel , and give you a 5 - star rating .
Force people to subscribe to your YouTube channel by applying an iFrame exploit .
StumbleUpon
Sending more than one story to your network daily .
The key to success is moderation .
Excess converts to spam .
Submitting and reviewing only your own articles .
Do you self - promote this often in real life ?
Submitting a story from another social news site to StumbleUpon for more visibility and eyeballs .
Once upon a time , I stumbled upon a Digg submission of a Sphinn submission of a blog post .
Seriously ?
Why do n’t you just submit the blog post directly instead of using the other sites as conduits ?
( This infraction goes for all social sites that accept submissions , and not just StumbleUpon . )
Blogging and Commenting
Commenting on other articles and using the name “ Yellow Brick Plumbing . ”
Is n’t your name actually Alan ?
There ’s no SEO value to these comments ( they ’re nofollowed by default ) , and all this approach does is makes you lose credibility in the eyes of the blogger .
This is n’t the way to network !
Using content from another blog without attribution .
Sometimes a specific blog will get an exclusive .
Then , another blog will write on the story using the original blog post as its “ source ” without attribution .
Even popular blogs will rip off stories from lesser known blogs in their space .
Do n’t let greed get in the way of your own blogging habits and make sure to link out where appropriate .
Sending a pitch to a blogger requesting a link exchange even though your site has no relevancy at all to their content .
I write about social media , people , not about beer bongs .
And well , they say that social media is the new link exchange , so instead of asking for an old - fashioned link ( which might have worked in 2002 ) , consider using a more viable strategy for this modern time period .
Turning a blog into a flame war against someone you do n’t like .
Scott Hendison recounts how forum spam not only turned into a bitter heated battle that may end up going to the courts but how the individual responsible for the abuse is not slowing down .
If you ’re wrong , acknowledge the wrongdoing and do n’t use other blogs to tarnish someone else ’s image .
Other Social Sites
Join a new social network and then invite everyone you ’ve ever emailed in your lifetime to the service by submitting your entire Gmail address book when the service requests it .
Reading the fine print is a wonderful — and you should never volunteer your email account ’s password to the social site anyway .
( It ’s also helpful to keep in mind that your email account password should not be the same as your social profiles , and that ’s not a question of etiquette — it ’s common sense ! )
Finally , a word on social media etiquette in general :
You ’re leaving your digital signature on the Internet right now .
Think about the consequences of your engagement on any social site .
Racial slurs , criticisms without warrant , and blatant abuse do n’t work in real life , and they really have no place in the social media channels simply because you are far more anonymous on these sites .
If you were living in New York and you walked up to a stranger with the same foul - mouthed comments that are rampant on many social media sites , you may never make it home .
Consider how your comments would be perceived before you actually post them , and think about logic above emotion at all times .
Above all , think about maintaining a certain level of professionalism , since people can use whatever you make “ permanent ” on these sites against you .
Not all blogs will remove a comment after you ’ve requested that they do so simply because you were angry when you wrote the comment .
Before you hit “ post , ” realize that this will be a permanent reflection of your identity and that it may never be erased .
It may even be used against you .
Conclusion
Remember that social media communities are real relationships , real conversations , and as such , they should be treated like they are real .
It ’s not about a me , myself , and I mentality .
It ’s about the collective , the community , and the common good .
Do you find that there are other social media violations that are committed on any of the above social sites — or perhaps on sites that I have n’t yet shared ??
If so , please share these infractions in the comments .

Three surviving British WWI veterans remember the millions who fell
His legs were old and tired now and his eyes were filled with tears .
But Henry Allingham had made a silent promise to absent friends and he was n't about to let them down , not even at the age of 112 .
So yesterday , in the bitter chill of a London morning , the oldest survivor of the Great War summoned all his fading strength to lay a wreath to the fallen .

But he refused to let go of the large poppy wreath until he was certain he could place it himself .
Slowly - and with countless eyes watching on TV screens across Europe - he bent forward to lay it on the ground at the foot of the memorial , with just moments to spare before the buglers sounded the Last Post at his side .

But it was three solemn faces that the winter sun caught when the trio came into Whitehall .
Big Ben sounded in the distance to mark 11 am .
And thus , at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month , the moment the guns fell silent precisely 90 years ago was indelibly marked in modern history .
For two minutes , the loudest noise was birdsong and the flapping of Union Flags above government buildings .
As always , the silence spoke far louder than words .
And all around the country , a similar stillness descended on memorials , in offices and military bases , and on individuals in the street .
Soldiers , sailors and airmen who had lined Whitehall now stood with heads bowed in respect - not just to the million dead of the First World War , one imagines , but for all those new recruits to the fallen .

By the time the trumpeters sounded Reveille , someone with a white handkerchief had to brush a tear from Mr Allingham 's cheek .
Harry Patch 's hands went to his face .
Bill Stone looked towards the sea of red poppies , and then to the sky .
To borrow a phrase from another war , this might have been their finest hour .
But everyone knew that some time soon , their voices would fall silent too .
Perhaps surprisingly , no senior member of the royal family attended the event , missing a rapidly disappearing opportunity to honour the veterans in person at this most significant hour , on this landmark anniversary day .
The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall joined French President Nicolas Sarkozy and First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy in France for the international ceremony at Verdun , and Prince Philip was attending an event on the QE2 in Southampton , where the liner arrived after being showered with a million poppy petals at sea , one for each life lost in the four years of war .
The Queen , who led the nation in remembrance at the Cenotaph on Sunday , was conducting an investiture at Windsor .

Instead , the The Duchess of Gloucester attended as patron of the World War One Veterans Association , standing alongside Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Defence Secretary John Hutton .
When the ceremony ended , the wheelchair veterans were escorted as VIPs through a corridor composed of some of the highest ranking military men in the land , then given guest of honour status at reception Mr Brown threw for them in Downing Street .
The distance they travelled was less than 200 yards , along a specially closed roads .
Ninety years ago it might have taken several months and thousands of lives to gain the same distance on the cloying mud of the battlefield .
Inevitably , their thoughts tayed with those they had to leave behind .
No - one summarised it better than Harry Patch .
Reflecting on the horror and carnage he had said : ' We were n’t heroes .
We did n’t want to be there .
You saw lots of people crying for help but you could n't stop .
We fought for a few yards of soil - and that cost the lives of most of my comrades , including my three best friends .
There was no excuse for such slaughter for so little gain .
It was a terrible waste . '

After the ceremony he added : ' I am very happy to be here today .
It is not just an honour for me , but for an entire generation . '
Mr Stone , speaking in Downing Street , said he was ' deeply proud ' to be representing others at the Cenotaph .
' I have wonderful memories and I still think about my comrades often , ' he said .
Mr Allingham also recalled memories of those who died , and described how he feared every day would be his last .

But the legacy the three men represented today will hopefully survive even longer .
Certainly some of the next generations were there to learn from it , among them three six - year - old schoolboys in short trousers and blazers .
Their teacher Alexandra Coode - reduced to tears when Mr Allingham kissed the poppy wreath - had selected Dominic Bramley - Carr , Luca Guerrini - Maraldi and Kaymar Kawash , from Eaton House School in London , to attend .
They already knew about Poppy Day , and a little about the horror and death that war always brings .
Everyone hoped it would simply be a history lesson for them .

( Adds Miliband , details , quote from resolution , background )
UNITED NATIONS , Jan 8 ( Reuters ) - The U.N. Security Council will vote on Thursday on a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza that Arab diplomats hope will put an end to Israel 's 13 - day offensive against the Palestinian enclave .
" We have an agreed text , " Saudi Arabia 's Foreign Minister Saud Al - Faisal told reporters .
" We are going to vote on it tonight on the Security Council .
This is ... a historic event . "
The resolution to be voted on " stresses the urgency of and calls for an immediate , durable and fully respected ceasefire , leading to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza , " according to a text obtained by Reuters .
Diplomats from all 15 council member states were discussing the draft behind closed doors ahead of the vote , which British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said he hoped would " send a very strong signal about the determination of the whole international community " to help the people Gaza and Israel .
The vote will end nearly a week of closed - door bickering over what -- if any -- text should be adopted by the council .
Arab countries , many facing strong anti-Israeli sentiment at home , had insisted the Security Council must issue a binding resolution that would force Israel to end its military campaign in the Gaza Strip immediately .
The United States , like Israel , was initially against the council passing any kind of statement or resolution on the conflict .
More than 750 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed in the 13 - day offensive aimed at halting rocket attacks from Hamas militants on southern Israel .

When we launched Bespin people noticed that our copy and paste experience was n’t the best .
It was n’t integrating with the system clipboard in most cases .
An editor needs clipboard support .
Needs it .
Essential .
101 .
It turns out that this can be a royal pain to work across various browsers and platforms .
I thought it may be good to share our story , where we were , where we are , and where we want to be .
I also am looking forward to hearing your ideas , as we may have missed something .
First , what are we talking about here ?
With our canvas based editor we needed access to the system clipboard to be able to copy data into , cut , and paste from the outside clipboard .
The first version that we had , used Clipboard Copy which accesses the clipboard APIs available in Flash .
Unfortunately , our parade was rained on .
With Flash 10 Adobe changed the access model to these APIs ( due to security issues ) .
Now a user has to explicitly click on a SWF control to get the access .
To help , zeroclipboard tricks Flash , allowing you to at least fake out the user and have them click on any element .
zeroclipboard hides a translucent SWF control on top of the element so the user thinks they are clicking on the “ copy ” icon , or something like it .
This is all well and good , but we obviously need to tie into the key combinations that we habitually know ( Cmd / Ctrl C , X , and V ) .
With Flash not able to do what we need ( as Flash 10 will be well supported soon , and it broke it ) we needed to take a fresh look at the problem .
What APIs do we have available in the browsers ?
In typical fashion , each browser does things differently .
IE had an early API to give you access .
I wo n’t go into detail on this puppy because we are n’t interested in supporting IE yes , until we can get Canvas / fillText running in a performant manner .
Then we will care .
What about Firefox ?
Firefox has a rich clipboard API in the XUL platform itself via the nsIClipboard interface .
It has everything we could possibly need , and we can implement copy and paste easily :
copy : function ( copytext ) { try { if ( netscape .
security .
PrivilegeManager .
enablePrivilege ) { netscape .
security .
PrivilegeManager .
enablePrivilege ( " UniversalXPConnect " ) ; } else { clipdata = copytext ; return ; } } catch ( ex ) { clipdata = copytext ; return ; } var str = Components .
classes [ " @mozilla.org/supports - string ; 1 " ] .
createInstance ( Components .
interfaces .
nsISupportsString ) ; str. data = copytext ; var trans = Components .
classes [ " @mozilla.org/widget/transferable ; 1 " ] .
createInstance ( Components .
interfaces .
nsITransferable ) ; if ( ! trans ) return false ; trans .
addDataFlavor ( " text / unicode " ) ; trans .
setTransferData ( " text / unicode " , str , copytext .
length * 2 ) ; var clipid = Components .
interfaces .
nsIClipboard ; var clip = Components .
classes [ " @mozilla.org/widget/clipboard ; 1 " ] .
getService ( clipid ) ; if ( ! clip ) return false ; clip .
setData ( trans , null , clipid .
kGlobalClipboard ) ; } , data : function ( ) { try { if ( netscape .
security .
PrivilegeManager .
enablePrivilege ) { netscape .
security .
PrivilegeManager .
enablePrivilege ( " UniversalXPConnect " ) ; } else { return clipdata ; } } catch ( ex ) { return clipdata ; } var clip = Components .
classes [ " @mozilla.org/widget/clipboard ; 1 " ] .
getService ( Components .
interfaces .
nsIClipboard ) ; if ( ! clip ) return false ; var trans = Components .
classes [ " @mozilla.org/widget/transferable ; 1 " ] .
createInstance ( Components .
interfaces .
nsITransferable ) ; if ( ! trans ) return false ; trans .
addDataFlavor ( " text / unicode " ) ; clip .
getData ( trans , clip .
kGlobalClipboard ) ; var str = new Object ( ) ; var strLength = new Object ( ) ; var pastetext = " " ; trans .
getTransferData ( " text / unicode " , str , strLength ) ; if ( str ) str = str. value .
QueryInterface ( Components .
interfaces .
nsISupportsString ) ; if ( str ) pastetext = str. data .
substring ( 0 , strLength .
value / 2 ) ; return pastetext ; }
Verbose is n’t it ?
Hardly the most succinct API ever for the common case , but it does the trick .
Or does it .
You can see the real problem here :
try { if ( netscape .
security .
PrivilegeManager .
enablePrivilege ) { netscape .
security .
PrivilegeManager .
enablePrivilege ( " UniversalXPConnect " ) ; } else { clipdata = copytext ; return ; } } catch ( ex ) { clipdata = copytext ; return ; }
For security , we have to ask the user to give us permission to use copy and paste .
You get one of those ugly dialogues , and the user will be asked repeatedly for each session .
Not only is this a pretty poor user experience , but we ca n’t even get this far .
When we ask for the priviledge , depending on the users settings , changes are that you will never actually get asked to grant them .
You have to sign JavaScript and the like to even get close .
This is pretty crazy .
I do n’t even get a CHANCE to ask the user for extended privileges ( unless you get users to do magic like : user_pref ( " signed.applets.codebase_principal_support " , true ) ; ) .
Here is where the cliff of the Web platform raises its ugly head .
We need to fix this !
Time to get subtle here .
Our use case is n’t about being able to sneakily get access to the clipboard without the user knowing .
All we want it to actually get access based on the user doing something .
When they Cmd / Ctrl C , X , or V .
When they click on a copy button , then do the action .
This is very different than getting access to the clipboard at any time .
In the code above , notice what the exception cause is doing : clipdata = copytext ;
This is our worst case scenario .
If we ca n’t get access to the clipboard then we keep an internal clipboard that only allows you to cut / copy / paste within the editor itself .
As soon as you want to copy something from a web page and paste it into the editor ?
Outta luck .
This is n’t good enough .
Now , let ’s take a look at WebKit .
WebKit does a decent job and implementing the initial Microsoft work in a nicer DOM way .
There are a set of DOM events that have pairings that tell you before * “ getting ready to do the action so set things up if you need ” and then the action itself .
beforecopy
copy
beforecut
cut
beforepaste
paste
In our world with the editor , we use the before events to set things up , and we have to do something pretty hacky to make it happen .
The copy event itself only actually goes through if you are on an element that supports it .
There are hacks around this too .
For example , if you want to be able to get a copy event on a div , you need to turn on contentEdible and set the tab index to - 1 .
Strange huh ?
To get around all of this , we use a hidden text input , which can of course accept these events .
Then , in the before event we focus over to that hidden element .
Here is an example for beforecopy :
Event . observe ( document , " beforecopy " , function ( e ) { e. preventDefault ( ) ; $ ( ' copynpaster ' ) . focus ( ) ; } ) ;
You will notice that we make a call to preventDefault .
This tells the system that we are in control and are handling the copy ourselves .
This turns out to be important is some subtle ways too .
For example ,
The OS will often grey out a menu choice for “ Copy ” if it does n’t see anything selected .
Since we are in control of the selection , we need to override that behavior and continue to pass through the event .
In fact , I noticed a few weird things happening if you do n’t get this all just right .
For example , in WebKit , if you select the “ Edit ” main menu , it would fire a beforecopy right away , and then once again when you selected copy .
Strange .
But , now we have gotten beforecopy to focus us in the text input , we are ready to implement the copy event which will not get passed through .
Here we need to do OUR magic to get the selection that we want to put into the clipboard , and for that we use e.clipboardData.setData( type , data ) .
In our case the type used is just plain text ( test / plain ) but you could use other rich data formats if you need .
You will also notice at the bottom of the code , we focus back on the canvas to shoot us back to where we were .
This completes the cycle :
Event . observe ( document , " copy " , function ( e ) { var selectionText = _editor .
getSelectionAsText ( ) ; if ( selectionText && selectionText != '' ) { e. preventDefault ( ) ; e. clipboardData .
setData ( ' text / plain ' , selectionText ) ; } $ ( ' canvas ' ) . focus ( ) ; } ) ;
The cut action is identical bar the step that gets the data into the clipboard .
In the case of cut we also add a step to delete the current selection :
_editor . ui . actions .
deleteSelection ( selectionObject ) ;
Paste is also quite similar , but instead of adding to the clipboard we are getting the data out , and for that we use :
e. clipboardData .
getData ( ' text / plain ' ) ;
Now we are good to go .
You can see the code in its entirety here .
You may notice some of the wiring up of the two styles ( Firefox / WebKit ) .
We cheat and do a simple test :
setup : function ( ) { if ( Prototype .
Browser .
WebKit ) { this .
install ( new Bespin .
Clipboard .
DOMEvents ( ) ) ; } else { this .
install ( new Bespin .
Clipboard .
Default ( ) ) ; } }
We favour feature detection over browser detection of course , but here it is a little painful as the real test is to to see if the event in a copy / cut / paste / has a clipboard Data object associated with it .
That ’s a little too deep into the onion layers , so we punt .
We would love to use this standards approach with Firefox too , and we almost can .
MDC has docs on support for this , such as paste but the rub is in this bug that states how onpaste does n’t let you getData ( ) back , which makes it useless for all bar signaling when the user wants o paste something .
PPK does a good job talking abou the various quirks with these events in general .
We still have some problems though .
We handle the copy / cut / paste menus and keyboard shortcuts perfectly , but our UI has our own icons that try to kick off these actions .
This is where we need to get zeroclipboard going , and then we are done ( in WebKit ) .
Phew .
That turned out to be a long explanation .
Fun times on the Open Web !
What am I missing ?
What tricks have you run into ?
Inquiring minds want to know !
More articles from Bespin
We are learning a lot from Bespin and beyond .
Here are posts from the team and community that you may find interesting :
The fatal episode occurred in April 2001 over the remote Amazon forest of Peru .
The C.I.A. had been operating in the region as part of a joint counternarcotics mission with the Peruvian Air Force , which had the authority to intercept or shoot down planes that did not comply with orders to land .
Government reports after the shooting attributed the accident in part to language barriers that prevented the pilot from understanding the orders .
The plane was carrying two missionaries , Veronica Bowers and her husband , James Bowers , their two children , and a pilot .
Ms. Bowers ’ husband and the couple ’s son survived the crash , along with the pilot .
Any decision to re-examine the matter could be an early test for the Justice Department under an Obama administration .
If the Justice Department determines there was wrongdoing , it may have no choice about whether to pursue a prosecution .
At the same time , a lengthy investigation into C.I.A. wrongdoing could immediately chill the relationship between the White House and the spy agency at a time when the C.I.A. is central to the American campaign against terrorism .
According to Mr. Helgerson ’s report , C.I.A. officials “ within hours ” of the downing explained the accident as a one - time mistake in an otherwise sound counternarcotics program .
“ In fact , this was not the case , ” the report said .
It said that the C.I.A. repeatedly misled the White House and Congress between 1995 and 2001 about the Peru operation .
The inspector general ’s report said that after the downing of the missionaries ’ plane , the C.I.A. had conducted internal reviews “ that documented sustained and significant violations of required intercept procedures . ”
But it said that the agency had denied Congress , the Department of Justice and the National Security Council access to these findings .
Mr. Hoekstra said Thursday that the inspector general ’s investigation specifically named C.I.A. officials responsible for the alleged cover - up , but he declined to name those officers .
The Justice Department and the C.I.A. inspector general had been investigating the roles played in the incident by the agency ’s field officers in Latin America as well as senior officials at the agency ’s headquarters in Virginia .
It is also possible that C.I.A. lawyers could face scrutiny if the Justice Department decides to reopen the Peru investigation .
The report by Mr. Helgerson says that C.I.A. lawyers from the office of the general counsel “ advised agency managers to avoid written products lest they be subject to legal scrutiny ” in connection with the downing of the plane .

The result of a restructuring at Sun last November has given Ian Murdock the new role of VP of Cloud Computing Strategy , which Murdock recently announced in a video interview with his former Sun colleague Barton George .
George , now at Lombardi Software , had met Murdock , his previous boss , at the Cloud Connect event in Mountain View CA and asked him his reason for being there .
Murdoch told him that he was there on business to get some clarity on cloud computing in general and Sun 's upcoming role in it .
As he says in the interview , " Obviously I have a deep background in Linux distributions , " and he compared his move to the work he had put into the origins of Linux since 1993 .
He was looking for a " Linux distribution equivalent in this cloud computing industry " and saw a similarity especially in the development of open standards , " given the role that Sun has played in the industry for the past 25 years around open standards . "
As he predicts , " I think this is going to be a pretty big part of Sun 's contribution to cloud computing . "
A day after the video interview Murdock followed up with a blog to explain things a bit more .
As he writes , " Over the years , facets of cloud computing have had many names : ASP , grid computing , utility computing , Web services , SOA , mashups , SaaS , Web 2.0 . "
For him these trends combine into one thing : cloud computing .
He recalls the term " Internet operating system " that Tim O'Reilly ( founder and head of the publishing company ) came up with in his 2002 " Inventing the Future " article .
Murdock then formulated some strategic ideas in the form of questions : " Who , then , will come along and similarly stitch the pieces of the cloud together into a cohesive platform ?...
And what will be the equivalent of package management for the cloud , the technology that weaves all the independent pieces maintained by those thousands of hands together ...? "
No coincidence that platform visionary Murdock is now playing a decisive role in Sun 's cloud strategy .
Only a few weeks ago Sun acquired the Q - Layer cloud computing company .
A significant part of Q - Layer 's product palette is NephOS , which provides a data center abstraction layer over existing hardware and virtualization solutions .
Dave Douglas , senior VP for cloud computing at Sun since the summer of 2008 , has his own take on the cloud computing presence in a video presentation .
Binary diffing is a powerful technique to reverse - engineer patches released by software vendors like Microsoft .
Especially by analyzing security patches you can dig into the details of the vulnerabilities it 's fixing .
You can use that information to learn what causes software break .
Also that information can help you write some protection codes for those specific vulnerabilities .
It 's also used to write 1 - day exploits by malware writers or security researchers .
This binary diffing technique is especially useful for Microsoft binaries .
Not like other vendors they are releasing patch regularly and the patched vulnerabilities are relatively concentrated in small areas in the code .
That makes the patched part more visible and apparent to the patch analyzers .

Cookie Monster with a heavily redacted MK Ultra document
Those familiar with the dark world of conspiracy theory already know that almost nothing is what it appears to be .
MK Ultra was the operational name of a host of experiments into mind control conducted by the CIA .
The program officially existed from the 1950s through the 1970s before it was supposedly discontinued .
Although the CIA insists that MK - ULTRA - type experiments have been abandoned , 14 - year CIA veteran Victor Marchetti has stated in various interviews that the CIA routinely conducts disinformation campaigns and that CIA mind control research continued .
In a 1977 interview , Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MK - ULTRA was abandoned a “ cover story ” .
Despite the claims that the program was discontinued , conspiracy theorists have claimed that the Jonestown Massacre was the end result of an MK Ultra program run amuck .
The children ’s television program Sesame Street has long been a favorite of children and adults alike for the supposedly educational and wholesome content of the program , but evidence has begun to mount that this television program and others like it are part of a propaganda machine funded via front organizations meant to disguise the fact that they are actually part of an ongoing MK Ultra covert operation .
James ( a.k.a. Jim ) Maury Henson :
Illuminati puppet - master
Sesame Street first hit the airways on November 10 , 1969 during the time period when it has now been established that MK Ultra was still an active program .
Officially a product of the innocent sounding Children ’s Television Workshop it is in fact funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting .
The CPB was created on November 7 , 1967 when U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 .
This legislation paved the way for an elaborate series of indoctrination programs and covert - ops served up as “ educational programming ” .
Much of Sesame Street ’s appeal was in the notion that it was educational fun that could be enjoyed by both adults and their children alike .
The puppet skits and loose emphasis on teaching letters and numbers seemed like a great way to get children interested in learning .
However it was exactly this mix of innocuous fun and supposedly educational content that allowed for a steady stream of subliminal messages to be fed to America ’s unwitting youth .
While parents thought their children were learning the fundamentals of reading there was a slow , steady stream of coded messages being planted into the content .
Each show had a specific letter and number sequence and over time these coded messages planted subliminal instructions of a still unknown nature in the minds of the young audience .
An entire generation of programmed Manchurian candidates awaiting activation may have been created by way of these subliminal messages .
Meanwhile on a cultural level the characters of the show were used for predictive programming of the culture to accept the cultural problems that we as a society are only now beginning to realize exist .
For example , Cookie Monster ’s character telescoped our nation ’s diabetes and obesity epidemic thirty years in advance of the fact .
Likewise , does anybody remember gay marriage being a political issue before Ernie and Bert were shown happily living together as America ’s first gay puppet couple ?
Rubber Ducky is n’t the only thing Ernie is awfully fond of
( note : rainbow pattern of Bert ’s shirt )
Another suspected MK Ultra children ’s television indoctrination front was Captain Kangaroo .
A recurring gag on the program involved Captain Kangaroo being repeatedly rained upon with ping pong balls in what can only be described as a predictive programming exercise .
The Captain ’s distain for the event was all a part of the conditioned response in that it implied the recurring nature of this particular torment .
While this was played for comedic effect it was obviously indoctrination and children were being trained to expect it and indeed to crave it .
Had Captain Kangaroo not be pelted with ping pong balls at least once each episode by Mr. Moose children would have felt cheated .
That was the entire goal of the program .
This may seem innocent enough on its face , but by inserting the conditioned response into the brain the mind becomes enslaved .
Similar experiments with the same basic results have been conducted for years , most famously by Ivan Petrovich Pavlov and his dogs .
Here is a clip from probable MK Ultra indoctrination program Romper Room :
Notice how the entire point is to train the children to obey simple instructions so they can be better controlled by their masters .
This program was straight up propagandistic obedience training .
The children are being groomed to act as insect drones for the good of the greater colony by being taught to emulate Busy Bee .
How many of these toddlers do you think grew up to become captains of industry ?
More than likely they are simple workers who push the button and turn the knob .
Another recurring skit on Romper Room was the Magic Mirror :
In this skit the children were told , after a psychedelic light show , that the host could see them ( indeed addressing some of them by name ) through the Magic Mirror .
The premise was meant to instill in the child the idea of being under constant surveillance by way of an all - knowing being .
Blind obedience to authority , whether religious or governmental , is the obvious goal of such an exercise .
Clearly MK Ultra is still going strong .
The New World Order elite have been indoctrinating the youth of the planet via children ’s television programming for generations now .
At last tally , Sesame Street and assorted spin - offs had been converted and repackaged for transmission into more than thirty other countries worldwide and some twenty different languages .
He uses his teabags three times and he 's getting married for £ 500 ...
Meet Britain 's meanest man
They say you can tell a lot about a man from his shoes .
So where on earth do you begin with Ieuan Butler , a 39 - year - old builder from Wales ?
The boots he is wearing today are the boots he has worn every day since , er , he can't remember .
Perhaps the Dark Ages .
They started out as ' smart boots ' , but were downgraded many years ago to ' work boots ' .
Since he spends most of his days stomping across construction sites , they 've taken a battering .
Three years ago , you or I would have flung these boots in the bin when bits started dropping off them .
Ieuan , however , was determined that he would get ' another few day's wear ' , and strapped them together with duct tape .
Penny - pinching : Dubbed Britain 's meanest man , Ieuan Butler , can go for days without spending any money
He tells the story with what only can be described as glee .
' What was astonishing was that the tape held for two weeks .
I thought , " I 'm onto something here , " and replaced it , taking a bit more care with it this time .
That time it held for even longer . '
And so it has continued .
For three years .
He can now tell you - in excruciating detail , believe me - everything you never wanted to know about how to hold your shoes together with tape .
His smile is a mile wide .
' People say to me , " but Ieuan , you must spend a fortune on gaffer tape ? "
But I do n't .
I 'm a builder by trade .
When you use a roll for a job there is always some left over , and it just gets thrown in the back of my van .
This way there is no wastage .
It 's brilliant . '
To say that Ieuan does n't like spending money , then , is a bit like saying Ian Paisley does n't like the Pope .
Such is his aversion to scattering the cash that he has just been dubbed Tightest Person in Britain , after a documentary team set out to find the country 's most obsessive penny - pinchers .
Ieuan - a father of seven who uses teabags at least three times - was the clear winner .
The boots are just the start of it when it comes to ' make - do - and - mend ' .
He cleans his house with a tiny pink ( toy ! ) dustpan and brush set that one of his daughters received as a present when she was four .
She is now 18 .
It too needs an introduction to the duct tape .
" Sellotape , gaffer tape and duct tape are big parts of my life , ' he admits , solemnly .
He is an amateur body - builder , so works out pretty much every day , yet he has had his trainers since 1997 , and reckons he will get another few years out of them - thanks to , yes , some tape .
Even when things can't be mended , Ieuan refuses to replace them .
He tells me he has worn the same jumper to work for eight years .
' My son said to me the other day , " Dad , did n't that used to be a fleece ? "
It did , but all the fleecy bits are long gone , so I 'm just left with the nylon base .
It does the job , though .
Some of my friends spend £ 45 on a single shirt .
I think that is the height of madness .
And do n't get me started on Ruth , my partner .
For her last Christmas work do , she went out to buy a new top .
I said , " There are a million tops in your wardrobe , " but she said she had worn them at least once .
' Once !
I ask you !
In my book , to pay its way a piece of clothing would have to get worn hundreds of times .
I would n't spend more than £ 80 on clothes in the entire year , and that includes work stuff .
In fact , I 'd probably spend a lot less . '
It is not surprising to discover that Ruth - the mother of Ieuan 's youngest child , Rosie , three - does not live with him .
They have been together for six years , and have a ' perfect relationship ' , he says .
Except for the fact that his attitude to spending so infuriates her that she refuses to live with him .
' She says it would n't work out , and she is probably right there .
She would want to buy pillows and cushions and things , which just are n't necessary and which I could n't bear to look at because it would remind me of money needlessly spent .
Waste not , want not :
Ienan reuses teabags three times before finally throwing them away
' Us living apart works out fine .
I drive down to see her every weekend and stay at hers .
She does n't much like my driving , so once I am there , we tend to use her car if we have to go out .
That suits me absolutely fine because it means I do n't have to pay for the petrol . '
Ah , the romance !
The pair are planning to get married next year - on a beach , of course , to save venue costs .
' I 've told her that I reckon we can do the whole thing for less than £ 500 , ' says Ieuan .
' We 're going to have everyone in casual clothes to keep costs down , and Ruth 's not the sort to be bothered about having a white or peach dress with a veil . '
But if truth be told , Ieuan is a little baffled to have been voted tightest man in Britain .
' Until the documentary researchers came - and sat there with their mouths open - I thought I was pretty normal , really .
Now , I guess I see that some people would think I was a little obsessive .
For the first 20 minutes of our interview I find it hard not to laugh at his ' odd little ways ' .
He is a walking talking calculator , able to tell you the cost of everything , from a packet of Tetley tea to a candlewick ( 4 p , if you know where to go ) .
He has a mobile phone , but prefers to borrow his sons ' , saving his own free texts and calls .
He has also converted the bottom half of his house into a gym - because he worked out that it would be more cost - effective than forking out for gym membership .
' It was costing me £ 500 a year to go to the gym , plus petrol costs , which was horrific .
Ten years ago , I installed this , and turned upstairs into a kind of bedsit for me .
Now I charge others to use my exercise equipment , so I make money from it .'
His body - building means he can't scrimp and save on food as much as some with his tendencies might , but even here things are meticulously planned .
' I spend £ 45 a week on food , but that is good food - lots of fresh fruit and veg , chicken , tuna , even steak .
But I wo n't buy even a Mars bar on a whim , and certainly not a packet of crisps .
My work mates think I 'm nuts , but it works for me . '
Life can't be a bundle of laughs with him , though .
Poor Ruth , for instance , never gets lavish meals or presents .
' If we are out for the day , Ruth might want to go into KFC , so I 'll go with her , but I 'll take my own Tupperware box of food with me , and much better value for money it is , too . '
It 's all very laudable - if extreme .
And the benefits of his frugal living are evident .
Ieuan may not be rich , but he is n't struggling to get by on his earnings , like so many in his position would be .
He earns £ 22,000 a year , in a good year , yet he has paid off all but £ 18,000 of his mortgage , and his home is now worth £ 120,000 .
He has no debts .
And he has also put one son through university and another through college .
' It baffles me when people who earn an awful lot more than me say they can't manage on their money and start racking up debts on credit cards , ' he says .
' I have one friend who earns £ 45,000 a year and says he can't manage .
That 's ridiculous .
If I earned that , in three years I would have £ 80,000 in the bank , at least .
' I do n't have huge savings - I 'd struggle to get my hands on £ 10,000 - but I have something .
I 'm proud of that .
But I 've arrived at that point only because I use teabags three times .
That 's what people fail to grasp . '
So how did he get his miserly reputation ?
He says that there has never been much money .
His parents split up when he was seven years old , and he grew up in a council house with a mother who did n't work , yet knew how to feed a family of four kids on almost nothing .
He remembers his first job , in a stone quarry , aged 16 .
It paid £ 57 a week , for 58 hours ' work .
While his mates were spending every penny that came in on beer and clubbing , even then he was trying to put it away .
' The most I would spend on a night out would be 75 p for an egg - fried rice on a Friday night .
The other guys would be getting tanked up and broke .
I 'd be as sober as a judge , but going home with money in my pocket , and that felt good .
At the back of my mind , I was always thinking , " Rainy days could be coming " . '
And the rainy days have been plentiful , as it turned out .
His first marriage , to the mother of his first six children ended , " when a friend of mine offered my wife a better life than I could " .
Ouch .
It 's fair to say his ex-wife 's attitude to money was different from his then .
' She wanted to spend it as fast as it came in .
But I certainly did n't .
And we had completely different things to teach the kids about money , too .
It 's been hard since we split because they want mobile phones and trainers , and I 'm the one going , " Do you need this ?
You do n't !
Do n't be silly . " '
He admits that he became obsessive about money - or holding onto it - after that marriage .
Sometimes , he goes for days on end without spending anything .
' One of my sons is a boxer .
He won a fight and got a write - up in the paper .
He told me to buy it , to put it up on my wall .
I said , " No , your granny gets that paper , so I will just wait and get hers when she is done with it . "
That might seem harsh , but I would n't dream of spending even 50 p it if was n't completely necessary . '
He is appalled at Ruth 's wanton spending .
' She likes the fine things in life , ' he says , which makes her sound like Imelda Marcos , but actually Ruth seems perfectly normal .
She is a primary school teacher , earning a pretty basic wage .
She has no debts that he knows of .
How much of a spendaholic can she be ?
' But she spent £ 500 on a Welsh dresser once , ' he points out .
' What is that all about ?
It does n't do anything .
It has no function , apart from to hold things .
I told her she was off her head , but she wo n't listen . '
' The worst thing is that she is getting Rosie hooked on all her habits , too .
I 've heard her say to Ruth , " When are we going shopping to Next , Mummy ? " '
Even Christmas is not a time for excess .
This year he did give his kids presents , as he will at their birthdays , but there was no Wii involved .
' I 'll give the older ones a couple of pounds , which they can spend as they like .
But I wo n't hand over lots .
They have to learn the value of money . '
The other day , one of his sons asked him what he would do if he won the lottery .
Would he go crazy at Selfridges ?
Apparently not .
' I said I 'd buy my kids a house - but two or three bedrooms , not four or five .
And a car - again , Ford Focus , not silly money car like a BMW .
I 'd put £ 10,000 in the bank for them , and that would be it .
What would they need with more ?
You have to work for money .
You have to keep your feet on the ground , and know what things are worth . '
Obviously , his feet are closer to the ground than most , given the flimsy nature of those soles .
Sadly , the boots are bin-bound .
He has just secured a new contract and the site manager told him to get some new ones because his breached every health and safety guideline going .
So how much will he have to spend on a new pair ?
' I dread to think , ' he whistles .
' But it will be double figures . '
TOP TIPS FOR SAVING CASH IN THE CRUNCH
Ieaun had stiff competition for the title of Tightest Person in Britain .
In their hunt , the team heard about a man who used the same piece of foil each day to wrap his sandwiches for a month at a time , and a woman who flushed her loo just once a day to save cash .
Some of the other stars of the programme are Gareth Taylor , a farmer in his mid-50s from Yorkshire , who bought his wife , Wendy , her first ever Christmas present - from him at least - last year .
It was a chainsaw .
He said their fuel bills were getting so big that she could make herself useful by chopping down trees to put on the fire .
Her response , ' I was so stunned I did n't know what to say .
But I was a bit chuffed too .
I 've never ever got a present from him before . '
Ilona Richard , 59 , from Scunthorpe calls herself Mean Queen on a frugal - living website and delights in finding new ways of saving money .
She buys men's underpants instead of ladies ' knickers because she thinks they 're cheaper and last longer .
' OK , so there is an extra bit at the front , but that does n't bother me , ' she says .
Aline Hay , 60 , shops in a bargain basement supermarket , despite living in a 56 - room castle in Scotland .
Even so , she finds the cost of dishwasher powder extortionate , so she puts just a tiny amount in each wash .
' Some people will point out it saves me just £ 30 or £ 40 a year , but that is a huge difference to me , ' she says .
Inside the GPS revolution it's more than maps and driving directions : location - aware phones and apps now deliver the hidden information that lets users make connections and interact with the world in ways they never imagined .
The future is here and it's in your pocket .

“ We know these big waves cannot get into shallow water , ” said David W. Wang of the Naval Research Laboratory , the science arm of the Navy and Marine Corps .
“ That ’s a physical limitation . ”
Image STORM SURGE
The chief engineer of the Stolt Surf took photographs as the tanker met a rogue wave in 1977 .
The deck , nearly 75 feet above sea level , was submerged .

By one definition , the titans of the sea rise to heights of at least 25 meters , or 82 feet , about the size of an eight - story building .
Scientists have calculated their theoretical maximum at 198 feet — higher than the Statue of Liberty or the Capitol rotunda in Washington .
So far , however , they have documented nothing that big .
Large rogues seem to average around 100 feet .
Most waves , big and small alike , form when the wind blows across open water .
The wind ’s force , duration and sweep determine the size of the swells , with big storms building their height .
Waves of about 6 feet are common , though ones up to 30 or even 50 feet are considered unexceptional ( though terrifying to people in even fairly large boats ) .
As waves gain energy from the wind , they become steeper and the crests can break into whitecaps .
The trough preceding a rogue wave can be quite deep , what nautical lore calls a “ hole in the sea . ”
For anyone on a ship , it is a roller coaster plunge that can be disastrous .
Over the centuries , many accounts have told of monster waves that battered and sank ships .
In 1933 in the North Pacific , the Navy oiler Ramapo encountered a huge wave .
The crew , calm enough to triangulate from the ship ’s superstructure , estimated its height at 112 feet .
In 1966 , the Italian cruise ship Michelangelo was steaming toward New York when a giant wave tore a hole in its superstructure , smashed heavy glass 80 feet above the waterline , and killed a crewman and two passengers .
In 1978 , the München , a German barge carrier , sank in the Atlantic .
Surviving bits of twisted wreckage suggested that it surrendered to a wave of great force .
I was going to do a bit of a series , releasing a jQuery tip every day or week or something , but I think I ’m a little too lazy to commit to something like that .
So I ’ve compiled them all into one post !
I ’ll probably add to the list at later dates so make sure to bookmark it !
Do you have a tip nobody knows about ?

$.fn is just a shortcut to jQuery .
prototype .
is just a shortcut to .
You can test if a jQuery collection contains any elements by trying to access the first element , e.g. if ( $ ( selector ) [ 0 ] ) {...} .
. jQuery normalizes the event object across all browsers !
Have a look at all the available properties / methods over here : http://docs.jquery.com/Events/jQuery.Event.
When you create a plugin you have access to the jQuery chain ’s previous object : j Query .
fn .
doSomething = function ( ) { this ; // => $ ( 'a ' ) this .
prevObject ; // => $ ( 'li ' ) //
Remember chaining in your plugins : return this ; } ; jQuery ( ' li ' ) . show ( ) . find ( ' a ' ) .
doSomething ( ) ; //
You could even create a new ' root ' plugin : // ( Returns the ' root ' of a chain ) jQuery .
fn . root = function ( ) { //
Root is always document so we have to // go back to one before the last : var root = this ; while ( root .
prevObject .
prevObject ) { root = root .
prevObject ; } return root ; } ; $ ( ' li ' ) . find ( ' a ' ) . children ( ) . root ( ) ; // <= $ ( 'li ' ) is returned // Using root ( ) is the same as using end ( ) . end ( ) in this situation
You can namespace events !
This is especially useful for plugin development : j Query .
fn . my Plugin = function ( ) { //
Clean up after yourself !
jQuery .
my Plugin = { cleanUp : function ( ) { //
Remove all click handlers binded // as a result of the plugin : j Query ( ' *' ) . unbind ( ' click.myPlugin ' ) ; //
ALternatively , remove ALL events : j Query ( '*' ) . unbind ( '.myPlugin ' ) ; } } ; return this .
bind ( ' click.myPlugin ' , function ( ) { //
Do something ... } ) ; } ; //
Note , you can also namespace data : // E.g. $ ( elem ) .data ( ' whatever .myPlugin' , value ) ;
You can access all event handlers bound to an element ( or any object ) through jQuery ’s event storage : // List bound events : console .
dir ( jQuery ( ' # elem ' ) . data ( ' events ' ) ) ; //
Log ALL handlers for ALL events : j Query .
each ( $ ( ' # elem ' ) . data ( ' events ' ) , function ( i , event ) { jQuery .
each ( event , function ( i , handler ) { console .
log ( handler .
toString ( ) ) ; } ) ; } ) ; //
You can see the actual functions which will occur // on certain events ; great for debugging !
j Query natively supports JSONP ( ‘ JSON with padding ’) which effectively means you can make cross -domain " Ajax " requests ( although not strictly Ajax since it does n’t use XHR ) .
For this to work the requested domain must have some JSONP API in place ( it must be able wrap the JSON with a specified callback function ) .
An example : function getLatestFlickrPics ( tag , callback ) { var flickrFeed = ' http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=' + tag + ' &tagmode=any&format=json&jsoncallback= ? ' ; jQuery .
getJSON ( flickrFeed , callback ) ; } // Usage : getLatestFlickrPics ( ' ferrari ' , function ( data ) { jQuery .
each ( data .
items , function ( i , item ) { $ ( " < img / > " ) . attr ( " src " , item .
media . m ) .
appendTo ( ' body ' ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
You might find it a little messy but jQuery enables us to create an entire DOM structure within a single chain : // Create and inject in one chain : j Query ( ' < div / > ' ) . append ( ' < p > < a href= " # " >
Foo</a></p>' ) . find ( 'p a ' ) . click ( function ( ) { //
Do something ... return false ; } ) . end ( ) . append ( ' < p > < a href= " # " >
Bar</a></p>' ) . find ( ' p :eq ( 1 ) a ' ) . click ( function ( ) { //
Do something else ... return false ; } ) . end ( ) .
appendTo ( ' body ' ) ;
Accessing the DOM elements within a jQuery collection is incredibly easy : var HTMLCollection = $ ( ' div ' ) . get ( ) ; //
Alternatively , if you only want the first element : $ ( ' div ' ) . get ( 0 ) ; $ ( ' div ' ) . get ( ) [ 0 ] ; $ ( ' div ' ) [ 0 ] ;
Not only can you bind events to DOM elements ; you can also bind a custom event to ANY object !
function Widget ( ) { //
Do something ... } ; var my PhotoWidget = new Widget ( ' photos ' ) ; jQuery ( my PhotoWidget ) . bind ( ' photoAdd ' , function ( ) { //
Custom event handling ... } ) ; //
Trigger event : j Query ( my PhotoWidget ) . trigger ( ' photoAdd ' ) ;
Finding the index of a selected element is very easy .
j Query gives us the ‘ index ’ method : $ ( ' table tr ' ) . click ( function ( ) { //
Find index of clicked table row : var index = $ ( ' table tr' ) . index ( this ) ; } ) ;
You can create your own filter selectors .
I did a post on this a while back , but take a look at an example anyway : $. expr [ ' :' ] . external = function ( elem , index , match ) { var url = elem .
href || elem .
src , loc = window .
location ; return !!
url. match ( new RegExp ( ' ^ ' + loc. protocol + '//' + '(?!' + loc. hostname + ' ) ' ) ) ; } ; //
You can now use it within your selectors : // Find all external anchors : $ ( ' a : external ' ) ; //
Find all external script elements : $ ( ' script:external ' ) ; //
Determine if link is external : $ ( ' a#mylink ' ) . is ( ' : external ' ) ; // true / false
I see quite a lot of people still using JavaScript ’s FOR or WHILE constructs to create loops in their jQuery scripts .
There ’s nothing wrong with this but be aware that jQuery ’s ‘ each ’ method can also iterate over arrays and objects !
var my Arr = [ ' apple ' , ' banana ' , ' orange ' ] ; $. each ( my Arr , function ( index , item ) { //
Do something with ' item ' // return false to BREAK // return true to CONTINUE } ) ;
The ‘ filter ’ method accepts a String selector or a function .
When using it with a function you must return false to remove the element from the stack and true to keep it : $ ( ' div ' ) . filter ( function ( ) { return this .
childNodes .
length >
10 ; // Must return a Boolean } ) ;
You do n’t have to give new elements IDs or classes to reference them later , just cache them into a variable : var myInjectedDiv = $ ( ' < div / > ' ) .
appendTo ( ' body ' ) ; //
Use ' myInjectedDiv ' to reference the element : myInjectedDiv. bind ( ' click ' , function ( ) { // ... } ) ;
j Query ’s ‘ map ’ method is incredibly useful , the passed function will be run on every item of the passed array ( or object ) and whatever the function returns each time is added to the new array , take a look : // Create an array containing all anchor HREF attributes : var URLs = $. map ( $ ( ' a ' ) , function ( elem , index ) { return elem .
href ; } ) ; // URLs = [ ' http://google.com', ' http://whatever.com', ' http://yahoo.com']
This is n’t jQuery related but it can be very useful .
When you need to compare two different ways of doing something ( performance - wise ) you can use the Firebug console to log the time taken to complete a chunk of code , for example : console .
time ( ' My first method ' ) ; //
Do something ... console .
timeEnd ( ' My first method ' ) ; console .
time ( ' My second method ' ) ; //
Do something else ... console .
timeEnd ( ' My second method ' ) ; //
Firebug will log the time ( in milliseconds ) taken // to complete each chunk ...

The BBC last night confirmed rumours that the BBC 1 show ‘ Hole in the Wall ’ is to move to BBC 4 from Spring 2009 , following complaints from viewers that the show was too subtle and conceptual for its BBC 1 Saturday night slot .
The move comes despite repeated attempts by the show ’s host , Dale Winton , to explain to viewers the various interactions between the moving wall with the hole in it , the contestants , and the pool of water , using a series of diagrams and instructional DVDs .
One viewer complained ‘ This sort of thing is all very well for the eggheads , but how is the ordinary man in the street supposed to get his head round it ?
Despite watching the show many times , recording it and playing it back repeatedly , I am still utterly at a loss as to what on earth is going on . ’
Another commented : ‘ Hole in the Wall is the televisual equivalent of Finnegan ’s Wake – utterly perplexing ’ .
A BBC spokesman said : ‘ The concept behind the show can be difficult for audiences to grasp .
Hopefully ‘ Hole in the Wall ’ will be more at home alongside the art - house films and Stephen Poliakoff dramas on BBC 4 .
What is certain is that the show ’s new host , Jeremy Paxman , will give the project his all ’ .
A radio 4 version is also planned , in which Mark Lawson and Tom Paulin describe exactly what is happening to the listener .
Meanwhile rumours are already circulating around what will replace ‘ Hole in the Wall ’ .
One insider said that two new shows were in the running ; ‘ Throw the Ball ’ and ‘ Celebrity I Bet I Can Fart Louder Than That !’
Writer and Conservative Education spokesman Michael Gove has already agreed to take part .

Come All Ye Faithful Taxpayers Christmas is for Church Members , Say German Politicians
People attending midnight mass at German churches may have to bring their tax returns with them in the future , if two politicians have their way :
They 've called for Christmas services to be confined to regular visitors who pay church tithes .
New Zealanders have begun voting in an election that polls are tipping could herald a change of government in the nation .
In bright sunshine Prime Minister Helen Clark , seeking a historic fourth term , voted in her Mt Albert electorate .
Wearing a bright red jacket Clark posed with onlookers who wanted a photo with the woman some call " Aunty Helen ' ' .
" We have countless thousands of people mobilising Labour supporters out to the polling booths today .
I am feeling very good about it , '' Clark told reporters .
Nearly three million Kiwis have registered to vote and authorities are expecting a record turn - out at polling booths .
Opinion polls show the opposition National Party leads Labour by as much as 18 per cent , although when political alliances are taken into account the result would be much closer .
Brenna Waghorn , 41 , who lives in Clark 's electorate , said while things have n't been perfect under Labour , she would be voting for Clark 's government to be returned .
" We do n't know what National is going to bring .
They are not coming clean with most of their policies , '' she said outside the polling station .
She said the opinion polls were a bit disappointing for Labour , but she had n't given up hope .
" We thought they might lose last time , '' she said .
Anna Parlane , 27 , also lives in Clark 's electorate and said she would vote for the prime minister , but she would cast her party vote to the Green Party .
Some polls are predicting the Greens could capture as much as 11 per cent of the vote nationally .
" I think it is unlikely that Labour will get into government again .
I think people get a bit sick of having the same government so many terms in a row , '' Parlane said .
Across town in the wealthy suburb of Parnell where opposition leader John Key lives , many had a different take .
At a polling station at a local school , Roger Flatz , 47 , said he would be voting National because he disagreed with the " wishy - washy ' ' education system Labour brought in .
" I want it back to the basics - reading , writing and arithmetic , '' Flatz said .
Lidia Nowak , 50 , was working at fundraising hotdog stand at the school .
She said she would vote for National and the ACT Party .
She said she hoped if National were elected they would help reverse the exodus of skilled workers heading to Australia .
" As an employer , when we are looking for staff it becomes much more difficult because they have all gone to Australia , '' Nowak said .
Loading
Eighty - two - year - old Kaye Ibbertson has lived in Parnell most of his life .
He said he would be supporting National , but he thought the New Zealand election paled into insignificance beside the US race .
" It is low key .
They ( politicians ) seem to get up and make their statements which are well - worn and we have heard them all before , '' he said .

Madison Square : Before and After .
Take a moment to appreciate how far we ’ve come in the last few years .
New York City is being honored tonight in Washington D.C. as the first U.S. city to win the ITDP Sustainable Transport Award .
Here is an excerpt from the press release :
New York City has demonstrated that political will , bold
leadership and citizen engagement can lead to sweeping transportation
reforms .
In 2008 , the city implemented key parts of Mayor Michael Bloomberg ’s long - term sustainability vision , PlaNYC 2030 .
The laudable changes made
throughout 2008 have reshaped the experience of walking on New York City
streets .
The city has embraced biking and walking as investment - worthy
transportation alternatives , while the traditional car - oriented
mobility model is taking a back - seat … .
In 2008 , New York City took 49 acres of road space , traffic lanes and
parking spots away from cars and gave it back to the public for bike
lanes , pedestrian areas and public plazas .
Protected on - street bike

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A vaccine designed to protect women and girls from cervical cancer caused by a wart virus may protect men , too , maker Merck and Co reported on Thursday .
The Gardasil vaccine was 90 percent effective in preventing lesions , mostly sexually transmitted warts , caused by the virus in men , Anna Giuliano of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute in Tampa , Florida , and colleagues found .
It was about 45 percent effective in preventing infection with the four strains of HPV that it targets .
“ We see 90.4 percent efficacy is reducing external genital lesions in males related to these four types of HPV -- 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 , ” Giuliano said in a telephone interview .
“ These are the only data evaluating efficacy of any HPV vaccine in preventing disease in males , and were presented for the first time this week at the European Research Organization on Genital Infection and Neoplasia International Multidisciplinary Conference , ” Merck said in a statement .
The human papilloma virus , or HPV , is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the world .
About 20 million Americans currently are infected with HPV , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
It is the main cause of cervical cancer , which kills 3,870 women a year in the United States and 300,000 globally .
It can also cause other types of cancer , including anal and penis cancer as well as mouth and neck cancer .
The CDC estimates that HPV caused 25,000 cases of cancer a year in the United States between 1998 and 2003 .
Gardasil and its rival , GlaxoSmithKline ’s Cervarix , are only approved for use in girls and women , but the companies are seeking new markets and some experts say it should be used in boys and men , to protect them and their future sexual partners .
Merck said it remains on track to submit a U.S. application by the end of the year for the use of Gardasil in males ages 9 to 26 .
Giuliano ’s team tested 4,065 young men ages 16 to 26 , giving them either vaccine or placebo , and then checking them every six months .
Evidence suggests the vaccine has to be given before a person is ever infected with HPV to be effective .
While it protected fewer than half the cases of HPV infection as detected in the blood , the vaccine appeared to prevent the development of genital warts and a precancerous
condition called penile / perineal / perianal intraepithelial neoplasia or PIN .
“ This opens up some really important questions for further research , ” Giuliano said .
“ The cancers in men , which are HPV related are really only now being understood . ”
It will also be important to study whether vaccinating men protects female sexual partners , she said .

The pair are spending time at one of Sean " Diddy " Combs 's homes
Rihanna and Chris Brown are back together , PEOPLE has learned exclusively .
The pair have reunited almost three weeks after Brown , 19 , allegedly battered the “ Umbrella ” singer on Feb. 8 , a source tells PEOPLE .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ They ’re together again .
They care for each other , ” says the source .
The on - again couple are currently spending time together at one of Sean “ Diddy ” Combs ’s homes , on Miami Beach ’s Star Island .
Adds the source : “ While Chris is reflective and saddened about what happened , he is really happy to be with the woman he loves . ”
In its latest issue , PEOPLE reports that Brown called Rihanna on her 21st birthday one week ago .
“ He called to wish her happy birthday , ” a source told the magazine .
“ They ’ve reached out to each other .
It ’s been mutual . ”
The Stanford University School of Medicine has launched the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education , thanks to a $ 150,000 gift in seed money from the 14th Dalai Lama , Tenzin Gyatso .
It 's the largest sum the Dalai Lama has ever given to a scientific effort , according to Stanford .
Impetus for the new center began in 2005 when the Dalai Lama visited Stanford to talk to scientists and Buddhist scholars about spiritual and scientific explanations for the human experiences of craving , suffering and choice .
Stanford Professor William Mobley , a neurologist , moderated the discussions .
Mobley and Jim Doty , a clinical professor of neurosurgery , then got the idea for the center .
Doty and Mobley are co-directors of the new center , which is housed in the Stanford Institute for Neuro - Innovation and Translational Neurosciences .
A Stanford delegation then visited the Dalai Lama in Seattle last March to talk about the plans for the new center , and the Dalai Lama " spontaneously volunteered " the $ 150,000 gift and promised a return visit to Stanford .

“ It is an unofficial requirement for every citizen to own , to read , and to carry this book at all times . ”

Monday , Jan 26th , 2009
A pocket sized book of Barack Obama quotations currently for sale on Amazon.com is causing a stir with customers who have slated the product , comparing it to Communist dictator Mao Tse - Tung ’s “ little red book ” .
The “ Pocket Obama ” , produced by the History Company , is a small blue book filled with “ quotations borrowed from Barack Obama ’s speeches and writings . ”
In a ( presumably ) tongue in cheek comment that has clearly and monumentally backfired , the sales review states , “ It is an unofficial requirement for every citizen to own , to read , and to carry this book at all times . ”
Printed in a size that easily fits into pocket or purse , this book is an anthology of quotations borrowed from Barack Obama ’s speeches and writings .
POCKET OBAMA serves as a reminder of the amazing power of oratory and the remarkable ability of this man to move people with his words .
His superb and captivating oratory style has earned comparisons to John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King , and this collection presents words that catapulted his remarkable rise to the American Presidency .
Includes themes of democracy , politics , war , terrorism , race , community , jurisprudence , faith , personal responsibility , national identity , and above all , his hoped - for vision of a new America .
This book is truly a primer for readers who want to examine the substance of his thought and reflect on the next great chapter in the American story .
It is an unofficial requirement for every citizen to own , to read , and to carry this book at all times .
( Article continues below )
At first glance this may appear to be a hoax , however , the History Company does indeed exist , and has been selling historical items like White House furnishings , models , and books for over ten years .
Irate Amazon customers have been quick to point out the comparison between the “ Pocket Obama ” and Mao ’s little red book of quotations , one of the most widely printed books in history , due to the fact that it was indeed an unofficial requirement for every Chinese citizen to own , to read , and to carry it at all times during the later half of Mao ’s rule .
During the Cultural Revolution , studying the book was not only required in schools but was also a standard practice in the workplace as well .
All units , in the industrial , commercial , agricultural , civil service , and military sectors , organized group sessions for the entire workforce to study the book during working hours .
Quotes from Mao were either bold - faced or highlighted in red , and almost all writing , including scientific essays , had to quote Mao .
Some customers have even uploaded images of Mao ’s book along side the official “ Pocket Obama ” images on the Amazon sales page .
The following represent a selection of “ reviews ” from angry Amazon customers :
Communist manifesto version 2.0 –
Why buy this book here ?
I ’m sure it will be provided for free in the re-education camps .
I ’m sorry but no man – I do n’t care who he is – is deserving of such blind adoration .
Only in Communist China , Stalin ’s Russia , or modern day North Korea or Cuba is “ Dear Leader ” held in such worshipful awe .
And where Dear Leader feels he absolutely deserves such adoration like Obama apparently does .
This is either a joke or the most disturbing thing I ’ve ever seen .
Can sane Americans really have such worshipful adoration for any politician , especially to this level ?
Supporting a politician is one thing , but this is sick , sick , sick .
Mao ’s Little Red Book , now Obama ’s Little Blue Book .
This is actually beyond sick , its frighteningly delusional .
I bought this book and read some of it to my landlord .
Guess what ?!
He said I did n’t have to pay rent any more !
And when I went to fill up my gas tank , the service attendant saw my book , winked , and said , “ No charge ! ”
At the DMV , standing behind 30 + others , I held up my pocket Obama and was immediately ushered to the front of the line !
Wow !
At just $ 5.95 , what a great investment !
It ’s like an all - access pass and everything is free !
Thanks , Mr. Obama !
Staggering , how people can project their hopes into such an empty suit , and expect it to hold its shape .
The pages of this book should be blank .
His words are just campaign rhetoric , people .
He does n’t mean any of it , he has n’t yet accomplished anything to speak of , and he has n’t yet lived up to any of his promises .
Our Dear Leader brilliance is masterfully condensed in this little blue book .
Consider it as a portable fountain of wisdom from which every American should quench his thirst for hope and change every day ( and if some refuse to do it , they should be forced ) .
Long live Obama , great Father of our New Nation , our glorious President for life !
Long live Obama , great Father of our New Nation , our glorious President for life !
WTF ?? , –
This ca n’t be for real .
Seriously people .
Has to be a joke .
Because if it ’s not , we are in deep s**t .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
If investors have regained confidence in the big U.S. banks , they have a funny way of showing it .
Shares of most big banks tumbled Friday morning after the government agreed to convert part of its preferred - stock investment in Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) to common stock .
By swapping $ 25 billion of its preferred shares for new common shares , the Treasury Department is giving Citi a boost to a key measure of its capital cushion against future losses -- tangible common equity .
But the move , the government 's latest bid to quell fears about the New York - based bank 's health , also dilutes existing shareholders .
That is one reason why Citi 's shares tumbled more than 30 % to an 18 - year low Friday .
And some warn it could still leave Citi undercapitalized compared with other banks .
Analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a report Friday that the conversion would raise Citi 's tangible common equity to 4.3 % of total capital -- but noted that this figure is bloated by a deferred tax asset .
Excluding that asset , Goldman said , the ratio would be just 2 % - compared with 3 % at the average large bank .
Other big banks get crushed
Wall Street was not only concerned about Citi 's future though .
Investors were also worried about the possibility of future federal intervention in the banking sector beyond Citi .
Shares Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , which like Citi has received more than $ 100 billion in federal aid in recent months , tumbled 12 % .
Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) fell 7 % .
The use of taxpayer funds to support troubled financial institutions has become unpopular in Congress , particularly in light of recent reports of the perks lavished on some banks receiving federal aid .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke have said repeatedly over the past month that they want to keep the financial system in private hands .
But with the U.S. economy in its worst recession in at least 26 years , there is growing concern among investors that the half - measures taken so far by the government wo n't be enough to prevent a wholesale takeover of the most troubled firms .
With unemployment rising , problems are increasingly spreading to the credit card and auto loan portfolios at many banks .
Earlier this week , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) - one of the healthiest big banks - slashed its quarterly dividend by 87 % in a bid to conserve cash and add to its capital base .
Wall Street had high hopes earlier this month that Geithner would unveil a comprehensive plan to support banks .
But the proposals he outlined were short on details .
Treasury said this week it began conducting so - called stress tests of banks , but results are n't expected for weeks .
In the meantime , investors -- burned in the plunge of financial stocks since the credit markets started seizing up in August 2007 -- are staying away from the banks , frustrating the administration 's efforts to bring in private capital to help solve the crisis .
How to Buy " The Complex , " a Banned Book About Lafayette Hubbard 's Evil Fiction Cult
So Tom Cruise went down to the Amazon offices in Seattle ( they sell the Kindle : the product that will " CHANGE EVERYTHING " ) and he singlehandedly convinced them to stop selling a book called " The Complex " by John Duignan .
" The Complex , " released in October , is a book about how science fiction writer Lafayette Hubbard 's evil paramilitary cult is gaining religious power in order to influence world events and bring about a centralized theocracy .
Sixty years ago , Lafayette Hubbard used the strong and deadly powers he learned from crafting fiction to create a money laundering scheme called " Scientology . "
Hubbard is fiction 's nightmarish burden ; one of our own who went bad ( like cole slaw ) and started convincing people that his beautiful lies were really The Truth of the Universe .
We have all looked into this abyss -- this possible path toward power -- and we have denied it and come back wiser , humbler , and more dedicated to the pursuit of pure romance , naked beauty , and artful fabrication .
But not Lafayette .
He let himself be consumed by the evil inside him .
There are not many " evil " fiction writers -- generally , they are just too damn busy to get much done -- but Lafayette is our cross to bear , our Darth Vader , our Faust , our Voldemort .
Anyway , since Amazon is a bunch of chickenshit cowards ( or complicit ) and have burned " The Complex " for Christmas and made it " temporarily not available , " here is where you can buy it directly from an Irish distributor , an outfit called Eason Books : " The Complex " was written by a man who was a member of Scientology 's elite " Sea Org " for over twenty years and who escaped to his native Catholic country for protection and to tell his tale .
The book is available all over Ireland , and the publisher is trying to sell the rights to somebody here in the States .
If you have money , buy this book and donate it to your local library .
You will be rewarded in heaven ( just kidding -- there is no God -- or if there is , she does n't care what you buy and loves you for your SOOOOOUUUUUUULLLLL ) .
Is n't this scary , though ?
Is n't it scary that Amazon can singlehandedly make a book disappear in America ?
Is n't it scary that they will not fight for the rights of their writers and yet they want to control all of ebook publishing using their appropriately named " Kindle " device ?
It is appropriately named because burning books has never been easier .
You just have to highlight your enemy and hit " backspace . "
Four men accused of helping to organise the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya were today acquitted by a court in Moscow , amid claims by human rights activists that those responsible for her death are still at large .
Two Chechen brothers , Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov , together with a former Moscow policeman , Sergei Khadzhikurbanov , were cleared of offering her killer operational support .
The fourth defendant , Pavel Ryaguzov , a lieutenant colonel in Russia 's FSB spy agency , was acquitted in a separate but related case .

Politkovskaya , Russia 's most famous opposition journalist and a scathing critic of Kremlin power , was shot dead in her Moscow apartment block on October 7 2006 .
Prosecutors alleged that her assassin was a third Makhmudov brother , Rustam , who they claim has now escaped abroad .
The two other Makhmudov brothers staked out her flat before the killing and gave Rustam a lift to the scene , they said .
Friends of the murdered journalist today described the investigation into her murder and the subsequent trial as deeply flawed .
Police have apparently been unable to identify the person who ordered Politkovskaya 's assassination , while sources at Novaya Gazeta , the paper for which Politkovskaya worked as a special correspondent , have described the case against the accused as " very weak " , suggesting the conspiracy was planned at a much higher level .
During the investigation vital pieces of evidence disappeared , including mobile phone SIM cards , computer discs and a photo of Rustam Makhmudov , who apparently fled to western Europe using a false passport .
Crucial video footage showing the assassin entering Politkovskaya 's apartment block went missing .
The video , shot from behind , shows a narrow - shouldered man wearing a baseball cap .
During the three - month trial held at Moscow 's district military court the Makhmudovs ' lawyer produced mobile phone footage of Rustam swimming in a Chechen river .
It revealed he has broad shoulders .
In their final words to the jury on Wednesday , all four defendants insisted they were innocent .
During the chaotic and frequently amateurish trial Politkovskaya 's son Ilya and daughter Vera sat a few feet from the accused , who were locked inside a yellow metal cage .
In a speech to the jury earlier this week , Karina Moskalenko , the lawyer for the Politkovskya family , said the murder had been ordered at a much higher level than the defendants .
" The whole thing has been organised at a high level , not at the level of the accused , " she said .
Novaya Gazeta has carried out its own investigation into Politkovskaya 's violent death at the age of 48 .
It has so far refused to reveal its findings .
The person most widely suspected of involvement in her death is Ramzan Kadyrov , Chechnya 's pro-Moscow president , who is accused of numerous human rights abuses and was a frequent target of Politkovskaya 's criticism .
He has denied any involvement in her death .
Prosecutors vowed to appeal , claiming the judge had committed numerous procedural violations .
The female captain of the 12 - member jury read out the unanimous not guilty verdicts after about two hours of deliberations at a military courthouse on Moscow 's main souvenir shopping street , the Old Arbat .
When the judge repeated that the defendants were acquitted , relatives of the Makhmudov brothers broke into applause and cries of " bravo " .
The judge said the defendants were free to go , and they burst out of a courtroom cage and embraced relatives .
" Thank God , thank the jury , " said Ibragim Makhmudov , still in the courtroom cage shortly after the verdict .
" There was no other possible outcome . "
" We 're glad , " said defence lawyer Murad Musayev .
" This is something that happens rarely in Russia .
This is what I call justice . "
In his final arguments earlier this week , Musayev had accused the prosecution of fabricating evidence and dismissed their case as " dust , fluff and ash " .
Relatives and former colleagues of Politkovskaya said justice would not be served until the gunman and the mastermind were prosecuted .
" The investigators now have to start a proper investigation , " said Karinna Moskalenko , a prominent lawyer who represented Politkovskaya 's family at the trial .
" The more time goes by , the harder it gets . "
Pupils are being asked to put themselves inside the minds of the 7/7 bombers to understand the motives of terrorists .
A government - endorsed teaching pack suggests secondary schools ask pupils to do a presentation on the 7 July London terror attacks from the bombers ' perspective .
The attacks , in 2005 , killed 52 of the capital 's commuters and injured 700 others .
The pack , called Things Do Change , was developed in West Yorkshire , home to three of the 7/7 bombers : Siddique Khan , Shezad Tanweer and Hasib Hussain .
Its author , Sail Suleman , told the Times Educational Supplement that schools should not shy away from asking pupils to think about what turns people into extremists .
She said : " Radicals , extremists and fundamentalists come in all different forms .
Is it right ?
Is it wrong ?
Is it justified ?
Was it pressure from individuals they were hanging out with ?
Hopefully , we 'll encourage pupils to stay away from those individuals . "
The department for children , schools and families ( DCSF ) recommends the pack to teachers as part of its online guidance on how schools can help tackle extremism .
The pack is designed for use by 11 - to 19 - year - olds in their classes on multicultural Britain and emphasises the similarities between communities , rather than their differences .
Among those who have used it are madrassas and mosques in West Yorkshire , schools in Birmingham , Sandwell and Lancashire and police forces in London Thames Valley and Greater Manchester .
But Don Rowe , head of curriculum development at the Citizenship Foundation , said some teachers might find it difficult to ask their pupils to put themselves into the minds of extremists .
He said : " It 's quite a complicated , ambitious question to ask .
I certainly would n't expect anyone who was n't confident in this area to barge in with this sort of material .
" Many form tutors are asked to address some of these issues without proper training .
But you need additional information about different forms of Islam , for example .
Otherwise , there 's a danger that all Muslims will be bunched together . "
The pack also suggests teachers ask pupils to imagine what effect 7/7 might have had on British Muslims , non-Muslim Asians , and the rest of the population .
As a result of the Chernobyl accident , tens of thousands of hectares of forests have experienced massive radioactive contamination , located in the immediate vicinity of the Chernobyl NPP and stretching approximately two kilometers west of the station .
These were mainly single - crop plantings of Scotch pine ( Pinus silvestris ) .
Signs of radioactive mutation of conifers are already evident , having absorbed approximately 100 doses .
It should be noted that the main radiation fallout on the pines resulting from the Chernobyl accident occurred during the revitalization process of plant growth .
In such a period the radiosensitivity of plants increases 1,5 – 3 times as compared to other periods .
The crown of fairly dense pines acts as an effective filter , which helped delay the effects of large quantities of radioactive dust and aerosols in the crowns of these trees .
Pine needles are typically not dropped for 2 - 3 years , causing a slow natural cleaning of crowns as compared with hardwood trees .
This factor increased the radiation effects on coniferous trees compared to other breeds .
The aerial photos of death forest , named us Red forest in summer 1986 .
/ Materials of ISNPP RAS “ Chernobyl in three dimensions ” / .
Results of the radiation effect on pine forests were directly dependent on the amount of received radiation doses .
Considering the nature of the radiation effects , scientists have classified four zones :
The first zone of Red Forest
Zone suffered a complete loss of conifers with partial damage to hardwoods ( the so - called “ Red forest ” ) .
Scholars estimate that the level of absorbed doses of external gamma radiation exposure in 1986 - 1987 was 8000 – 10000 , with the maximum capacity of the external dose was 500 mR /h and more .
This total area of this zone is approximately 400 hectares .
In this zone , the pine tree trunks completely died and pine needles exhibited a brick color .
The entire forest was virtually “ burned down ” – having accumulated a significant amount of radioactive emissions .
Heavy radioactive contamination of the dead trees led to its burial .
On the territory of the “ Red Forest ” , immediate actions were implemented to restore the forests .
At 500 square hectares , the territory ’s forest is already recovering .
The second zone of Red Forest
The zone of sublethal effects in the forests claimed the lives of 25 - 40 % of the trees , and killed most of the forest underbrush ( 1 - 2,5 meters tall ) .
In 90 - 95 % of the trees and severely damaged die of young shoots and buds .
Absorbed dose – 1000 – 8000 capacity exposure dose – 200 – 250 mR / h .
This area of the zone encompassed 12500 hectares , including 3800 hectare of pine forests .
The third zone
The zone of average radiation damage of pine forest .
This zone was affected in the characteristics of mostly young shoots and pine needles turned yellow only on separate sites of branches .
Small morphological deviations in the growth of pines were also noted , but these plants have maintained their viability .
The absorbed dose 400 – 500 and capacity exposure does 50 – 200 mR / h .
The area of the third zone encompassed 43300 hectares , including 11900 hectare of pine forests .
The fourth zone
The zone of weak effects where some growth process anomalies were seen .
Visible damage of the pines has not been found .
All trees have maintained normal growth and needle colour .
Absorbed dose was 50 - 120 capacity exposure dose – 20 mR / h .
Configuration of the zones of forest destruction by radioactive emissions is displayed in the maps below .
Zoning of the stricken forests was completed in 1987 and these areas have changed over time , through the process of natural vegetation recovery ( 1991 ) .
Map of the zoning of the dead forests ( “ Red Forest ” ) , which was created due to the spread of radioactive fallout ( as of spring 1987 ) .
Damaged trees have been observed in violation of the natural rhythm of growth processes , targeting shoots and morphological processes .
Doses of 300 – 400 caused growth in the diameter of birch , spruce and pine trunks to decrease by half .
Together , the affected trees have been observed to have active regenerative processes .
For example , in forming gigantic spruce pine needles up to 4 – 4,5 cm and in the pines – 12 – 14 cm .
From 1989 - 1992 , the amount of needles on young shoots increased by 3 – 3,5 times compared to 1986 .
Germination of seeds has increased .
This fact indicates an increase in reproductive functions among species .
The combination of research results makes it possible to predict the subsequent development of restoration processes .
In the zones of average and sublethal effects , natural rehabilitation ( recovery ) of the forest will occur .
In the place of pine forests will develop mainly deciduous plantings , with a predominance of birch and shrub species of plants .
Gradual turfing of the soil will also occur .
Dead trees were a significant risk of , for example by fire , a secondary source of radioactive contamination .
Moreover , radiation from dead trees significantly deteriorated the situation near the road that was one of the major transportation hubs of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant .
Different methods were suggested for the decontamination of the territory of the Red Forest .
Even before the discussions about decontamination methods ended in 1987 , trenches 2.5 meters in height and approximately 3.5 km in length were dug around the dead trees .
The burial of the dead trees , forest undergrowth and topsoil was accomplished through the use of felling , shovel dumped trees by bulldozers , put it the remains into the trenches and covering them with a one meter thick layer of soil .
In total , more than four thousand cubic meters of radioactive materials were buried .
As a result of these activities , the capacity exposure dose of gamma radiation has decreased in 4 – 50 times , and in the second half of 1987 ( after decontamination works ) , the maximum levels of the dose rate amounted to 180 mR / h .
Aerial view overlooking the burial trenches with radioactive trees – Red Forest ( trenches indicated by arrows ) .
Burial of radioactive trees occurred in deep trenches – 0,5 – 2 meters deep .
This is at the level of local groundwater .
This has led to the contamination of groundwater by the accidental release of radioactive substances .
According to scientists , already 2 – 3 years after burial , the existence of radionuclides was noted in the groundwater near the trenches where dead trees were buried .
Currently , the burial place of the dead forest is a source of radioactive substances in the groundwater , which qualifies as long - term contamination .
Because of the negative environmental impact of such an event , as well as the complexity of its removal ( minimize ) , one can conclude that the burial of the dead trees was not a good plan , but only deepened the environmental problems .

This chart , from " The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan " , a report by two Obama administration advisors , was getting a lot of comment late last week on the financial blogs .
Mostly on whether or not the numbers could be believed .
( Thanks to Calculated Risk for extracting the chart image . )
Frankly , I doubt very much that these numbers can be believed .
This is a sales job by an incoming administration , in a realm where even unbiased prognostications beyond six months have been overwhelmingly wrong .
But let 's assume for the moment that this chart is dead accurate .
Something leapt out at me that seems to have escaped comment elsewhere -- namely , that in four years ' time , the " unstimulated " and " stimulated " forecasts converge .
In 2013 , there would be essentially no difference between " doing nothing " and the lavish stimulus plan .
Which means , the entire ( admitted ! ) purpose of the stimulus plan is to reduce unemployment for the four years of the Obama administration .
Now , at its peak ( late 2010 ) , this plan is forecast to reduce unemployment by 1.8 % ... about 2.2 million jobs , according to the report .
The median full - time wage in the U.S. for hourly workers seems to be about $ 25,000 per year .
So , just to hand all those folks a $ 25,000 paycheck would cost $ 55 billion a year , or $ 220 billion over four years , which is less expensive than the Obama plan .
( And this assumes that we need to create 2.2 million jobs for a full four years , whereas looking at the chart indicates that the Obama plan will create fewer than that for most of the duration . )
Which means , the Obama plan is a particularly wasteful way to get a temporary drop in unemployment .
Now , I do n't mean to belittle the prospect of 2.2 million people having jobs rather than facing unemployment .
Unemployment is brutal , and I would n't wish it on anyone .
But I do mean to belittle the notion that this " stimulus " plan is about solving fundamental problems ... except , perhaps , Obama 's fundamental problem of getting re-elected in 2012 .
The Agile development model has spawned hundreds of books and dozens of conferences .
There 's a significant track record of successful companies moving to Scrum , Extreme Programming ( XP ) , and other lightweight , highly collaborative development models .
Agile can fundamentally change the way software development is done , yet the methods for recruiting and hiring developers has n't changed a bit .
One company has adopted a new approach , and they share their methods here .
" Hire for talents rather than skills , build an environment where skills can be learned and reinforce the culture you are trying to build in the interview process itself .
Too often , our industry hires for exact skill matches . "

Richard Sheridan , with Lisamarie Babik
Most senior programmers and managers grew up in a time when software engineering classes emphasized " complete , consistent , correct " specifications and the ideal developer work environment was a quiet , private office .
It was a time when the way to be most effective as a developer was to be left alone .
The management team at tech problem troubleshooting consultants Menlo Innovations needed to hire several programmers in 2004 .
But traditional interviewing methods , with the traditional résumé and interview process , failed to take into account a developer 's aptitude to work in a highly collaborative workspace .
Instead , Menlo's founders Richard Sheridan and James Goebel decided to implement an " Extreme Interviewing " event , led by Lisamarie Babik , Agile advocate and Menlo 's evangelist .
CIO caught up with Babik and Sheridan right before a presentation of their ideas at XP West Michigan to discuss practical implications of hiring for Agile aptitude , and how to add these skills to an existing enterprise .
CIO : Where did the initial idea for the extreme interview come from ?
Sheridan :
After experimenting with extreme programming for six months in 1999 at Interface Systems , where I was the vice president of development , my boss and CEO Bob Nero asked me to double my team — from 14 to 28 developers — as quickly as possible .
I knew that traditional interviewing practices would n't work .
My concern was that it would be impossible to describe what paired programming in an open and collaborative environment would feel like .
My fear was that we would successfully hire 14 more people who would quickly learn to hate the new environment .
I had to find a different way .
Babik :
We used it for the first time at Menlo in April 2004 .
We were sitting around talking about how we needed to hire some folks for a new project we were starting .
Rich offhandedly said , " You know , what we need is an Extreme Interview . "
I had heard Rich talk about it in passing , but did n't really know the nitty - gritty details .
I was about to find out .
CIO : What does the interview entail ?
How is it different than a traditional interview ?
Babik :
The interview is more of an audition than a traditional interview .
Participants are called together in a large group ; each is paired with another participant who is interviewing for the same position and an observer who is a current Menlo team member .
During the course of the interview , candidates are paired with three partners and assigned three problem - solving tasks .
What they are told , however , is that we are not particularly interested in the outcome of the problem solving .
Rather , what we 're looking for is good " kindergarten skills . "
In particular we want participants to " make their partner look good . "
CIO : " Make your partner look good ? "
Can you clarify what you mean by that ?
Sheridan :
We are looking for evidence that you 're going to help out your partner .
So our instructions include hints like , " If your partner is looking for an answer that you know , give it to them .
If they get stuck , help them out of their rut . "
Why ?
Because this is the way we work every day at Menlo Innovations .
We want to begin the training in our process at the moment of first contact , the day of the interview .
CIO : What kind of results do you see from this process ?
Sheridan :
Out of the 40 - 50 people we bring in for the Extreme Interview , we usually invite back 16 - 20 people for a second interview based upon their collaboration or kindergarten skills .
As a result , the 8 - 10 who make the final cut have already demonstrated their ability to team with others .
Babik :
At first , we only used this process for programmers , but we found the process could be used for other roles , such as project managers and high - tech anthropologists .
When we did n't use this process , we found that new team members struggled to fit in .
It 's almost like Extreme Interviewing has become a rite of passage to join the team .
CIO : Now , long after the initial hiring spree : how has your staff retention been ?
How do these employees differ from those hired using traditional methods ?
Sheridan :
We have what I call a " negative attrition rate . "
We do lose people over time for a number of reasons .
However , many end up coming back and we welcome them .
We find they are actually even more dedicated the second time around .
Babik :
There are also those that make it through the initial process and still wash out in the long term .
It 's just a fact that no interview process is perfect .
We acknowledge that we might miss some good candidates with this process .
CIO : If you had to do it all over again , what would you do differently ?
Sheridan :
We have used this process two or three times per year since 2004 .
We continue to refine it , experiment with new ideas , etc .
But the basic process has remained the same since we first initiated it in 1999 .
Babik : I 've asked myself that question many times when using a " traditional " hiring method , after I was burned by someone who wrote an excellent résumé , but lacked the skills — soft or technical — to back it up .
As for extreme interviewing , we 're always trying new things to improve our results .
Most recently , our changes have been to the evaluation process based on some things we read in The Experience Economy by James H. Gilmore .
CIO : Put yourself in the shoes of a technology executive for a mid-size company considering an Agile transition .
What advice would you give for how to change hiring ?
Sheridan :
My advice is to hire for talents rather than skills , build an environment where skills can be learned and reinforce the culture you are trying to build in the interview process itself .
Too often , our industry hires for exact skill matches .
I often counsel new college graduates to avoid these kinds of employers , as the message is clear : " We are unwilling to invest in you . "
Babik : Absolutely .
Do n't focus on what they already know .
Focus instead on whether or not they exhibit a life - long love of learning .
Are they eager to learn new things ?
Are they excited ?
In today 's fast - paced society , the ability to adapt to change is paramount for success .
CIO : Our readers would probably agree that collaboration is key to any software endeavor , regardless of methodology .
If you could give one idea to a technology executive — just one tweak to the hiring process to hire for collaboration — what would it be ?
Sheridan :
The traditional interviewing process is two people pleasantly lying to one another for an hour or two and then making a really big decision that they will live with for years to come .
Harkening back to Thomas Edison 's interview process :
Try as hard as you can to simulate the work environment in the interview process .
Babik : I 'd have to say , " Align your inside perception with your outside reality . "
Be upfront and honest about who you are and about the environment for which you 're hiring .
If you 're reluctant to share some aspect of the culture or people , it might be a sign that you need to re-examine corporate priorities and the environment you created for your team .
CIO : Where can our readers go to learn more ?
Babik :
We conduct tours of our workspace almost every day .
All people need to do is e-mail or call and we 'll arrange a time .
Sheridan : Heck , they can just walk in the door .
Babik :
And often do !
There is also a white paper under the " Free Stuff " tab on our website that describes our extreme interviewing process in more detail .

Prince Harry has been forced to apologise for his behaviour in the past Prince Harry has apologised for using offensive language to describe a Pakistani member of his army platoon .
The News of the World has published a video diary in which the prince calls one of his then Sandhurst colleagues a " Paki " in his commentary .
St James 's Palace said he had used the term three years ago as a nickname about a friend and without any malice .
The prince filmed parts of the video and in another clip , he is heard calling another cadet a " raghead " .
The prince had to apologise in 2005 for wearing a swastika armband to a party , which offended many Jewish people .
Bullying and racism are not endemic in the Armed Forces

Profile : Prince Harry Reaction to prince 's racist term
The video obtained by the News of the World shows Harry while still an officer cadet at Sandhurst military academy .
It was filmed in front of other cadets at an airport departure lounge as they waited for a flight to Cyprus to go on manoeuvres .
The newspaper said the prince , who is third in line to the Throne , had called the soldier " our little Paki friend " .
' Extremely sorry '
Meanwhile , during a faked call to the Queen , as the Commander in Chief of the British Army , the prince says : " Granny I 've got to go , send my love to the Corgis and Grandpa . "
He finishes saying : " I 've got to go , got to go , bye .
God Save You ... yeah , that 's great . "

" There is no question that Prince Harry was in any way seeking to insult his friend . "
The statement continued : " Prince Harry used the term ' raghead ' to mean Taleban or Iraqi insurgent . "
A man told BBC Radio Five Live the cadet concerned was his nephew , Ahmed Raza Khan , from Pakistan , who served with Prince Harry at Sandhurst for one year as a Commonwealth cadet .
Iftikhar Raja said his nephew , now a captain in the Pakistani army , would have risen above such terms and had not mentioned the incident to his family .
Mr Raja said : " At no time he told us that he was called Paki or he was a good friend of Prince Harry , I mean , although they served together that is true .

" But I myself am a British subject , I am proud to be British and if someone called me Pakistani I would be proud to be called that , but Paki is definitely a derogatory remark . "
He added : " We expect better from our Royal Family on whom we spend millions and millions of pounds for training and schooling . "
Captain Ahmed Raza Khan graduated with Harry from Sandhurst in 2006 receiving a special award from the Queen for being the best overseas officer cadet .
' Disturbing allegations ' BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph said this was an extremely embarrassing episode for the prince and the Royal Family .
She said the emergence of the three - year - old video was " unfortunate timing " for Harry , whose image had greatly improved since he served in Afghanistan last year .
" That was a real step up for him , a real sense of maturity that people could see , " she said .
She added that as a member of the Royal Family , Prince Harry was held to a certain standard , and everything he said and did was scrutinised " regardless of whether it was banter among colleagues or something that was being used by lots of other people he was working with " .
The Army has been trying to recruit soldiers from ethnic minority backgrounds as these are currently under - represented in the services .
A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said : " Neither the Army nor the Armed Forces tolerates inappropriate behaviour in any shape or form .
" The Army takes all allegations of inappropriate behaviour very seriously and all substantive allegations are investigated .
" We are not aware of any complaint having been made by the individual .
Bullying and racism are not endemic in the Armed Forces . "
A spokeswoman for the Equality and Human Rights Commission said : " These appear to be disturbing allegations and we will be asking the MoD to see the evidence , share that evidence with us and their plans for dealing with it .
" We will then consider what further action might be necessary . "

Das Berliner Kammergericht hat die Revision des Rechtsanwalt Günter Freiherr von Gravenreuth gegen ein Urteil des Landgerichts Berlin verworfen .
Die niedere Instanz hatte Gravenreuth im September vergangenen Jahres wegen versuchten Betrugs zu 14 Monaten Haft ohne Bewährung verurteilt .
Das Kammergericht verwarf die Revision nun mit der verschärfenden Maßgabe , dass sich Gravenreuth sogar des vollendeten Betrugs schuldig gemacht habe .
Mit der Entscheidung vom 2 .
Februar sei das Urteil rechtskräftig , berichtet die taz , Gravenreuth müsse seine Haftstrafe nun antreten .
Die Entscheidung des Kammergerichts dokumentiert auch Johannes Eisenberg , Anwalt der taz , auf seiner Website .
Das Landgericht Berlin hatte zuvor als erwiesen erachtet , dass sich Gravenreuth in einer zivilrechtlichen Auseinandersetzung mit der Berliner Tageszeitung taz des versuchten Betrugs schuldig gemacht hat , und den wegen seiner Abmahnungen bekannt gewordenen Juristen zu einer Haftstrafe verurteilt .
Nach Überzeugung des Gerichts hatte Gravenreuth in einem Disput mit der Zeitung , in dem es um ausstehende Zahlungen ging , die Domain taz .de pfänden lassen , obwohl er bereits Kenntnis von der Begleichung seiner Forderung hatte .
Zunächst war der Anwalt vom Amtsgericht Tiergarten zu einer Haftstrafe von sechs Monaten verurteilt worden .
Im Berufungsverfahren vor dem Landgericht Berlin war eine Bewährungstrafe aus einem anderen Verfahren in die Strafzumessung eingeflossen .
In diesem Verfahren vor dem Landgericht München 1 war Gravenreuth wegen der Veruntreuung von Mandantengeldern zu 11 Monaten auf Bewährung verurteilt worden .
Wann von Gravenreuth seine Haftstrafe antreten muss , ist bisher noch nicht bekannt .

The Government has been accused of creating a new poverty trap with recent changes to the tax credit and benefit system which risk penalising almost two million low earners trying to boost their income .
Thousands of the lowest - paid workers handed a pay increase or choosing to work more hours will be taxed as much as 90 per cent on their additional income because of losses in benefits and tax credits , according to analysis of figures in the pre-Budget report .
A total of 60,000 households receiving income - related benefits or tax credits will face handing 90 p of every extra pound they earn to the Treasury next year , twice this year 's total .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Those earning just above the minimum wage and receiving housing benefit are thought to be at the greatest risk of suffering from a very high " marginal tax rate " , as small increases in the amount they earn could result in the loss of the benefit .
Single mothers returning to work are also thought to be among those hit .
Currently , anyone working more than 16 hours a week loses their right to benefits .
Opposition parties argue that this prevents women from working additional hours .
The number of low - income households with a marginal tax rate of more than 60 per cent will grow by 85,000 to more than 1.9 million next year .
The Conservatives said that the high marginal tax rates risked becoming a disincentive for the low - paid to rise up the employment ladder .
Chris Grayling , the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary , said that he had met a low - income worker last week who had turned down a pay rise because of the consequences it would have on his tax credits and benefits .
" Once again Gordon Brown has let down hard - working , low - income families .
It 's simply not good enough that some of the poorest families face tax rates of over 90 per cent , " he said .
" This is yet another tax con trick buried in the pre-Budget report . "
Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrats '
Treasury spokesman , said that the Government would have to reassess its tax credits system to ease the problem .
" The combination of income tax and national insurance , combined with the tax credit system , creates a serious disincentive to low - paid workers and makes it in effective prohibitive for some groups like single mothers to go out to work at all , " he said .
The Treasury said that there was " little evidence " that changes to the tax credit system had led to workers choosing to work fewer hours .

Sinn Féin solidarity with Gaza
Socialist Unity -- January 12 , 2009 -- Sinn Féin's Northern Ireland Assembly team held an event this today at 11.30 am on the steps of Stormont , Belfast , to highlight the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza .
This was supported by Ireland–Palestine Solidarity Campaign .
Speaking ahead of the event Sinn Féin Chief Whip and North Belfast MLA Carál Ní Chuilín said that this was a ``simple '' expression of solidarity with the beleaguered people of Gaza .
Ms Ní Chuilín said , “ Monday ’s event will bring together the Sinn Fein Assembly Team as well as other groups and organisations , to highlight , in a small way , our solidarity with the people of Gaza .
“ Sinn Féin is calling for an immediate end to attacks on all civilians ; we are calling for a ceasefire and for urgent aid to be allowed into Gaza .
“ What is going on is an international humanitarian crisis and we hope that this further , all be it a simple expression of our solidarity and our hope to see the horrific events over , will add to the countless international calls for inclusive negotiations . ”
Sinn Féin have also submitted a motion to the Northern Irleand Assembly on the Gaza crisis .
Sinn Fein Assembly Group Leader John O’Dowd MLA highlights the main point of the motion that ‘ this Assembly condemns the appalling loss of life in Gaza and calls on those responsible for all attacks on civilians to cease . ’
Speaking after the motion was submitted Mr O’Dowd said ,
“ Obviously the attention of the world is focused on the situation in Gaza .
Numerous Sinn Féin leaders have highlighted our position over the past few days and called for an immediate ceasefire in the area .
We hope that this motion will be a further expression of our concern and assist the world wide calls for an immediate ceasefire and end to hostilities . ”
The full text of the Sinn Féin motion reads as follows :
`` This Assembly condemns the appalling loss of life in Gaza and calls on those responsible for all attacks on civilians to cease .
The loss of life and scale of injuries among the civilian population is totally unacceptable .
There is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza .
Humanitarian aid organisations must have the freedom of movement to deliver their aid unhindered to the people of Gaza .
This Assembly calls for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza .
This Assembly further calls on the international community to mobilise to secure these objectives .
Socialist Resistance ( Britain ) : ` Break links with apartheid Israel !'
Zionist Israel slaughters over 760 Palestinians
Unions must build direct solidarity
A statement by Socialist Resistance ’s steering committee
January 8 , 2009 -- Since Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza , the Zionist rulers have maintained it as an open air prison and most of the time as a shooting gallery .
Now they have made it an extermination camp .
The premeditated slaughter of more than 760 Palestinians , one - third children , with more than 3500 wounded has horrified the world and especially the Arab masses , who sympathise with the Palestinians .
The Palestinian people have been relegated to the status of vermin in their own land by the Zionist colonisers and their US imperialist backers .
In the Zionist treatment of the Palestinians the Arab masses recognise the contempt that the imperialists have for them , and the sight of it rubs salt in their wounds .
They have suffered this bitterness and have harboured a justifiable hatred for their oppressors for decades without finding an effective outlet .
Today their outrage can only become deeper ; in time it will eventually overwhelm the neo-colonialist rulers of their own countries , who connive with the Zionists and the imperialists .
The Zionist colonisation aims to condemn the Palestinians to hopelessness , which mirrors the hopelessness of all the Arab and Muslim peoples and all Third World peoples suffering under the economic dominance and exploitation of the imperialists .
Egypt , by far the largest Arab state , in particular seethes with such frustration , both because of the collaboration of its brutal dictatorial rulers with imperialism and the failure of the promises that the road out of poverty would be opened by cooperation with world capitalism ’s economic overlords in the so - called Infitah ( open door policy ) , which paralleled the peace with Israel .
The Camp David Accords with Israel were a political capitulation , the Infitah , which opened up Egypt to imperialist economic exploitation , was a corresponding economic capitulation .
Egypt , the only Arab state to border on Gaza , is openly collaborating with the ongoing Zionist massacre .
The international press reported that Egyptian border guards are firing on Palestinians trying to flee from Gaza .
That is a violation of a fundamental human right , the right of flight , the right of refugees to international protection .
Paradoxically , the Zionists ’ real objective is to drive out the Palestinians , but they want to crush them first .
Palestinians will fight to stay in their country , to hold onto to their land , to resist the Zionist colonisers .
But some may want to flee to save their lives or the lives of their children .
If they want to , they have that right , and it is protected by international law and humane tradition .
It is an outrage that Israel and Egypt are denying them this basic human right .
Egypt could also end the Zionist economic siege of Gaza .
It need only open the border .
Palestinian forces were able to force their way through at one point and keep the border open for a few days .
But Egypt closed it again and reinforced it .
That is another outrage .
It goes beyond capitulation to Zionism ; it is active collaboration with it .
Even the capitalist press has pointed out that the Israeli present campaign is the greatest slaughter of Palestinians since the 1982 massacre in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps by Lebanese fascists with the open complicity of the Israeli army .
That is the measure of the challenge today .
Can world public opinion allow such a massacre to go on in the full view of the world ’s peoples ?
If it does , that will be a grave setback for the advance of civilisation in general .
The provocations of Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups are no excuse for indifference .
Acts of resistance can be expected from any human beings subjected to intolerable conditions .
Similar acts can be seen every day , everywhere around the world , but the imprisonment of the Palestinians is far worse .
Their acts of resistance should arouse sympathy and not censure .
Humanity is one .
If one section of humanity is subjected to torture , all of humanity suffers , all humanity is endangered .
It is time for all people of good will and reasonable sense to rise to the defence of the suffering people of Gaza .
They can force their governments to pressure Israel to end its siege of Gaza .
Israeli is and has always been a racist Zionist colonial settler state .
It was established in 1948 with imperialist agreement by the physical removal of the Palestinian people from their historic Palestine .
Shortly after the original “ partition ” which divided Palestine in roughly two parts , the imperialist - armed Zionist army organized a war to destroy hundreds of Palestinian towns and villages in order to occupy additional portions of Palestinian .
What remains of Palestine today is less than 20 percent of the original homeland to millions , the majority of whom today live in exile and constitute the largest refugee population in the world .
Socialist Resistance , like the vast majority of British socialists , has never recognised the legitimacy of the Zionist State of Israel , just as we reject extending any legitimacy to the conquest and occupation of any nation by imperialist colonisers anywhere in the world , past and present .
We support Palestinian self - determination .
A democratic secular state should re-constituted on the original Palestine lands , with equal rights for all , and with the right of all Palestinians to return .
We call for the dismantlement of the Zionist structure of the state of Israel , which is a form of institutionalised discrimination analogous to Apartheid in South Africa .
We simultaneously support struggles for a socialist federation of the Middle East and for a socialist Palestine , where all inhabitants , irrespective of religious or ethnic origin , can live at peace in an egalitarian society free from capitalist profit and exploitation .
We demand that the Labour government :
Immediately ends all economic , political , intelligence and logistical aid to Israel .
Immediately embargos arms sales to , and from , Israel , including components via a third party .
Severs all relations with Israel , including the withdrawal of ambassadors .
Withdraws forthwith the charitable status of Zionist fund - raising bodies in Britain .
Confiscates Israeli government funds invested in the UK , and enable their use for the reconstruction of Palestine .
Uses its seat on the UN Security Council to initiate a UN Security Council - sanctioned resolution against Israel .
Supports the efforts to arrest Israeli political and military leaders and to bring them to trial for war crimes .
We call on the labour movement to show its solidarity with the people of Palestine by :
Supporting the call from Palestinian trade unions and other bodies for a comprehensive campaign of Boycotts , Disinvestment and Sanctions against Israel .
Establishing direct links of solidarity with Palestinian communities , including through the growing twinning movement .
Arming the people of Gaza .
Supporting the Israeli opposition to this oppression , including the scores of young Israelis imprisoned for refusing to take part in the army of occupation .
Freedom for Palestine !
Cease - fire in Sri Lanka !
By the Communist Party of India ( Marxist Leninist ) Liberation
Belying the fond hopes of all those who greeted each other for a ``peaceful ’’ and ``terror - free ’’ 2009 , the New Year has begun on a particularly aggressive note of war and destruction .
Armed Israeli forces have mounted an all - out assault on Gaza , killing and maiming hundreds of Palestinians through air strikes , a ground offensive as well as sea - borne attacks .
Nearer home , the Sri Lankan Army claims to be advancing towards Mulaitivu , after having already captured the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) stronghold of Kilinochi .
The LTTE claims to have killed more than 50 members of the Sri Lankan armed forces in retaliatory resistance and counter - operations , both around Mulaitivu and in the capital Colombo .
Both these campaigns seem to have been timed deliberately at this particular juncture .
Busy with the post-election change of guard in the US , neither Bush nor Obama will have to face the heat on account of these wars , and the European Union and all other major players in international relations are preoccupied with the global financial meltdown and economic recession .
Israel ’s attack on Gaza clearly enjoys the fullest backing of the US which sees Israeli aggression merely as a ``reply ’’ to acts of military ``provocation ’’ by the Hamas .
The Sri Lankan military offensive may not enjoy that sort of explicit endorsement by the US and its allies , but Sri Lanka is out to seek international legitimacy for its action by projecting the whole thing as a crucial victory over “ savage terrorism ” .
The history of Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories in Gaza and the West Bank goes back to four decades .
Notwithstanding periodic changes of guard in both Israel and the US , the two establishments have always had the closest strategic partnership .
Every military assault by Israel on Palestinian / Arab territory or people has enjoyed the protective political umbrella of the US , and since 2001 the partnership has been reinforced by the US - led global ``war on terror ’’ .
While the US has gone on to invade and occupy countries like Afghanistan and Iraq , Israel has specialised in targeting the backbone of Arab resistance , Hamas in Palestine , and Hezbollah in Lebanon .
But just as the US has got stuck in Afghanistan and Iraq , two years ago Israel too had to suffer a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Hezbollah in Lebanon .
Regrettably enough , the US - Israel axis has been emboldened not only by the silence of much of the Western world and big Asian countries like China and India , but also by the complicity and acquiescence on the part of sections of Arab rulers .
Egypt and Jordan have already been pushed into so - called peace treaties with Israel , and they now look away , if not play willing accomplices , as the US - Israel axis targets the Palestinians , Lebanese and Syrians .
In spite of such a division within the Arab ruling establishment , the Hezbollah had successfully withstood and defeated Israeli aggression two years ago , thanks to overwhelming popular support within the Arab world .
This time too , Hamas and Hezbollah have both called for organising mass protests and resistance across the Arab world and Israel may once again have to pay a heavy price for its military misadventure in Gaza .
Reports of communist - led protests are also coming in from within Israel .
India has traditionally opposed the Israeli occupation of Palestine and since the disastrous International Peacekeeping Force experience in the late 1980s , officially India has favoured a political , and not military , solution of the Sri Lankan Tamil question .
But over the last ten years as Indian foreign policy has started revolving increasingly around the US - Israel strategic axis , India too now effectively endorses the aggressive military strategy pursued by Israel and Sri Lanka .
Meanwhile , the FBI has virtually taken over the ``Indian ’’ probe into Mumbai terror attack and , through the newly set up NIA , the US now has an ever tighter grip on various aspects of India ’s domestic security as well .
The Indian people must therefore come out ever more vociferously against the Israeli attack on Gaza and also for an immediate cease - fire in Sri Lanka .
The more India endorses the marauding military expeditions of the US - Israel axis , the more India weakens her own battle against terrorism .
A free Palestine remains the most crucial unfinished agenda of the contemporary global battle for peace , justice and democracy and the Indian people must throw their entire weight behind the just forces of Palestinian resistance and for a dignified political resolution of the Sri Lankan Tamil question .

SACP condemns `genocidal aggression ' by Israel in Gaza
Statement by the South African Communist Party
January 6 , 2009 -- The South African Communist Party joins millions across the globe , including tens of thousands of Israeli peace activists , in expressing outrage at the genocidal aggression of the Israeli security apparatus against the people of Gaza .
This aggression is both futile and absolutely disproportionate to the alleged objective of halting rocket fire from Gaza , an enclave that has been suffering a bitter and illegal siege for months .
The real and entirely cynical objectives of the current military offensive include the boosting of the popularity of Israeli politicians ahead of February elections , and punishing Palestinians for supporting a political party of their choice in democratic elections .
In overall strategic terms , " Operation Cast Lead " is part of a broader Zionist agenda that includes the Zionist apartheid wall and the daily harassment of Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza .
In the words of Israeli peace activist , Ur Shlonsky , the objective is to " terrorise the civilian population , assuring maximal destruction of property and cultural resources ...
The daily life of the Palestinians must be rendered unbearable :
They should be locked up in cities and towns , prevented from exercising normal economic life , cut off from workplaces , schools and hospitals , This will encourage emigration and weaken the resistance to future expulsions " .
The hundreds of Palestinian civilian casualities of the last few days of intensified aggression ( like the tens of thousands who have been killed in the last years ) , are not " collateral " victims , they are the targets .
It is also in this light that the 2004 relocation Jewish settlements in Gaza should be understood .
The relocation was presented as part of Washington 's " road map to peace " and a " victory " for Palestinians .
In fact , it was exactly the opposite .
The presence of Jewish settlers within Gaza was an impediment to turning the territory into a concentration camp that could be indiscriminately bombarded .
The SACP further condemns the criminal complicity of the US administration , the major backer and arms supplier to the Zionist state , and the hypocrisy of all major western governments .
Stop mass murder in Gaza !
Hands off Gaza !
Free Palestine !
Statement by the Socialist Party of Malaysia in solidarity with the people of Palestine
January 6 , 2009
1. The Socialist Party of Malaysia ( PSM ) condemns Israel for its latest massive assault on the Palestinian people .
2. Israel began its latest round of barbaric assaults on December 27 , 2008 , by launching air strikes followed by land offensives , which aimed to destroy every aspect of civilised life in Gaza .
The death toll in Gaza has reached over 500 , while thousands have been wounded in the barbaric attacks of the Israeli armed forces .
3 . The latest massacre has been carefully planned by the Zionist regime of Israel , attempting to destroy Hamas , the organisation that leads the struggle of the Palestinian people against its oppression .
Hamas won the Palestinian election in January 2006 .
The recent assault is not a response to Hamas ' rocket attacks as Israel claims , but rather a pre-planned ethnic cleansing to purge Arab Palestinians , and overthrow a democratically elected Hamas administration , with backing from imperialist powers like the United States .
4 . This is not the first time the Zionist apartheid regime of Israel has committed an act of genocide , but this time it has been far more ruthless than before .
5. Israel 's economic blockade of Gaza since June 2007 has cut off supplies of the most basic needs , such as food , water and medicine .
The continuous blockade has turned Gaza Strip into the largest concentration camp in the world with a 1.5 million starving population imprisoned within its border .
6. Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire with Israel in June 2008 to try to bring humanitarian relief to the population of Gaza .
But Israel 's refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza , along with its continued attacks on Palestinians , have hampered the process .
7. Israel 's new round of slaughter of the Palestinian people has deepened the humanitarian crisis in Gaza Strip .
8. Fewer than 20 Israelis have been killed by Qassam rockets fired from Gaza since 2001 .
Nearly 500 people in Gaza have been killed by Israeli state violence in just a week , and the death toll is expected to increase as the Israeli offensive continues .
Palestinians have chosen to resist with largely home - made rockets , their occupiers who practise apartheid , while the Israeli Zionist state , well equipped with imperialist [ - supplied ] killing machines , has responded by collectively punishing the impoverished population of Gaza .
Collective punishment is a war crime under the Fourth Geneva Convention ( GCIV ) , which Israel has become part of 60 years ago upon its formation .
9 . Besides the Zionist Israeli state -– a racist state founded on the mass expulsion of the Palestinians , its imperialist ally –- the US and other Western imperialist powers , are equally responsible for the ongoing slaughter of the Palestinian people .
The US government has supplied Israel with the world 's most modern weapons including F - 16 fighter jets , Apache attack helicopters , missiles and bombs which have been used by the Israeli armed forces during the attacks on the people in Gaza .
The US government has planned to provide Israel with an average US $ 3 billion a year in military aid for the next decade .
10 . US support for Israel is part of the imperialist desire to dominate the Middle East region .
In the midst of defeats of the US in both Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as its failure to contain Iran , US under the outgoing Bush administration has chosen to back Israel .
The recent assault on Gaza would show both Israel and US still possessing the power to bully weaker governments in the region and to warn disobedient governments like Iran and Syria .
11 . The question is why does the US president - elect Barack Obama , who will be inaugurated on January 20 , 2009 , seem to be keeping a low profile on the recent slaughter in Gaza .
Will the Obama administration make a difference in the Middle East by breaking away from the US imperialist strategy embraced by previous presidents ?
12 . The PSM extends its solidarity to the people of Palestine in their struggle against Israel 's apartheid regime and imperialism .
13 .
The PSM demands the following :
i . Israel must immediately end the siege of Gaza , stop its aggression and pull out all its troops from territories of the Palestinian Authority ii .
The US must stop all its military aid to Israel and impose an arms embargo against Israel iii .
The US needs to end its " War on Terror " by immediately withdrawing its military from Iraq and Afghanistan .
14 .
The people of Palestine have the rights to determine their future through democratic process from below .
15 .
The resistance of the ordinary people of Palestine against the Zionist regime of Israel is a resistance against the barbaric system of global capitalism and a struggle against imperialism .
The struggle of the Palestinian people is our struggle .
16 . A lasting peace in the Middle East will only prevail if justice is upheld for the Palestinian people and imperialism is defeated .
It is only a global mass movement of ordinary people from below that can defeat imperialism .
Down with racism and imperialism !
Hands off Gaza !
Long live resistance !

Residents ' Action Movement , New Zealand : Stop the killing in Gaza !
Below is the text of a RAM leaflet ( http://www.ram.org.nz/) produced for a Wellington protest on January 6 against Israel 's attacks on Gaza :
`` It ’s horrible , but what can we do about it ? ”
That ’s the reaction of people everywhere to the pictures of dead Palestinian children and the pleas of the doctors in Gaza .
Israel ’s military might can seem unstoppable .
But the ongoing attacks are only possible because of the diplomatic , financial and military support they receive from the US state , its allies and friends .
Around the world , people are taking action to end their government ’s acceptance of the Israel attacks .
We can :
Protest
Protests have the power to keep the plight of innocent victims in the public eye .
They can help people at home , feeling sickened by the TV news , to feel they are n’t alone .
It ’s hard for a lone individual not to shrug their shoulders and look the other way .
It ’s natural for people to come together at times like these to say they want it to stop .
Protests can keep hope alive .
Tell our government to take a stand
National ’s foreign minister , Murray McCully , has said almost nothing about the biggest international crisis of the day .
He did declare that the NZ government “ wo n’t take sides ” .
This is a continuation of what Labour called its “ even handed approach ” .
But if a boy poked out his tongue at another in the school playground , and the second clubbed him back with a baseball bat , is it good enough to “ not take sides ” ?
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for an immediate ceasefire .
Venezuela ’s campaigning president , Hugo Chavez , condemned the Israeli attacks as “ criminal ” and called for a “ massive campaign of repudiation ” .
Our government should do similar .
Boycott Israel
In the 1980s , Black South Africans asked the world to impose an academic , sporting , political and economic boycott of their country .
This added to the pressure which eventually ended South Africa ’s racist apartheid system .
Today , Palestinians are calling for a boycott of Israel .
We can support it by refusing to buy Israeli products and by writing to the shops that sell them .
Food brands include Beigel Beigel and Silan ( sold by Pak ’N’ Save ) .
Children ’s toys ( including Happy House ) are sold by Bunnings Warehouse and Edukids .
DIY hardware includes Chromagen hot water systems and Keter plastics ( manufacturer of some Black & Decker toolboxes , sawhorses etc , stocked by Placemakers and Mitre10 ) .
And we must put pressure on the NZ company Rakon , which supplies components for Israeli guided bombs , to stop .

We are all Palestinians !
Stop Israel ’s genocidal war and occupation of the Gaza and Palestine !
January 4 , 2008 -- The Partido Lakas ng Masa , Philippines , adds its voice to the international outrage and condemnation of the Israeli assault and now the ground assault of Israeli troops against a defenceless Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and stands as one with Hamas , the legitimate government of the Palestinian people in Gaza .
In opposition to the brutal Israeli attack on Gaza we say : “ We Are All Palestinians ! ”
At the same time we also draw attention to and condemn the backing of US imperialism for the Israeli state and US support for the current Israeli occupation and bombardment of Gaza .
Without the support of world imperialism , and especially the support of the US , Israel cannot get away with such genocidal actions against the Palestinian population and continue to survive .
We condemn the US and the Bush Administration support , as well as the US Congress vote in support of Israel ‘s most recent assault and occupation of Gaza .
In the same breadth we oppose any suggestion that Hamas is in any way equally responsible for the events unfolding .
Hamas is a legitimate liberation movement struggling against the Israeli occupier and aggressor .
Any condemnation and demands to end the war must be directed at Israel .
The ``blame '' lies with the brutal Israeli occupation and aggression and not with the liberation movement fighting to free the Palestinian people .
We demand :
Israeli troops out of Gaza !
Israel immediately halts the bombardment of Gaza !
An immediate arms embargo against Israel !
We call on the Philippines government to immediately freeze all diplomatic relations with Israel !
We also support calls for an international boycott of Israeli products and sanctions against Israeli investments .
For example , we support the international campaign against Motorola and its fully owned subsidiary Motorola Israel , to end its production and sales of all communications devices to the Israeli military , including all radar detection devices .
Ultimately , we stand by our principled support for a free , democratic and secular Palestine .
President Hugo Chávez urges Israel to stop invasion of Gaza Strip
January 5 , 2009 -- Bolivarian News Agency --
The President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela Hugo Chávez urged Israel " to stop the invasion of the Gaza Strip and the murder of thousand innocent people . "
The Bolivarian leader denounced the government of Israel and described it as murderous and genocidal .
" It is sad that Israel continues acting as the killing arm of the yankee empire . "
Likewise , he pointed out that the Latin American and European countries , as well as the United Nations Organization , should stand up and declare against this attack on the Gaza Strip .
As an action of solidarity with the Palestinian people , the Venezuelan president will undertake humanitarian actions to supply Palestine with medicines and food " in spite of some opposition leaders who continue attacking me and saying that I am giving away the money Venezuela needs to face the world economic crisis . "
" The yankee empire has no mercy and the evidence is what they are supporting in Gaza , where a real slaughter , bombardments every 15 minutes and a ground invasion are taking place ; this is all supported by the current government of the United States " , said President Chávez .
" Nobody knows what their plans are to expand the war in the Middle East and other parts of the world .
That 's the reason why we will undertake humanitarian actions with the Palestinian people ; no matter what the opposition says " , stressed the Venezuelan leader .

Socialist Alliance , Australia : End ties with the racist Israeli state !
December 29 , 2008
Socialist Alliance statement ( available in Arabic at http://links.org.au/node/826)
Israel ’s killing must stop !
Stand up for the people of Gaza !
End ties with the racist Israeli state !
The Socialist Alliance condemns the Israeli massacre in the Gaza strip , which has left at least 280 people dead and 800 more injured .
We call on the Rudd government to also condemn this slaughter and to break Australian economic , diplomatic , military and cultural ties with the Israeli apartheid state .
While Israel claimed that it targeted “ terrorists ” , the 100 bombs were mostly aimed at police stations in the middle of densely populated civilian areas .
The attack , which was carefully planned at least several days in advance , also took place at the same time as children were going home from school , leaving many dead or injured .
The massacre comes on the back of two years of blockade imposed by Israel in an attempt to topple the democratically elected Hamas government .
Many Gazans have already died due to lack of basic medical treatment , food , clean water and electricity .
The killing looks set to continue with large numbers of Israeli armored vehicles massing on the border of Gaza .
Israel has called up 6500 reservists and has announced that it will call up more over the next few days .
If the massacres are to stop international public opinion needs to let Israel know that its actions are unacceptable .
In particular , Israel ’s traditional supporters , who have clearly sanctioned this bloody operation , must be forced to withdraw their support .
The Australian people need to stand up for the people of Gaza by making the Rudd government end its support for Israel 's ethnic cleansing of Palestine .
Socialist Alliance urges its members and supporters to join all emergency protests that are being organised around the country against this latest crime of the Israeli state .

Gaza massacre : A message from George Galloway MP , Respect ( Britain )
" The barbaric Israeli assault on Gaza will go down in infamy alongside Deir Yasin and Sabra and Shatilla as one of the defining events of the Palestinian tragedy and resistance .
" The atrocities are continuing -– so too must the world - wide protests .
We in Britain have a particular responsibility .
Our government , alongside George W Bush , has sickeningly placed the blame on the Palestinians for their suffering in Gaza .
" Our government arms the quisling Arab regimes whose cowardice and greed are as necessary to Israel 's murder as its US supplied weapons .
" Historically , it was a British foreign minister who authored the Palestinian tragedy when he signed their country away to the Zionist movement .
" Respect helped organise the militant demonstration on December 28 in London outside the Israeli embassy within 24 hours of the first air raids on Gaza .
We stand in solidarity with the protests called by diverse groups across Britain .
" Every single MP should be put under pressure to speak out clearly against Israel 's aggression .
Those who do not will have the blood of innocent Palestinians on their hands .
" Let 's unify our efforts .
Stop the Slaughter in Gaza .
Hold the British government to account .
Freedom for Palestine . "
COSATU condemns Israeli assault on Gaza
The Congress of South African Trade Unions vehemently condemns today 's murderous Israeli attack on the people of Palestine , when Israeli warplanes and combat helicopters killed at least 155 people and wounded around 200 more in Gaza .
It is reported that in Gaza City the dead and wounded lay scattered on the ground after more than 30 airstrikes destroyed several security compounds , including two where Hamas was hosting graduation ceremonies for new recruits .
Today 's death toll is even worse than on the five - day Israeli offensive in March , which killed more than 120 people .
It is the highest loss of life in a single day in more than 20 years .
And yet the Israeli government says that today 's attack is " just the beginning " of their offensive against the people of Gaza !
Among the dead , according to medical workers ' reports , are police chief , Tawfiq Jabber , the head of Hamas 's security and protection unit , and the governor of central Gaza .
Contrary to the Israeli claim that it had only targeted " terrorist infrastructure " , TV footage clearly shows wounded children being carried to hospital .
Yet again civilians are bearing the brunt of the bombings and shootings .
COSATU endorses the view of Palestinian President , Mahmoud Abbas , that this Israeli air campaign was " criminal " and backs his call for the international community to intervene .
The federation reaffirms more strongly than ever its demand that Israel must immediately withdraw all occupation forces from Gaza and end the occupation of all Palestinian land .
It must abide by international human rights law , and refrain from imposing collective punishment on Palestinian civilians ( as per the UN Human Rights Council declaration issued on July 6 , 2006 ) , which it has blatantly contravened today .
All workers and freedom - loving people of South Africa and the world should intensify the boycott of Israeli goods .
COSATU reiterates its call for the government of South Africa to break diplomatic ties with Apartheid Israel and institute sanctions against it until it ends its 40 years of military occupation of Palestine and recognise the people 's right to sovereignty and self - determination .

Israeli attacks on Gaza 's population must stop !
By Left Party ( Sweden )
December 28 , 2008 --
It is with great dismay and sadness , that we are seeing how Israel abuses the already hard - hit population of Gaza continues .
The casualities are rising as the Israeli bombardments continue .
Hospitals are filled with wounded and dying people , hospitals who lack access to medicines and equipment due to Israel 's blockade of the Gaza Strip .
``We are running out of words in order to accurately describe the hell that the Gaza residents endure '' , says Lars Ohly , chair of the Left Party .
Israeli attacks on densely populated areas in the Gaza Strip are unjustified and in clear and serious violation of the very foundations of international law and the law of wars .
It is the duty of the entire world , including Sweden , to act forcefully .
The Left Party demands that Israel immediately ceases its attacks on Gaza and the border crossings are opened , so that the population of Gaza can have access to medicines and food .
Sweden must clearly put pressure on Israel to respect international law and human rights .
`` The time for verbal condemnation is over , Israel 's clear violations of human rights and international law must now bear consequences .
Sweden must act immediately within the EU to break the existing free trade agreement between the European Union and Israel , and freeze the negotiations on deepening cooperation between the EU and Israel .
Now it is high time to stop rewarding the Israeli occupation and aggression '' , said Hans Linde , foreign policy spokesperson for the Left Party .

LALIT strongly condemns Israel aggression against Palestinians
To
Hon. Navin Ramgoolam
Prime Minister
Republic of Mauritius
December 29 , 2008
Dear Sir ,
We write to you as Prime Minister in view of the brutal air strikes by the Israeli army against Gaza , which according to the Red Cross have caused 300 deaths , most of them civilians , and 950 wounded amongst the Palestinians since last Saturday .
LALIT strongly condemns this military aggression by the Israeli army against the Palestinians living inside the Gaza Strip .
It is both disproportionate and indiscriminate .
We are particularly concerned about the fate of the 1.5 million ``imprisoned '' Palestinians of Gaza living under the murderous siege imposed by the Israeli government since June 2007 and suffering the effects of economic sanctions that are backed by the US and its European allies .
This siege and the economic sanctions are together responsible for denying Palestinians access to medical treatment and causing shortages of food , fuel and electricity to Palestinians .
Together they constitute a grave act of collective punishment .
The current international economic blocade against Palestine has resulted in a spiralling humanitarian disaster , with the spread of disease , malnutrition and chaos in both the West Bank and Gaza .
This new military attack by Israel is further aggravating the situation of the Palestinian people .
The illegal occupation and colonisation of Palestine is , in fact , benefiting the Israeli economy .
Israel is making enormous financial gains from its control of all essential services for the Occupied Territories , including water , electricity and telephone services .
Some 10 % of Israel ’s income ( or 46.651 new Israel shekels ) is generated each year by the occupation of Palestine .
It is the Israeli military industrial complex that has been the primary beneficiary .
It is using the occupied territories for ‘ field trials ’ for new weapons systems .
In 2004 the export of this weaponry was worth US $ 4.5 billion , or around 10 % of the total military expenditure in the world according to Shiv Hever and the Israeli - Palestine Alternative Information Centre ( AIC ) .
Companies like Caterpillar , Volvo , Daewoo are also making huge profits from the occupation , all three are supplying equipment to Israel , specially to the military .
The D9 armoured bulldozers , supplied by Caterpillar are often used for the demolition of Palestinians ’ houses .
Since 2000 , according to the UN , more than 4500 Palestinian homes have been demolished .
The Israeli Committee Against House Demolition estimates that Israel has demolished more than 12,000 Palestinian homes since 1967 .
The ``security barrier '' or Apartheid Wall that Israel is building is also making profits for Israeli and foreign companies .
The wall is in fact designed to steal Palestine ’s natural resources ( such as water and land ) .
The ``seamline '' zone between the 1967 Green Line and the Apartheid Wall is now being used by Israeli capitalists to super - exploit Palestinian workers who are forced to work as cheap labour in this “ free ” zone , a zone where companies do not have to abide by Israeli labour or environmental laws .
The continued military attacks and war waged by Israel on Palestine are motivated by the economic interests and political agenda of the capitalist business class of Israel , US and Europe and their respective States .
Through this letter we would like to re-iterate the call that LALIT and former President Cassam Uteem made to your government in a letter in November 2006 .
We therefore call again on your government
( i ) to freeze its diplomatic relations with Israel ,
( ii ) to call for an arms embargo on Israel , and
( iii ) to initiate a boycott of Israeli products .
Your government should simultaneously use its influence in regional and international forums to take the initiative to prepare a collective statement demanding an immediate stop of Israel military action in Gaza and to follow suit in the three actions above .
All must be done to force the present Israeli regime to act according to international law and to put an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people .
The 40 years of illegal occupation and 60 years of colonisation of Palestine are reminiscent of the violence of colonisation in past centuries , now universally condemned as having been totally unacceptable plunder often bordering on genocide .
It must stop .
LALIT also expressed its total solidarity with the people of Palestine , in particular with the inhabitants of Gaza , who are facing another harsh and disastrous end of the year .
We are actively supporting groups in Palestine and in Israel engaged in resistance actions against military occupation and colonisation .
Yours sincerely ,
Alain Ah - Vee
For Lalit

Solidarity ( United states ) : Behind the Gaza massacre
By David Finkl
The horror in Gaza is not some kind of accident or unexpected disaster .
It is a result of events and decisions years in the making .
It can not be understood apart from years of United States policy in the Middle East .
And it is most definitely not an act of “ legitimate Israeli defence against unprovoked Hamas rockets ” .
The bombing of Gaza is the massacre of a civilian population .
Homes in refugee camps , hospitals , a university and its dormitories with students sleeping inside , vital infrastructure -- all have been hit by Israel ’s “ precision bombs ” .
Targets destroyed in the name of “ destroying terrorist structures ” include police stations and recruits , who are ordinary people not military personnel .
Journalists are barred from entering Gaza , so direct accounts of the carnage come mostly from Palestinian bloggers or desperate United Nation relief officials .
The military operation has clearly been planned for months .
All during this time , Israel has tightened the blockade of Gaza , with complete United States government approval - cutting off essential medicines including insulin , reducing critical food supplies to barely above starvation level - fully realizing that the Hamas authorities in Gaza would eventually respond with rockets at southern Israeli towns .
That was exactly the pretext that Israel ’s government wanted .
Horror in Gaza
Several hundred Gaza residents , including noncombatant women and children , have been killed and thousands wounded .
Even before this onslaught , however , they have been dying from lack of medicines blocked by the Israeli siege .
A recent solidarity delegation to Gaza , traveling by boat in defiance of the blockade , was asked by their Palestinian hosts to bring thousands of children ’s hearing aids -- because children in Gaza have catastrophic hearing loss from Israeli noise bombs as well as jets ’ routine sonic booms .
The Israeli assault is intended to break the back of the Hamas government in Gaza , but it will fail in this , as the Palestinians of Gaza will rally behind Hamas in their solidarity against attack .
Therefore , the massacre of Gaza ’s people can be expected to continue until international outrage forces it to stop .
That outrage is quite rightly directed as much at the American government as it is at Israel .
The Bush administration , with its proclamation that the elected Hamas Palestinian government “ are nothing but thugs ” , is giving open full support to this crime against humanity .
Palestinians and their supporters are sickened by the complicity of Arab governments , particularly Egypt , in the Israeli - US attempt to destroy the leadership that was chosen through a free election in the Occupied Palestinian Territories .
The European Union , whichextends special trading privileges to Israel , has also done nothing to stop the Israeli blockade of Gaza and now the slaughter of its population .
The pressure to force the bombing to end must come from below , from the Global Justice movement and from the outrage of people throughout the Middle East and the world .
Obama
Much of the world is awaiting with great hope the arrival of the Barack Obama presidency .
Mr Obama was elected , let us remember , with great majority support both from Jewish and Arab Americans , and his victory was greeted with elation in the Arab world and Israel alike .
Tragically , his statements before the election , and his silence now , offer little reason to expect the Obama White House to change US policies which are leading Israel , as well as the United States and the Middle East , toward mutual destruction .
What needs to change ?
The fiasco known as the “ peace process ” since the early 1990s has produced no peace , because it was always built on two false assumptions .
The first was that Israel would keep the promises it made to halt settlement construction in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and allow a viable Palestinian state to emerge .
No Israeli government ever intended to do so .
The second assumption was that the Palestinian population would quietly surrender in the face of overwhelming firepower to whatever terms the United States and Israel would dictate .
They have n’t surrendered , and they wo n’t now .
The Arab American community and supporters of the Palestinian people poured out in Dearborn , Michigan on December 30 , lining the sidewalk on Warren Avenue for a full half mile .
At least two thousand people participated in this protest against Israel ’s murderous bombing of the population of Gaza , so many that a memorial service for the Palestinian martyrs planned for the evening had to be postponed as the crowd overflowed the hall .
Another mobilisation will occur at Dearborn City Hall on Friday , January 2 .
Under this “ peace process ” , the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the siege of Gaza have created a reality worse than existed in South Africa .
The world must stand up against this to force the change that is necessary if there is to be peace for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples .
The growing international efforts for boycott and sanctions deserve full support , to end the Israeli occupation and force the slaughter in Gaza to stop .
The only other possible outcomes , all too clearly foreshadowed by what we must call the Israeli - US massacre in Gaza , are new forms of apartheid and ultimately genocide too horrible to contemplate .
