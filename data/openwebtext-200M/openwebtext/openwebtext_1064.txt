US agents have arrested 44 elected officials and rabbis in New Jersey in a huge anti-corruption sweep across the state .
Charges of extortion , bribery , money laundering and human organ trafficking were stunning even for a state long notorious for official corruption and organised crime .
Under arrest ... a rabbi is taken into court .

Five rabbis were among the suspects , along with the mayors of Hoboken , Secaucus and Ridgefield , the Jersey City deputy mayor and council president , two state assembly members and numerous other politicians , prosecutors said .
Acting US Attorney for the district of New Jersey Ralph Marra told a press conference the sweep demonstrated " the pervasive nature of public corruption in this state " .
OTTAWA–Canadian motorists should be given random roadside tests in an effort to combat impaired driving , a parliamentary committee recommends .
Conservative MP Ed Fast ( Abbotsford ) , chair of the justice and human right committee , said the move might be controversial but something has to be done because impaired driving remains the No. 1 criminal cause of death in Canada .
Currently , the law requires reasonable grounds before police can administer a breathalyzer to a driver suspected of being impaired .
Under the committee proposal , that requirement would disappear .
Fast told a press conference yesterday the all - party committee decided random checks , like those used in Ireland and Australia , would be the most effective deterrent available to stop motorists from driving after drinking .
" It increases the probably of an impaired driver coming into contact with police and therefore increases the risk of being caught , " Fast said .
The all - party committee stopped short of recommending the legal limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood ( .08 ) be reduced , citing the inability of the justice system to cope with the increased workload .
The New Democrats dissented on this , arguing it should 50 milligrams ( .05 ) .

Women were among the crowd at the rally at Bamako 's main stadium
Tens of thousands of people in Mali 's capital , Bamako , have been protesting against a new law which gives women equal rights in marriage .
The law , passed earlier this month , also strengthens inheritance rights for women and children born out of wedlock .
The head of a Muslim women 's association says only a minority of Malian women - " the intellectuals " as she put it - supports the law .
Several other protests have taken place in other parts of the country .
The law was adopted by the Malian parliament at the beginning of August , and has yet to be signed into force by the president .
One of the most contentious issues in the new legislation is that women are no longer required to obey their husbands .
Hadja Sapiato Dembele of the National Union of Muslim Women 's Associations said the law goes against Islamic principles .
" We have to stick to the Koran , " Ms Dembele told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme .
" A man must protect his wife , a wife must obey her husband . "
" It 's a tiny minority of women here that wants this new law - the intellectuals .
The poor and illiterate women of this country - the real Muslims - are against it , " she added .
Judge a person by their questions , rather than their answers .
Because asking the right questions today is the answer .
It ’s a harsh fact that every one of us is ignorant in some way .
Although we tend to pretend otherwise , it ’s impossible to know it all .
Ignorance is our biggest collective secret .
And it ’s one of the scariest and most damaging realities of life , because those of us who are most ignorant — and thus most likely to spread ignorance — are often the ones who do n’t know it .
Here ’s a quick test :
If you have never changed your mind about one of your beliefs , if you have never questioned the fundamentals of your opinions , and if you have no inclination to do so , then you are likely ignorant about something you think you understand .
What ’s the immediate solution ?
Just move one step outside of your social bubble and find someone ( online or offline ) who , in your opinion , believes , behaves , or handles certain aspects of life differently from you .
Then , have a simple , honest , peaceful conversation with them .
I promise it will do both of you lots of good .
Once you ’ve done that , here are some key truths to remind yourself of on a regular basis : [ Read more … ]
It appears that the Conspiracy Files programme has form .
As a programme it has investigated the conspiracy theories behind the death of Princess Diana , Dr David Kelly and 9/11 .
More often than not , because of their method of dramatising the evidence against the conspiracy theorists , they have actually given kudos to the theories they hope to destroy .
In the days before Iplayer , these shows were available to stream through real media ( use real alternative – it is just better ) .
This is yet another area where BBC Iplayer has actually reduced choice .
Many of the shows that used to available for streaming are now gone from their archives .
I have to say , this was a very very poor attempt by the BBC to label all those calling for a public inquiry into 7/7 as nuts .
A typical guilt by association tactic more associated with the darker arts of propaganda than journalistic research .
Another blog has directly accused the BBC of siding with “ spooks ” on a show that was nothing more than a whitewash .
My post yesterday predicted that the BBC would fail to provide any reasonable explanation about why 7/7 happened .
For a start not questioning even the basic actions of the “ bombers ” on that day .
Buying a parking ticket for the car and return train fares ?
What were they worried Network rail would chase them for the fines in the afterlife ?
They attacked the youtube author for his videos , accusing him of deliberately stirring up Islamic hate of the Police .
They do a good enough job of that themselves anyway .
The police ( and indeed the BBC ) have continually demonised Muslims .
They continue to do so .
The police launch bigger and bigger “ terror raids ” that result in no prosecutions .
The BBC often have cameras there for the raid itself .
When these raids fail to turn up any evidence the BBC is then happy to repeat the lie they were not terrorists they were kiddie fiddlers .
( Update – this is the bit I can not get over .
Tony Blair said hand on his Zanu Labour v1 battery cell that his Foreign Policy of invading Muslim Countries had nothing whatsoever to do with London getting bombed .
However the BBC have the gall to say that the conspiracy theorist may be responsible for any future Islamic extremist terror outrage .
Someone please explain how I can make this compute )
Can the BBC seriously say that if Jean Charles De Menezes had have been Muslim the Police and the BBC would not still be claiming that another tube outrage was prevented ?
Which on the day of the shooting is exactly what they were trying to do .
In fact the BBC made up lies on the behalf of the Police while reporting the shooting .
In one of the early articles , the BBC flat out lied .
Home affairs correspondent Margaret Gilmore said officers had challenged a known suspect they had been following .
“ He ran , they followed him .
They say they gave him a warning , they then shot him .
“ They brought in the air ambulance .
They did everything they can to revive him .
He died at the scene . ”
None of that actually happened did it Ms Gilmore ?
In fact does this person the BBC “ interviewed ” really exist ?
Another passenger on the train , Anthony Larkin , told BBC News the man appeared to be wearing a “ bomb belt with wires coming out ” .
Or this person ?
Londoner Dan Copeland was in the carriage in which the man was shot .
He told BBC News : “ We were sitting for a few minutes on the platform , then we heard shouting from the concourse between the two platforms .
“ Then the man burst in through the door to my right and grabbed hold of the pole and a person by the glass partition near the door , diagonally opposite me .
“ An officer jumped on the door to my left and screamed , ‘ Everybody out ! ’
The fact that the police used illegal hollow point rounds in that shooting was hardly covered at all by the BBC .
Yet more crimes carried out by our Government forces in our name .
It is not as thought the police did not try and besmirch his name either , early on claiming he was an illegal over - stayer .
Which again the BBC reported .
The BBC do themselves a disservice by completely dismissing Israeli links .
Operation Kratos , the illegal and never debated or agreed shoot to kill policy originated in Israel .
The BBC themselves asked very similar questions .
The Panorama video is still available to stream .
I guess that they are allowed to ask questions because they get their money at the point of a gun .
They are after all responsible a large percentage of women prisoners , who were too poor to pay the BBC TV tax .
Members of the public who ask questions are just nuts and must be attacked .
Well the BBC have continually stamped on their own legitimacy , they have lied for the Government as demonstrated here and by siding with the Government on this one has to question their legitimacy again .
If they were prepared to lie on behalf of the police who murdered an innocent civilian on the streets of London , are they prepared to do so again ?
The official version of what is supposed to have happened has never been tested at an inquiry .
It is therefore nothing more than a conspiracy theory itself .
Which makes their show nothing more than a hit piece .
The facts of 7/7 are very much open to question .
It seems that the BBC , who require us to fund them will now happily belittle those who simply want answers to questions .
Well that as the Pet Shop Boys say in their homage to Jean Charles makes us all criminals now .
And if you criminalise a whole Country , well no one does have anything to hide any more except of course – the Government .
Iran is beginning to discover the consequences of that .
The Severn estuary could become the site of a giant tidal barrage , generating huge amounts of clean energy but obliterating vulnerable wildlife habitats ( Image : Kevin Allen / Alamy )
You ca n’t generate vast amounts of green energy without large - scale engineering projects ( Image : Toby Smith / Construction Photography )
YOU can understand the frustration on both sides .
Environmentalists worldwide are clamouring for bold action to end the burning of fossil fuels and plug the world into renewables .
Politicians throw their weight behind a $ 14 billion scheme that would replace the equivalent of eight coal - fired power stations with tidal power .
What do they get for their pains ?
Green outrage .
“ This massively damaging proposal cannot be justified , ” said Graham Wynne , chief of the UK ’s normally staid Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) .
Friends of the Earth said it was “ not the answer ” .
What is going on here ?
Have greens lost the plot ?
Has environmentalism been hijacked by big construction companies ?
Or do we simply have to learn that even environmental energy comes at an environmental cost ?
The project causing all the controversy is the Severn barrage on the west coast of Britain , but similar stories are playing out across the world .
As greens gradually win the argument for switching to renewable energy , they are finding that they do n’t always like the look of the new world they are creating .
The problem is one of scale .
Bigness is often an issue for greens , many of whom grew up reading one of the movement ’s key texts : E. F. Schumacher ’s Small Is Beautiful .
They liked biofuel while it was about recycling cooking fat , but …

It ’s pictures like these that make me a ) want to do more photography , b ) feel more in awe of nature than I already am , and c ) wonder how the photographer did n’t pack up his gear and run away screaming .
But thank goodness the talented storm chasers did n’t run away , they actually witnessed a very rare event , up close .
This astounding image was shot by photographers Francis Schaefers and Daniel Burger when they were chasing a thunderstorm along a beach in Vlissingen , the Netherlands .
Chasing a storm along a beach .
The best bit of the SpaceWeather.com article comes right at the end , where it says that Schaefers and Burger took a series of shots from “ underneath a balcony where they figured the lightning would n’t reach . ”
Let me emphasise that last bit : underneath a balcony .
Balls of steel comes to mind .
For me , nothing less than a reinforced bunker surrounded by lightning rods will do .
Related Lightning Articles :
Anyway , back to why this image is so fantastic .
When lightning strikes the ground , if you are able to get the timing perfect , you might be able to capture ‘ upward streamers ’ rising from the ground to meet the leading edge of the bolt , as NASA lightning expert Richard Blakeslee explains :
“ In a typical cloud - to - ground lightning strike , as the leader approaches the ground , the large electric field at the leader tip induces these upward propagating streamers .
The first one that connects to the downward propagating leader initiates the bright return stroke that we see with our eye .
Upward streamers are often observed on photographs of lightning hitting the ground . ”
It ’s hard to imagine if this streamer phenomenon has been observed to reach out from water before , but this Dutch example must be very rare .
It ’s hard enough to photograph lightning streamers on solid ground , let alone on the surface of a body of water .

Those of you still hoping for " change " can forget it .
Young Mr. Obama is working the same number that young Mr. Bush pulled on us .
In Obama ’s address to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Phoenix , Ariz. , on Aug. 17 , he made his commitment to war in the Bananastans irrevocable .
It would be wonderful if public servants seeking to associate themselves with the military would cater to the agenda of the Veterans for Peace .
For a president of the United States to pander to the VFW is a disgrace .
While the VFW is not a pack of latter - day Brownshirts like the American Legion , the two groups possess a common value : they never saw an armed conflict they did n’t like .
If they had to serve in a pointless war , everyone else should too .
They also never met a Republican politician they did n’t like .
Why a Democrat who was elected on a peace platform feels compelled to throw a bone to Pavlov ’s dogs of war is inscrutable .
In Phoenix , Obama deflected criticism of his lack of support for the self - defeating Iraq war by drumming up support for his self - defeating conflict in the Bananastans .
He continued a tradition established by his predecessor when he told the veterans " Those who attacked America on 9/11 are plotting to do so again . "
Are we doomed to hearing presidents evoke 9/11 every time they want to justify overseas adventurism ?
" But we must never forget , " Obama reminded the veterans , that the Bananastans conflict " is not a war of choice . "
It is a " war of necessity " because " if left unchecked , the Taliban insurgency will mean an even larger safe haven from which al - Qaeda would plot to kill more Americans . "
So , according to Obama , the Bananastans crusade is not only " worth fighting , " it is " fundamental to the defense of our people . "
What fundamental horse manure .
We ’ve accepted the myth that the 9/11 attacks were made possible by Osama bin Laden ’s " sanctuary " in Afghanistan for far too long .
9/11 " mastermind " Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was operating in the Philippines when he first presented the attack plan to bin Laden in 1996 .
The six hijackers who controlled the airplanes received their flight training in the U.S.
The " muscle hijackers " came from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates .
That bin Laden was in Afghanistan at the time is a narrative of our " good intelligence " in that part of the world , which , to this day , amounts to beating or bribing locals into telling us what we want to hear or believing the lies that Afghan and Pakistani intelligence agencies feed us .
" We will plan responsibly , " Obama told the veterans , and he boasted of the " new comprehensive strategy " for the Bananastans that he announced in March .
The people responsible for Obama ’s new comprehensive strategy deserve a session of tar - and - feather therapy .
The strategy , conjured by National Security Adviser James Jones and his team of " chess masters , " is a compendium of wimp - words and hazy goals .
We ’ll be " promoting a more capable " Afghan government , one that " can eventually function . "
We ’ll also be " developing " an " increasingly self - reliant " Afghan security force .
On top of all that , we ’ll be " assisting efforts to enhance civilian control " of Pakistan ’s government .
With a strategy like this , who needs enemies ?
It ’s self - defeating .
We ’ll kinda / sorta try to do things we can’t possibly accomplish .
A prolonged occupation of the Bananastans will not " disrupt , dismantle , and defeat al - Qaeda " and its allies .
Al - Qaeda and its allies have iPhones .
They do n’t need to hunker down in the Bananastani Himalayas .
They can plan and execute their evildoing at a Club Med getaway if they want to .
By June 2009 the Pentagon still had n’t figured out what measures of effectiveness to use in determining if the new comprehensive strategy is working .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm .
Mike Mullen said that some of those metrics – whatever they turn out to be – will remain classified .
That way they wo n’t have to explain how they know they ’re being effective ( if they told us , they ’d have to kill us ) .
We ’ll just have to take their word for it that they ’re turning corners and mopping up dead - enders and that victory is at hand even though it will be a long struggle .
Gates and Mullen make Cheney and Rumsfeld seem like straight shooters .
Obama told the VFW that " military power alone will not win this war , " but military power , as flaccid as it has become , is more effective than the other forms of power in the American arsenal .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is as adept at diplomacy as John Bolton was .
Whenever she opens her mouth it ’s all anyone can do to keep another war from breaking out .
Whatever economic efforts we can afford to make in the Bananastans will amount to handing out bribes like the ones we handed out in Iraq , and our information operations there involve , at best , a gentlemanly exchange of mendacities with the host countries .
" By moving forward in Iraq , " Obama told the VFW , " we ’re able to refocus on the war against al - Qaeda and its extremist allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan . "
Candidate Obama pledged to " get the job done " in Afghanistan when his opponents attacked him for having voted against the surge in Iraq .
He would have been better off to refute claims of the strategy ’s success .
Today , more than two - and - a - half years after the surge commenced , counterinsurgency expert John A. Nagl says " the insurgency is not over " and Pentagon correspondent Thomas E. Ricks says we ’re " at about the midpoint of the conflict now . "
Bush was probably too dim to realize he was talking gibberish about Iraq , but Obama is too smart to believe the bull jargon he ’s handing us about the Bananastans .
Obama has to realize that there is no strategy for Afghanistan and that the organized but senseless violence his generals are conducting there will not further " the security and safety of the American people . "
At this point , Obama cannot escape the Bananastan trap without gnawing off a political foot .
He needs to sack his National Security Council and everyone in the Department of Defense who wears a bird or a star in their collar or whose title contains the word " secretary . "
Then he needs to tell the nation that he was wrong about escalating the war in Afghanistan , and then he needs to bring our troops home .
I doubt that he has the political baby - makers to do that .
A new Taser that fires wireless electric shock projectiles up to 30 metres is being considered for use by UK police forces , the Home Office has confirmed .
The eXtended Range Electronic Projectile ( XREP ) , which went on sale in the US last month , attaches itself to its target with a series of barbed electrodes and delivers a 20 - second , 500 volt shock .
If the subject tries to grab the device to pull it off , " reflex engagement electrodes " activate to complete a circuit that sends the shock through the subject 's body out to their hand .
The makers of the XREP , Taser International , say it is a " revolutionary " step that will allow police to safely immobilise potentially dangerous suspects from a much greater distance than before – the traditional hand - held Taser stun guns used in the UK only fired darts up to 25 feet – and then give them time to reach the target before he or she is able to move again .
Previous Tasers have only delivered a five - second shock , which could be retriggered .
But Amnesty International said it was " seriously concerned " about the XREP and worried by the news it could be authorised in the UK .
" This is effectively a shotgun that fires electric - shock bullets , " Amnesty International UK 's arms programme director , Oliver Sprague , said , adding : " Because this bullet can be fired wire - free from a standard shotgun there is a heightened risk of causing serious injury to the face and head .
" We 're also concerned by the fact that these weapons will deliver an excruciatingly painful shock for 20 seconds .
Amnesty would be very alarmed if the Home Office were to consider authorising this weapon to police officers in the UK . "
Taser 's footage of the device being manually activated on already wired - up volunteers shows them tensing up in pain , groaning and slumping towards the floor .
Watch Taser 's promotional footage TASER
On the Discovery Channel 's Future Weapons programme , one heavily muscled volunteer was asked afterwards how the shock had felt .
" Like my toes curled back to touch my behind , " he said .
" There 's no way I could fight through that . "
Rick Smith , Taser International 's CEO , told the show the device " can drop the largest , scariest people on the planet " .
Last month Taser co-founder Rick Smith told analysts the wireless systems would " leave more of a mark " .
" It 's a bigger projectile to reach out to extended ranges , " he said in a conference call .
" It 's moving faster ; it 's going to , potentially , cause a much bigger bruise , contusions .
It 's going to be a pretty bad thing . "
This meant law enforcement would use the devices more sparingly , in only very high risk situations , Smith added .
The Home Office confirmed it was evaluating the XREP for possible use by law enforcement in Britain .
" The Home Office Scientific Development Branch are considering it as part of their ongoing remit to evaluate new less lethal technologies " a spokesman said .
Taser rejected Amnesty 's concerns , saying the XREP would cause less pain when it hit than other " less lethal " impact munitions and was a safer way to immobilise someone than shooting them with live ammunition .
" The premise behind the XREP is not to cause or impart physical pain , it is to cause incapacitation , " spokesman Steve Tuttle said .
" I 'm not saying this is risk free : it will leave potential bruising and it could cause a contusion .
But when you compare it to a traditional impact munition it will be significantly less likely to cause injury and much more accurate . "
28 Practical Uses for Vinegar , Nature 's Magic Cleanser
Have you overlooked the many practical uses of vinegar ?
Clean , disinfect and shine for pennies !
Heinz company spokesperson Michael Mullen has cited numerous studies to show that a straight 5 percent solution of vinegar such as you can buy in the supermarket kills 99 percent of bacteria , 82 percent of mold , and 80 percent of germs ( viruses ) .
He noted that Heinz can't claim on their packaging that vinegar is a disinfectant since the company has not registered it as a pesticide with the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
However , it seems to be common knowledge in the industry that vinegar is powerfully antibacterial .
Here are twenty - seven uses for vinegar : * Deodorize your sink drains :
Pour a cup down your drain , let stand about thirty minutes , then run cold water .
* Unclog a drain : Dump 1 cup of baking soda down your drain and follow it with 1 cup of vinegar .
When they mix , they foam and expand , cleaning your drain .
Allow a few minutes for the mixture to do it 's job , then flush with hot water for several minutes .
* Disinfect and clean wood cutting boards : Rub with vinegar to disinfect and clean .
If your cutting board has deep grooves , you can also soak the board in vinegar for 5 - 10 minutes .
*
Cut grease :
When washing greasy pans or dishes , add a few tablespoons of vinegar to your soapy dishwater .
* Clean the dishwasher : Vinegar reduces soap build up , so throw a cup of vinegar in your dishwasher and let it run a full ( empty ) cycle once a month or so .
* Clean the coffeepot : Hard water can clog a coffeepot and cause yucky buildup inside it .
To remedy this , pour 1 cup vinegar in your coffeepot , fill the rest of the way with water , then run it through a cycle as usual ( without coffee grounds in the filter ) .
Rinse the coffeepot out .
Fill it with fresh water and run another cycle without coffee to rinse the inside of the coffee maker .
* Loosen food grime and clean the microwave :
Place a microwave - safe bowl with 2 cups water , 1/ 2 cup vinegar inside the microwave and microwave on full power for 3 - 4 minutes ( it needs to boil ) .
Keep your microwave closed for a few minutes to allow the steam to loosen the grime , then open your microwave , carefully remove the bowl , and wipe clean !
* Clean windows : Mix 1 cup vinegar with 5 cups water , and you 've got a great window cleaner .
If you must have blue window cleaner , just a few drops of blue food coloring !
* Remove grease from kitchen walls :
Put straight vinegar on a dishcloth to wipe grease off kitchen walls , or the stovetop .
* Remove pet urine stains ( and smells ) from carpet : Mix about 1/4 cup of vinegar to a quart of water .
Soak a washcloth in the mixture and blot the area several times .
* Clean kitchen and bathroom faucets :
Soak a paper towel in vinegar then wrap it around your faucet to remove mineral deposits .
* Clean and shine no - wax vinyl or linoleum floors :
Mix 1 gallon of water with 1 /2 cup vinegar in a bucket , then mop or scrub your floor with the solution .
* Inexpensive scouring powder : Combine two tablespoons each of vinegar and baking soda for an effective scouring powder .
* Clean the toilet rim :
Put straight 5 % vinegar in a squirt bottle and use it to clean the rim of the toilet .
It disinfects , too ! * Prevent mold and mildew in the shower :
Wipe down tile or Formica shower walls with a sponge or cloth dampened with water and vinegar .
The vinegar will clean the walls and inhibit the growth of mold and mildew .
* Unclog the showerhead : Mineral deposits from hard water can cause a sputtering , clogged shower head .
Place the showerhead in a pot , add enough vinegar to completely cover it .
Heat the vinegar to just below boiling , then remove from heat .
Allow to sit for at least 6 hours .
The acid in the vinegar will eat away the deposits .
Rinse the showerhead well , and it 's ready to go again .
*
Get rid of the funky smell in that lunchbox : Soak a piece of plain bread in vinegar , then place it in the lunchbox overnight and the smell will disappear !
* Remove rust :
To get rid of rust , soak items in vinegar ( do not dilute ) .
This will work on any metals .
* Remove residue and styling product build up from hair :
After shampooing , rinse your hair with a mixture of 1/2 vinegar , 1/ 2 warm water to remove all the build up and get rid of that dullness .
* Eliminate smells : Run a hot tub of water and pour in one or two cups of vinegar .
Hang smelly clothes on hangers along your shower curtain rod .
This will remove smoke and other tough smells .
*
Get rid of stickers , decals and sticky residues : Rub a few coats of vinegar on the area and allow to soak .
Then wash off with a wet washcloth and the sticky will rub right off .
* Polish patent leather purses and shoes :
Place vinegar on a clean cloth , then rub over patent leather .
Wipe dry with another clean cloth .
* Remove stains : Rub a small amount of vinegar gently on fruit , jelly , mustard or coffee type stains and wash as usual .
No more stain ! * Clean your glasses :
Place a drop of vinegar on the lens , then rub with a cotton cloth .
*
Get the smell out of your cloth diapers !
Next time those cloth diapers start to smell , add a 1 / 2 to 1 cup of vinegar in your last rinse .
* Polish your car : Rub vinegar on chrome to clean and shine it .
* Remove bumper stickers :
Soak a cloth in vinegar and lay it over the bumper sticker .
Allow to soak a few minutes .
The bumper sticker should peel right off .
Rub vinegar over the area to remove the sticky residue , if necessary .
*
Next time you have a sore throat , try gargling with cider vinegar !

Created : August 03 , 2009 20:42 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Sen. Richard Durbin ( D - Ill . ) ( WDCpix )
A top Democrat on Monday warned the nation ’s banks that , unless they get more aggressive in modifying mortgages to prevent foreclosure , Congress will renew previous efforts to empower families to keep their homes through bankruptcy .
But Sen. Richard Durbin ( Ill. ) , the upper - chamber ’s second ranking Democrat , also gave the banks three months to comply with his ultimatum — a span over which roughly 1 million new homeowners are projected to enter foreclosure .
Congress and White House officials have created a series of programs designed to entice mortgage lenders and servicers to modify troubled loans voluntarily , but those efforts have n’t kept pace with an ever - rising number of foreclosures , which have already topped 1.5 million since January .
The issue has plagued lawmakers , who have spent hundreds of billions of dollars propping up the nation ’s banks , but have provided little in direct help for families caught in the swirl of the housing crisis , which was at the root of the current recession .

Durbin is the sponsor of legislation to alter the bankruptcy code to allow judges to trim , or “ cramdown , ” the terms of primary mortgages to keep people in their homes — an option current law does n’t permit .
The Senate killed the proposal earlier in the year , but it could resurface if foreclosures continue to rise and the banks continue their reluctance to cut mortgage rates on their own .
Durbin , for his part , thinks the bankruptcy change can’t come soon enough .
“ The voluntary efforts by some banks to slow the foreclosure crisis and stabilize America ’s housing market have not worked , ” Durbin said during a housing forum at the Center for American Progress Action Fund .
“ Whether the bankers and mortgage servicers are failing because of intransigence or incompetence does n’t matter …
They have to do much better . ”
At the center of the Obama administration ’s efforts is the Home Affordable Modification Program , which allocates $ 75 billion to encourage banks to make mortgage loans more affordable .
White House officials estimate the initiative will prevent between 3 million and 4 million foreclosures in the next few years .
Yet only 200,000 modifications have been accepted under the program , according to the Treasury Department , and most of those are temporary , three - month trial arrangements .
Last Tuesday , the Obama administration called executives from the nation ’s top servicers to the White House , urging them to commit to a goal of 500,000 modifications by the start of November .
If the banks have n’t made “ real progress ” toward that target , Durbin warned Monday , he ’ll begin whipping support for “ further legislative solutions , ” including the controversial proposal to reform the bankruptcy code , and another to require third - party arbitration between borrowers and lenders .
“ I want to put the banks and mortgage servicers on notice today , ” said Durbin , who sent letters Monday to each of the 34 banks that have already signed on to participate in the administration ’s modification program .
The comments arrive just days after another powerful Democrat , House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) , issued a similar threat to revisit cramdown .
The statements are evidence of a growing impatience among some lawmakers with the banking industry ’s efforts to stabilize the still - volatile housing market .
Credit Suisse has estimated that Durbin ’s bill would prevent roughly 20 percent of all foreclosures — not because one - fifth of struggling homeowners would pursue loan modifications in bankruptcy court , but because the very threat of bankruptcy would prod banks to volunteer the more affordable modification terms required to keep families in their homes .
“ If that is at the end of the road as a possibility , ” Durbin said , “ I think it ’s an incentive for action . ”
Standing in his way have been the powerful finance industry and its many supporters on Capitol Hill , who argue that mortgage contracts are sanctuaries not to be meddled with .
Empower judges to alter mortgages , they say , and the increased risk to the banks will be passed along to all borrowers in the form of higher rates .
Another barrier to bankruptcy reform has been the Obama administration , which abandoned its previously enthusiastic support for cramdown earlier this year .
Although the House passed its version of the bill in March , the absence of White House backing led to the Senate defeat of Durbin ’s cramdown bill in April .
More recently , White House officials told Congress that they have all the tools they need to tackle the foreclosure problem .
Durbin on Monday said he has n’t been in direct touch with Obama about the issue , but has been in contact with others at the White House , including Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner .
Meanwhile , nationwide foreclosures are on pace to top 3 million this year , up from 2.3 million in 2008 , according to RealtyTrac , an online foreclosure database .
In June alone , foreclosures topped 336,000 , up roughly 15,000 from May , Realty Trac found .
At that rate , the number of new foreclosures surfacing by Durbin ’s November ultimatum will approach 1 million .
Or more .
Fueled by rising unemployment trends and another wave of looming mortgage resets — this one revolving around the so - called option adjustable rate mortgages — experts warn that the numbers will only get worse .
“ It ’s a problem that ’s not going to get any better anytime soon , ” Martin J. Gruenberg , vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , said during Monday ’s housing forum .
Much of the problem revolves around the complex web of disconnected interests associated with mortgage finance .
Lenders and investors , for example , have different motivations than borrowers , who have different motivations than the servicers who purchase the rights to manage the loans .
David Wecker , an investor with Illinois - based Magnetar Capital , said Monday that the “ misalignment ” between those interests has led servicers to pursue foreclosures even when they harmed both investors and homeowners .
Wecker encouraged a bolder system of enticing loan modifications .
The instability that results from frequent foreclosures , he argued , is “ not good for any market participant . ”
Policymakers will soon have a new tool at their disposal :
On Tuesday , the Treasury is set to release servicer - specific modification data — information that should lend a better picture of whether the reluctance to modify loans is a problem isolated to just a few companies , or whether the problem stems from some more fundamental flaw in its design .
Durbin , meanwhile , says he ’s not trying to rescue every borrower in the country , but simply to stabilize the housing market that ’s been the cause of the recession .
“ I ’m a realist , ” said the Illinois Democrat .
“ I know we ca n’t save every soul .
But it ’s going to take more than the power of prayer to take us through this crisis . ”
No one is advocating a return to the lax lending standards of 2006 , when buyers with no income or documentation could get loans .
But many people say they believe lenders and the government , in correcting the excesses of that era , have gone too far in the other direction .
Fannie Mae , the government - controlled company that buys mortgages , is so dominant in the lending market that its rules set the standard .
It recently toughened its policies , saying it would count only 70 percent of the value of stocks and mutual funds when calculating a buyer ’s assets .
Previously , that figure was 100 percent .
A Fannie spokesman , Brian Faith , said tighter regulations screened out those unprepared to be owners .
“ One of the important lessons learned in the past few years is that it is not enough to help a borrower own a home , ” Mr. Faith said .
“ We must also help ensure that they will be able to stay in the home over the long term . ”
Mortgage brokers say those who are being rejected for loans are often entrepreneurs who are used to taking risks .
“ They are chomping at the bit to get into this market , but are forced to the sidelines , ” said Stuart Fraass of Guaranteed Rate Inc .
“ If you ’re self - employed , you have virtually no chance of getting a mortgage now . ”
Mr. Fraass was unable to help Raghbir Singh , a real estate investor who owns a gas station in Dover , N.H. Mr. Singh tried to buy a $ 301,000 house for himself and his family with 10 percent down and excellent credit , but was rejected .
“ It was unfair , ” Mr. Singh said .
“ I ’m a good risk , but I ’m forced to rent . ”
Trivia
Gen. Paul Mireau and Gen. George Brulard appear to be based loosely on two real French generals , Robert Nivelle and Philippe Pétain .
Nivelle was a French army Commander - in - Chief who ordered an unsuccessful assault on German positions that resulted in horrendous French casualties .
He was sacked and replaced by Petain , who ordered the execution of dozens of French soldiers who had mutinied when they found out they were to be sent across the same terrain to attack the same target again .

I have said in the past that I think that as time passes , historians , and the American people will have a progressively worse opinion of the Bush / Cheney administration ( yes , it can get worse , it can go from 20 % favorable to zero ) .
This is the opposite of what several Republican pundits have tried to assert .
The problem for the former administration is that the truth is going to come out regarding some of the things they have done and those revelations are going to be devastating .
Yesterday , Cheney inadvertently outed himself as a liar regarding a connection between 9/11 and Iraq .
Taking us back to 2002 and 2003 , in order to sell the Iraq war , one will recall that there were claims of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , pilot - less drones that Iraq could use to fly those weapons to the US , and claims that Iraq was in league with Al Qaeda to attack us on 9/11 .
Cheney weighed in on the reported link between 9/11 , Al Qaeda and Iraq several times , yesterday being the most recent and revealing episode .
As reported here , http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23228.html in an Andy Barr article in Politico :
Former Vice President Dick Cheney says there was “ never any evidence ” that Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq played any role in the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on New York and Washington .
“ On the question of whether or not Iraq was involved in 9/11 , there was never any evidence to prove that , ” Cheney said during an interview Monday night with Fox News ’ Greta Van Susteren .
-------------------------------------------
The video of this interview can be seen at http://www.politico.com/singletitlevideo.html?bcpid=1155201977&bctid=25026448001
Barr ’s article goes on to point out that this directly contradicts what then Vice President Cheney said in a 2003 Meet the Press Interview on NBC when Cheney said :
“ the Czechs alleged that Mohamed Atta , the lead attacker , met in Prague with a senior Iraqi intelligence official five months before the attack . ”
-----------------------------------
But there is even more evidence that Barr missed .
Consider the 2004 interview Cheney had on CNBC as reported here at CNN , http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/18/cheney.iraq.al.qaeda/ when Cheney said :
" There clearly was a relationship .
It 's been testified to .
The evidence is overwhelming " It goes back to the early '90s .
It involves a whole series of contacts , high - level contacts with Osama bin Laden and Iraqi intelligence officials . "
" The press , with all due respect , ( is ) often times lazy , often times simply reports what somebody else in the press said without doing their homework . "
------------------------------------
Well , I have a response for Dick Cheney on his last point .
I ’ve done my homework concerning his statements on Iraq and 9/11 and here are the videos :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJiNtpIpD6k
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RytxVNM0llQ
--------------------------------------
Cheney repeatedly made assertions that there were high - level connections between Iraq and Al Qaeda and , through asserting a meeting happened between Iraq officials and Mohammed Atta six months before 9/11 , insinuated that there was a connection between Iraq and 9/11 .
Cheney was so effective in this insinuation that 40 % of the American people believed Iraq had a role in 9/11 as recently as 2007 .

ROME , Italy ( CNN ) -- Pope Benedict XVI preached and greeted well - wishers Sunday , three days after breaking his wrist in a fall .
The pope celebrates mass with his broken wrist in plaster .
He held the text of his speech in his uninjured left hand , then circulated among the crowd who came to hear him in Romano Canavese , pictures from the northern Italian town showed .
The 82 - year - old pope had surgery on his right wrist after he fell Thursday night , spokesman Father Federico Lombardi told CNN on Friday .
The pope is " learning " to live with his cast , Lombardi told Vatican Radio .
The most painful aspect of the incident for Benedict is having to give up writing by hand , which he had intended to do frequently during his annual vacation Italy 's Val d'Aosta region , Lombardi told the official Vatican station .
" I know that here , too , in the Ivera region , many families are facing economic hard times due to a lack of work , " he said , referring to the now - defunct Olivetti typewriter manufacturer in the region .
" Dear friend , do not be discouraged , " he added , according to Agence - France Presse .
" Providence always helps those who do the right thing and seek justice ; it also helps those who think not only of themselves , but also think of those in worse situations than their own . "

Broadband customers are being sold super - fast connections that their providers are unable to achieve , according to research that shows internet users are struggling with speeds of less than half the rate they signed up to .
The media and telecoms watchdog , Ofcom , examined the most popular broadband product advertised as offering speeds of " up to " 8 megabits per second and used by 57 % of homes .
The report , published today , says , on average , users are getting speeds of just 3.9 Mb .
That means a DVD - quality film would take more than two hours to download – longer than it takes to watch it – compared to just over an hour at the faster speed .
Fewer than one in 10 households on an up to 8 Mb service get over 6 Mb and no one can ever receive the full speed because of the way the internet service providers ( ISPs ) run their networks , the report said .
The average speed for all broadband connections in the UK , according to Ofcom , is just 4.1 Mb .
That doubles the time it takes to download a music track – 10 seconds as opposed to 5 seconds at the fast rate .
The lower speeds have led to a flurry of complaints from consumers .
More than one in five of those surveyed by Ofcom expressed dissatisfaction with the speed they are getting while 26 % said they did not get the speed they expected to receive when they signed up .
The research comes after Gordon Brown recently said broadband internet access was as important to British homes as gas and electricity .
It also shows a wide disparity in the service from individual service providers : Tiscali and AOL , both owned by Carphone Warehouse 's TalkTalk , scored lowest on speed while Virgin Media 's comparable up to 10 Mb service was the fastest , not least because it uses different technology and its network only reaches half the country .
The survey , compiled by technology experts SamKnows and market research firm GfK , tracked the internet connections of more than 1,600 users over six months in a process that involved 60 m readings .
It also proves what many consumers have been complaining about for some time : during peak times internet connections are being slowed down .
Between 8 pm and 10 pm when many people are using video services such as the BBC 's iPlayer , the average speed of a top - of - the - range service slows by more than half .
Consumer groups have called for widespread changes to the advertising of broadband connections .
" There are some real questions to ask around the transparency of advertising in this industry , " said Matt Bath , technology editor at Which ?.
The Communications Consumer Panel , which advises Ofcom on consumer issues , has been pushing for advertising using claims of up - to speeds to be scrapped in favour of average speed , but has been frustrated by the lack of reliable data .
Its chair , Anna Bradley , believes the new Ofcom research could provide a fresh benchmark that will give consumers a much better idea of what they can expect before they sign on the dotted line .
" The Ofcom work is incredibly helpful because it exposes just how little the up - to speeds mean and exposes how variable the service level is from one provider to another , " she said .
" The fact that they are still advertised with ' up - to ' speeds is deeply problematic . "
But Ofcom 's Peter Phillips , said ISPs " are not lying to consumers .
If you are very close to the exchange you can get those speeds . "
Late last year the industry agreed a voluntary code of practice with Ofcom which has been signed by 50 of the UK 's biggest ISPs , accounting for 95 % of all internet connections .
It requires them to tell customers the maximum speed they can expect from their line , as speed is affected by distance from the local telephone exchange , and allow them to trade down if they cannot get the service they want .
Ofcom is currently undertaking a so - called " mystery shopper " exercise to ensure the code is working , but if consumers are being mis-sold , Ofcom could introduce a mandatory code of practice which the whole industry would be required to abide by and would include penalties .
BT has already attacked the report as " unreliable " because it used too few people , and as out of date because the company is migrating to new broadband technology .
TalkTalk , meanwhile , has pointed out that it is moving Tiscali customers on to its own network , which should improve their service .
A Virgin Media spokesman said : " It 's what customers get , not what their ISP claims , that counts . "

“ On Earth today , it ’s Thanksgiving .
If the crew has to eat
synthetic meat loaf , I want it to look like turkey . ”
A pioneering group of scientists are working to grow real animal protein in the laboratory , which they not only claim is better for animal welfare , but actually healthier , both for people and the planet .
It may sound like science fiction , but this technology to create in - vitro meat could be changing global diets within ten years .
“ Cultured meat would have a lot of advantages , ” said Jason Matheny of research group New Harvest .
“ We could precisely control the amount of fat in meat .
We could make ground beef with an ideal fatty acid ratio — a hamburger that prevents heart attacks instead of causing them . ”
But it is n’t just the possibility of creating designer ground beef with the fat profile of salmon that drives Matheny ’s work .
Meat and livestock farming is also the source of many human diseases , which he claims would be far less common when the product is raised in laboratory conditions .
“ We could reduce the risks of diseases like swine flu , avian flu , ‘ mad cow disease ’ , or contamination from Salmonella , ” he told CNN .
“ We could produce meat in sterile conditions that are impossible in conventional animal farms and slaughterhouses .
And when we grow only the meat we can eat , it ’s more efficient .
There ’s no need to grow the whole animal and lose 75 to 95 percent of what we feed it . ”
In this context Matheny believes his project could significantly cut the environmental impact of meat production — using much less water and producing far fewer greenhouse gases .
“ We could reduce the environmental footprint of meat , which currently contributes more to global warming than the entire transportation sector , ” says Matheny .
Between mediocre sci- fi movies and timorous vegetarians it will take an advertising campaign comparable to that which introduced the navel orange – or the hybrid automobile – coupled with lower prices to achieve any success .
Not that I ’m pressimistic – just cynical .
Just look at how many years we ’ve been farting around with irradiated food – always seeking another excuse to put off a cost effective solution to a great deal of food spoilage .
Diagnostic failures , or diagnoses that are delayed or in error , are an increasingly popular topic of research in patient safety .
While some researchers have focused on the role of doctors  are there flaws in the way they think ?
are “ gut reactions ” reliable ?
 others have looked at the steps involved in care , or the process of care .
What has emerged most recently from this latter group of studies is that diagnostic failures are often due to missed steps , so - called “ process of care lapses , ” that stem from both doctors and patients .
In the June issue of The Journal of General Internal Medicine , for example , investigators from Harvard Medical School studied the records of over 100 women with breast cancer diagnosed late or at advanced stages and found that roughly a quarter of patients had experienced process of care lapses .
Examples of such lapses included inadequate physical exams , delayed physician involvement and incomplete diagnostic and laboratory tests .
But while the investigators discovered that nearly 20 percent of the women were missing as many as two or more steps in their care , they also found that doctors and patients contributed equally to the resulting diagnostic failures .
“ Clearly we found that about half of the process failures were due to something the patient did , ” said Dr. Saul N. Weingart , lead author of the study and a practicing internist and vice - president of Quality Improvement and Patient Safety at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston .
“ These patients missed their mammogram appointments or never went to see the specialists their primary care physicians had recommended . ”
To address these lapses , experts in the field of patient safety like Dr. Weingart have proposed a variety of strategies to strengthen patient follow - up .
One strategy that many physicians already use in one form or another is a “ tickler system , ” electronic or paper reminders to check that diagnostic testing or referrals are completed .
Other ways include implementing a type of technology that allows physicians to check specific tests across their entire practice , or panel , on a monthly basis .
With “ the push of a button , ” a doctor can see which patients have not yet followed through , for example , on their mammogram appointments .
And perhaps just as important as any technological change is one that involves transforming deep - rooted practice patterns .
“ It ’s not part of practices now , ” Dr. Weingart said , “ but you can imagine creating an expectation among the medical community where if patients do n’t go , the referring doctors or practices will notify you . ”
But there are hidden obstacles in care as well .
When Dr. Weingart and his co-investigators looked more closely at the group of individuals who had experienced lapses , they found that many were patients who were particularly vulnerable : they were minorities , possessed less education and came from challenging socioeconomic backgrounds , all of which contributed to practical obstacles or poor health literacy .
These findings “ suggest that there are some intangible barriers , ” Dr. Weingart remarked .
“ Perhaps these patients do n’t know how to access care , need an interpreter , live farther away , or may be overwhelmed by family responsibilities .
All of these factors are distractions for a patient and make getting care all that much harder . ”
Last month , Drug War Chronicle reported that cannabusinessman and dispensary operator Richard Lee , creator of Oaksterdam and founder of Oaksterdam University , had assembled a team of activists , attorneys , political consultants and signature - gathering pros for an initiative to tax and regulate marijuana in California they hoped to place on the November 2010 election ballot .
Drug reform organizations were apprehensive , however , worrying the proposed initiative was too soon , the polling numbers were n't high enough , and that a loss could take the steam out of the legalization push for years to come .
Is reefer madness ( e.g. marijuana prohibition ) winding down ?
Lee has pushed forward , such concerns notwithstanding ; on Monday he and Oakland medical marijuana pioneer Jeff Jones filed the Regulate , Control , and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010
And then there were two .
On July 15 -- two weeks prior , but with less heraldry -- a trio of NORML - affiliated Northern California attorneys filed the Tax , Regulate , and Control Cannabis Act of 2010 .
To avoid confusion , we 'll refer to the second as the Omar Figueroa initiative ( coauthored by Joe Rogoway and James Clark ) and the first as the Richard Lee initiative .
" Cannabis prohibition , like alcohol prohibition , is an expensive and ineffective waste of taxpayer money , " said Figueroa .
" California 's laws criminalizing cannabis have failed and need to be reformed , " said Lee .
" Cannabis is safer than alcohol .
Cannabis does n't cause overdose deaths or make people violent like alcohol .
It makes sense to regulate cannabis like alcohol , instead of prohibiting it completely . "
The Figueroa initiative is broader and would bring complete legalization under state law , while the Lee initiative would create semi-legalization , allowing adults to possess up to one ounce and grow their own in a 5 ' x 5 ' garden space .
The Figueroa initiative would allow the state of California to tax marijuana sales , while the Lee initiative would allow cities and counties to tax marijuana sales .
The Figueroa initiative would end marijuana prohibition statewide , while the Lee initiative would give cities and counties the local option to tax and regulate or not , but would also provide that people could still possess and grow the specified amounts even in locales that opt out of regulating .
" Our initiative repeals cannabis prohibition ; Richard 's just narrows the scope , " said Figueroa , a San Francisco attorney specializing in medical marijuana and marijuana cultivation cases .
" People would not be free to possess more than one ounce and there would be limitations on growing your own .
And our initiative is going to have that big economic impact statement for the state budget that Richard 's will not , " he said .
" We worked for many weeks with Richard on his initiative , and we support both , but we think ours would result in more far - reaching change and would generate money for the state through tax revenues , " Figueroa added .
" We want to stimulate debate and provide an alternative to Richard 's initiative , which we do n't think would create enough change . "
The initiative effort is moving forward and preparing to begin signature - gathering , said Figueroa , but its prospects are iffy .
" We do n't have the deep pockets Richard has , " he said .
Lee has signed a $ 1.05 million contract with a signature - gathering organization and says he has already raised half of that sum .
" We are confident we will be on the ballot , " he said .
" Then we need to raise another $ 10 to $ 20 million to win , depending on the opposition . "
The initiatives come as the noise level around marijuana legalization in California grows ever louder .
An April Field poll put support for legalization at 56 % .
Gov. Schwarzenegger said this year that the issue should be discussed , and the state Board of Equalization 's estimate that legalization could generate $ 1.4 billion in revenue for the state has generated considerable interest .
That estimate was a response to a bill before the legislature , Rep. Tom Ammiano's AB 390 , which would legalize marijuana and allow the state to tax it .
Meanwhile , voters in Oakland last week overwhelmingly supported a special dispensary tax , another Richard Lee effort .
And now the Los Angeles city council is considering doing the same thing .
The Figueroa initiative would appear to have more appeal to hard - core marijuana legalizers , but the Lee initiative has more money behind it and is more likely to actually make it to the ballot .
That is making the Lee initiative the subject of more discussion as to its likelihood of passage .
That discussion in turn has opened a window on just how complex the issues around legalization are , how difficult it is to create a " perfect " legalization initiative , and how difficult it is to decide if this is the time to act or whether it would be premature .
The major national marijuana and drug reform groups are generally skeptical that a legalization initiative can win in California in 2010 .
They also worry about the impact of a defeat on the movement .
" We 're concerned about the timing and we 're not sure it 's the best worded initiative , " said Dan Bernath , assistant communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project .
" It is getting the conversation about marijuana policy reform going , but we 're concerned it could set the movement back if it loses .
We 're more interested in Ammiano 's bill , " he said .
" We would like [ the Lee initiative ] to win , " said Steven Gutwillig , California State Director for the Drug Policy Alliance , whose funding of Proposition 215 helped make medical marijuana legal in the state , " and we 're not that concerned that losing would be an enormous setback to the movement unless it really loses big .
We are looking to end marijuana prohibition as quickly and effectively as possible , and if this is the way to do it , we 're all for it . "
But unlike the Prop. 215 effort , DPA will be cheering from the sidelines .
" We 're not an official proponent of this and we 're not in a position to fund a campaign of this scale anytime soon , " said Gutwillig .
" We 're still relatively fresh from the $ 7.5 million campaign to pass Proposition 5 sentencing reforms , which did n't go the right way . "
Lee is optimistic , and he thinks that now , rather than 2012 as others have suggested , is the time .
" We have poll numbers that show a majority , and we have the terrible economy working for us , " he said .
Lee pointed to the budgetary crisis afflicting California cities and counties , which lost big in the latest state budget .
" The governor and legislature stole a bunch of money from the cities and counties , and this could help them recoup some of the money they 're losing , " Lee argued .
Dale Gieringer , head of California NORML , worries the lack of a provision for taxation directly by the state will hurt the initiative at the polls , even if the potential revenues for counties and cities are equivalent .
" The state always writes a financial analysis on initiatives , and I suspect this one will say uncertain or none . "
Gieringer pointed to the Board of Equalization 's $ 1.4 billion estimate .
" The tax benefits make this a sexy issue , and sacrificing that sacrifices most of the appeal of legalization to non-users . "
Still , if it 's happening , CANORML will support it .
" We support anything that improves the marijuana laws , " said Gieringer .
" There is a lot of enthusiasm right now , and people want to do something for legalization . "
" Omar Figueroa and Richard Lee are both pushing the envelope , " said national NORML head Allen St. Pierre , who was more sanguine about the effort than MPP or DPA , though only slightly .
" These initiatives are a good thing ; I just do n't know if they will be successful .
Even if they are n't , they will move the ball forward on the public discussion of the issue .
When we have public discussions about reform , the longer and deeper the discussion , the more it breaks toward reform . "
The Lee initiative in particular is a harbinger of things to come and demonstrates changing dynamics within the California marijuana reform movement , said St. Pierre .
" What is really changing drastically is that this will be driven by cannabusinesses ' ability to raise and spend money , not by one or two elite wealthy people whose stake in this is magnitudes less than say , Richard Lee , who has created Oaksterdam . "
There is another reason for the local option , said Lee .
" It gets us around federal law .
We do n't have any other way until federal law changes because the state would be in conflict with federal law .
But we had cities taxing medical marijuana outlets ; that 's why we wrote it that way . "
Will the competing initiatives both make it to the ballot ?
If they do , can they win ?
Will it fly in Fresno ?
Will the threat of an initiative spur the legislature to act on the Ammiano legalization bill ?
Stay tuned .
It looks like very interesting times are ahead .

To fully appreciate and understand the hurdles we voluntaryists face in imparting the rational truth about government to the general public , observe this particular spectacle : an excerpt from an article written by Leon Wieseltier , titled ' Washington Diarist : Love Me I'm a Liberal , ' published in the March 4 , 2009 edition of The New Republic :
' I want the president to tell the American people that , contrary to what they have been taught for many years , government is a jewel of human association and an heirloom of human reason ; that government , though it may do ill , does good ; that a lot of the good that government does only it can do ; that the size of government must be fitted to the size of its tasks , and so , for a polity such as ours , big government is the only government ; that strong government comports well with strong freedom , unless Madison was wrong ; that a government based on rights cannot exclude from its concern the adversities of the people who confer upon it its legitimacy , or consign their remediation to the charitable moods of a preferred and decadent few ; that Ronald Reagan , when he proclaimed that ' government is not the solution to the problem , government is the problem , ' was a fool ; and that nobody was ever rescued , or enlarged , by being left alone .
For all its grotesqueness , American government is a beautiful thing . '
Leon , your ' jewel ' is violence , that heirloom is of a sick mind , and Madison was wrong ' very , very wrong .
There are no such things as ' rights , ' not really , and no amount of people , realistically , can ever confer one shred of legitimacy upon the monstrosity whose alleged virtues you choose to extol .
Ronald Reagan , I agree , was in many and varied ways a fool ' but I 'd still , for all of that , rather not be ' rescued ' or ' enlarged ' by you or anyone else .
I prefer ' hell , demand ' to be left alone .
Dig it ?
And nothing grotesque is ever beautiful .
Your entire thought processes Leon , in spite of the flowery prose , are distortions .
They 're backwards , Orwellian .
They make Bavarian pretzels look like slide rules .
Such thinking is what has brought us to this sorry fix ; this downward spiral that is increasingly tantamount to the total destruction of everything that has ever made life worth living .
We 're just a hair 's breadth away from the cattle cars and concentration camps .
Then apocalypse .
This is where Wieseltier wants to take us , whether he realizes it or not .
Dogma has made him blind , and as such , he 's now incapable of living with logic .
He 's a creature of pure scatalogical emotion .
Dangerous .
Deadly .
This is by no means limited to crackpot , authoritarian - minded journalists .
In a recent speech about torture and mistreatment of combat detainees in Amerikan custody , given by Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy before a congressional subcommittee , and published in the May 14 , 2009 Rutland Herald titled , ' What Went Wrong ? ' , the good Senator said :
' Most importantly , we need to re-establish the trust of the American people in their government .
They deserve to know and understand what happened and why so that we can do our best to ensure that we do not make the same tragic mistakes , again . '
Well Leahy , as to the first sentence in the above quote , when engaging anyone who has even the slightest inkling of anything that 's actually going on , you 've got one motherfucker of a task in front of you .
I 'd say you 're at least several decades too late to be ideating about that .
There 's not a single reason anywhere to be found why anyone in their right mind should trust you , or any of your thieving , murdering cohorts .
To believe there is only reveals in stark obscenity your visceral arrogance .
You , and those of your bureaucratic ilk , possess poisoned minds .
You are diseased , infected , and as feral as the blackest and most sinister of all possible vampires .
I am , however , quite interested in exploring the second sentence in your quote :
' They deserve to know and understand what happened and why so that we can do our best to ensure that we do not make the same tragic mistakes , again . '
If you had been talking about the American people in relation to the government that was first formed by a group of short - sighted presumptuous fools in 1776 ( the mere shadow of which you are currently a part ) , then you'd be doing a rare and wondrous thing ' for a politician .
You'd be exercising logic , and telling the truth .

complete list of Linux Laptops on Amazon.de
[ 23- Jul - 2009 - art - Linux_Laptops_Bestsellers_in_Germany ]
A look at the current ( 23rd July 2009 ) Amazon.de ( Germany ) Laptop / Notebook bestsellers list will be a nice surprise for any desktop Linux advocate and possibly a worry for Microsoft and Apple sales executives .
At the time of writing there are two laptops with pre-installed Linux in the top ten bestsellers , both in front of the first best selling Apple laptop .
In second position we have the Asus X5DIJ - SX018L Linux laptop , a Pentium Dual - Core laptop with 2GB of RAM , a 250 GB hard disk , DVD writer and 15.6 " screen , while a few positions below ( fourth ) we have the brand new , very keenly priced Acer Extensa 5235 - 571G16N
Linux laptop which we wrote about the other day .
The first best selling Apple laptop appears only several positions below .
Exact positions occasionally fluctuate slightly as the Amazon bestseller list is updated hourly , but the fact that two Linux laptops are in the top ten is quite remarkable in our opinion .
To put this into perspective , when looking at the Amazon.
co.uk Laptop bestsellers list or the Amazon.com Laptop bestsellers list we did n't find a single Linux laptop anywhere , in any position .
After last year 's boom of Linux netbooks ( which has apparently been effectively squashed by Microsoft ) , is this another temporary fad , or is this a sign that no matter what Microsoft does , they can't keep Linux from conquering more and more of their OS market share ?
Only time will tell .

It will come as no surprise to anyone who 's taken a road trip with a member of the opposite sex that men and women navigate differently .
Now a new study shows that they even use in - car navigation systems differently .
The differences start before purchase .
Both men and women are equally aware of navigation systems ( at 90 percent each in the groups surveyed by Navteq ) , but the single greatest source of information for women was word of mouth .
For men , it 's the media .
Women use features built into their navigation systems , like traffic warnings and Point - of - Interest maps , far less than men do .
Almost 39 percent of women " never " use the traffic feature , for instance ; the figure for men is just 10 percent .
Perhaps as a result , they are significantly less satisfied with the performance of their systems .
Asked if they are " extremely " or " very " satisified with their navigation systems , 80 percent of men said yes .
Only 60 percent of women responded the same way .
We suspect the men are more satisfied simply because , at last , they need n't suffer the humiliation and misery of having to respond to repeated suggestions that we simply stop and ask someone fer crissakes .
Is that a ridiculous stereotype ?
Somehow , we do n't think so .

What ’s behind the recent unrest ?
A concerted campaign by Beijing to assert control over a restive region that for centuries was dominated by the Uighurs ( pronounced WEE - gurs ) , Turkic - speaking Muslims who migrated from Mongolia .
Since the 10th century , the Uighurs have lived in and around the Tarim Basin , a vast , mountain - bound depression in northwest China bordering Tibet .
The region ’s rugged , arid terrain is so inhospitable that it was one of the last areas on earth to be settled .
Historically , the Uighurs were money - changers and merchants who operated along the Silk Road , the legendary trading route between Asia and Europe .
But today , most of them — about 10 million — live a harsh , uncertain existence in what is now Xinjiang , about 2,000 miles from Beijing .
Last month , China ’s worst unrest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre left some 200 people in Xinjiang dead and more than 1,000 injured .
The killings were the latest result of longstanding ethnic tensions between the Uighurs and the Han , the ethnic group that makes up 92 percent of China ’s population .
What happened ?
The trouble began in late June , when a false rumor that Uighur men had raped some Han women sparked a melee involving hundreds of Han and Uighurs , who attacked each other with knives and metal pipes .
Two Uighurs died .
In response , several hundred Uighurs gathered for a protest march in Xinjiang ’s capital city of Urumqi , during which Uighurs torched cars and shattered store windows with stones .
Thousands of Han fought back with hammers , baseball bats , and pool cues , yelling , “ Kill the Uighurs ! Kill all Uighurs ! ”
There were reports of police standing by while Uighurs were savagely beaten , and many bodies were burned beyond recognition .
Police eventually brought the riot under control , but the situation remains tense .
Why are Uighurs under assault ?
Beijing wants the Han to control the political and economic levers of Xinjiang , which boasts rich mineral , gas , and oil deposits .
Toward that end , Beijing has been systematically crushing Uighur culture — banning the language from schools , forbidding Uighurs from wearing beards and head scarves , and razing large sections of their cities to make way for modern developments .
Beijing has also been resettling millions of Han in Xinjiang while moving Uighurs to other areas throughout China — where , the government says , they have better opportunities .
Only the Han in Xinjiang receive government perks such as health insurance , housing , and free transportation .
Within a few hundred yards of the steel - and - glass towers where many Han live and work , Uighurs dwell in mud - brick homes without running water or sewers .
“ We all feel the difference , ” said Ashan Saidi , who recently lost his job as a street cleaner .
“ There are seven people in my family .
We want to buy an apartment , but we ca n’t afford it . ”
When did this conflict start ?
Its roots extend back to about 1760 in the Qing Dynasty , when China annexed Xinjiang .
There were periodic conflicts over the next two centuries , but the region was largely left alone because it was so remote .
In 1944 , the Uighurs declared Xinjiang ’s independence , renaming it East Turkestan — a name that Uighurs still use .
But when Mao Tse - tung ’s Communists took power in 1949 , they regained control of Xinjiang and began resettling large numbers of soldiers there .
A second wave of repression occurred in the 1990s , following the breakup of the Soviet Union .
Fearful that Xinjiang might get separatist notions of its own , Beijing began labeling Uighurs traitors and terrorists .
Violence has flared every few years since then , with the central government cracking down hard .
Are the Uighurs separatists ?
Some of them are .
Whenever blood is spilled in Xinjiang , the state - run media usually pins the blame on what it depicts as sinister forces bent on insurrection .
Their favorite target is the World Uighur Congress , an umbrella group of expatriates .
There ’s also the East Turkestan Islamic Movement , which wants to create an independent Islamic state of East Turkestan .
The ETIM reportedly has links to al Qaida and has been labeled a terrorist group by both Beijing and Washington .
Many Uighurs , though , simply want to be left alone , free to practice their religion and maintain their way of life in their own homeland .
Is that likely ?
No .
The Uighurs ’ future appears grim .
Unlike the Buddhist Tibetans , the Uighurs have yet to command the world ’s sympathy , in part because they lack a charismatic , globe - trotting , multilingual leader like the Dalai Lama .
Some Muslim nations are protesting China ’s treatment of the Uighurs — Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has called it “ a kind of genocide ” — but the Western response has been muted .
President Obama urged both sides in Xinjiang “ to exercise restraint , ” while the European Union declared that the Urumqi massacre was “ a Chinese issue , not a European issue . ”
World Uighur Congress President Rebiya Kadeer , who now lives in Virginia , has been trying to generate support for her people .
“ Only if the world pays the same attention to Uighurs as to Tibet and Darfur , ” she said through a translator , “ is there a chance for this to change . ”
The Uighurs of Guantánamo
Most Americans had never heard of Uighurs until earlier this year , when a small group of them became embroiled in a drama at the U.S. military prison at Guantánamo Bay .
The saga of the Guantánamo Uighurs actually began soon after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan , in 2001 , when Pakistani bounty hunters turned over 22 Uighurs to the U.S.
The Uighurs claimed they were in Afghanistan to receive military training in the fight for their people ’s “ liberation , ” not to fight Americans .
After keeping them in Guantánamo for years , the Bush administration determined they were neither enemy combatants nor security risks and , in 2006 , released five to Albania .
A federal judge ordered that the remaining 17 be freed , and in June the Obama administration released four more to Bermuda .
The fate of the remaining 13 remains unclear .
Congress voted overwhelmingly to prohibit any Guantánamo detainees from being resettled in the U.S. , and most countries do n’t want them out of fear of offending China .
The Pacific island of Palau recently said it would take the Uighurs , though no formal offer has been made .
The U.S. has promised Palau an additional $ 200 million in development aid .

Iran 's supreme leader has issued a stern warning that protests against the country 's disputed presidential election results must end .
In his first public remarks after days of protests , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the outcome had to be decided at the ballot box , not on the street .
He said political leaders would be blamed for any violence .
US President Barack Obama said the Iranian government should be aware that " the world is watching " .
Demonstrators calling for a new election earlier vowed to stage fresh protests on Saturday .
But the governor of Tehran province , Morteza Tamadon , has said no permission has been given for such a rally and he hoped it would not be held .
Chants of support Addressing huge crowds at Tehran University , the ayatollah voiced support for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , saying the president 's views on foreign affairs and social issues were close to his .
LATEST FROM TEHRAN Marcus George Very robust words indeed from the Supreme Leader .
Ayatollah Khamenei said the election results are fine and there 's no way that any vote rigging could have happened in this nation .
That would be treacherous , he said .
He has effectively endorsed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's landslide win .
He said it just is n't possible to have vote rigging here .
In the meantime , he has told Western nations " keep your nose out of our business , these are domestic affairs you are meddling in and you are responsible for the allegations of vote rigging to begin with " .
Mr Ahmadinejad was among the thousands of people who packed the campus and surrounding streets , punctuating the ayatollah 's speech with chants .
Responding to allegations of electoral fraud , the ayatollah insisted the Islamic Republic would not cheat .
" There is 11 million votes difference , " the ayatollah said .
" How can one rig 11 million votes ? "
He appealed to candidates who had doubts about the election result to pursue any challenges through legal avenues .
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne says that Ayatollah Khamenei appears to have staked everything on this election result and Mr Ahmadinejad .
It all points to heavy crackdowns if the protests continue , our correspondent says .
UK summons
In his highly anticipated address after Friday prayers , the ayatollah said despite differences of opinion among the presidential candidates , they were all trustworthy and loyal to the Islamic Republic .
He said the election was a " political earthquake " for Iran 's enemies - singling out Britain as " the most evil of them " - whom he accused of trying to foment unrest in the country .
" Some of our enemies in different parts of the world intended to depict this absolute victory , this definitive victory , as a doubtful victory , " the supreme leader said .
Some of our enemies ... intended to depict this absolute victory , this definitive victory , as a doubtful victory
Ayatollah Khamenei
Profile : Ayatollah Khamenei Protest at ' evil UK ' comment Iran 's internet dilemma Khamenei speech : Iran reaction The UK government summoned the Iranian ambassador to protest against the ayatollah 's remarks , although the embassy sent a more junior diplomat in his place .
In Washington , the House of Representatives voted 405 - 1 for a statement supporting democratic and fair elections , condemning the " ongoing violence " and the Iranian government 's " suppression of independent electronic communications through interference with the internet and cell phones . "
President Obama later told US broadcaster CBS : " I 'm very concerned based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made , that the government of Iran recognise that the world is watching .
" And how they approach and deal with people who are , through peaceful means , trying to be heard will , I think , send a pretty clear signal to the international community about what Iran is and is not . "
Amnesty International said it was " extremely disturbed " by the speech , saying that it indicated the " authorities ' readiness to launch violent crackdowns if people continue to protest " .
Amnesty says its reports suggest that up to 10 protesters have been killed in clashes with security forces and plain - clothed militias .
It was revising its earlier report of 15 dead but said that at least four students were still unaccounted for after an attack on a Tehran University dormitory .
Iran has seen repeated opposition rallies since the presidential result was declared last Saturday .
More than 100,000 people took to the streets of Tehran on Thursday in a " day of mourning " for eight protesters killed in the capital on Monday by members of the pro-government Basij volunteer militia .
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has expressed concern at the number of arrests of opposition supporters and urged the government to rein in the militias .
Defeated candidates
The official results gave Mr Ahmadinejad 63 % of the vote against 34 % for his main election rival , Mir Hossein Mousavi .
Defeated candidate Mehdi Karroubi has joined calls for the election to be declared void .
In an open letter to the electoral authorities , he wrote : " By deciding fairly to cancel the election and hold it again , you would be accepting the nation 's will and guaranteeing the permanence of the system . "
The Guardian Council - Iran 's main electoral authority - has invited Mr Mousavi , Mr Karroubi and the other defeated candidate to discuss their objections on Saturday .

Former vice president Dick Cheney has responded to the Monday release of new CIA documents , showing abuse , mismanagement and potential criminal violations in the harsh interrogation program that he approved .
He offers a striking statement for three reasons .
But first a look at what Cheney says :
The documents released Monday clearly demonstrate that the individuals subjected to Enhanced Interrogation Techniques provided the bulk of intelligence we gained about al Qaeda .
This intelligence saved lives and prevented terrorist attacks .
These detainees also , according to the documents , played a role in nearly every capture of al Qaeda members and associates since 2002 .
The activities of the CIA in carrying out the policies of the Bush Administration were directly responsible for defeating all efforts by al Qaeda to launch further mass casualty attacks against the United States .
The people involved deserve our gratitude .
They do not deserve to be the targets of political investigations or prosecutions .
President Obama ’s decision to allow the Justice Department to investigate and possibly prosecute CIA personnel , and his decision to remove authority for interrogation from the CIA to the White House , serves as a reminder , if any were needed , of why so many Americans have doubts about this Administration ’s ability to be responsible for our nation ’s security .
So what is surprising ?
First ,
Cheney does not mention the claim , which he has made elsewhere , that the use of enhanced interrogation techniques produced information that saved lives .
Rather , he claims only that “ individuals subjected to Enhanced Interrogation Techniques provided the bulk of intelligence we gained about al Qaeda . ”
This statement is neither in dispute , nor much of a revelation .
The enhanced techniques , when they were used as designed and not by rogue agents without proper supervision , were employed on a select few detainees who knew a lot about al Qaeda .
The outstanding question is whether the enhanced techniques were necessary to produce the information , and on that score the memos continue to paint a muddy picture , as TIME ’s Bobby Ghosh explains today in this piece .
In fact , the CIA IG concludes that measuring the effectiveness of the harsh techniques is a “ subjective ” task , with no clear result .
[ Update on Wednesdsay : Yesterday , after I published this post , Ben Smith reported that a “ person close to Cheney ” was reporting that the careful language was not symbolic of a shift in Cheney ’s position .
I contacted a spokesperson for Cheney to confirm this , and received this emailed statement this morning : “ Vice President Cheney believes that the newly released documents show that employing the EITs [ Enhanced Interrogation Techniques ] led to the release of new information that saved lives . ”
I will write another post on this issue in the coming days . ]
The second surprise concerns Cheney ’s decision not to directly address two other memos that the CIA released Monday .
Back in April , in an appearance on Sean Hannity ’s Fox News program , Cheney was asked “ Why were those tactics [ waterboarding , sleep deprivation , insects ] needed , necessary , and why do you think they continue to be necessary ? ”
In his answer , Cheney said there were classified memos held by the CIA that would answer the question :
And there are reports that show specifically what we gained as a result of this activity .
They have not been declassified .
I formally asked that they be declassified now .
I have n’t announced this up until now , I have n’t talked about it , but I know specifically of reports that I read , that I saw that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country .
And I ’ve now formally asked the CIA to take steps to declassify those memos so we can lay them out there and the American people have a chance to see what we obtained and what we learned and how good the intelligence was , as well as to see this debate over the legal opinions .
These memos soon became a cause celeb for conservatives , who accused the Obama Administration of withholding key evidence showing the effectiveness of harsh interrogation .
Later , in a major speech on the issue of national security , Cheney charged that Obama was intentionally withholding the memos .
Said Cheney :
As far as the interrogations are concerned , all that remains an official secret is the information we gained as a result .
Some of his defenders say the unseen memos are inconclusive , which only raises the question why they wo n’t let the American people decide that for themselves .
But now that the memos have been released –with redactions –they provide no clarity to the question Cheney claimed they would answer :
Did the enhanced techniques produce results ?
Rather the two memos describe the value of information provided by Al Qaeda detainees , which one memo calls a “ crucial pillar of counterterrorism efforts . ”
The memos , as redacted , are silent on the role of harsh interrogation in producing that information .
One memo describes another effective technique–dubbed the “ building block ” process –that dd produce significant information .
This process is an standard technique , of confronting one detainee with information from another detainee to produce more information .
It does not involve any physical coercion .
Does Cheney want other parts of the same memo , which were redacted in the latest release , made public ?
It is unclear .
The third surprise in Cheney ’s statement is the blanket praise he offers to CIA employees and contractors , even , apparently , those who violated the Bush Administration ’s own guidance .
“ The people involved deserve our gratitude , ” Cheney writes .
“ They do not deserve to be the targets of political investigations or prosecutions . ”
The CIA IG report reveals a number of instances where CIA employees disobeyed the rather precise instructions of the Bush Administration and the Department of Justice .
These are the only cases that Attorney General Holder has said he wants to pursue further .
For instance , the Justice Department never gave permission to a CIA contractor to beat a detainee to death with a flashlight , an incident that is alleged in the report .
And yet , in his statement , Cheney characterizes such investigations as “ political investigations and prosecutions . ”
wow !
really good point , the more I think about it the more I see where you are coming from .
I am no expert , but if what you are saying can be proven , you will really have an impact on the sciences .
I 'd pursue this a little more , I am not sure if this this Einstein quality , but keep in mind when he first introduced his ecm = 2 , people thought he was crazy .
Best of luck !
An oligopoly is an economic condition in which there are so few independent suppliers of a particular product that competitive pricing does not take place .
Oligopoly is a form of market where there is domination of a limited number of suppliers and sellers called Oligopolists .
A situation in which a particular market is controlled by a small group of firms .
An oligopoly is much like a monopoly , in which only one company exerts control over most of a market .
In an oligopoly , there are at least two firms controlling the market .
An oligopoly is a market dominated by a few large suppliers .
The degree of market concentration is very high .
Firms within an oligopoly produce branded products and there are also barriers to entry .
Another important characteristic of an oligopoly is interdependence between firms .
This means that each firm must take into account the likely reactions of other firms in the market when making pricing and investment decisions .
This creates uncertainty in such markets - which economists seek to model through the use of game theory .
The retail gas market is a good example of an oligopoly because a small number of firms control a large majority of the market .
Economics is much like a game in which the players anticipate one another 's moves .
Game theory can also be applied in this situations as if decision makers must take into account the reasoning of other decision makers .
It has been used , for example , to determine the formation of political coalitions or business conglomerates , the optimum price at which to sell products or services , the best site for a manufacturing plant , and even the behavior of certain species in the struggle for survival .
The ongoing interdependence between businesses can lead to implicit and explicit collusion between the major firms in the market .
Collusion occurs when businesses agree to act as if they were in a monopoly position .
KEY FEATURES OF OLIGOPOLY - A few firms selling similar product - Each firm produces branded products - Likely to be significant entry barriers into the market in the long run which allows firms to make supernormal profits .
- Interdependence between competing firms .
Businesses have to take into account likely reactions of rivals to any change in price and output THEORIES ABOUT OLIGOPOLY PRICING
There are four major theories about oligopoly pricing : ( 1 ) Oligopoly firms collaborate to charge the monopoly price and get monopoly profits ( 2 ) Oligopoly firms compete on price so that price and profits will be the same as a competitive industry ( 3 ) Oligopoly price and profits will be between the monopoly and competitive ends of the scale ( 4 ) Oligopoly prices and profits are " indeterminate " because of the difficulties in modelling interdependent price and output decisions Distinct features of an oligopolistic market : - An oligopolistic market comprises a handful of firms , engaged in selling analogous products - All oligopolistic markets increase mutual dependence among the firms involved in similar competition .
It also prepares businessmen to accept the outcomes arising from rivalries with respect to alterations in the production and prices of goods .
-
In near future , an oligopolistic market is likely to impose restrictions on admission , in an attempt to incur abnormal profits .
- Each of the business houses involved with this market produces branded goods THE IMPORTANCE OF PRICE AND NON - PRICE COMPETITION
Firms compete for market share and the demand from consumers in lots of ways .
We make an important distinction between price competition and non-price competition .
Price competition can involve discounting the price of a product ( or a range of products ) to increase demand .
Non-price competition focuses on other strategies for increasing market share .
Consider the example of the highly competitive UK supermarket industry where non-price competition has become very important in the battle for sales - Mass media advertising and marketing - Store Loyalty cards - Banking and other Financial Services ( including travel insurance ) -
In - store chemists / post offices / creches - Home delivery systems - Discounted petrol at hyper - markets - Extension of opening hours ( 24 hour shopping in many stores ) - Innovative use of technology for shoppers including self - scanning machines - Financial incentives to shop at off - peak times - Internet shopping for customers Price leadership : Oligopolistic market
The dominance of one firm in the oligopolistic market results in price leadership .
Firms having less market shares only follow the prices fixed by leaders .
Oligopolistic competition : Effects - Oligopolistic competition in most cases leads to collaboration of the business firms on issues like raising the prices of various goods and subdue production process .
-
Under other given market conditions , the competition between the sellers acquires a violent form , on the grounds of lowering the prices and increasing the production .
- Collaboration of various firms also brings about stabilization in the unsteady markets .
PRICE LEADERSHIP IN OLIGOPOLISTIC MARKETS
When one firm has a dominant position in the market the oligopoly may experience price leadership .
The firms with lower market shares may simply follow the pricing changes prompted by the dominant firms .
We see examples of this with the major mortgage lenders and petrol retailers .
In reality , it is the Oligopoly market which exists , having a high degree of market concentration .
This indicates that a huge percentage of the Oligopoly market is occupied by the leading commercial firms of a country .
These firms require strategic planning to consider the reactions of other participants existing in the market .
This is precisely why an oligopolistic market is subject to greater risk of connivances .
By : Schafaq Chohan
An oligopoly is a market form in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of sellers .
Barriers to entry are high .
Essentially the technique converts the first factor into binary , multiplies each of its constituents by the second factor , and sums the results .
Imagine that each line is associated with a power of 2 : the first line with 20 , the second with 21 , and so on .
The business in the first column , halving the first factor successively and crossing out those lines with even numbers , effectively reduces the first factor to its binary constituents — here , the lines that remain are those associated with 20 , 25 , and 26 , and , sure enough , 20 + 25 + 26 = 97 .
Now we need to multiply each of those constituents by the second factor , 23 .
In other words , we want to find :
( 23 × 20 ) + ( 23 × 25 ) + ( 23 × 26 )
That ’s what ’s accomplished in the second column .
Doubling the second factor successively , as we ’ve done there , is equivalent to multiplying it by 20 in the first line , by 21 in the second , and so on .
That is , 23 = 23 × 20 , 46 = 23 × 21 , etc .
And the lines that have n’t been crossed out are precisely the ones we want :
23 (= 23 × 20 )
736 (= 23 × 25 )
1472 (= 23 × 26 )
So if we add those values , we ’ll get the product of the original two numbers , which is what we sought : 23 + 736 + 1472 = 2231 .
Here ’s essentially what we ’ve done , from the top :
97 × 23
= ( 20 + 25 + 26 ) × 23
= ( 23 × 20 ) + ( 23 × 25 ) + ( 23 × 26 )
= 23 + 736 + 1472
= 2231
It works with any pair of numbers .

The speculation can finally come an end .
From tomorrow the Xbox 360 Elite 120GB will cost 199.99 in the UK – that ’s a drop of 30 from the current RRP .
And as expected , the price of the Xbox 360 Arcade has increased by the same amount to 159.99 , though Microsoft has not yet clarified whether the machine will come with any additional extras .
The Xbox 360 Pro SKU is to be phased out .
In North America , the Pro is to be discounted by $ 50 to $ 250 for as long as stocks last .
Both price changes come into force from tomorrow ( Friday August 28th ) – a move that will see the reduced price Elite given a bank holiday weekend head - start ahead of the launch of PS3 Slim next Tuesday .
In North America the Elite has dropped to $ 299 whilst the Arcade price has remained static .
With the Christmas season right around the corner , it ’s already time to start looking for entertainment and gifts that everyone will enjoy , ” Microsoft Europe ’s Chris Lewis vice president Interactive Entertainment Business .
We have a goal over the next 18 months to reinvent entertainment in the living room and we want to ensure that we have the right foundations in place for our consumers to make simple informed choices around their entertainment platform .
We know that price is a critical influencing factor in consumer choice , but we also know that consumers across Europe are looking for value , benefit and entertainment experiences , so we need to address all these points to continue to grow and be successful in Europe . ”
HOLDENVILLE —
A man here said crews pulled up to the driveway of a home he owns , cut out a slab containing T. Boone Pickens ’ signature and drove off .
The roughly 3 - by - 5 - foot concrete slab was taken to the Pickens ranch in the Texas Panhandle .
" I was in shock and started talking to my neighbors .
I could n’t imagine who would actually come and cut my driveway out or when it had happened , ” David McCart said .
Pickens spokesman Jay Rosser said in a statement , " The small section of cement was removed recently when Boone was in town to inspect enhancements to a family plot at the Holdenville cemetery . ”
McCart said he ’s planning a lawsuit to get back the concrete signed by the billionaire oilman .
" Right now I ’m pursuing criminal charges against T. Boone Pickens , ” McCart said Monday .
" It will be for theft and vandalism . ”
Rosser , in his statement , said , " We are clearly open to any thoughts the McCarts might have regarding how to best commemorate his association there for their purposes . ”
Missing section
As a youngster , Pickens scratched his name in the cement driveway in 1946 at his grandmother ’s house , now owned by McCart .
Pickens has frequently checked on the house when he visited Oklahoma .
On June 22 , McCart stopped by the unoccupied house so he could mow .
He saw a hole where the signed concrete had been .
A neighbor and passersby said a large truck with Texas tags stopped at the two - story house four days earlier .
Three men with cement saws and pry bars cut out a chunk of cement and loaded it into the truck bed , McCart said he was told .
McCart called police and filed a report , he said .
Police Chief Jerry
Young did n’t return calls for comment .
Someone put new cement in the driveway after he reported the incident to police , McCart said .
McCart said he contacted Holdenville Daily News reporter Bob Melton to get photos of the signature .
It had been published in the paper with a 2008 story about Pickens ’ wife buying his childhood home , the one next to McCart ’s , and moving it to the 68,000 - acre Texas ranch for Pickens ’ birthday .
The paper then ran a story saying the historic piece of concrete had disappeared .
Rosser ’s e-mail continues , in part : " There is no one prouder of his Holdenville heritage than Boone .
He carved his name in that cement 70 years ago , in his grandmother ’s driveway .
" It means a lot to him , and is now with his childhood home , which has been carefully restored and relocated to his ranch in the Texas Panhandle to help commemorate his Oklahoma roots .
" He ’s pleased to learn that the neighborhood he grew up in and the cement markings were so popular in Holdenville . ”
McCart said Police Chief Young visited the property at 211 N Kelker , looked at the driveway and said the missing slab was between the sidewalk and street , so it was city property .
McCart contends the improvements — the driveway — made on the easement belongs to his family .
He said his family maintains it .
When Pickens bought his childhood home next to the McCart house , his workers wanted to move the house across his driveway .
The McCarts did n’t allow that for fear the concrete would crack , he said .
McCart said he bought the house 19 years ago , mainly because of Pickens ’ signature in the concrete .
The roller - coaster ride that has been the story of Midway Games in recent months is finally coasting to an end , one which seems to have calmed down with the $ 33 million sale of the company and its assets to Time Warner .
While much of Midway will continue to exist under the Time Warner banner , it 's been revealed that certain former assets ( like specific studios and franchises ) may not carry on unless another buyer is found for them .
One thing that many of us did n't think about , though , was the survivability of Midway 's name and logo , which seems like it may be destined to only live on in the history books .
According to Big Download , various members of what was Midway 's development studio have revealed that their office has now been renamed Warner Brothers Games Chicago .
No mention has been made about keeping the Midway Games logo with any of the recently - acquired studios , as it seems to be something that Warner is n't all that interested in .
When Joystiq talked to a company spokesperson about the future of the Midway name , they were told , " They [ WB ] bought the assets and the trademark and all the copyrights and the logo and all that ... to say the name is dead , it 's silly but , ya know , it 's premature the company Midway Games , Inc. still exists . "
This is true , as Midway Newcastle and San Diego are still around , but the studios will only stay open for a few more weeks unless they can find a buyer ; even then , it seems unlikely that either studio will keep the Midway name if they manage to get snapped up by someone else .
While it 's encouraging to see that many of Midway 's former employees are still reliably employed , it 's also a bit surreal knowing that the name and logo that 's been around for so long might not exist for too much longer .
Hopefully , the two remaining studios will be picked up by a publisher and ( even more hopefully ) get to keep their name in the process .
Jingoism Got Its Start in the 19th Century
Jingoism originated during the Russo - Turkish War of 1877 - 1878 , when many British citizens were hostile toward Russia and felt Britain should intervene in the conflict .
Supporters of the cause expressed their sentiments in a music - hall ditty with this refrain :
We do n't want to fight , yet by jingo if we do ,
We 've got the ships , we 've got the men ,
We 've got the money , too !
Someone holding the attitude implied in the song became known as a jingo or jingoist , and the attitude itself was dubbed jingoism .
The jingo in the tune is probably a euphemism for Jesus .
Spider with hummingbird
Hey Bugman ,
Like everybody else I love this site !!
I came home from work yesterday and saw this carnage outside my bedroom window .
I had been watching this Golden - Orb Weaver ( I call it the zig - zag spider ) for days but was shocked at the attached picture .
As I lifted the shade to get a better look at the female ruby throated hummingbird I also saw a poor cicada was also trapped in the spiders web .
Needless to say this spider will not be hungry for many days .
Just thought you might enjoy this picture .
Did n’t know if you had ever seen anything like this before .
This all took place in College Station , Texas .
Donell S. Frank
Hi Donell ,
We are a bit nervous to post your photos ( though that wo n’t stop us ) because we fear that they might bring about the demise of numerous Black and Yellow Orb Weavers , Argiope aurantia .
This is a most unusual catch for this regal spider , and we know that the nature loving public has a particular fondness for hummingbirds .
Nonetheless , this is quite an amazing documentation .
Thank you so much for sending the images our way .

The Wall Street Journal reports ( subscription required ) on research from Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Modoff showing that Apple and Research in Motion together accounted for approximately 35 % of the cellphone industry 's total operating profit in 2008 while only representing 3 % of total unit sales .
Apple 's share of industry profits clocked in at approximately 20 % while holding only just over 1 % of the unit market share .
The two companies ' outsize share of profits underlines the shift in the wireless industry toward feature - rich devices accenting easy - to - use software and away from an emphasis on hardware .
Smart phones account for only about 13 % of total cellphone sales globally , but the segment is growing , despite a drop in the broader cellphone market .
Apple and RIM had about 32 % of the smart - phone market between them in the first quarter , estimates IDC .
Moreover , Modoff estimates that Apple and Research in Motion will reach a combined 5 % of unit sales for 2009 , raking in roughly 58 % of the total industry profit between them .
The report notes that wireless carrier subsidies provide the driving force behind such large profits for leading smartphones such as Apple 's iPhone and Research in Motion 's BlackBerry lines .
Apple reportedly receives about $ 400 in carrier subsidy for each iPhone , while BlackBerry sees about $ 200 and the typical basic cellphone about $ 100 .
Among manufacturers dominating the basic cellphone market , only market leader Nokia is able to leverage its economies of scale to pull in a greater share of industry profits ( 55 % ) than its corresponding unit market share ( 46 % ) .
But even Nokia has seen its unit market share and profits slip as customers increasingly adopt more sophisticated smartphone models from smaller competitors .
Multiple sources tell us that Dash Snow — photographer , semen artist , graffiti writer , and embodiment of the downtown NYC scene — has apparently died of a heroin overdose , two years shy of his 30th birthday .
We got a tip this morning that Dash had overdosed last night .
Earsnot , a.k.a.
Kunle Irak , a fellow downtown artist and one of Dash 's best friends , posted this on his Twitter page this morning :
A separate source close to Dash confirmed to us this morning through an intermediary that Dash has died .
It 's already popping up on Twitter , as well .
We 'll let you know more details as we learn them .
( Snow 's gallery , Peres Projects in Berlin , is n't releasing a comment ) .
Dash Snow was most memorably profiled by Ariel Levy in New York magazine two years ago .
He and his friends came up in the downtown graffiti scene , and branched out to find success in the art world , without ever losing their bizarre , drug - addled edge .
What makes the legend richer is that Dash Snow could very easily have lived a different kind of life , been a different kind of artist .
Snow 's maternal grandmother is a De Menil , which is to say art - world royalty , the closest thing to the Medicis in the United States .
His mother made headlines a few years ago for charging what was then the highest rent ever asked on a house in the Hamptons : $ 750,000 a season .
And his brother , Maxwell Snow , is a budding member of New York society who has dated Mary - Kate Olsen .
But Snow has concocted something else for himself .
He has been living as hard as a person can - in and out of jail , doing drugs , running from the police - for a decade .
He 's unschooled , self - taught .
The Irak crew , which Dash helped found , is now world famous .
You can still see his " SACER " tags around the city .
His fine art was somewhat less conventional :
Snow has been working with his own ejaculate a lot lately ; his contribution to the Saatchi show was a piece called Fuck the Police , which featured sprays of his sperm on a collagelike installation of tabloid cutouts , headlines about corrupt cops .
Dash 's other items for sale included T - shirts and his coke , sold on Ebay .
Whether you liked his art or not , you have to admire the fact that he was a unique dude .

NEW YORK —
In the wake of David Letterman 's apology for his joke last week about Alaska Governor Sarah Palin 's daughter , a number of protesters flocked around the " Late Show " studios in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday ( June 16 ) to show their support for Palin — albeit not in the numbers previously expected .
Approximately three dozen protestors stood across the street from the studios , chanting " Fire Dave !
Shame on CBS ! , " and spoke about Letterman 's joke , for which he has twice apologized and Palin has accepted his apology .
Last week , Letterman joked in his monologue about an " awkward moment " for Palin at a New York Yankees game , when " her daughter was knocked up by Alex Rodriguez . "
Letterman did not refer to the daughter by name , though he later claimed he was referring to 18 - year - old unwed mother Bristol , not 14 - year - old Willow , who actually accompanied her mother to the game .
" It 's a disgrace what 's going on in our country today , " said a protestor named Ellen .
" We would n't do that to Obama 's daughters . "
Before Palin accepted the apology , it was rumored that nearly 2,000 people would protest outside the " Late Show " studios Tuesday .
Some of the Palin supporters who did show up , like Robert Gretczko , said they did n't think Letterman 's apology was good enough .
" It does n't matter , " Gretczko said .
" Don Imus was still fired for his comments . "
Gretczko later said he showed up because it was personal , not political .
" I do n't see this thing as political , " he said .
" It 's about degrading women on national TV . "
Tamra Burgess heard about the protest this morning and said it was a waste of time .
" We do n't have time for this , " she said .
" It 's really sad .
Letterman is n't going anywhere . "
Melany Purrier - Blake was walking home from work when she saw the protestors gathering , and took offense when protestors attacked Obama .
" Nothing is wrong with the president , " Purrier - Blake said .
" Palin needs to be educated about politics . "
British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have stepped up restrictions on suspected swine flu carriers by introducing measures to turn back passengers showing symptoms of the virus .
Britain is Europe 's worst - hit swine flu territory , with estimates of 55,000 new cases last week .
" If we have concerns about a customer or the customer is concerned , then we have a 24 - hour medical service we can call to give advice to staff , " a British Airways spokeswoman said .
" There have been a number of cases where we have advised customers not to fly on the basis of their diagnosis or symptoms of H1N1 . "
Britain's health authorities are advising people with symptoms to delay journeys if they are feeling unwell .
" If there are signs of something being wrong , be it excessive sneezing or coughing , not looking well , high temperature , then the airport staff can call in a medical team for extra advice , " Virgin Atlantic spokesman Paul Charles said .
" If the medical team believe there are reasons not to fly , the passenger will be asked to produce a fit to fly certificate from their doctor or a hospital , and they will be put at our cost on to the next available flight . "
More positive tests
The news of more stringent checks came with a group of 52 students and teachers in quarantine after the British Council said four students tested positive for the virus upon their arrival in Beijing for a study tour .
Later on Sunday , the BBC said on its website that another four British school pupils from the same group had been confirmed as having swine flu following tests .
" It was a bit of [ a ] surprise to be detained at the airport .
We have been in a state of shock , " Ian Tyrrell , one of the teachers leading the tour , said .
Mr Tyrrell said there were some Americans and other nationalities under quarantine at the hotel , some of them students , but he could not provide a specific number .
He added that two of the children who tested positive for swine flu had since rejoined their groups in quarantine , while two others were " doing well " in a Beijing hospital .
Global spread
China , which has registered around 1,500 positive cases of the virus , has launched aggressive measures to try and detect swine flu , including temperature checks on foreign flights into the country .
While the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has stopped collating figures on infected numbers , European Union Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou predicted on Saturday that 60 million people across the 27 - nation bloc would need priority vaccination .
Northern France , next to the channel crossings into England , has seen an upsurge in new cases over the past week , and Italy has warned that the start of the next school year could also be put back .
The spread of swine flu shows no sign of abating , with Egypt reporting its first death linked to the virus on Sunday after a 25 - year - old woman returning from Muslim holy places in Saudi Arabia died in hospital .
Egypt 's top cleric , Sheikh Ali Gomaa , said he would not issue a decree barring Egyptians from making the pilgrimage , but health officials said all returning pilgrims would be quarantined .
New cases were also confirmed on Sunday by Moroccan health authorities and in Russia , where a sailor back in port became the ninth person infected since the end of May .
In the last table released by the WHO on July 6 , the UN agency had recorded 94,512 laboratory - confirmed cases in 136 countries and territories since April , including 429 deaths .

CAIRO  A suicide bomber who was trying to kill the head of Saudi Arabia ’s antiterrorism efforts stumbled just short of his target and fell , detonating an explosion that had been arranged by an affiliate of Al Qaeda , a spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry said Friday .
The Saudi official , Prince Mohammed bin Nayef , who serves as deputy interior minister and is a member of the royal family , was slightly wounded in the attack in the Red Sea port of Jidda , Saudi Arabia , on Thursday , said Gen.
Mansour al - Turki , the spokesman for the Interior Ministry .
The prince had allowed the wanted militant , who had come saying he wanted to turn himself in , to bypass security as a sign of good faith , General Turki said .
The militant was killed by the explosion , the authorities said .
“ He expressed his desire to turn himself in directly to the prince and the prince granted him his complete trust by requesting that he not be searched , ” General Turki said .
“ And this is something that the prince does .
It is not the first time , but it did not end in this deceptive manner before . ”
So this is Pangea :

It 's sort of depressing that only 42 percent of Americans know this well - established , non-controversial bit of scientific fact .
And while no group acquits itself extremely well , it is once again Republicans dragging down the numbers .
Almost half refuse to believe in plate tectonics , and only a quarter have this basic bit of scientific knowledge under their belt .
And look at the racial breakdown -- despite the rantings of your typical racist , African Americans scored the best on this question , followed by " other " and " Latino " .
Whites lagged far behind , dragged down of course by their over - represented anti-science conservative component .
German candidate campaigns on cleavage
If you got it , flaunt it .
At least that ’s what my grandmother used to say , and I imagine if she could see the campaign ads coming out of Germany this week , she ’d probably laugh .
And Vera Lengsfeld , who is running for a parliament seat in Germany ’s upcoming September elections , is banking on the fact that constituents will have a sense of humor .
The ad ( shown above ) pairs pictures of Lengsfeld and none other than Chancellor Angela Merkel , shoulder to shoulder showcasing the bountiful assets bestowed upon them by Mother Nature — two very ample bosoms barely contained by two seriously wide and plunging necklines .
The line that runs across reads : “ We have more to offer . ”
No doubt , where there ’s more chest , there ’s more attention .
Lengsfeld , who did not clear the ads with Merkel , reports that traffic to her blog has increased , getting as many as 17,000 visitors since this campaign went public .
Her takeaway on all this ?
If only a tenth of them also look at the content of my policies , then I will have reached many more people than I could have done with classic street canvassing . ”
It ’s an interesting acknowledgement on Lengsfeld ’s part , she ’s clearly aware that the show - stopping photos are n’t appealing to the thinking minds of men and women , though it sounds as though she ’s hoping the ad ’s wit will trump the old T&A approach .
Many of those not laughing are likely to be women who find the posters , and the ploy behind them , cheap and offensive .
The glass ceiling runs far and wide , thicker over some places than others , and apparently the profiles of men cast long shadows , even over the most powerful women in global politics .
Truthfully , I ’d like to see a man foolish enough to market his campaign “ package ” in the same fashion …
Or has Berlusconi kind of done that already ?

A complaint you hear quite often is that the Linux desktop environments , which mostly refers to KDE and GNOME , are trying too hard to be like Windows and Mac OS X. Now , even James Bottomley , Distinguished Engineer at Novell , Director of the Linux Foundation , and Chair of its Technical Advisory Board ( put that on your business card ) states in an interview that he believes the Linux desktop is too much like Windows and Mac .
Bottomly will moderate the upcoming Linux Kernel Roundtable at LinuxCon , a discussion with , among others , Jonathan Corbet and Linus Torvalds .
In an interview , Bottomly said that getting open source innovation to the end user is one of the challenges for Linux .
For Linux as a whole , I think the challenge is to bring open source innovation to the end user computing experience , particularly on the desktop .
We have some brilliant desktop technologies , but a lot of them are based on existing Windows or Mac stuff .
I think the next releases of GNOME and KDE are pushing us much farther along towards the leading edge here , and I ’m interested to see what actually emerges as viable technology for the next generation of user interfaces .
It ’s a complaint you often hear , namely that GNOME and KDE try to cater too much to the Windows , and to a lesser extent , the Mac crowd , while they instead should be trying to innovate and differentiate themselves .
I ’m honestly not so sure of this .
If you look at especially KDE4 , then you see a desktop environment bearing very little resemblance to either Windows or Mac OS X ( and remember , we ’re not talking about looks , but functionality and behaviour ) .
Instead , KDE4 is truly standing on its own two feet , and while it was off to a rocky start , and still poses problems for some users ( especially in trying to get performance at an acceptable level ) , it is distinctly different from other desktop environments out there .
GNOME is a bit of a different story , but GNOME is more about providing a stable , slowly improving desktop than KDE is .
The KDE project is trying all sorts of new things , while GNOME is more about gradual progress .
However , even the GNOME project is working on a lot of new things for GNOME 3.0 , which will really set it apart from other environments currently available .
In the end , though , the inescapable truth of the matter is that desktop environments are all relatively alike , and if you can find your way around one of them , it does n’t take too much adapting to find your way around another .
While trying to be different is a noble cause , you do have to wonder if being too different wo n’t just scare people away .

BrightSource Energy has broken ground on a 29 - megawatt solar steam plant at a Chevron oil field in Coalinga , Calif .
The 100 - acre project ’s 7,000 mirrors will focus sunlight on a water - filled boiler that sits atop a 323 - foot tower to produce hot , high - pressure steam .
In a conventional solar power plant , the steam drives a turbine to generate electricity .
In this case , the steam will be injected into oil wells to enhance production by heating thick petroleum so it flows more freely .
Oil companies typically rely on steam generated by natural gas or other fossil fuels to maximize oil recovery in places like the oil patch in California ’s Fresno and Kern counties , where the petroleum is heavy and gooey .
That part of California also has some of the state ’s strongest sunshine and several large solar power plants are planned for the region .
Chevron is an investor in BrightSource , a solar power plant builder based in Oakland , Calif. , and solar - powered oil extraction offers the oil giant an opportunity to reduce its carbon footprint while gaining a hedge against volatile natural gas prices .
For BrightSource , which has signed contracts to supply 2,610 megawatts of solar electricity to California utilities , the Chevron deal is a chance to scale up its technology –- the company so far has only built a six - megawatt demonstration power plant in Israel -– and explore new applications for its technology .
“ It ’s potentially a very lucrative market for us , ” said Keely Wachs , BrightSource ’s senior director of corporate communications .
He declined to discuss the financial terms of the Chevron agreement , however .
The solar plant will be built by BrightSource and owned and operated by the oil company and is scheduled to go online by the end of 2010 .
The project ’s existence was first reported by Reuters after Chevron disclosed the BrightSource deal at a city council meeting in Coalinga on Thursday evening .
Besides Chevron , BrightSource counts the oil giants BP and StatoilHydro of Norway as investors .
Two BrightSource competitors , Ausra and eSolar , are also eyeing the oil industry as a potential market for solar steam .
Ausra , based in Palo Alto , Calif. , last year flipped the switch on a five - megawatt demonstration solar power plant outside Bakersfield , Calif. , and the company ’s chief executive , Robert Fishman , said he had held discussions with oil producers about deploying the company ’s technology .
The economics of solar - powered oil extraction depend largely on the price of natural gas , which hit a seven - year low last week when gas futures fell below $ 3 per million British thermal units .
A February 2009 report by New Energy Finance , a London - based market research firm , estimated that that solar steam systems would be competitive with natural gas at $ 8.50 per million British thermal units .
The report noted that natural gas prices in California had swung 300 percent over the last four years , and that beyond California , the Middle East is a prime — and sunny — potential market for solar steam extraction of heavy oil .
Solar steam , however , works only when the sun shines , so oil companies will still need to rely on natural gas - fired steam .

The release of the July unemployment report was filled with a wide array of distortions and inexplicable results ( especially from the Birth - Death model ) , which have undoubtedly resulted in a better - than - warranted reported gain .
In this post we ’ll explore these oddities in some detail .
The news :
U.S. economy sheds fewer jobs than expected WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) – U.S. employers cut 247,000 jobs in July , far less than expected and the least in any month since last August , according to a government report on Friday that provided the clearest evidence yet that the economy was turning around .
With fewer workers being laid off , the unemployment rate eased to 9.4 percent in July from 9.5 percent the prior month , the Labor Department said , the first time the jobless rate had fallen since April 2008 .
Wait , how can you lose jobs and have the rate of unemployment fall ?
This does n’t make sense , because it is the equivalent of saying , " I spent more than I earned and my savings went up . "
The key here is understanding the ways in which the government measures unemployment .
First , job gains / losses are measured by a sampling of businesses ( called the " establishment " data ) .
This gives us the headline number of 247,000 jobs lost .
Second , the rate of unemployment comes from a completely different sample , this one of households , which gives us the 9.4 % rate of unemployment .
As always , the devil is in the details .
Without the Birth - Death model providing the largest addition of jobs in its entire series for July , the 247,000 jobs lost number would have been higher .
The table below shows the contributions or subtraction of jobs provided by the Birth - Death model in each month of July since its creation .
This July sports the highest addition ever :
Normally , July and January are " true - up " months , where all the past overstatements of the Birth - Death model are cleaned up .
Does it make sense to you that this July , out of all months , the Birth - Death model should be showing the largest monthly gain in the series ?
It makes sense to me that July 2006 could have squeaked out a positive , since that was at the tail end of a strong period of growth .
But July 2009 ?
No , not even in the slighest .
If the B - D model had turned in a far more normal looking - 60 k to - 80 k result , then the number of reported lost jobs would have been in the range of 350,000 job losses , not the 237,000 reported .
However , I would have expected the fact that the B - D model has added 879,000 this year since the last true - up in January , during the worst period of economic growth since the Great Depression , to have been a strong indication that this July would have resulted in one of the largest negative July adjustments on record .
Instead we got the strongest positive one !!
This is simply so far out of the bounds of " reasonable " that I am almost out of words .
But it gets worse .
In the table below showing the Household data ( source ) , we can see that the way in which the rate of unemployment dropped from 9.5 % to 9.4 % was almost entirely due to the fact that 637,000 people were dropped from the labor force – not from an increase in employment .
If we left these 637,000 people in the labor force , then the rate of unemployment would have increased from 9.5 % to 9.8 % .
What ’s the difference between unemployment slipping to 9.4 % rather than increasing to 9.8 % ?
All the difference in the world when you have a major initiative underway :

Obama Setting Out to Put Brighter Face on Economy
August 4 , 2009 WASHINGTON —
The White House is making a major push this week to persuade Americans that President Obama ’s policies are helping bring the nation out of recession .
But a four - letter word — jobs — may well get in the way .
With poll numbers showing that support for Mr. Obama ’s handling of the economy has declined , the president and other top administration officials — Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke — will hit the road on Wednesday in a coordinated show of force .
They will try to make the case , as the president said Saturday in his weekly address , that “ in the last few months , the economy has done measurably better than expected . ”
They have some statistics to back them up .
If you are wondering about the political pressure that propels the BLS ( et al. ) to produce misleading but favorable economic statistics , you need look no further than this article .
Obama , like every president before him , has a strong desire to use his station to inject optimism into the economy .
That ’s hard to do when the statistics are dismal , so every effort is made to have them be brighter and more favorable than they really are .
Same as it ever was .
Bad statistics can be good for politicians , but not so much for sound decisions .
Do we have the " clearest evidence yet that the economy is turning around , " as the original article claimed above , or do we have evidence of something else , like , perhaps , statistical trickery ?
A sticky end : Scorned women exact painful revenge on cheating husband with superglue
Three women exacted a painful revenge on a cheating husband they discovered had been sleeping with them all at the same time - by superglueing his private parts .
The angry women lured married father Donessa Davis to a motel where they decided to humiliate him .
The ambush was set up by the man 's wife after she discovered he had been cheating on her with as many as five women .
Hell hath no fury : Therese Ziemann , left , Wendy Sewell , centre , and Michelle Belliveau got stuck in
Police in the U.S. state of Wisconsin are now searching for the scorned wife after she disappeared from the family home after the assault .
Mr Davis is recovering after needing hospital treatment for his embarrassing injury when his manhood was glued to his stomach .
The attack took place after Therese Ziemann , 47 , lured the husband to a motel in Chilton , Wisconsin , with the promise of a massage .
The husband voluntarily allowed himself to be tied to the bed and blindfolded .
As he lay prone on the bed , Ziemann opened the motel room door and two other women , Wendy Sewell , 44 , and Michelle Belliveau , 43 , burst in .
All three had been contacted by the Mr Davis ' wife Tracy Hood - Davis .
She had discovered her husband 's affairs and had plotted with them to exact their revenge .
The wife : Tracy Hood - Davis discovered her husband 's affairs and plotted revenge
According to a police report the man 's underpants were cut off with a pair of scissors and a tube of superglue squirted over his most sensitive body part .
One of the women asked the victim which women he loved more and which one he wanted to grow old with before slapping him in the face and taunting him : ' Can you handle that .?'
Mr Davis was finally released after he started screaming , and police say the women fled with his mobile phone , wallet and car .
He told police that Ziemann pointed a gun to his head and at his penis before saying , ' You 're lucky they will not let me shoot ' .
Mr Davis also claimed that Ziemann punched him in the face , and according to police reports , he sustained bruising to his left eye .
Police issued an arrest warrant for Tracy Hood - Davis and discovered she had told the three mistresses that her husband was using them for sex and money .
Ziemann told detectives she the married man on internet site Craigslist and had paid for the motel room where they met for sex over a two month period .

Only a few years after the all - out guerrilla war in Rambo ( 1982 ) , John Rambo 's former commanding officer , Colonel Sam Trautman , pulls him out of jail , only to send him back to a place he swore never to return : the impenetrable jungles of Vietnam .
Entrusted with the dangerous task of collecting evidence that American POWs are still being held captive , Rambo agrees to infiltrate the unknown zone , and before long , he finds himself double - crossed , marooned behind the enemy lines .
Once , John fought for his country .
Now , the government has left him for dead in a Soviet - infested land .
Can Rambo fulfil his suicide mission ?
Will he deliver his lethal justice ?

Saudi Businessman Orders $ 50,000 Solid Gold Penis Enlarger By By Andrew Moran Aug 6 , 2009 in World According to a Canadian manufacturer , a Saudi businessman purchased the world 's most expensive adult item : a solid gold penis enlarger .
Currently , it is against Saudi Arabian law to order sex toys however , the company manufacturer states that it is a United States medically certified device .
Rick Oh , X4 Labs co-owner , told the Associated Press , “ It 's an unusual request .
We did n't take it seriously at first , but once he sent us a deposit , we had to agree to it .
Obviously , there were giggles initially when we presented our project to a jeweler and asked him for help . ”
These types of devices range around $ 400 however ; this custom made device will cost approximately $ 47,000 .
Product coordinator Matt West told AFP that he “ is convinced that there is a demographic that is willing to pay for lavish medical devices for their private areas ... to pay good money to spoil themselves .
There is something tremendously selfish about the male ego , and subsequently 50,000 - dollar orders may become the norm for companies like X4 Labs . ”
The company now will offer all customers the option of customizing their male novelty devices .
X4 Labs , which is a Canadian manufacturer of medical devices , and a Montreal custom jeweller designed and constructed the $ 50,000 solid gold penis enlarger .
The penis enlarger is being encrusted with 40 diamonds and rubies as well and is ordered to be delivered in October in an armored plated car .

Swedish artist and composer Magnus Uggla has launched a scathing attack on the owners of Spotify .
After discovering that Sony BMG is a shareholder and after receiving virtually no payment from his music being played there , he has withdrawn his tracks from the service declaring , " I 'd rather be raped by The Pirate Bay . "
For many years now the media has been filled with the industry line that the operators of The Pirate Bay are little more than thieves , handing out other people ’s content without ensuring creators get paid .
Few have been more vocal than the music industry , who time and again distill the situation down to a simple , easily palatable ‘ truth ’ – The Pirate Bay is evil because the artists do n’t get paid .
But where are the alternatives ?
If someone created a service to compete with pirates , everything could improve .
Sites like
The Pirate Bay would cease to exist and users would flood to legal services where not only could they avoid being sued , but the artists would get paid too .
It seems that just about everyone who has tried it absolutely loves Spotify .
It has in excess of 3.5 million tracks available , all for free ( if you chose that option ) , all funded by advertising .
And of course , for those wishing to champion the morality of paying artists , this is dealt with too .
This week it was revealed that the major labels all have fingers in the Spotify pie – surely paying the artists would be a foregone conclusion ?
Not according to Swedish noble , artist and composer Magnus Uggla , who has launched a scathing attack on the fledgling streaming service , branding it as dishonest .
Writing on his blog he says that Spotify is a really incredible , fantastic service which offers everything – for free too .
But , he writes , it ’s too good to be true .
Like thousands of other artists , Uggla ’s work is available via Spotify and , due to involvement of the major labels and a lack of involvement from the local torrent site operators , he of course expects to get paid a reasonable amount .
Not so .
Uggla says that when he received his first earnings statement from Spotify it became apparent that he “ earned as much in six months as a BUSKER could earn in a day . ”
Ouch .
Understandably upset , Uggla raised the issue in a long discussion with Sony boss Hasse Breitholtz but came away feeling that he should trust in the man and the service .
However , Uggla was as surprised as most people when he learned last week that the major labels , including Sony , all have a stake in Spotify .
A mere 30,000 kroner ( $ 4,000 ) investment bought the company 5.8 % of the service now valued at around 1.8 billion kroner ( $ 251 m ) .
Referring to the valuation , Uggla questions how this company can do so well – and comes to the conclusion that it ’s at the artist ’s expense .
He says that Sony Music , after “ suing the shit out of The Pirate Bay ” is acting just like them by not paying the artists .
“ I would rather be raped by Pirate Bay than by Hasse Breitholtz and Sony Music and will remove all of my songs from Spotify pending an honest service , ” he says .
Sony ?
Dishonest ?
Surely not …

The communist dictator Hugo Chavez way back in 2004 purchased the Sequoia software that runs our voting machines and the mainstream media wo n't report any of it not even Fox because Saudi Arabia bought a percentage of Fox in 2007 .
This is the stuff that the media never gives
Taitz a chance to say because it's so focused on the news hook of the " birther " issue .
( And , believe me , this has been merely a tiny sample of what I saw on my road trip this spring . )

Here is a good survey of some of the debates , plus Paul Krugman mentions the topic in his column today .
Here 's my earlier post but I 'd like to add or reiterate a few points :
1 . On one hand , critics wish to charge that there is little or no advantage to having prices move more quickly to reflect new information .
On the other hand , some of these same critics charge that short - run volatility of prices — assuming this is in fact the result of HFT ( and that is not proven ) — creates social costs .
That 's not quite a contradiction but it is an odd mix of views about the relevance of the short run .
2 . I have n't seen a good estimate , or for that matter a bad estimate , of the social loss involved from investing resources in HFT .
Even if the practice has no gain , I suspect the loss is small .
It 's the symbolic nature of the issue which excites people — bailed - out elites doing fancy things with powerful computers in a non-egalitarian manner — rather than the belief that it is a policy priority .
Even if you think HFT is bad , on an actual list of bad policies or practices in our world , would it be in the top million ?
Mostly it 's a canvas on which to paint complaints about the continuing political and economic power of finance , but we should n't let that skew our judgment of the practice itself .
3 . There is no argument to date , and probably no argument period , that HFT can lead to financial insolvency or collapse on a major scale .
The cost , if there is one , is that the associated trading strategies bring a temporary collapse of asset prices for some period of time ( how long ? ) or perhaps greater ongoing price volatility , or uncertainty about order execution , in the short run .
When I read that HFT may give markets " a new , currently unknown set of emergent properties " I think buying opportunity .
4. Research by Hans Stoll indicated that program trading was not in fact an instrumental culprit behind Black Monday in 1987 , yet media coverage of HFT seems to be indicating that it was .
Many of the HFT debates echo themes from the earlier program trading debates from the late 1980s but in fact program trading did not turn out to be a major problem .
We have been down this path before and it turned out there was much less there than the critics thought at the time .
5 . The more I read these debates , the more nervous I get about the idea of a financial products safety commission .
Essentially on innovation we 're seeing a flipping of the burden of proof and I do n't think it is possible to easily fine - tune that flipping in a way to capture good innovations and rule out bad ones .
We should still follow the rule of regulating practices shown to be harmful or likely to be harmful .

Is Treasury not getting the message ?
When it comes to administering TARP , the agency has been warned again and again about its lack of transparency by the three government watchdogs monitoring the bailout .
Back in January , the Government Accountability Office concluded that goings on at the agency were so opaque it was difficult to tell whether Treasury even had a “ strategic vision ” for TARP at all .
The agency has even tried to stonewall Neil Barofsky , the Special Inspector General for TARP ( or , SIGTARP ) , refusing to hand over certain documents he requested .
Meanwhile , Elizabeth Warren , the Harvard law professor chairing the Congressional Oversight Panel , has said that “ without more transparency and accountability … it is not possible to exercise meaningful oversight over Treasury ’s actions . ”
It must have been all the more frustrating for her when COP recently requested specific information about the stock warrants
Treasury received from bailout recipients only to be told that none would be forthcoming .
At issue is whether Treasury is maximizing taxpayers ’ return on investment , or giving bailed out banks sweetheart deals by allowing them to repurchase their warrants at bargain rates .
So far it looks like the latter .
The COP ’s latest report [ PDF ] , released on Friday , found “ eleven small banks have repurchased their warrants from Treasury for a total amount that the Panel estimates to be only 66 percent of its best estimate of their value , ” shorting taxpayers about $ 10 million overall .
While the agency has only sold warrants from smaller banks so far , if it were to unload its holdings under the same terms , taxpayers could lose out on as much as $ 2.7 billion .
Given this , it would seem particularly important to find out how exactly Treasury is valuing these warrants .
But this is specifically the information the agency is refusing to part with .
In a June 12 letter , Warren posed a series of questions to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner relating to the repayment of TARP funds , which many bailout recipients are hastening to do in order to avoid the pesky scrutiny that accompanies their participation in the program .
Among other things , she asked Geithner to “ provide any information relating to Treasury ’s internal valuations of warrants not yet exercised or repurchased . ”
Imagine Warren ’s dismay when Geithner came back with this :
It is not Treasury ’s policy to publish estimates of the fair market value of its investments made under the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( “ TARP ” ) .
In the present case , Treasury believes it would not be in the taxpayer ’s interest for Treasury to disclose any valuations it has performed in connection with warrants whose repurchase is currently pending or that may be repurchased in the near term .
The panel singled this out as a “ disheartening ” sign that the transparency message , which “ the Panel has emphasized .. since its first report , ” had yet to sink in for Treasury .
Pointing out that “ the disposition of the warrants is of direct financial interest to the public , ” the report notes that “ it is especially important that Treasury be absolutely transparent about the nature and substance of the decisions it is making and the reasons for those decisions . ”
Since it is the healthy banks that are currently repaying , the value of their respective warrants has no doubt gone up .
In this respect , early sales of these warrants may leave Treasury holding the warrants of weaker institutions with lower stock prices and less likelihood of appreciation in the value of their warrants , at least in the immediate future .
The Panel recognizes that Treasury must protect proprietary information and use care to avoid giving other institutions information that would prejudice the interests of the taxpayer , but it must make any decision to restrict disclosure for these reasons only in the most thoughtful and judicious manner .
This seems like a polite way of saying that COP regards Treasury ’s decision to withhold warrant valuations as neither thoughtful nor judicious .

California must shrink the population of its teeming prisons by nearly 43,000 inmates over the next two years to meet constitutional standards , a panel of three federal judges ruled Tuesday , ordering the state to come up with a reduction plan by mid-September .
The order cited Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s own words when he proclaimed a state of emergency in the corrections system in 2006 and warned of substantial risk to prison staff , inmates and the general public , saying “ immediate action is necessary to prevent death and harm . ”
Tuesday ’s ruling heightens the stakes for a legislative debate over prisons that will take place later this month .
As part of the agreement to close the state ’s $ 26 - billion budget gap , the governor and lawmakers agreed to cut $ 1.2 billion from the prisons budget , but postponed decisions on how to hit that goal .
The governor and most legislative leaders back a plan that would reduce prison populations by as many as 37,000 over the next two years using a combination of early releases , changes in parole policies and shifting of some prisoners to county jails .
Advertisement
Debate on that plan will be contentious , with many Republicans opposed .
But the judges ’ ruling means that defeating the plan would not only unravel a major piece of the budget agreement but also potentially cede decision - making over prison policies to the federal courts .
Lengthy process
The 185 - page opinion follows a trial last year and nearly 14 years of deliberations over lawsuits brought by inmates alleging cruel and unusual punishment , which moved the state case into federal jurisdiction .
The opinion accuses the state of fostering “ criminogenic ” conditions that lead prisoners and parolees to commit more crimes , feeding a cycle of recidivism .
“ The constitutional deficiencies in the California prison system ’s medical and mental health system cannot be resolved in the absence of a prisoner release order , ” the judges concluded .
Advertisement
They stopped short of issuing a release edict , though , giving state officials 45 days to come up with their own plan for reducing overcrowding while observing that alternatives to release , such as building new prisons , were “ too distant ” and unlikely to be funded .
Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown said the state would comply with the order to produce a plan , but repeated criticism that the judges had ignored significant improvements made in recent years .
He said he doubts the U.S. Supreme Court , to which state officials could appeal any release order , would find that current prison conditions violate the Constitution .
“ The courts are ordering the state to come up with a plan to release all these prisoners , but the question is : Which prisoners ?
Release to what -- halfway houses , GPS monitoring ?
And what happens when they commit another crime -- do they come back ?
There ’s a lot that is not clear , ” Brown said .

Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Secretary Matthew Cate said he hoped the judges would back down if state officials and lawmakers make progress in reducing the state ’s prison population this month , as planned .
The administration ’s proposal to cut the inmate population by 37,000 over two years could be approved by the Legislature with a majority vote -- meaning no support would be needed by conservative Republicans who threatened to scuttle last month ’s budget deal if prisoner releases were included .
The governor ’s plan would allow the state to place on home detention prisoners with less than a year left on their sentences and those who are elderly or infirm .
It would also change sentencing and parole rules to reward those who show evidence of rehabilitation .
But Schwarzenegger may be reluctant to use the courts as a hammer to push his plan through .
Administration officials have repeatedly said that the court has overstepped its boundaries .
The overcrowding problem , Cate said , is a state problem that needs to be fixed by the governor and lawmakers .
Advertisement
“ It is not the job of the federal court to do this , ” he said .
Noting the legislative session that begins in two weeks , Prison Law Office Director Donald Specter , who brought the prisoners ’ suits , said lawmakers now face the choice of being “ part of the solution or continuing to be part of the problem . ”
Potential win-win
Specter emphasized , as did the judges , that the ruling “ does n’t mean that 40,000 prisoners are going to walk out of prison tomorrow . ”
Advertisement
“ If done right , this could be a win - win situation for the entire state , as the prisons will be safer for my clients and the staff who work there , taxpayers will save hundreds of millions of dollars a year and communities will be safer as a result , ” Specter said , pointing to the judges ’ opinion that prison conditions contribute to repeat offenses .
The judges capped the prison population at no more than 137 % of the designed capacity of 84,000 .
That would mean release of 42,920 inmates to meet the population ceiling of 115,080 .
Some lawmakers welcomed the ruling while others vowed to fight it .
“ It ’s frankly a day of reckoning for those who have pushed for constant sentence enhancements , who would decimate rehabilitation programs and who oppose revenues to support state services , ” said Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) , alluding to Republican lawmakers ’ conflicting efforts to be tough on crime while cutting spending .
Advertisement
“ Today ’s decision by the three - judge panel is a nightmare come true for California families , ” countered Assembly Minority Leader Sam Blakeslee of San Luis Obispo .
“ Any fair - minded court will see there is no way to reduce our prison population by nearly 43,000 without letting out some very dangerous criminals onto our streets and into our neighborhoods . ”
The judges pointedly rejected any notion that conditions have improved .
Citing testimony during last year ’s trial by some of the nation ’s foremost prison administrators , the judges said the experts reported “ they have never previously witnessed such appalling prison conditions . ”
Until overcrowding is reduced , the state will be unable to provide “ constitutionally compliant care , ” concluded the panel comprised of U.S. District Judges Thelton Henderson and Lawrence Karlton , and U.S. 9th Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt .
The judges said overcrowding at prison reception centers approaches three times designed capacity , frustrating prison intake officials ’ ability to identify incoming prisoners with medical or mental health problems .
Advertisement
Overcrowding has led to conditions that contribute to the spread of disease , require increased use of lockdowns to control inmates , and impede authorities ’ ability to provide essential healthcare , the judges said .
It also “ worsens many of the risk factors for suicide among inmates and increases the prevalence and acuity of mental illness , ” they added .
Conditions are “ often dangerous , and on many occasions fatal , ” the judges said , alluding to reports that California inmates die of treatable or avoidable illnesses at the rate of one per week .
Henderson , a judge of the U.S. District Court for Northern California , seized oversight of the prison healthcare network in 2006 and appointed a receiver to fix the deficiencies .
J. Clark Kelso , the receiver , said in a recent interview that his staff was making progress on a daunting array of projects but that significant improvements remain at least a year away .
He plans to computerize inmate medical records , replace a deficient pharmacy operation , build at least $ 2 billion worth of hospitals and upgrade existing ones .

US Reported In â Panicâ  After Chemtrail Planes Forced Down In India , Nigeria
Researchers have established the conditions that foster formation of potentially dangerous levels of a toxic substance in the high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) that is often fed to honey bees .
Their study , which appears in the current issue of ACS ' bi-weekly Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry , may also have implications for soft drinks and dozens of other human foods that contain HFCS .
The substance , hydroxymethylfurfural ( HMF ) , forms mainly from heating fructose .
In the new study , Blaise LeBlanc and Gillian Eggleston and colleagues note HFCS 's ubiquitous usage as a sweetener in beverages and processed foods .
Some commercial beekeepers also feed it to bees to increase reproduction and honey production .
When exposed to warm temperatures , HFCS can form HMF and kill honeybees .
Some researchers believe that HMF may be a factor in Colony Collapse Disorder , a mysterious disease that has killed at least one - third of the honeybee population in the United States .
The scientists measured levels of HMF in HFCS products from different manufacturers over a period of 35 days at different temperatures .
As temperatures rose , levels of HMF increased steadily .
Levels jumped dramatically at about 120 degrees Fahrenheit .
" The data are important for commercial beekeepers , for manufacturers of HFCS , and for purposes of food storage .
Because HFCS is incorporated as a sweetener in many processed foods , the data from this study are important for human health as well , " the report states .
It adds that studies have linked HMF to DNA damage in humans .
In addition , HMF breaks down in the body to other substances potentially more harmful than HMF .
( AP ) — TIGARD , Ore. - The Tigard Police Department has ended a sex - for - marijuana Internet sting because officers posting the online ads posed as promiscuous women , not prostitutes .
…
The officers posting the Craigslist ads posed as women willing to a have casual sexual encounter with men who had marijuana .
No cash was involved .
When the men showed up for the encounter , they were charged with prostitution and delivery of drugs .
Defense attorneys say the program was entrapment .
Opponents of marijuana reform often try to act like it 's already no big deal .
They say no one really gets in much trouble for it and it's not a top priority for police .
It 's a pretty desperate and counterintuitive strategy .
It 's also total bullshit : Ya think ?
I could n't ask for a better example of police taking advantage of people in order to put them in jail .
The whole thing is perverted and I 'm not talking about the people who responded to the ad .
This story should be posted on every police department bulletin board in the country with " DON'T DO STUFF LIKE THIS " scrawled across the top of the page .
Remember before the drug war , when the police officer 's job was to prevent bad things from happening to people ?
Now we 've got cops who think the best use of their time ( and our money ) is to trick people into breaking the law and then ruining their lives .
When we talk about ending the drug war , it 's not because we want more freedom to take drugs .
It 's because we want to take away any incentive our police have to do stupid and insane crap like this .
if a poll tells you seniors do n't like something , but for the most part everyone else is okay with it , what do you do with that information ?
Lies and distortions are n't forever .
If an actual bill appears , courtesy of the US Congress , and there are no unpopular - with - seniors features which were rumored to be in the bill , what then ?
Who wins , who loses ?
In a fascinating dissection of theABC / WaPo poll , we learn what we knew , in ways tough to ignore .
Seniors must think the kids are after their Medicare , which , of course , is a beloved government - administered health insurance program .
Among the seven questions asked , all reflecting similar generational splits :
Same is okay ; you have n't lost until " worse > 50 " .
But the numbers mirror the generational split we see in the weekly Daily Kos Research 2000 tracking poll , where Obama 's favorability ( 55 - 40 ) looks like this :
We have the 30 - 44 year olds ( Michael J Fox as Alex P. Keaton ) who do n't know what to make of Obama , and the seniors ( at 43 - 54 fav- unfav ) in stark contrast with the 18-29s ( at 78 - 18 ) and 45 - 59 year olds ( who have more in common with Millenials than inter- generational sniping would have you believe . )
Looking over the past seven weeks ( from July 17 though the latest poll ending Aug 27 ) , the hits have been over the last two weeks ( at least one of which has been while Obama is on vacation ) :
Is it forever ?
An actual bill would go a long way to answer that question .
Getting seniors back to " neutral " would be an immediate goal .
In the meantime , because nothing happens in a vacuum , you can expect that seniors will continue to get played .

An international debate is needed on the use of autonomous military robots , a leading academic has said .
Noel Sharkey of the University of Sheffield said that a push toward more robotic technology used in warfare would put civilian life at grave risk .
Technology capable of distinguishing friend from foe reliably was at least 50 years away , he added .
However , he said that for the first time , US forces mentioned resolving such ethical concerns in their plans .
" Robots that can decide where to kill , who to kill and when to kill is high on all the military agendas , " Professor Sharkey said at a meeting in London .
" The problem is that this is all based on artificial intelligence , and the military have a strange view of artificial intelligence based on science fiction . "
' Odd way ' Professor Sharkey , a professor of artificial intelligence and robotics , has long drawn attention to the psychological distance from the horrors of war that is maintained by operators who pilot unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , often from thousands of miles away .
" These guys who are driving them sit there all day ... they go home and eat dinner with their families at night , " he said .
" It 's kind of a very odd way of fighting a war - it 's changing the character of war dramatically . "

The rise in technology has not helped in terms of limiting collateral damage , Professor Sharkey said , because the military intelligence behind attacks was not keeping pace .
Between January 2006 and April 2009 , he estimated , 60 such " drone " attacks were carried out in Pakistan .
While 14 al - Qaeda were killed , some 687 civilian deaths also occurred , he said .
That physical distance from the actual theatre of war , he said , led naturally to a far greater concern : the push toward unmanned planes and ground robots that make their decisions without the help of human operators at all .
The problem , he said , was that robots could not fulfil two of the basic tenets of warfare : discriminating friend from foe , and " proportionality " , determining a reasonable amount of force to gain a given military advantage .
" Robots do not have the necessary discriminatory ability , " he explained .
" They 're not bright enough to be called stupid - they can't discriminate between civilians and non-civilians ; it 's hard enough for soldiers to do that .
" And forget about proportionality , there 's no software that can make a robot proportional , " he added .
" There 's no objective calculus of proportionality - it 's just a decision that people make . "
Policy in practise Current rules of engagement to which the UK subscribes prohibit the use of lethal force without human intervention .
Nigel Mills is aerial technology director at defence contractor QinetiQ , who make a number of UAVs and ground robots for the armed forces .
He told BBC News that building in autonomy to the systems required assurances of the importance of human input .
UK soldiers prepared UAVs for deployment in Afghanistan last month " The more autonomous a system is , the more effort you have to put into the human / machine interface because of the rules of engagement .
" Complete autonomy - where you send a UAV off on a mission and you do n't interact with it - is not compatible with our current rules of engagement , so we 're not working on such systems . "
The US air force published its " Unmanned Aircraft Systems Flight Plan 2009 - 2047 " in July , predicting the deployment of fully autonomous attack planes .
The document suggests that humans will play more of a role " monitoring the execution of decisions " than actually making the decisions .
" Advances in AI will enable systems to make combat decisions and act within legal and policy constraints without necessarily requiring human input , " says the report .
HAVE YOUR SAY Robots do not feel emotions and do not surrender .
Send robots to war and the consequences would be devastating Glen Thomas However , it concedes that " authorising a machine to make lethal combat decisions is contingent upon political and military leaders resolving legal and ethical questions .
" Ethical discussions and policy decisions must take place in the near term in order to guide the development of future UAS capabilities , rather than allowing the development to take its own path apart from this critical guidance , " it continues .
While the US 's plans are vague , Professor Sharkey said the mere mention of ethical issues was significant .
" I 'm glad they 've picked up on that , because if you look at any previous plan , they had n't done so , " he told BBC News .
However , he warned that work toward ever more autonomous killing machines is carrying on , noting the deployment of Israel 's Harpy - a fully autonomous UAV that dive - bombs radar systems with no human intervention .
He cautioned that an international debate was necessary before further developments in decision - making robots could unfold .

( CNN ) --
It is a problem of massive plastic proportions -- a giant floating debris field , composed mostly of bits and pieces of plastic , in the northwest Pacific Ocean , about a thousand miles off the coast of California .
Researchers recover nets from the Pacific Ocean on August 3 , 2009 .
It 's called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and it covers a vast area of hundreds , maybe even thousands , of miles of open ocean .
Now researchers are trying to learn more about the sea - bound trash zone and perhaps find answers to basic questions .
A crew of scientists from the University of California 's Scripps Institution of Oceanography has embarked on a three - week mission aboard the research vessel New Horizon , heading for the debris field to study it .
The mission is not as straightforward as it sounds .
" There may be a misapprehension ... that if you got out there and stood on the middle of a deck you 'd see nothing but plastic litter from horizon to horizon , " said Robert Knox , deputy director for research at the Scripps Institution .
" It 's relatively sparse , and you might or might not see something visible to the human eye at any particular location out there , " Knox says .
" Certainly one does encounter pieces of plastic stuff that are big enough to see .
But the other side of the puzzle is all the little bits and pieces of plastic that you can't even see unless you scoop up a sample of seawater and see what 's in there . "
" I think it 's a little misleading to think of it as a great big island that you could practically get out and walk on , but the point is it 's a big area of ocean .
So even a few pieces of plastic per square meter amounts to a lot of plastic when you add it up over this enormous ocean area . "
There has been some previous research on this garbage field , but not much .
It 's been very poorly studied in a scientific sense .
Major questions remain :
How how much stuff is there ?
What size is the stuff ?
Where is it distributed in the ocean , at the surface or at what depth ?
What does it do to the food chain , especially the small particles of plastic that may be ingested by smaller organisms at the bottom of the food chain ?
While the main focus of the Scripps mission is the impact of this plastic trash on marine life , researchers will gather information on a wide variety of issues .
Here 's what scientists do know :
They know the size of this zone is huge , maybe as big as Texas .
And they know that all the plastic accumulated in the patch has mostly broken down into smaller bits , floating just under the water 's surface like confetti , basically a soupy mix of plastic - filled seawater that stretches for maybe thousands of miles .
They know the garbage patch has been growing for many years , and scientists first became aware of the problem years ago when fisherman reported encountering widespread debris .
They know there are other debris fields in other oceans of the world , but this one is the biggest .
Rusty Brainard with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says this giant garbage patch , in addition to plastic , also contains huge masses of fishing nets , which destroys ecosystems around the Hawaiian Islands .
But the plastic is really the toxic killer .
While it slowly degrades , it turns into increasingly smaller bits of plastic .
Seabirds mistake it for food and they dive down and eat it .
Brainard says they find a lot of skeletons of seabirds on the Islands and " their gut content is just filled with plastic . "
Brainard says that has scientists wondering what other animals are eating this plastic .
As the larger animals and marine life eat the smaller animals , this plastic eventually ends up in the human food supply , too .
But even the size is of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is uncertain .
" It 's not a hard and fast number .
It 's a little bit like a whirlpool on the surface of a river or a lake .
You'd be hard - pressed to tell me where the edge is .
All you know is that it 's stronger in the middle than it is in the outer reaches .
But it 's an area of many hundreds of miles -- perhaps thousands -- in which the ocean currents tend to bring it together , " according to Knox .
NOAA has tracked the Great Pacific Garbage Patch movement to some degree .
Scientists know it moves as much as a thousand miles north and south in the Pacific seasonally .
And during warmer ocean periods , known as El Nino , it drifts even further south .
A kind of large , clock - wise circulation of currents driven by the wind around the Pacific ocean basin causes the plastic and other garbage to mix together in convergence zones , forming this giant trash zone and making its movements comparable to a whirlpool .
Researchers believe this enormous trash zone accumulated over many years from trash being dumped off boats and ocean - going ships , and from trash accumulated on beaches , where it eventually washed in the Pacific Ocean and into the huge zone .
This study mission may even help scientists determine whether there 's any way to clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and , if so , the best way to do it .

It looks like Ponzi - scheme criminal Bernard Madoff will share the fate of the convicted Enron criminal and Bush buddy Ken Lay .
“ Bernard Madoff , convicted of swindling $ 65 billion through the biggest - ever Ponzi scheme , has told fellow prison inmates that he is dying of cancer , the New York Post reported on Monday , citing unnamed prison sources , ” reports Reuters .
Madoff allegedly told his fellow inmates at a North Carolina federal prison he does not have longer to live .
The New York Post reports there had been speculation that Madoff was suffering from pancreatic cancer earlier this year .
Inmates said Madoff was taking “ about 20 pills a day ” and “ not doing very well . ”
Ken Lay , CEO of Enron and the poster child for corporate abuse and accounting fraud , allegedly died died while vacationing in Snowmass , Colorado on July 5 , 2006 , about three and a half months before his scheduled October 23 sentencing .
Last month , Bob Chapman , publisher of the financial newsletter The International Forecaster , predicted arch criminal and fall guy Bernie Madoff would die within six months .
It appears Chapman was way off the mark but spot - on about Bernie ’s demise .
“ I do n’t think he will die , ” Chapman told Jones .
“ I think they will tell you he died and he will be shipped out some place . ”
As Alex noted during the conversation with Chapman , there are persistent rumors that Ken Lay is alive and well and living in Paraguay on a Bush ranch , sort of like infamous Nazis guilty of the most unimaginable war crimes ended up in South America sixty odd years ago .
Chapman noted that the Fed and the Treasury know exactly where the money went — to offshore bank accounts — and the Madoff scam was merely business as usual .

GE will print the OLEDs on polymer substrate , and use their ultra - high barrier coating .
GE says that they managed to lower production cost by using roll - to - roll printing , and inexpensive substrates ( the polymer ones ) .
GE are also thinking about possible new designs , and have released this video a month ago , which includes several flexible OLED light designs by art students , including wearable OLEDs for emergency safety gear , illuminated stairs , walls and signs in stores and a nice " wall peel " OLED lamp .
I started using Blosxom a few weeks ago .
I liked the basic idea ( that each post is one file ) very much , but I found the code hard to read and poorly documented .
Plugins varied widely in quality , and I had to jump through hoops to implement some of the things I wanted .
By the time I got everything working the way I liked it , I ended up with a complete rewrite .
The code is well - documented , supports tagging and pagination , generates an RSS feed , works nicely with Git , and lets me publish URLs like http://toroid.org/etc/200908 and /etc/ birds +language .
( Disadvantages : it is n't quite plugin - compatible with Blosxom , and it does n't support static generation . )
I 'm sure I could have used a more modern , featureful program to achieve the same effect , but I 'm glad I did n't have to .
I was happier to spend a couple of hours writing something worse than a few days trying to fit something better , like Wordpress , into my head .
I wrote this code for my own use with no intention of releasing it , but a few people have expressed an interest in using it , so here it is .
No longer maintained
Update ( November 2013 ) : Loathsxome never had more than a handful of users , and only two who regularly contributed code ( Arnt Gulbrandsen and myself ) .
Arnt wrote plusxome , and I wrote something else using Mojolicious without even pretending to maintain backwards compatibility .
Loathsxome is still here .
It works as well as it ever did , and none of what 's written below is untrue , but nobody uses it any more .
Features
Loathsxome knows how to display two kinds of things : a single journal entry or post , and an " index view " or list of posts ( all posts , or those that match some criterion , such as " tagged with ' horror ' " or " written in May 2009 " ) .
Loathsxome features nice - looking URLs , support for tagging and categorisation by directory , RSS feed generation , " Read more " links for selected posts in index views , HTML entity encoding , and so on .
If you use Git to maintain your web site , as I do , you 'll find that Loathsxome works very well with it .
The code is easy to follow , and well - documented ; the plugin system is simple but powerful .
Plugins can affect any aspect of the program 's operation , from URL parsing to post selection and rendering .
Compared to Blosxom
Loathsxome has two significant disadvantages : it is not compatible with existing Blosxom plugins , and it does not support static generation yet .
( But the plugin interface is so similar that most plugins can be ported with a few minutes ' work ; and I intend to implement static generation in a future release . )
Existing Blosxom users may find little reason to switch , especially if they have invested some effort into selecting and configuring plugins .
But it takes real work to configure Blosxom to duplicate Loathsxome 's default behaviour , so new users who like that behaviour can save time by using Loathsxome ; and anyone who wants to extend the code will appreciate its improved internal organisation .
Loathsxome also has a more evocative name than Blosxom .
Download
Loathsxome is a CGI program written in Perl ( without any CPAN dependencies ) .
This distribution contains loathsxome.cgi and some plugins , described below .
It is distributed under an MIT - style open source license .
( See the included LICENSE file for details . )
Download loathsxome.tar.gz ( from github.com/amenonsen/loathsxome )
Here 's a quick summary of the installation process :
Place loathsxome.cgi in your cgi -bin directory
Edit the file and set values in the configuration section
Create the data , plugin , and plugin state directories
Create template files , or edit the built - in templates
Copy plugins to the plugin directory
Optional : set up mod_rewrite rules for nicer URLs
Optional : set up git trigger to update the entry cache
For more details , see the INSTALL file in the distribution .
Documentation
I am aware that Loathsxome has inadequate documentation , and I consider this a serious bug .
The source code is well - documented , but there is no user manual .
I wrote the program for myself , at first with no intention to release it , and later with no expectation that more than a few of my friends would use it .
But that is not an excuse for poor documentation , and I would like to improve it .
Suggestions are welcome .
Please let me know if you have questions about any aspect of installing , using , or extending Loathsxome .
I will try to answer them and use the answers as the basis for better documentation .
( Knowing that the documentation would actually be useful to someone would provide motivation to write it . )
In the meantime , the Blosxom documentation may be useful .
Most of the ideas translate directly , but the details may differ slightly .
If you are at all familiar with Perl , the source code may help to explain those details .
Maintenance and feedback
Loathsxome does most of what I want from it , but I still enjoy working on it , and intend to add features as needed .
I already know that I want to implement static generation and port or modify a few Blosxom plugins ( e.g. archive links , search , and support for Atom feeds ) .
But in deciding what to do , I will pay more attention to features that people ask for , so if you use Loathsxome and would like to see something work differently , please send me mail , and I 'll try to help .
Questions about the code or how to use the program are also welcome .
If you find Loathsxome useful , I would be delighted to hear about it .
Some of Loathsxome 's functionality is implemented by the following plugins , which are all included in the distribution along with basic documentation .
filterdate
Show entries matching a date specified in the URL filtertag
Show entries matching one or more tags specified in the URL autotag Automatically tag posts based on the directory they are in paginate Split index views into pages and provide links to older and newer pages readmore Display " Read more " links for selected long posts pagetitle Defines values for the title and heading fulldate Defines some formatted date values for a post hidepreview Do n't display posts tagged " preview " unless they 're asked for explicitly metadata Process " meta : " lines in posts ( this is how posts are tagged ) entrycache Maintain a cache of file properties
Loathsxome looks for plugins in the configured plugin directory , and loads them in alphabetical order .
If you want to change that order , you can rename the plugin file to 01 foo to cause it to be loaded before 02 bar .
You can temporarily disable a plugin by renaming it to foo_ .
The distribution includes an example plugin that explains how and when each plugin function is called , and what it is expected to do .
It also includes a bundle that contains all of the plugins mentioned above .
In actual use , you may want to use the single plugin to reduce the number of files that must be opened to render each response .
Let me know if you have any questions about these plugins , or if you need help with writing your own plugins , or porting Blosxom plugins .
Git integration
I keep my web site in a git repository , and push changes to a repository on my web server .
I wanted to keep my journal entries in the same place , but git makes no attempt to preserve file mtimes , so posts were sometimes re-sorted inappropriately .
I looked at the various mtime - caching plugins for Blosxom , but did n't like the way they worked .
So I rolled my own solution .
I wrote a plugin which read " filename : mtime " lines from a file and used those values instead of the real mtimes .
Next , I added " meta : date=NNN " lines at the beginning of each post ( removing them before display using another plugin ) , and wrote a script to create the mtime cache based on that data .
Finally , I set that script up as a post - commit hook , so that every time I changed ( or added ) a post in the repository , a " meta : date=NNN " line would be added based on the current mtime , and the cache ( also under version control ) would be updated automatically .
This scheme works well for other kinds of metadata too ( e.g. " meta : tags=birds , language " ) .
The distribution includes the post - commit hook I use , and instructions on how to set it up .
( There 's one mild complication .
The way I have my repository set up , the Loathsxome data directory is under my web site 's DocumentRoot , which it really should n't be .
I papered over the problem with a " Deny from all " in the relevant htaccess file , but if I had to do it over , I would put it outside the DocumentRoot altogether . )
History
I first heard of Blosxom in 2004 , and I liked the idea enough to return to it when I needed something like it five years later .
I spent a couple of weeks trying to configure it — and a handful of plugins — to my liking , but I spent too much time trying to understand and fix bugs in the old code , and ended up rewriting most of it while trying to add tagging support and implementing the entry cache .
I did not want to rewrite Blosxom , but the reduced maintenance burden is sufficient to justify the effort .
Loathsxome does exactly what I want .
I did not intend to release it , but a few people have already expressed an interest in using it , so here it is .
Thanks to Mike Acar for his help during the preparation of the first Loathsxome release .
A Worldwide Bubble in Everything
The depression deepens .
“ These are not layoffs … they ’re permanent job losses , ” said Barry Ritholtz yesterday morning in his presentation at the Agora Financial Investment Symposium in Vancouver .
“ These people are not going back to work anytime soon . ”
That is the difference between a recession and a depression .
In a recession people get laid off … and then they are called back to work when things go back to normal .
But in a depression , they are let go permanently .
They exhaust their unemployment benefits and become desperate .
They must find new employment in new industries .
Because things cannot go back to normal ; normal is played out .
“ In the period , 2001 - 2007 , ” our old friend Mark Faber reminded us in his speech on Tuesday , “ the Fed managed to do something that had never before been done – create a worldwide bubble in just about everything .
Stocks , bonds , art , oil , housing – you name it ; it went up .
The only thing that did n’t go up was the dollar . ”
How did the Fed pull off such a remarkable achievement ?
Stimulus !
After a half a century of stimulus – with credit , inflation and the money supply growing faster and faster – the Fed put the pedal to the metal following the nano - recession of 2001 .
It dropped interest rates to just 1 % – well below the rate of consumer price inflation – and kept them there until an expansion had been going on for three years .
Stimulus stimulates .
By 2007 , the world economy was taking curves far too fast .
As we guessed , the stimulus did n’t stimulate nearly as well as the meddlers had hoped .
Instead of increasing real output in the US , it lured Americans to spend and speculate … and drove Chinese entrepreneurs to put up new factories in order to give them something to buy .
In America , debt grew 5 times faster than GDP ; for each dollar of extra income , Americans added $ 5.50 to their debt .
In China , manufacturing capacity grew faster than ever .
Whole industrial cities , the size of New York or Chicago , were added to the map – in a matter of just a few months .
Now the world has too many factories … and too many consumers with no money to consume with .
You ’ve heard us tell this tale many times .
You ’d probably like us to get on with it …and tell you how it turns out .
Instead , we keep looking back .
“ Bubbles had been localized in the past , ” Marc explained .
“ A bubble in one area drew investment from another area .
In one market , prices soared .
In another they slumped .
Overall , things did n’t change much . ”
But a worldwide bubble in everything is something new .
And it caused something else that is new – a worldwide crash .
We have been ducking explosions and stepping over the debris for the last two years .
One of the biggest and most obvious consequences of this worldwide bubble is unemployment .
Even Ben Bernanke says that joblessness could be a problem for years .
What to do about it ?
More stimulus !
“ The ( Fed ) believes that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will be appropriate for an extended period , ” he said on Tuesday .
Will this new stimulus succeed ?
Will the depression end soon ?
‘ No ’ is the right answer .
Instead , it must run its course .
It must eliminate plus capacity and reduce excess debt .
Until that is done , the job picture will get worse , not better .
Just look at what is happening in state and local governments .
The LA Times :
“ If the budget deal crafted by Governor Schwarzenegger and top legislative leaders is passed by the legislature and survives the inevitable court challenges , California will undergo perhaps the biggest down scaling of government in its history . ”
Downscaling government means fewer state - level jobs .
Fewer people drawing salaries from the government means more people looking for work elsewhere .
But they will not find it in the blown - up industries and zombie companies of 2009 .
They will have to wait …and wait …and wait …
In the race to downscale , California faces swift competition .
All over America …and in much of the English - speaking world … governments are forced to cut back .
Just look at what is happening in Ireland .
Here , we turn to The Telegraph in London :
“ Events have already forced Premier Brian Cowen to carry out the harshest assault yet seen on the public services of a modern Western state .
He has passed two emergency budgets to stop the deficit soaring to 15 pc of GDP .
They have not been enough .
The expert An Bord Snip report said last week that Dublin must cut deeper , or risk a disastrous debt compound trap .
“ A further 17,000 state jobs must go ( equal to 1.25 m in the US ) , though unemployment is already 12 pc and heading for 16 pc next year .
“ No doubt Ireland has been the victim of a savagely tight monetary policy – given its specific needs .
But the deeper truth is that Britain , Spain , France , Germany , Italy , the US , and Japan are in varying states of fiscal ruin , and those tipping into demographic decline ( unlike young Ireland ) have an underlying cancer that is even more deadly .
The West cannot support its gold - plated state structures from an aging workforce and depleted tax base . ”
Until tomorrow ,
Bill Bonner
The Daily Reckoning
Home > Archive > 2009 > August > 27 Health care in a nutshell Thursday , August 27 , 2009 by Dave Winer .
Health care is a lot like a fire department or police department .
You never know when it 's your house that 's going to be on fire , that 's why everyone pays equally for protection , and the person whose house burns gets the " benefit " if you can call having your house burn a benefit ( or getting very sick ) .
The main difference is that very few houses burn , but eventually everyone needs life - saving or end - of - life care .
Every responsible person must pay for care , and basically only the truly rich ( multi- millionaires ) can afford to self - insure .
If you assume that everyone has to pay for health insurance , then the question is how much do you want to pay .
In the US , our current system costs 16 % of GDP and we get less care , in some cases much less care than other rich countries that pay as little as 9 % of their GDP .
So we 're making poor choices here .
Obama 's plan is less comprehensive than the German , Canadian , French or Japanese plans .
In each of these other rich countries , health insurance is a non-profit business .
That does n't mean insurance companies do n't make money , they do , but not from health insurance .
Obama is n't promoting that ( although it 's not clear why ) .
And for 40 million Americans they might as well live in the third world , for them health care is based on their ability to pay out of pocket .
As long as they just get colds , they survive .
As soon as they need more care , they either go bankrupt or become disabled , or die .
This is their country too , they get a vote in how our system works .
You 're related to some of these people ( unless you have no family ) .
They 're the ones who should be standing in anger at the town halls .
And they 're not all poor , many of them are middle class or upper middle class , they just happen to not be profitable for the insurance industry .
These are the people whose houses burn to the ground when they catch fire .
The people who would vote against universal health insurance are stupidly cocky , because they will all need health care some day and for many of them it will not be there .
Sometimes they 're people who do n't smoke or are n't obese , who do n't have any personal bad habits .
People get sick for a lot of reasons that no one understands .
Maybe just bad luck or bad genes .
In the wrong place at the wrong time .
Bottom - line , we could spend a lot less money on health care and take care of everyone .
Instead we 're opting on the worst approach , we spend a lot more , and a huge portion of the populace is n't cared for and the rest of us are treated not as patients but as profit centers .
If you happen to need health care , you can't get it .
This is some kind of way to run a country ?
Yikes .
If you want to understand what our options are , I highly recommend listening to the FreshAir interview with T.R. Reid , who has just written a book on health care systems around the world .

Leave Us a Comment , Would You Use Maggot Therapy ?
( OrganicJar ) Maggot therapy is the use of maggots , or fly larvae , to clean and promote healing in open wounds .
Also known as Maggot Debridement Therapy ( MDT ) , it is one of the safest and most effective ways to treat open wounds that are either infected or covered in dead flesh .
The larvae used for maggot therapy are raised in clean fly farms , and disinfected prior to use in either humans or animals .
The most common types of fly larvae used are from green flies and blow flies , although other species of flies may also be used .
The use of maggot therapy to treat wounds has been round for hundreds of years ; there is even proof of it being used in ancient Mayan civilization .
It was also used during Europe 's Renaissance period .
Many of the most notable stories about the use of maggot therapy , however , come from times of war .
The medics during the American Civil War , during which medical supplies were scarce , made great use of maggots to treat war wounds , probably saving hundreds of lives .
Maggots were also used in both of the World Wars .
There are several ways that maggots facilitate the healing of wounds .
The first way is to eat the necrotic , or dead , flesh , making it easier for new skin to grow .
They also eat any bacteria in the wound .
The secretions of maggots contain several types of antibacterial matter , which kills any bacteria the maggots have not eaten while also preventing any new bacteria from infecting the wound .
Maggots also massage the wound as they move around , which also helps to encourage healing and the growth of new skin .

Just how much could the bailout of the financial system end up costing American taxpayers ?
Neil M. Barofsky , the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program set up by the Treasury Department , came up with the largest number yet in testimony prepared for delivery Tuesday to a House committee .
“ The total potential federal government support could reach up to $ 23.7 trillion , ” he stated .
But in the report accompanying his testimony , Mr. Barofsky conceded the number was vastly overblown .
It includes estimates of the maximum cost of programs that have already been canceled or that never got under way .
It also assumes that every home mortgage backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac goes into default , and all the homes turn out to be worthless .
It assumes that every bank in America fails , with not a single asset worth even a penny .
And it assumes that all of the assets held by money market mutual funds , including Treasury bills , turn out to be worthless .
It would also require the Treasury itself to default on securities purchased by the Federal Reserve system .

Make threatening advances towards the bear 's young , the bear will stand down in fear that you might harm the young ?
Lie still and be quiet , " playing dead " will cause the bear to cease attacking ?
Attack the bear in its eyes and snout , forcing it to back away ?
Question 2 of 7 During an intrepid exploration of the undergrowth , you have the misfortune of falling into a patch of quicksand .
How do you go about escaping ?
Do you ...
Sink to the bottom and walk out ?
Flail to the nearest solid ground and attempt to pull yourself out ?
Struggle to the surface , moving as much as possible in order to stop sinking any further ?
Escape from quicksand ?
No one escapes from quicksand .
Use a walking pole and lay the pole across the sand and flop onto your back in order to prevent yourself from sinking , and then keep positioning the pole under you until you make it to safety ?
Question 3 of 7 During a mountain expedition , you stumble badly .
The resulting fall breaks a bone in your leg .
Do you ...
Reset the bone with your bare hands and use a makeshift crutch as walking support ?
Use two stiff objects as splints above and below the injured area , tie these in place , but not so tight as to cut off circulation ?
Walk it off , it should be fine if you put some weight on it ?
Tie a tourniquet just above the injured area , this will help with recovery ?
Question 4 of 7
Whilst escaping from bad guys , they ram your holiday rental car into a lake , how do you escape ?
Do you ...
Let the car sink , then drive to safety along the bottom ?
Open or smash the windows as quickly as possible and climb out ?
Wait until the car fills up with water , the pressure will equalise , then force a door / window open ?
Activate all of the airbags , causing the car to float to the surface ?
Question 5 of 7
During a relaxing swim in the ocean , you spot the tell - tale dorsal fin of a shark rapidly approaching you .
It 's out for blood .
Do you ...
Hit it in the nose , as this is the most sensitive area , thus dazing the shark and allowing for your swift exit ?
Swim towards it , making noises like a bear ( sharks hate bears ) ?
Repeatedly jab it in the eyes and gills , indicating that you are not defenceless ?
Dazzle it with something shiny , this will confuse the shark and it will leave you be ?
Float motionless on your back / front , the shark will get bored and leave ?
Question 6 of 7
Much to your disbelief , a man has decided to simultaneously both stab and shoot you .
You need immediate treatment .
Do you ...
Immediately remove any imbedded objects ( e.g. bullets , knife blade ) so that blood flow can be stemmed more easily ?
Leave any impaled objects alone , as removing them may lead to additional blood loss , then control the bleeding ( via applied pressure , tourniquets , etc ) ?
Lie as still as possible , this will reduce blood circulation and therefore blood loss via wounds ?
Cover the injured area with mayonnaise , as mayonnaise has natural healing abilities and will aid with recovery ?
Get your friendly dog companion to lick your wounds , as canine saliva has proven healing properties ?
" Terrorists could take that ankle bracelet off with a saw and strap it to a dog and let them run around , " Moul said .
" We need to know if these people are returning to the war to fight against America . "

Although every lie detector ever built has proved unreliable , scientists continue to search for that magic machine that will reveal dishonesty .
Now two Harvard neuroscientists have hit on a " pre-crime " technique that reveals intent to lie before it happens .

While some people already think that brain - imaging lie detectors are a scam , others remain convinced that they 're the wave of the future .
A recent study by Joshua Greene and Joseph Paxton at Harvard University shows that the skeptics might be right .

Paxton and Greene bet their subjects money based on guessing a coin flip .
While those who had to record their responses in advance had average success , those who did n't have to tell their guess until after they knew the result had a high success rate , indicating they were lying .
More interestingly , those people who were even interested in lying showed brain activity when just offered the opportunity to cheat , while those who were more honest showed no difference in their brain activity regardless of the opportunity to cheat .
Over time , Greene and Paxton were able to predict whether certain volunteers would lie at all .
They expect that their machine could be developed not just to determine whether someone was lying or had lied , but if they were interested in doing so or would in the future .
You always knew your brain would eventually betray you .
The question is , how useful is this information really ?
Does n't everyone want to lie sometimes , including people who are honest ?

In fact , non- mesh hernia repair surgeries were commonplace for over 100 year .
However , many surgeons in those days could not properly perform the non-mesh surgery and as a result recurrence was high , over 20 percent .
“ Since the 1980s , there has been an increase in mesh - based hernia repairs — by 2000 , non-mesh repairs represented less than 10 % of groin hernia repair techniques . ”
FDA
However , “ In the right patients , some groin hernias can be repaired without mesh and still have acceptable success rates . ”
Stonybrook medicine “ In the right patients , some groin hernias can be repaired without mesh and still have acceptable success rates .
Additionally , some small hernias at the belly button can be repaired with suture alone .
Most repairs , though , do utilize prosthetic mesh to achieve a successful repair . ”
Id .
According to the FDA , hernia surgeries could be either Laparoscopic or Open repair .
There are non-mesh alternatives for both laparscopic and open repair .
Surgical
Laparoscopic –
The surgeon makes several small incisions in the abdomen that allow surgical tools into the openings to repair the hernia .
Laparoscopic surgery can be performed with or without surgical mesh .
– The surgeon makes several small incisions in the abdomen that allow surgical tools into the openings to repair the hernia .
Laparoscopic surgery can be performed with or without surgical mesh .
Open Repair–
The surgeon makes an incision near the hernia and the weak muscle area is repaired .
Open repair can be done with or without surgical mesh .
Open repair that uses sutures without mesh is referred to as primary closure .
Primary closure is used to repair inguinal hernias in infants , small hernias , strangulated or infected hernias .
( Source FDA )
There is also natural tissue hernia repair
The Shouldice Hernia Hospital in Ontario Canada , for example , does not implant hernia mesh in any hernia surgery it performs Instead , Shouldice Hernia Hospital uses natural tissue procedure without utilizing hernia mesh .
Shouldice ’s procedure relies upon a patient ’s own natural tissue to repair the hernia as opposed to using a mesh to cover the affected area .
The hospital ’s operating theory is only to use mesh as a last possible resort in the rare instance where the patient ’s surrounding tissue is not strong enough to support fixing the hernia .
In only a handful of cases , the patient ’s tissue is heavily damaged or weakened or the hernia is simply too large to fix without mesh .
The hospital will also consider the use of the mesh to repair hernia that have recurred several times .
However , Shouldice operates from the premise that mesh is not the first option for the best possible surgical outcome given the problems that have arisen from the use of hernia mesh .
In fact , Shouldice ’s founding occurred over 10 years before hernia mesh began to be used , and they never adopted the practice .
Shouldice will not use mesh in a direct inguinal hernia or an indirect inguinal hernia repair .
The hospital will almost always administer patients a full IV during surgery for patients to be as comfortable as possible during the procedure .
Dr. Michael Reinhorn of Boston Hernia for example , began “ offering no mesh shouldice repair in 2015 . ”
Boston hernia ’s website indicated , ” While we expect the long - term outcomes of the Shouldice repair to reveal a higher rate of hernia recurrence , this repair is a reasonable alternative for some patients . ”

Footage has emerged of the Queen appearing to express mild irritation at Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for being too noisy .
The incident took place as the Queen posed with world leaders from the G20 summit in the traditional " family " photograph at Buckingham Palace .
Mr Berlusconi then shouted " Mr Obama " , prompting Her Majesty to turn around in mock frustration at the noise .
Buckingham Palace have denied that any offence was taken by the Queen .
The footage has been placed on the YouTube website and has quickly proved to be a popular clip .
' Loud and jolly '
A palace spokeswoman said the atmosphere at the reception , during which the photograph was taken , had been " warm and friendly " .
" It was loud and jolly and very jovial , there were no gaffes and no offence taken , " she said .
The Queen and Mr Berlusconi had earlier chatted as the world leaders gathered in the palace 's picture gallery .
Mr Berlusconi has developed a reputation for his outspoken comments and playful behaviour , even on the world stage .
Last year he was filmed apparently playing " hide and seek " with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , hiding behind a large column as she walked past .
And he was also criticised for describing Barack Obama as " young , handsome and tanned " .
The Italian leader accused his critics of being humourless " imbeciles " .
Meanwhile , Mr Berlusconi has confirmed that the G20 will hold a third summit on the financial crisis later this year in Japan , to follow up world leaders ' meetings in London this week and in Washington in November .

The Barefoot Bum posts a passage from George Orwell criticizing Anarchism for its apparent tendency for transparent totalitarianism .
For Orwell and TBB , people acting as per the social norms is the worst kind of dictatorship , while having actual dictators who tell you what you cannot do is “ obviously ” far superior , because among the things you can do , you have more freedom .
First , lets take a step back and see how our current society works .
Is it true that people in the current society only live according to what they can not do ?
Do they abide by the few restrictions and then go wildly in all directions on everything else ?
Even a casual observation of society shows the falsity of such a view .
Truth is , people do currently abide by social norms and public opinion to a large degree .
Do you see people running naked around ?
Do you see people making physical contact with strangers ( at least in western society ) ?
There ’s a lot of things people do not do , even though the freedom is there .
Is this totalitarianism ?
Of course some people still do “ eccentric ” acts even when it goes against the public opinion , but it is a baseless assertion to claim that the same would not happen in Anarchism .
Why not ?
In fact , there is nothing that would stop this .
A social rules and laws are not black and white .
It ’s not that we have some definite laws and then freedom .
It ’s that we have a gradual scale of rules which move in the intensity of social disapproval .
We start from simple etiquette , progress through unwritten rules and eventually reach the definite “ laws ” that one is not allowed to break .
All the rules in this scale are decided via public opinion .
Yes . including Laws .
Laws do not spring up from nothingness , nor are they inherent rules of the universe that some “ bright minds ” have discovered .
The distinguishing thing is that the power to decide the unbreakable rules in an authoritarian system ( such as any statist system , from Representative Democracy to a Marxist - Leninist dictatorship ) is granted only to a privileged few .
The original and basic laws that will be passed ( such as respect for human life etc ) will be based on pre-existing social rules of the same type and thus will seem natural , but many of the rest of the laws will be decided arbitrarily by the ruling elite and may even come in opposition to the public opinion .
The rest of the social norms , such as etiquette or unwritten rules will remain in the enforcement of the public , as has always been the case .
Now the fallacy that Orwell is commiting is to assert that if the ruling elite is taken away , if the power to decide the laws is taken away from the few , then all social rules will become laws .
That is , people will start treating rules of etiquette with the same contempt and opposition as murder .
This is the only way that one can be forced out of eccentricity and conform with every rule the public opinion decides .
But this is absurd .
There is nothing to make us believe that if the power to decide and enforce the strictest rules ( laws ) in a society is decentralized , there will be no gradual scale and no freedom anymore .
This is a mental jump that just makes no sense to take .
In Anarchism then , the only difference from an authoritarian system is who hold the power to decide and enforce the laws .
The statist will tell you that it ’s better for the enlightened few to make those decisions but I do n’t think I need to point out the utopianism of the “ enlightened few ” concept .
The Anarchist will tell you that since laws are in any case taken from what the public opinion already does , it makes no sense to take this power away from the people .
To do so is to simply invite abuse and stagnation into our society .
Abuse from those who would pass arbitrary laws only to benefit themselves and stagnation from making it difficult to modify the laws when public opinion does not agree with them in the same intensity anymore ( for example a law becoming an unwritten rule , such as in the case of nudity . )
To allow the public to decide its rules is not to have absolute conformity with the public opinion as this is impossible for the non-major things .
For public opinion includes every one of us and all of us .
The less important the act , the more diverse and therefore weak this “ public opinion ” becomes .

BY MID - MORNING on August 20th , election day , the police standing outside the Haji Janat Gul High School , a polling centre a few miles east of Kabul , estimated it had been visited by just four lorries , carrying a score of voters each , and three or four cars .
After long conflicts , the second set of elections is often a story of unrealistic expectation turned to disillusion and apathy .
Across Kabul , turnout was sluggish .
But at Haji Janat
Gul the lack of voters had not dented the tally of votes .
Only an hour after voting began , 6,000 had been cast .
Yet not a voter was in sight .
Staff insisted that the 6,000 had all come at 7 am , when polls opened : “ The Taliban said that they would cut off the fingers of people voting so they came early . ”
This was impossible .
Typically it takes four minutes to vote .
For 6,000 to have voted in an hour at the 12 ballot boxes , they would have had an average of seven seconds each .
The Electoral Complaints Commission later received allegations that the ballot boxes had been stuffed for President Hamid Karzai before polls opened , at the instigation of a local MP and tribal leader .
Three interlocking factors shaped the Afghan election day : large disparities in turnout across the country ; the threat of Taliban violence ; and allegations , as yet largely unproved , of systematic electoral fraud on behalf of Mr Karzai .
Western military commanders claimed that the Taliban had failed to disrupt the election , with only 26 people killed on polling day .
But the Taliban 's strategy was one of intimidation , designed to deter rather than kill voters .
In that they were successful .
During the poll there were some 400 insurgent incidents , making it the most violent day this year .
Many seemed intended just to register the presence of insurgents in the area .
In Wardak , for instance , a rocket landed in the general area of every polling centre .
Threats to cut off fingers marked with the indelible ink used to prevent double voting turned out to be almost entirely baseless .
But they worked as a deterrent .
In a relatively benign northern arc , from Herat in the west to Nangarhar in the east , turnout was as high as 60 % in some areas , though in Nangarhar it fell to about 35 % , and overall turnout was well below the level achieved in the previous presidential poll in 2004 .
In parts of the south , however , intimidation and apathy kept turnout extremely low .
“ The Taliban are patrolling the area .
Nobody voted and nobody could vote , ” said Haji Ahmad Shah Khan , an elder in Nad Ali district of Helmand .
On election day the chief of the Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) in Helmand , Abdul Hadee , estimated turnout in the province at under 10 % .
In some districts no votes were cast at all .
Results have not yet been collated , and the outcome remains unpredictable .
Both Mr Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah ( pictured above ) , his main rival among the 41 candidates , have already claimed victory .
In his campaign Mr Karzai mortgaged his future government several times over for the support of a rogue 's gallery of former warlords .
The first published results , of 10 % of the polling stations , showed the rivals almost neck and neck .
But there was little to be drawn from this since results will vary massively across different provinces , following varied turnout and divisions by ethnicity and tribe .
Many of the southern provinces that are Mr Karzai 's ethnic - Pushtun heartlands have yet to be counted .
The suppressed vote across the south would seem likely to harm Mr Karzai , but his opponents accuse him of using the state apparatus to engage in a large - scale fraud , with the absence of observers in unstable areas allowing him to stuff ballot boxes freely .
Indeed some unstable areas have returned more votes than early estimates of turnout would suggest .
In Helmand , for instance , Western officials believe that in the district of Garmser about 5,000 people voted .
But the ballot boxes arriving in the provincial capital , Lashkar Gah , contain about 20,000 .
In Musa Qala the discrepancy was between 9,000 and 18,000 .
Mr Hadee , the IEC official , now says that turnout in Helmand was 25 % .
Some Western officials reckon 20 % of votes nationally may be fraudulent .
Electoral complaints passed the 1,000 mark in mid-week .
However , proving them will be hard .
Afghans often vote in blocks according to the dictates of local leaders , so irregularities are almost impossible to spot .
Millions of extra voting cards are known to have been illegally registered .
There has been no recent census to establish lists of voters .
So the country is entering dangerous waters .
Dr Abdullah has promised to place his faith in the IEC and the Complaints Commission , and not to send his supporters onto the streets .
This will earn him the gratitude of foreign powers .
But the ethnic dimension to the election , with Dr Abdullah seen as a Tajik ( he is actually of mixed ethnicity ) and Mr Karzai as a Pushtun , has forced an underlying tension within Afghan society close to the surface .
“ The biggest danger is that Afghans will view their government as even more illegitimate than they already do , ” says John Dempsey , in Kabul for United States Institute of Peace , a Congressional think - tank .
And as he notes , that would have consequences for the counterinsurgency .

While we might continuously debate glossy vs. matte screens , the visual aesthetics of a translucent dock , or the value of MobileMe , few issues in the Apple community generate as emotional an response as Mac security .
One extreme considers the Mac an unassailable platform immune to the problems plaguing Windows users , while the other tells us that a Mac Security Armageddon is just around the corner .
But the vast majority of Mac users merely want to know what risks they really face , and how to keep their system safe .
On May 26 , Macworld republished a controversial Computerworld article by Ira Winkler suggesting that Apple is “ grossly negligent ” when it comes to security , and should be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission for false advertising .
The author was motivated to write this piece based on Apple ’s recent failure to patch a known Java security flaw that was fixed on other platforms nearly six months ago .
While the article raises some legitimate issues , it ’s filled with hyperbole , inaccurate interpretations , and reaches the wrong conclusions .
Here ’s what you really need to know about the Java situation , Mac security in general , and the important lesson on how we control Apple ’s approach to security .
The article is absolutely correct in that Apple clearly bungled the Java security patch , placing Mac users at risk in the process .
This is n’t the first time Apple has failed to patch a known security issue in a timely fashion , and it reveals a major weakness in the company ’s security program .
Mac OS X , like other operating systems , relies heavily on third - party components or programs .
Since Apple does n’t necessarily control the code , it is reliant on the software ’s developers to manage any security vulnerabilities that come up .
This is a pretty common situation in the software world , and companies typically develop relationships with whoever controls the code they include ( even if it ’s open - source software ) to coordinate updating their products when patches are released for the underlying programs .
Since , once a patch is released , the details of a vulnerability become public , it ’s important for all software using that code to be patched at the same time , so no one is left exposed .
Most computers are compromised using known , unpatched vulnerabilities rather than new , unknown flaws .
Apple has a poor history here , often failing to provide OS X security fixes for flaws fixed on other platforms days , weeks , or even months earlier .
We ’ve seen Mac users exposed to known vulnerabilities in WebKit ( Safari ) , Samba ( Windows file sharing ) , DNS ( networking ) , MDNS ( Bonjour ) , Apache ( web server ) , Java , and more .
This is an extremely serious problem , and one Apple is rightly criticized for .
All Mac users are at risk due to the Java vulnerability , and should immediately take actions to protect themselves .
Had Apple issued a patch with everyone else , we would n’t be so exposed .
While there ’s no legitimate excuse for Apple ’s failure to patch , Winkler ’s article misinterprets the facts in its call for government involvement .
Yes , Macs are plagued with as many ( and sometimes more ) vulnerabilities as other operating systems .
These are the doors attackers use to exploit our systems , and Macs are far from invulnerable .
But the truth is that in the real world , Macs suffer from far fewer compromises .
This is the difference between security and safety .
A highly secure home in a bad neighborhood is still more likely to be robbed than a less secure home in a safer area .
Mac market share is probably an important reason here , as is the history of the platform , the focus of the bad guys , and a host of other factors .
Should the FTC ever make that fateful call to Cupertino , Apple can show a track record of customer safety , even with lower security .
While Macs are theoretically more exposed to attacks than current versions of Windows , despite all the OS X vulnerabilities there are only a couple handfuls of malicious Mac software programs in the wild , and not a single widely seen self propagating virus .
Macs do get compromised , but currently at a rate far lower than Windows systems .
Apple advertises that Mac users are safer , and , practically speaking , they are .
Until those vulnerabilities and Apple mishaps result in actual , wide exploitation of its users it ’s mighty hard to call those advertisements grossly negligent .
To steal Mr. Winkler ’s analogy , if an automobile manufacturer advertised having safer cars than its competitors , and their customers suffered fewer accidents with less injuries , even if the car was a theoretical death trap it might be hard to build a case for negligence .
Besides , the FTC would then have to go after nearly every other major software company that ’s made false claims as to the effectiveness of security or other features in their products , instantly slamming us back into the stone age .
The real failure of this , and many other , calls for Mac security is that they fail to accurately identify those who are really responsible for Apple ’s current security situation .
It is n’t security researchers , malicious attackers , or even Apple itself , but Apple ’s customers .
Apple is an incredibly successful company because it produces products that people purchase .
We still buy MacBooks despite the lack of a matte screen , for example .
And until we tell Apple that security will affect our buying decisions , there ’s little motivation for the company to change direction .
Think of it from Apple ’s perspective — Macs may be inherently less secure , but they are safer than the competition in the real world , and users are n’t reducing what they spend on Apple because of security problems .
There is reasonable coverage of Mac security issues in the mainstream press ( Mr. Winkler ’s claim to the contrary ) , but without demonstrable losses it has yet to affect consumer behavior .
If Macs start being compromised on a wide scale , or security concerns otherwise start affecting buying decisions , no amount of Apple advertising will be able to cover it up .
Market forces will engage , and Apple will either provide a more secure platform , or we ’ll all move on to something else .
The more we pressure Apple for security , and not just relative safety , the less likely we are to experience future real - world security compromises .
Our Mac security future is in our hands , not the government ’s , attackers ’ , or even Apple’s .

TAM Music Factory 週刊アスキ ー 2009 年11月10日号 に「 SOLITUDE 」が掲載されました。
Most of us first met up with others in our communities to walk together to Times Square .
My group joined some other groups at St. Vincent 's hospital in downtown Manhattan .
The weather was n't great , but a few people made the best of it .
As of this morning , we had about 85 signups for our walk ; 130 people showed up .
We took that as a good sign .
We learned last night that the Bill Moyers Show would be walking with us .
Here they are interviewing one of the volunteers .
At 12:30 , we headed to Times Square .
Our group was the first to arrive at the rally site .
But groups from all over the city arrived shortly after .
By 1:30 , one area was completely full and the police opened a second in the next block .
Creative New Yorkers made some fantastic signs .
Including kossack mindoca ( R ) , who get really inspired last night and created this beauty .
She 's here with javelina .
I also saw sidnora , brooklynweaver and skrp23 .
It was great running into so many kossacks .
And I ran into Baratunde -- I guess I was briefly on his streaming phone thing ...
I was n't entirely sure what was going on , and thought he was taking our picture together .
I am so not ready for prime time .
And I spotted Living Liberally 's Justin Krebs in the crowd , but did n't get a chance to say " hi . "
There seemed to be a lot of media interest in what we were doing .
There were a lot of speakers , including Congresspeople Caroline Maloney , Jerry Nadler ...
and Yvette Clarke
The best speakers were ( not so surprisingly ) the non-politicians .
One of the highlights was Jonathan Arend , from the National Physicians '
Alliance , who shared how hard it is to a doctor and not be able to give people the care they need because private insurance wo n't cover it .
Perhaps most impactful was Jessica Silk , who recently finished grad school where she studied public health , but who has n't had health insurance herself .
She starts a new job soon which will provide coverage in two months .
She said that in the meantime she would continue the plan she has , which is a " knock on wood " plan .
But the real heros of the day are the grassroots leaders who have been working tirelessly on this issue and put together this impressive rally .
I hate to do shout - outs , because I 'm sure I 'll miss some of the main people , but here are photos of some people who deserve a big " thanks . "
Here 's Naomi ( the one NOT in a white coat ) who was one of the main organizers the rally .
Amy was another main rally organizer .
Both Naomi and Amy have been organizing all kinds of health care events over the past months .
Amy is shown with Lamont , our emcee and the best " fired - upper " EVER .
Nina is one of the main people behind NYC for Change and today 's rally .
With her are Lamont and Geoff Berman , a NY field director with Organizing for America .
Thanks Geoff for all you did to make the rally a big success .
Tim Foley is a rock star of health care reform and organizing .
If you have n't been reading his blog , you should .
We are so lucky to have him working on this issue here in NY !
I 've left off way too many key people , but that 's the way it goes .
Thank you to everyone involved : Anne , Alan , Allie , Mark , Ethan , etc. , etc. , etc .
And thanks to all the group and community organizers who got their volunteers out on a rainy summer Saturday .
Today New York showed that we are ready to Get This Done !
UPDATE : I have to head out for dinner shortly , but will check comments when I get back .
If this diary inspires you , check out all the townhalls , rallies and other events kath25 found yesterday .
We 're rounding up all the great health care events we can find every day .
Find an event near you and GO !
UPDATE 2 : Someone in the comments mentioned that Anima has a great photo diary up of the Portland Oregon rally today .
Go check it out .
Also Bria posted a great diary with more photos from the Times Square rally .
Road signs can be tri-lingual , reflecting each language 's traditional names Israeli transport chiefs have unveiled a plan to replace traditional Arabic and English place names on road signs , keeping only their Hebrew versions .
It means biblical locations such as Nazareth and Caesarea will come to be identified as Natsrat and Kesriya .
The Transport Ministry planners said a lack of uniform spelling on road signs caused confusion for drivers .
Israeli Arabs said it is an attempt to erase the Arabic language and heritage which predates the modern Israel .
" [ Transport Minister Yisrael ]
Katz is mistaken if he thinks that changing a few words can erase the existence of the Arab people , " said Arab MP Ahmed Tibi .
Currently most Israeli road signs are written in Hebrew , Arabic and English , using the traditional names in each language .
Jerusalem is identified as " Yerushalaim " in Hebrew , " Jerusalem " in English , and " al - Quds " in Arabic ( along with " Yerushalaim " written in Arabic script ) .
Under the new policy the Holy City will only be identified as Yerushalaim in all three languages .
Jaffa , near Tel Aviv , which still has a sizeable community of Arabs who trace their ancestry to pre-1948 Palestine , will in future be written as Hebraised Yafo .
Not allowed " The lack of uniform spelling on signs has been a problem for those speaking foreign languages , citizens and tourists alike , " said Yeshaayahu Ronen , of the Transportation Planning Department .
Some Palestinian maps still refer to the Israeli cities by their pre-1948 names .
I will not allow that on our signs .
Transport Minister Yisrael Katz However , speaking to the Ynet news website , Transport Minister Yisrael Katz hinted that there might indeed be an underlying political motive for the plan .
" Some Palestinian maps still refer to the Israeli cities by their pre-1948 names " [ before Israel was founded ] , said Mr Katz .
" I will not allow that on our signs .
This government , and certainly this minister , will not allow anyone to turn Jewish Jerusalem to Palestinian al - Quds . "
He said areas in the occupied West Bank where Israel exercises civil control would keep their Arabic road signs , so Nablus would not become the Hebrew Shechem .
A right - wing coalition came to power in April including ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party , which has demanded Israel 's Arab minority demonstrate greater loyalty to the Jewish state .
Israel 's one million Arab citizens make up about one - fifth of the population and they frequently complain of being marginalised and discriminated against by the Jewish - majority state .
The Transport Ministry said changes would be gradual , and no existing sign would be changed unless it needs replacing due to wear .

Remember that online games are written by humans and thus are subject to the bugs and flaws that humans are so good at introducing .
This was made quite evident by an article for the current issue of 2600 : The Hacker Quarterly that a former coworker of mine wrote .
It ’s an interesting read and I encourage you to check it out , though it is only in print on dead trees .
In this article he describes a flaw that became apparent to him within a newly released BlackJack game on the Paradise Poker website .
In BlackJack , when the dealer is showing an ace , the dealer offers the players the option to purchase insurance .
This is a way for the players to pay to cut their losses should the dealer have ten ( 10 , Jack , Queen , or King ) in the hole .
On this particular online game , he noticed that when the dealer did have a pocket ten , there would be a noticeable pause before he was prompted with the Insurance request .
When there was n’t a pocket ten , the prompt appeared immediately .
After doing some quick calculations , he realized this bit of information gave him an edge over the house .
He ended up playing the next seven hours exploiting this bug and made a nice chunk of change during that time .
Obviously I do n’t know what caused the flaw in the game , but my guess is that there was some calculation the system needed to make to determine whether or not to offer insurance .
That calculation may have taken more time to perform in the situation the dealer had a ten .
Let ’s pretend I am right ( not a huge stretch as I am always right ) and think about that for a sec .
The code itself may have been completely correct in the sense that it did what it was supposed to do .
It was the amount of time the code needed to execute that ended up being the tell .
No different than when a poker player twitches when holding a great hand .
The fix may have been to change the execution profile of the code so that it made the same pause no matter what was in the hole .
Talk about a challenge for game developers .
Not only does the code need to be bug free in syntax and semantics , but they now need to worry about the execution profile for their games .
Who knows if there are several other timing flaws like this in other games .
It did n’t even require my friend to hack into anything .
He simply observed the timing disparity .
Now imagine if he was running a timing program specifically designed to look for other timing flaws .
Something that would notice discrepancies down to the millisecond .
Bitter taste after eating for days – caused by pine nuts ?
I started to get a bitter taste in my mouth after eating .
At first I thought I was going to die so I Googled on it – how many people a minute go through that process !
My scatter gun approach to diagnosis came up with a series of suggestions .
I either had jaundice or I was diabetic or I had eaten pine nuts ( possibly from China ) in the last few days .
My skin is n’t yellow and my pee is n’t orange and I am not thirsty all the time but I had eaten a new kind of pine nut in the last few days so the third option looks like it warrants attention .
After Googling start blogging .
There is a very short scientific - like paper out there Taste disturbances after pine nut ingestion .
In the initial case the pine nuts were oxidized and not fit for consumption but six other cases are mentioned and it is not clear if these were oxidized .
A test subject also consumed two portions of nuts which I guess they would n’t do if they were oxidized .
Importantly there was no fungal contamination , no pesticide contamination and they did n’t know what species of tree the nuts were from but they had come from China .
The wikipedia pine nut page currently summarises and has a few links to discussion groups where the effect is mentioned .
Now I eat pine nuts a lot ( I am a veggie ) and this is the first time this has happened .
It is also the first time I have had ‘ Baby ’ pine nuts which were sold as being small .
My theory is that these are actually a different species of pine nut .
This would be fun to investigate .
What candidates do we have among commonly eaten pine nut species ( according to Wikipedia )
Pinus gerardiana , known as the Chilgoza Pine , ‘ noosa ’ , or ‘ neoza ’ , is a pine native to the northwestern Himalaya in eastern Afghanistan , Pakistan , and northwest India , growing at elevations between 1800 - 3350 m .
It often occurs in association with Blue Pine ( Pinus wallichiana ) and Deodar Cedar ( Cedrus deodara ) . ( Wikipedia ) – This is a possible one .
Are its seeds smaller than P. koraiensis I wonder ?
Pinus koraiensis is Korean Pine .
It is native to eastern Asia , Manchuria , far eastern Russia , Korea and central Japan .
Korean
Pine differs from the closely related Siberian Pine in having larger cones with reflexed scale tips , and longer needles .
The seeds are extensively harvested and sold as pine nuts , particularly in northeastern China ; it is the most widely traded pine nut in international commerce .
–
Very likely .
( Wikipedia )
Pinus pinea Stone Pine ( or Umbrella Pine ) Native of Southern Europe in the Mediterranean region ( Wikipedia ) – not likely contender .
Pinus edulis Colorado Pinyon or Two - needle Pinyo is native to the United States and so not likely contender .
Pinus cembroides Mexican Pinyon – mexican so not likely to bother us .
Pinus monophylla Single - leaf Pinyon – USA native so not likely to bother us .
Looks like there are two contenders .
Common things happen commonly so I have probably been eating P. koraiensis for years as it is the most commonly traded .
Perhaps these new seeds are P. gerardiana ?
I will investigate further .

Over the past year I 've had a problem .
Whether in public places or in the privacy of my home , I 've had involuntary spasms that have resulted in sexual climax .
At first , I believed it to be nothing more than coincidence , as the first few times were triggered by sexual arousal .
But since then , it 's evolved to normal activity such as in the middle of office meetings .
Or in the grocery store buying oranges .
About nine months ago , I went to see a doctor about it and he prescribed me pills , which I still believe are over - the - counter tic -tacs .
About five months ago , I came out with the problem to a close friend and he recommended male enhancement pills , as they would concentrate on circulating the flow of fluids differently .
I tried that and ended up one day with an eighteen - inch erection .
This caused me to pass out from loss of blood circulation .
I woke up eleven hours later in a puddle of my own semen .
ever since then it 's been worse .
There 's been more flow each time and more and more I feel drained after each time
It 's happened .
I 've even seen traces of blood in it a few times .
I have a feeling if I do n't stop this , my body will be permanently screwed up .
Does anyone have solutions ?

This section explains in detail how I accomplished the trip .
There 's lots of information about the moped , the gear I took , costs , distances traveled , how I lived on the road , and so on .
Please note that I no longer own a moped .
I gave away the moped that made this trip quite a number of years ago , due to lack of storage space for it , and I have n't owned a moped since .
Therefore I am unable to answer any questions about current moped brands , features , prices , etc .
However , I welcome any other comments that you have about this trip and moped riding and traveling .
Please email me .

The Moped I used a 1978 Mobylette moped , purchased brand new before the trip .
I took one test trip on it before the main trip .
I left Toronto with 755 miles on it .
However , I had put about 21,000 miles on my previous moped over a period of 3 years traveling around Ontario and eastern Canada .
It was also a Mobylette .
I took this older moped apart for spare parts and left them at home , ready to be sent to me if needed .
See " Preparations " , below ...
Preparations for the Trip Prior moped experience : I first started traveling by moped in 1975 .
I traveled about 6000 miles that summer and the next , all over southern and northern Ontario .
In 1977 I spent the entire summer traveling by moped in the eastern provinces of Canada ( Quebec , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Newfoundland , Prince Edward Island ) .
Altogether I put about 21,000 miles ( 33,600 km ) on my first moped .
It was the same brand and model that I took on the 1978 trip to Yukon , Alaska and NWT .
Those three summers of traveling by moped gave me the practice and knowledge I needed to make the 1978 trip .
I learned how to repair the moped , what parts were most likely to break down or cause trouble , and what tools I needed to bring .
Prior camping and traveling experience :
In 1973 I spent most of the summer on a work project in a Native Indian community in northern Ontario .
I slept outside most of the summer .
I had made several long distance bicycle trips around Ontario prior to 1978 ( in addition to the numerous moped trips ) .
In 1974 , when I was 17 years old , I bicycled 800 miles up to northern Ontario .
From there I hitchhiked for 4 months : west to British Columbia ( Vancouver , Prince Rupert ) , Yukon and Alaska , and back across Canada to Nova Scotia , and then back to Ontario in October .
I also gained a lot of hitchhiking experience on later trips .
In 1976 I started to travel a little by car as well .
But the moped remained my preferred method .
And I still preferred to camp .
As well , by 1978 I had made numerous backpacking and canoeing trips in Ontario 's wilderness .
Overall , I loved being outdoors and on the road , and I loved the sense of uncertainty and adventure that comes with that .
It was when I was traveling outdoors in the wild areas that I felt most alive .
I also enjoyed the simplicity that came with traveling light , with a minimum of belongings .
So all in all , by 1978 I was no stranger to camping , traveling , and being outdoors !
Support system : Prior to leaving on the 1978 trip I dismantled the old moped and labeled and catalogued all the parts .
The parts that I did n't take as spares I left behind at home , ready to be shipped to me as needed wherever I was on the road .
I also asked a couple of friends to be willing to buy new parts and ship them to me if needed .
The local moped dealer where I lived was very helpful .
They got me the specialized tools I needed to be able to be fully independent and service every part of the moped myself ( in the remote areas where I was headed there would certainly be no Mobylette moped dealers ! ) .
They also got me a parts and repair manual for the bike .
The trip would not have been possible without these items ( ie , I could not have been fully independent ) .
I received no sponsorship from Mobylette or their distributor in Canada .
I asked for a discount on the new moped I purchased for the trip and was declined .
But I did the trip just fine without that !
Trip and route planning Generally speaking , I preferred to stick to the back roads wherever possible , as long as they were paved .
Sometimes I had no choice , and I traveled on the main roads , or on unpaved roads .
I preferred these " back roads " for several reasons :
Less traffic , they were quieter , I was closer to the land and the country I was passing through , and I was more likely to meet local people along the way .
To plan my routes I simply used the official provincial and state highway maps published by each province / state .
These maps show secondary highways , which are really the " back roads " that I refer to .
And they were free .
If you travel by moped I advise you to stay away from expressways .
Not only is it usually illegal to ride a moped on such highways , it can also be dangerous .
I generally did not plan where I would end up each day .
I preferred instead to just allow the trip take me wherever it led each day .
I liked to take each day as it came , particularly when I traveled .
That 's part of what traveling is all about : freedom from schedules and other similar constraints .
I would of course have a general idea of what was up ahead , and also have a general direction or eventual destination in mind .
And I would not head into an area in the evening that was devoid of places to camp .
Sometimes I would stop earlier in the day if I found a really nice place to camp and hang out .
It 's no fun riding into dusk , still searching for a campsite !
I did that a number of times , however , when I could n't find a place to camp earlier , or took a chance and continued riding when I should 've stopped earlier .
I would also be open to advice from people I met along the way , both fellow travelers and locals , about what roads were best to take for various reasons , and places to see or avoid .
If I had bound myself to a route and schedule , I would have missed out on a LOT !
So , overall I would say , when traveling : have a general direction and goal in mind , but above all enjoy the trip .
Be open to change and leadings along the way .

How I Did It : Previous Next
Since marijuana farmers have begun selling exclusively to legitimate dispensaries , the underground market for illegal weed has been quashed , putting drug dealers out of business for lack of available stock .
One such dealer I talked to in Boulder , who I will call Quark at his request , told me that with the supply of high - quality Colorado hydroponic weed redirected to dispensaries , he has only been able to procure cheap Mexican schwag for the past few months .
Since the implications of indirect association with brutal Mexican cartels unsettles him , Quark is currently seeking a regular job so he will have money to pay tuition this year .
Though it has negatively impacted his own solvency , Quark has nothing but praise for the new phase in Colorado 's marijuana industry .
His only concern is that the change in employment status will burden his study time as he nears completion of his advanced degree in astrophysics .
Opponents of legalization / decriminalization of marijuana -- medicinal or otherwise -- argue that legitimizing the industry will lead to increased usage by young people , though rational analysis and official statistics indicate otherwise .
California examined the issue a decade after their 1996 legalization of medicinal marijuana .
The state attorney general discovered that over the previous ten years , teen usage had declined dramatically , at a rate much faster than the national trend .
As compared to California statistics pre-1996 , different teen age groups evidenced 25 to nearly 50 % fewer numbers reporting that they 'd used marijuana in the previous month .
I would bet that one could find their way to a pot dealer on any college campus in this country by asking the first three people you meet where to procure ganja .
Considering the prevalence of the underground market , legitimizing the business has the effect of tightening controls over it , regulating who can legally purchase , sell , or grow it , which puts unscrupulous drug dealers out of business , this reducing the availability of product through any but official channels .
The controls that come with legalization effectively reduces its availability , rather than the contrary .
Kathleen acknowledges that the cultivation and sale of marijuana has been a thriving underground industry for decades in her tiny mountain town about 15 miles west of Boulder .
" It 's always been happening ; it 's just not been taxed until now , " she says .
The massive blackmarket is emerging into the light , though the Colorado Department of the Revenue says they have no plans to keep track of how much money the rapidly growing legitimate industry will be feeding into state coffers .
The largest dispensary in the state , serving 1400 patients in Colorado Springs , generates $ 30,000 per month in sales tax revenue for the state .
" And now that the legal dispensaries have killed the underground market , it will only get bigger , " Kathleen predicts .
For her own ambition , that is most certainly the case .
One Brown Mouse currently corners the medicinal marijuana market in Nederland , though half a dozen more dispensaries are preparing to open there in the coming months .
Kathleen represents the leading edge of a growing movement of ganjapreneurs , and wants to carve out a substantial market share before the field becomes crowded with ambitious latecomers .
Her fine - tuned business acumen , clearly unharmed by decades of casual marijuana use , recognizes the much larger market for her goods lies thirty minutes east in Boulder .

The way to hook the ladies ?
WHY are men's muscles so much bigger than women's ?
Partly , of course , because men do the fighting and hunting .
But also , perhaps , because women like men who can do these things well , and are thus attracted to muscular men .
Both phenomena — competing with members of the same sex and showing off to members of the opposite — are subject to a form of evolution known as sexual selection .
It is sexual selection that created the deer 's antlers and the peacock 's tail , and William Lassek of the University of Pittsburgh and Steven Gaulin of the University of California , Santa Barbara , think it explains men's muscles as well .
The main characteristic of sexually selected features is that they are expensive to maintain .
Since , whether competing or attracting , only the best will do , resources get piled into them , almost regardless of the consequences .
In a study just published in Evolution and Human Behavior , Dr Lassek and Dr Gaulin show that this crucial characteristic is true for men's muscles .
Their data came from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , which followed 12,000 American men and women over the course of six years .
They found that men require 50 % more calories than women do , even after adjusting for activity levels , and that their muscle mass is the strongest predictor of their intake of calories — stronger than their occupation or their body - mass index ( a measure of obesity ) .
And there is another cost to being muscly : men's immune systems are less effective than those of women ( which was known before ) , and become worse the more muscular the men are ( which was not ) .
The benefits , however , were there , as well .
The more muscular a man , the more sexual partners he reported , both in the past year and over his lifetime , and the earlier his first sexual experience was likely to have been .
This may , in part , be a result of the ability of muscular men to intimidate 97lb weaklings .
But in a society where extreme forms of such intimidation are curbed by law , female choice seems as likely an explanation — especially as previous studies have confirmed scientifically the everyday observation that women do indeed prefer men with big biceps and triangular torsos .
Because muscles come at such cost , Dr Gaulin thinks an evolutionary fight is going on between natural selection , which conserves metabolic expenditure and promotes longevity , and sexual selection , which willingly trades both for extra mating opportunities .
This may explain why men have such a range of muscularity .
In the past , the strong man would have had better mating opportunities in the short term , but the skinny guy who outlived him could have had just as much reproductive success over the course of his longer life .
The irony for the skinny guy is that the laws which protect him from aggression also make it less likely that the hulk will fight himself into an early grave .
Modern medicine , meanwhile , means the hulk 's weakened immune system is less likely to expose him to lethal infection .
Time , then , to get the weights out , and start pumping iron .
Anthony Bourdain did n’t invent the chef memoir , but he revolutionized it .
And judging by the latest crop of books , I ’d say he has a lot to answer for .
In the old days , chef stories followed a pretty staid outline : childhood in sunny France , first job , first great chef , own restaurant , and after many struggles , stardom .
Like Horatio
Alger stories they were at once almost ritualistic in their progress and thoroughly sanitized , yet oddly comforting in their predictability .
Bourdain changed all that with his “ Kitchen Confidential . ”
The story of a wayward chef and his exceedingly merry ways , “ Kitchen Confidential ” turned food publishing on its head .
Not only did it bear little or no resemblance to its chef - ography predecessors , it joyously trampled on their pieties .
It was full of sex and drugs , and it described a cooking career that could most charitably be described as underachieving .
Restaurant kitchens , it turned out , were hotbeds of bad behavior , more akin to high school locker rooms than the artist ’s ateliers we ’d been led to believe they resembled .
And “ Kitchen Confidential ” cheerfully laid it all out with an attitude that was like a food version of “ Seinfeld ” : “ No hugging , no learning . ”
And like the television show , it was both utterly enjoyable and outrageously successful .
Professionals and amateurs alike thrilled to the inside story of what life in a professional kitchen is really like .
Published in 2000 , “ Kitchen Confidential ” has sold well over 1 million copies .
Certainly part of the reason the book did so well was because it was the first of its kind .
But more important , Bourdain is a born storyteller ( he ’d published two novels before hitting the nonfiction trail ) .
Nobody since George Orwell delivered such an honest and unflinching look at the behind - the - scenes world of the professional kitchen .
This created not a little bit of angst in the restaurant world .
A friend who is a World Famous Chef called me right after the book came out concerned with the way his profession had been portrayed .
Relax , I told him , it ’s better people know about all the hard work and sweat that goes into great cooking rather than just assuming it happens by magic .
But after having waded through four chef memoirs that have been published just in the last couple of months , I have to admit I ’m regretting those words .
Call them Bourdain ’s bastard children .
And while each of these books has its moments , they really only point up how remarkable their sire actually was .
‘ Spiced ’
The best of the lot is Dalia Jurgensen ’s “ Spiced . ” A top New York pastry chef , Jurgensen delivers the best sense of both the inspiration and perspiration of professional cooking .
And you can tell from the way she talks about food that she ’s deeply connected to it -- something that ’s not as common as you might expect in these books .
The book has gotten a lot of buzz because of Jurgensen ’s uninhibited approach to the telling of matters of love and sex ( a little girl - on - girl experimentation , a long - running affair with her boss . . . really not that big a deal in these post - Bourdain days ) .
But I found her oddly reticent about what matters most -- her food .
Her desserts sound amazing , inventive but not silly .
But Jurgensen rarely takes the time to explore why she does what she does in the kitchen .
The sole exception , which comes near the end , is quite a tease ; her explanation of how she balances flavors and textures in a bamboo - honey panna cotta is fascinating .
Inspired by a dark , slightly bitter honey she found at the farmers market , she used it to flavor a panna cotta .
The result was a little sweet , so she accompanied it with a raspberry sauce that she deliberately under - sweetened .
For crunch and more depth of flavor , she garnished the dish with sliced almonds that she ’d dusted with bee pollen , “ a bright yellow dust with a floral earthiness . ”
‘ Cooking Dirty ’
On the other hand , a little more reticence is exactly what I was praying for while reading Jason Sheehan ’s “ Cooking Dirty ” ( to be published this month ) .
Sheehan pictures himself as a poster boy for kitchen bad behavior and details years of careening from self - inflicted meltdown to self - inflicted meltdown with an almost operatic tone .
The problem is , he ’s just not that interesting .
And he ’s not that great a cook .
I had to keep reminding myself that for most of the book he ’s really just a guy working in a diner .
He affects a Keith Richards swagger , but culinarily he ’s a drummer in a garage band .
In the end , sickened by all of his wasted opportunities ( and his blowhard approach to bragging about them ) I just wanted the book to be over .
And while we ’re at it :
Although wartime metaphors have been part of kitchen stories since the beginning , there ought to be a moratorium on them while people are actually fighting and dying .
Let ’s get this straight : Professional cooking is hard , pressured and sometimes slightly dangerous , but let ’s not mistake cut fingers and scorched forearms for what happens in battle .
‘ The Hunger ’
In an odd way , John Delucie ’s “ The Hunger ” is perhaps the most accurate description of the careers of many chefs these days .
Delucie was a journeyman until the gods of fortune smiled upon him with a business partner named Graydon Carter , whose Vanity Fair Rolodex ensured a packed and illustrious dining room from Day 1 at their restaurant Waverly Inn .
Delucie is the kind of cook who takes pride mostly in his professionalism .
He ’s a demon on food cost and efficiency .
But when he talks about what he ’s cooking , there ’s little sense of passion .
It seems he ’s mostly putting spins on dishes he knows will sell well from places he ’s worked before .
Probably the most revealing moment in the book is when , feeling full of success , he goes to a big foodie chef event in Miami thinking he ’s a star and realizes he ’s just climbed the bottom rung of yet another ladder .
‘ Under the Table ’
On the other hand , Katherine Darling ’s “ Under the Table , ” the story of her time as a student at New York ’s French Culinary Institute , is so ripe with folly it ’s probably best read as a Bridget Jones - like parody .
Tired of her unglamorous life in publishing , Darling decides to go to cooking school with the intention of becoming the next Rachael Ray .
There are several problems .
First , she is an utter snob of the shallowest sort ; she seems to pay more attention to what her fellow students are wearing than to the cooking lessons ( and her horror at having to wear school - issued front - pleated chefs pants is only alleviated by a trip to the tailor ) .
She has little stomach for handling food ( like crying in baseball , there should be no “ ewwwwws ” in a professional kitchen ) .
Worst of all , Darling does n’t write very well .
She apparently never met a cliché she did n’t fall in love with ( dishes are repeatedly described as “ mouth - wateringly delicious ” ) .
But what ’s really delicious is the inadvertent hilarity .
At one point she confuses fraisage ( rubbing pie dough to get a flaky crust ) with frottage ( rubbing of an entirely different sort ) .
But I have to admit , I got my biggest smile of all picturing her working in Anthony Bourdain ’s kitchen .

The Pentagon says banning smoking would add to the stress for troops American troops are not to be banned from smoking in war zones , the US Defence Department says .
The decision comes despite a recent study which recommended the US military should be tobacco - free .
Pentagon spokesman , Geoff Morrell , said US troops were already making enough sacrifices in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He said Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , did not want to add to the stress of the troops by taking away their right to smoke .
But Mr Morrell said the Pentagon would examine the recent study to see what else could be done to move towards banning tobacco in the military .
He said : " Obviously it is not our preference to have a force that is using tobacco products . "
' Fearless warrior '
A report commissioned by the US government said last week that the US military should be smoke - free in the next 20 years .
The Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) said 30 % of army personnel were smokers , leading to " very high " economic and health costs .
But it acknowledged that the change could be hard to introduce , as smoking had " long been associated with the image of a tough , fearless warrior " .
The Pentagon has said it supports the idea and believes it is " achievable " .
The report , commissioned by the Pentagon and the US Veterans Affairs Department ( VA ) , said the Pentagon spent more than $ 1.6bn ( £ 1 bn ) every year on tobacco - related medical care , hospital treatment and lost days of work .
It said that rates of tobacco smoking in the military had increased since 1998 , and may be as high as 50 % among service personnel returning from duty in Iraq and Afghanistan .

Infections of SIV among gorillas seem quite low Gorillas have been found , for the first time , to be a source of HIV .
Previous research had shown the HIV - 1 strain , the main source of human infections , with 33 m cases worldwide , originated from a virus in chimpanzees .
But researchers have now discovered an HIV infection in a Cameroonian woman which is clearly linked to a gorilla strain , Nature Medicine reports .
A researcher told the BBC that , though it was a new type of HIV , current drugs might still help combat its effects .
HIV originated from a similar virus in chimpanzees called Simian Immunodeficiency Virus ( SIV ) .
There 's no reason to believe this virus will present any new problems , as it were , that we do n't already face
Dr David Robertson
researcher Although HIV / Aids was first recognised by scientists in the 1980s , it is thought to have first entered the human population early in the 20th Century in the region of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
The virus probably originally jumped into humans after people came into contact with infected bush meat .
SIV viruses have been reported in other primates , including gorillas .
Unusual case French doctors treating the 62 - year - old Cameroonian woman who was living in Paris said they initially spotted some discrepancies in routine viral load tests .
South Africa has begun human trials of the first African - produced HIV vaccine Further analysis of the HIV strain she was infected with showed it was more closely related to SIV from gorillas than HIV from humans .
She is the only person known to be infected with the new strain , but the researchers expect to find other cases .
Before moving to Paris , she had lived in a semi-urban area of Cameroon and had no contact with gorillas or bush meat , suggesting she caught the virus from someone else who was carrying the gorilla strain .
Analysis of the virus in the laboratory has confirmed that it can replicate in human cells .
Co-author Dr David Robertson , from the University of Manchester , said it was the first definitive transfer of HIV seen from a source other than a chimpanzee , and highlighted the need to monitor for the emergence of new strains .
" This demonstrates that HIV evolution is an ongoing process .
" The virus can jump from species to species , from primate to primate , and that includes us ; pathogens have been with us for millions of years and routinely switch host species . "
The fact the patient had been diagnosed in France showed how human mobility can rapidly transfer a virus from one area of the world to another , he said .
New problems ' unlikely '
Speaking to the BBC's Wold Today programme , Dr Robertson said there was no reason to believe that existing drugs would not work on the new virus .

" If some day we do manage to develop a vaccine , there 's no reason to believe it would n't work , " he said .
" There 's no reason to believe this virus will present any new problems , as it were , that we do n't already face . "
Professor Paul Sharp , from the University of Edinburgh , said the virus probably initially transferred from chimpanzees to gorillas .
He said the latest finding was interesting but perhaps not surprising .
" The medical implication is that , because this virus is not very closely related to the other three HIV - 1 groups , it is not detected by conventional tests .
" So the virus could be cryptically spreading in the population . "
However , he said that he would guess it would not spread widely and become a major problem .
" Although the patient with this virus was not ill , there is no reason to believe that it will not lead to Aids , " he added .

Astronomers have announced that a sequence of images collected with the Smithsonian 's Submillimeter Array ( SMA ) clearly reveals the presence of a rotating molecular disk orbiting the young binary star system V4046 Sagittarii .
The SMA images provide an unusually vivid snapshot of the process of formation of giant planets , comets , and Pluto - like bodies .
The results also confirm that such objects may just as easily form around double stars as around single stars like our Sun .
These findings are being presented by UCLA graduate student David Rodriguez in a press conference at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Pasadena , Calif .
" It 's a case of seeing is believing , " says Joel Kastner of the Rochester ( NY ) Institute of Technology , the lead scientist on the study .
" We had the first evidence for this rotating disk in radio telescope observations of V4046 Sagittarii that we made last summer .
But at that point , all we had were molecular spectra , and there are different ways to interpret the spectra .
Once we saw the image data from the SMA , there was no doubt that we have a rotating disk here . "
Co-author David Wilner of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ( CfA ) adds , " This is strong evidence that planets can form around binary stars , which expands the number of places we can look for extrasolar planets .
Somewhere in our galaxy , an alien world may enjoy double sunrises and double sunsets . "
Wilner is one of the world 's experts on radiointerferometry , the technique used in this study to form images with the SMA 's multiple radio antennas .
The other contributor to the SMA study of V4046 Sagittarii led by RIT's Kastner and UCLA 's Rodriguez is Ben Zuckerman of UCLA .
According to Rodriguez , the images clearly demonstrate that the molecular disk orbiting the V4046 Sagittarii binary system extends from within the approximate radius of Neptune 's orbit out to about 10 times that orbit .
This region corresponds to the zone where the solar system 's giant planets , as well as its Pluto - like Kuiper Belt objects , may have formed .

" We believe that V4046 Sagittarii provides one of the clearest examples yet discovered of a Keplerian , planet - forming disk orbiting a young star system , " Wilner says .
" This particular system is made that much more remarkable by the fact that it consists of a pair of solar - mass stars that are approximately 12 million years old and are separated by a mere 5 solar diameters . "
" This could be the oldest known orbiting protoplanetary molecular disk .
It shows that , at least for some stars , formation of Jovian - mass planets may continue well after a few million years , which astronomers have deduced is characteristic of the formation time for most such planets , " Zuckerman says .
Findings of this study build on previous work published in the December 2008 issue of Astronomy and Astrophysics in which Kastner and his team first suggested that the case of V4046 Sagittarii illustrates well how planets may form easily around certain types of binary stars .
" We thought the molecular gas around these two stars almost literally represented ' smoking gun ' evidence of recent or possibly ongoing ' giant ' Jupiter - like planet formation around the binary star system , " Kastner says .
" The SMA images showing an orbiting disk certainly support that idea . "
The evidence for a molecular disk orbiting these twin young suns in the constellation Sagittarius suggested to the scientists that many such binary systems should also host as - yet - undetected planets .
" The most successful technique used so far for the discovery of extrasolar planets - that of measurement of precision radial velocities - is exceedingly difficult for close binary stars such as V4046 Sagittarii .
So these radio observations are probing a new region of discovery space for extrasolar planets , " says Rodriguez .
" At a distance of only 240 light - years from the solar system , the V4046 Sagittarii binary is at least two times closer to Earth than almost all known planet - forming star systems , which gives us a good shot at imaging any planets that have already formed and are now orbiting the stars , " he continues .
Kastner and collaborators had previously used the 30 - meter radiotelescope operated by the Institut de Radio Astronomie Millimetrique ( IRAM ) to study radio molecular spectra emitted from the vicinity of the twin stars .
The scientists used these data to identify the raw materials for planet formation around V4046 Sagittarii - carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide - in the noxious circumstellar gas cloud .
" In this case the stars are so close together , and the profile of the gas - in terms of the types of molecules that are there - is so much like the types of gaseous disks that we see around single stars , that we now have a direct link between planets forming around single stars and planets forming around double stars , " Kastner says .
While thousands of indebted students have complained about their treatment by lenders , Mr. Bowman has documented his personal debt crisis with remarkable , obsessive intensity .
He claims Sallie Mae overcharged him , imposing hefty and unjustified fees ; did not allow him to defer payments when he was entitled to do so and improperly accounted for periods when he did defer .
According to his detailed records , a Sallie Mae representative even threatened him .
“ If you default , your license will be taken from you , ” the representative said .
“ Do you understand that ? ”
When Mr. Bowman said that he did not yet have a law license , the representative responded that the company would prevent him from getting one .
Martha Holler , a Sallie Mae spokeswoman , said that such threats would violate the company ’s rules .
“ The size of this account is extremely unusual , but not surprising given that the customer took out 32 loans to pursue undergraduate , law and masters of law studies and has not made a single monthly payment over his 26 - year student loan history , ” Ms. Holler said .
“ We are performing an extensive review of his extraordinary case , and if we identify any errors we will quickly rectify them . ”
Mr. Bowman has not had an easy time of it .
He was shuffled through foster care and various legal proceedings as a child .
He was impressed by the lawyers who represented his interests and saw a possible life ’s work .
Getting a college degree took 10 years because he had spent nearly six in rehabilitation , relearning how to walk after an all - terrain vehicle hit him while he was stopped on his motorcycle .
The accident nearly cost him his left leg ; he graduated from the State University of New York in Albany in 1995 .
The Blue Grotto , the most famous tourist attraction on the island of Capri , was closed to visitors yesterday due to fears its crystal waters had been contaminated by raw sewage , possibly dumped by the Naples mafia .
La Grotta Azzurra , as it is known in Italian , is celebrated for the intense blue tones of the water and the mysterious , silvery light thrown off by underwater rocks in the cave .
In the 1st century AD , the Emperor Tiberius liked to retire to the grotto to swim and cool off during the hottest days of summer .
But the cave 's problems have been brewing since reports that two employees of a waste disposal firm at Castellamare di Stabia , near Naples , had dumped 5,000 litres of raw cesspool sewage in the grotto using hoses .
The firm has the contract for the disposal of waste from homes and hotels on the island to sewage treatment plants in the area .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The two men are alleged to have dumped the sewage to avoid paying charges levied at the treatment plants .
They were arrested and are currently under house arrest .
An inquiry into the polluting of the famous cavern started last week .
But on Tuesday afternoon , the longer - term implications of the affair became apparent after boatmen ferrying tourists around the inside of the cavern discovered evil - smelling cream - coloured scum floating in it .
One of the boatmen became nauseous after inhaling the fumes , and some of the tourists said they felt sick .
Health experts were dispatched to test the waters to identify the noxious substances , and police said the grotto would not be reopened until their work was completed .
The Naples region , which includes Capri , has for years been beset by problems connected with rubbish disposal , largely because of the success of the Camorra , the local equivalent of the Sicilian Mafia , in infiltrating the industry .
Last year , in the early weeks of his new government , Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi staked his credibility on securing a speedy end to a crisis which had seen the streets of the city , Italy 's fourth largest , stacked up to head height with huge piles of uncollected domestic refuse .
Yesterday his Environment Minister , Stefania Prestigiacomo , claimed that the Camorra might also be behind the poisoning of the grotto .
Ms Prestigiacomo said the overall environmental situation on the island was " disturbing " .
" Structural problems , lack of infrastructure , a sewage system that is incomplete , with not all homes connected to it : this is a situation which encourages the infiltration of criminal gangs , " she claimed .
" From what I have learned , the conditions [ on the island ] could lend themselves to being manipulated by illegal interests .
The suspicion is in the air .
I hope that the investigators will get to the bottom of it and make their findings known as soon as possible . "
But a public prosecutor in Naples was quick to deny the likelihood of organised crime being involved .
" As things stand now there are no elements to lead us to suppose that the Camorra is involved in these latest episodes on Capri , " Giovandomenico Lepore , the public prosecutor of the city , said .
" It seems to me a hasty and premature judgment to raise the bogey of the Camorra .
To date there has been no evidence that organised crime has a presence on the island . "
The Blue Grotto is entered by a narrow aperture in the high rocky wall some two metres wide by two metres high , requiring tourists , arriving two or three to a rowing boat , to enter lying down while the boatman hauls his craft inside with a chain .
The uniquely vivid blue of the light inside the cavern is caused by daylight entering through an underwater opening beneath the above - water entrance .
The light is filtered by the water which absorbs the red tones , leaving the light in the cave a startlingly blue hue .
FAIR USE ?
Labour is suggesting the Government take a look at a levy on internet accounts to compensate copyright holders .
Labour communications spokeswoman Clare Curran says a charge on internet accounts should be considered to recompense copyright holders for downloaded material .
Ms Curran says the idea received support at workshops she has been holding to formulate Labour policy .
But the Federation Against Copyright Theft ( NZFact ) says it is not a solution its movie studio members are looking at .
The Recording Industry Association ( Rianz ) , which represents the music industry , is also lukewarm .
Rianz director Campbell Smith says " all things are worth considering " , but such a licensing regime would remove the ability of rights - holders to deal with their works as they saw fit .
InternetNZ executive director Keith Davidson says the idea is not without merit .
Internet providers and rights holders recognised they would have to work together in future , " but maybe the time is not quite right " .
The charge , which Ms Curran prefers described as a licensing agreement , rather than a levy , would need to be " economically viable " for consumers .
She would not speculate on what it should be .
The Government last week unveiled proposals for a revamped section 92a of the Copyright Act to tackle piracy .
Consumers who ignored warnings not to breach copyright for example by downloading pirated music and movies through peer - to - peer file - sharing services could elect to go to mediation with rights - holders or be hauled in front of the Copyright Tribunal , which could fine them or temporarily cut them off from the internet .
The clause would replace an earlier version , which would have obliged internet service providers to cut off infringers on terms that were to be hammered out with rights - holders .
Mr Smith says it is not obvious why Rianz ' members would not be better off suing internet users , which they could do without warning , rather than going through the " complicated process " set out in the new proposed section 92a .
Commerce Minister Simon
Power says he is pleased with the initial response to the proposal , taking heart from the fact it was described as " less worse " than the original section 92a by InternetNZ 's Mr Davidson .
But Ms Curran says it approaches the problem of copyright infringement from the perspective of trying to contain the problem through penalties and it is time for " some new thinking " .
" The genie is out of the bottle .
I believe we need to be thinking seriously and doing some number - crunching on licensing agreements that involve all the ISPs and rights - holders in this country and it is my impression there is beginning to be general consensus that is the way forward .
" It could be there was a licence fee attached to people 's internet service that was collected and managed by an external agency . "
Mr Power says he is sure the Economic Development Ministry will " welcome all submissions on the issue " .
Ms Curran was not sure whether a levy should be used to compensate overseas as well as New Zealand rights - holders for material downloaded by New Zealanders , but it should " look at our own creative content first " .

A BEGINNER ’S GUIDE TO KEYS IN MUSIC .
Firstly , let ’s define three important terms which are easy to get confused and therefore important to be distinguished from each other before exploring how they are related .
1. Key : a family of notes which belong together and have a distinctive sound or “ colour ” .
A key can be major or minor and is represented by a key signature ( see definition 2 ) .
Every key has 7 individual notes which are represented in the scale ( see definition 3 ) of the key .
2 . Key signature : a representation of the accidentals found in a key .
These are shown at the start of each stave just after the clef and just before the time signature * and greatly reduce the number of accidentals that have to be shown in the main body of the score **.
The order of accidentals in a key signature does not always follow the order in which they appear in the scale .
Instead , they follow the order in which they appear from one scale to the next .
3. Scale : a representation of the notes belonging to a key in ascending and descending order starting and ending on the root note of the key .
There are 3 main types of scales : major ( which represent major keys ) , harmonic minor and melodic minor ( which represent minor keys ) .
Each type follows a specific order of intervals ***
Understanding major and minor keys and their relationships
The reason there are related major and minor keys is because they share the same key signature .
Major keys are easier to understand because they do not deviate from their key signature , and have only 1 scale to represent them .
Major scales are based on the following sequence of intervals :
Whole tone ; whole tone ; half tone ; whole tone ; whole tone ; whole tone ; half tone .
So let ’s see how that relates to the actual notes of C major :
C – D : whole tone
D – E : whole tone
E – F : half tone
F – G : whole tone
G – A : whole tone
A – B : whole tone
B – C : half tone
No matter what the key , major scales follow an identical sequence of intervals .
This is why they all have different key signatures .
In order to follow the same sequence , they have to follow a unique pattern of notes .
Minor keys are more complex than major scales .
Every minor key has 2 different types of minor scale as previously mentioned : a harmonic minor scale and a melodic minor scale .
Each type deviates from the key signature in a slightly different way .
But let ’s forget that confusing fact for a moment and look at how major scales and minor scales relate to each other .
Every key signature relates to both a major key and a minor key .
The table below shows 3 ascending major scales .
The numbers above the scales represent each step of the scales .
The note in bold print in each scale is the root note of the relative minor .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 C major C D E F G A B C G major G A B C D E F# G D major D E F# G A B C# D
You ’ll notice that it is always the 6th step of the major scale that is the root note of the relative minor key .
This is the easiest way to find out which minor key shares the key signature of a major key .
In contemporary rock and pop music , we often come across “ natural minor ” scales .
These are minor scales that do not deviate from the key signature and take on the following sequence of intervals :
Whole tone ; half tone ; whole tone ; whole tone ; half tone ; whole tone ; whole tone .
This is a ( natural ) minor , which is related to C major ( as you can see in the table above )
A – B : whole tone
B – C : half tone
C – D : whole tone
D – E : whole tone
E – F : half tone
F – G : whole tone
G – A : whole tone
The next table shows the three natural minor scales related to the major scales above .
This time , you ’ll notice that the bold print note , which is the root note of the relative major key , has changed to the third step .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 a minor a b c d e f g a e minor e f# g a b c d e b minor b c# d e f# g a b
In classical music , minor scales are altered in 2 different ways .
This gives minor keys a more distinct and defined sound , and distinguishes them from major keys .
The first alteration is the harmonic minor scale , in which the 7th step is always raised up by a half tone as shown in a harmonic minor below :
A – B : whole tone
B – C : half tone
C – D : whole tone
D – E : whole tone
E – F : half tone
F – G# : augmented second
G# – A : half tone
The augmented second is the largest interval you ’ll find in any classical scale , and is only found in the harmonic minor .
Play and listen to the scale several times to hear its distinct sound .
The table below shows 3 examples of harmonic minor scales .
The altered 7th steps are in bold italic .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 a harmonic minor a b c d e f g# a e harmonic minor e f# g a b c d# e b harmonic minor b c# d e f# g a# b
Now for the melodic minor scale , which I like to call the chameleon scale because it changes its colours on the way down .
Melodic minor scales raise the 6th and 7th steps by a half tone in the ascending half and lower them back down by a half step in the descending half .
This means that the scale has a different sequence of intervals in its ascending and descending halves as shown in a melodic minor :
Ascending
A – B : whole tone
B – C : half tone
C – D : whole tone
D – E : whole tone
E – F# : whole tone
F# – G# : whole tone
G# – A : half tone
Descending
A - G : whole tone
G - F : whole tone
F - E : half tone
E - D : whole tone
D - C : whole tone
C – B : half tone
B – A : whole tone
Note also that the descending melodic minor scale is a natural minor which follows the key signature .
Play and listen to the scale , and be sure to hear the difference between the melodic minor and the harmonic minor .
The table below shows 3 examples of melodic minor scales .
The altered notes in the ascending scale are shown in bold italic print , and the lowered notes in the descending scale are shown in bold print :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 a melodic minor a b c d e f# g# a g f e d c b a e melodic minor e f# g a b c# d# e d c b a g f# e b melodic minor b c# d e f# g# a# b a g f# e d c# b
The altered notes in harmonic and melodic minor scales are always shown as accidentals within the score , and not in the key signature .
So how do we know whether a music score is in a minor key or a major key ?
First look at the key signature and make sure that you know which major and minor key it belongs to .
Then look at about the first 8 bars of the music .
If you see any accidentals within the score ( not , the key signature – you ’ve already looked at that ) check what they are .
If they happen to be the 6th and / or 7th step of the minor key , then you can be certain that the music is in a minor key and not a major key .
If you see no accidentals within the score , or accidentals that are not the 6th or 7th steps of the minor key , you can be certain of it being a major key .
* Times signatures , unlike clefs and key signatures , are only shown at the start of the first stave and do not appear again unless there is a change of time signature in the music
** Score : a written or notated representation of music
*** Interval : the pitch distance between 2 consecutive notes ( e.g. C – D = a whole tone or major second ; C – D - flat = a half tone or minor second )
Three New Jersey residents plan to file a lawsuit today that could put the staple of the great American backyard cookout -- the hot dog -- on the same path as the once romanticized puff on a cigarette .
Pointing to " landmark " research showing a heightened risk of colon cancer in people who consume processed meat , the class - action lawsuit in state Superior Court in Newark will target the makers of Nathan's , Oscar Mayer , Ball Park , Hebrew National and Sabrett franks as if they were Big Tobacco .
The plaintiffs want labels on hot dogs to read , " WARNING : CONSUMING HOT DOGS AND OTHER PROCESSED MEATS INCREASES THE RISK OF CANCER . "
" We view this just like the tobacco litigation , " said Dan Kinburn , the plaintiff 's lead attorney and general counsel for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine .
" There is now a scientific consensus that processed meats are a significant cause of colorectal and other forms of cancer . "
Not so fast , said Janet Riley of the American Meat Institute and the National Hot Dog & Sausage Council .
On Tuesday , she challenged the assertions by the nonprofit Cancer Project , which is filing the lawsuit on behalf of the New Jersey residents , and its affiliate , the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine .
" They 're an animal rights group , " Riley said .
" Their solution to every possible illness is vegetarianism .
Their objective is to end meat consumption , period .
...
It 's a very selective use of the science to further their animal rights agenda . "
The lawsuit is based on a " landmark " 2007 American Institute for Cancer Research report , based on 58 scientific studies , showing that the daily consumption of one 50 - gram serving of processed meat ( about the amount in a single hot dog ) increases the risk of colorectal cancer , on average , by 21 percent , according to the Cancer Project .
About 50,000 people die each year from colorectal cancer .
The findings would seem to run counter to a bevy of studies , including a 2004 federally funded Harvard School of Public Health study finding no link between meat and colon cancer , provided by the meat - industry arm .
What 's more , the meat institute 's Riley said , the chemical preservative nitrites cited as harmful are found in abundance in vegetables .
" It 's such a minor source of nitrites , " Riley said .
The lawsuit -- filed on behalf of John O'Donnell of Voorhees , Ruthann Hilland of Westville and Michele De Scisciolo of Emerson -- asserts that processed meat contains " appreciable amounts " of human carcinogens , such as nitrites and compounds such as N - nitrosodimethylamine , or NDMA , many of which do n't occur naturally in food .
In 1987 , California listed NDMA as a human carcinogen , putting the defendants " on notice , " according to the lawsuit .
The lawsuit names Kraft Foods Inc. , maker of Oscar Mayer franks ; Sara Lee Corp. , maker of Ball Park franks , ConAgra Foods Inc. , maker of Hebrew National , Nathan 's Famous Inc. ; and Marathon Enterprises , maker of Sabrett .
The defendants referred calls to the industry group , declined to comment or did not return calls .
Reached Tuesday , De Scisciolo , one of the plaintiffs , said she learned about the issue via an e-mail alert from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and decided to step forward .
" I did n't know about hot dogs causing cancer , " said the 26 - year - old accounts payable manager .
" I think people have the right to know .
...
On cigarettes , they put a warning label . "
The lawsuit asserts consumer fraud , specifically omitting information about the " known risks , " and demands mandatory warning labels and signs on packaging and websites in the face of the " most comprehensive body of evidence " yet .
" The situation is similar to the link between the smoking of tobacco products and lung cancer , " the lawsuit says .
" While all the molecular events linking the smoking of tobacco to the development of lung cancer are not known , the link cannot be disputed . "
The plaintiff 's attorney , Kinburn , said the lawsuit was to be hand - delivered at 9 a.m. today to state Superior Court in Newark .
He foresees a long court fight .
" I expect it to be very hard - fought litigation , " he said , " And I 'd be surprised if we got to trial in less than two years . "
Neal Barnard , president of the Cancer Project , conceded that his group supports " plant - based diets " but also noted that he comes from a family of ranchers .
" As time goes on , you realize what you 're raising contributes to cancer , " he said .
" Everybody knows in the scientific world of that risk .
When you bring your 7 - year - old daughter to a baseball game , and they 're selling you something she puts into her mouth , you should know about the risks . "

The Art of Picking Intel Registers
I wrote this article for an online magazine called Scene Zine .
Scene Zine caters to the Demo Scene , which is an digital art community dedicated to pushing the limits of computers through a mix of music , art , and computer programming .
A particular category of demoscene productions , 4 K intros , focus on the final production 's raw file size .
The goal is to put as much high - quality music , graphics , and animation as possible into only 4096 bytes .
Doing this requires highly - specialized size optimization techniques , since 4096 bytes is less space than two pages of typed text or a true - color Windows XP icon .
This article discusses some of these techniques .
Some people have commented that they want to see more expert programming articles in Scene Zine .
To remedy the situation , this article is for all assembly language programmers out there .
It discusses the fine art of picking which registers to use in your code .
This information should simplify your coding and help you write smaller routines .
When the engineers at Intel designed the original 8086 processor , they had a special purpose in mind for each register .
As they designed the instruction set , they created many optimizations and special instructions based on the function they expected each register to perform .
Using registers according to Intel 's original plan allows the code to take full advantage of these optimizations .
Unfortunately , this seems to be a lost art .
Few coders are aware of Intel 's overall design , and most compilers are too the simplistic or focused on execution speed to use the registers properly .
Understanding how the registers and instruction set fit together , however , is an important step on the road to effortless size - coding .
Using the registers consistently has other advantages besides size optimization .
Like using good variable names , using consistent registers makes code more readable .
When they are used properly , the registers have meanings almost as clear as the loop counter , i , in higher - level languages .
In fact , I occasionally name my variables in C after x86 registers because the register names are so descriptive .
With proper register use , x86 assembler can be almost as self - documenting as a high - level language .
Another benefit that consistent register use brings is better compression .
In productions which use a compressor to pack the final build , such as 4 K intros , creating more redundant code leads to smaller packed sizes .
When code uses registers consistently , the same instruction sequences begin to appear over and over .
This , in turn , improves the compression ratio .
As a review , all x86 - family CPU 's have 8 general - purpose registers .
The registers are 32 bits wide , although 16 - bit versions are also accessible with a special one - byte instruction prefix .
In 16 - bit mode , the situation is reversed .
The lower 16 bits are accessible by default , and the full registers are accessible only with a prefix byte .
Each register name is really an acronym .
This is true even for the " alphabetical " registers EAX , EBX , ECX , and EDX .
The following list shows the register names and their meanings :
EAX - Accumulator Register
EBX - Base Register
ECX - Counter Register
EDX - Data Register
ESI - Source Index
EDI - Destination Index
EBP - Base Pointer
ESP - Stack Pointer
In addition to the full - sized general registers , the x86 processor also has eight byte - sized registers .
Since these registers map directly into EAX , EBX , ECX , and EDX , most people view them as parts of the larger registers .
From the instruction set point of view , however , the 8 - bit registers are separate entities .
For example , the CL and CH registers share none of the ECX register 's useful properties .
Except for AL and AH , none of the 8 - bit registers have any special significance in the instruction set , so this article does not mention them .
EAX : The Accumulator
There are three major processor architectures : register , stack , and accumulator .
In a register architecture , operations such as addition or subtraction can occur between any two arbitrary registers .
In a stack architecture , operations occur between the top of the stack and other items on the stack .
In an accumulator architecture , the processor has single calculation register called the accumulator .
All calculations occur in the accumulator , and the other registers act as simple data storage locations .
Obviously , the x86 processor does not have an accumulator architecture .
It does , however , have an accumulator - like register : EAX / AL .
Although most calculations can occur between any two registers , the instruction set gives the accumulator special preference as a calculation register .
For example , all nine basic operations ( ADD , ADC , AND , CMP , OR , SBB , SUB , TEST , and XOR ) have special one - byte opcodes for operations between the accumulator and a constant .
Specialized operations , such as multiplication , division , sign extension , and BCD correction can only occur in the accumulator .
Since most calculations occur in the accumulator , the x86 architecture contains many optimized instructions for moving data in and out of this register .
To start , the processor has sixteen byte - sized XCHG opcodes for swapping data between the accumulator and any other register .
These are n't terribly useful , but they show how strongly the Intel engineers preferred the accumulator over the other registers .
For them , it was better to swap data into the accumulator to than to work with it where it was .
Other instructions that move data in and out of the accumulator are LODS , STOS , IN , OUT , INS , OUTS , SCAS , and XLAT .
Finally , the MOV instruction has a special one - byte opcode for moving data into the accumulator from a constant memory location .
In your code , try to perform as much work in the accumulator as possible .
As you will see , the remaining seven general - purpose registers exist primarily to support the calculation occurring in the accumulator .
EDX : The Data Register
Of the seven remaining general - purpose registers , the data register , EDX , is most closely tied to the accumulator .
Instructions that deal with over sized data items , such as multiplication , division , CWD , and CDQ , store the most significant bits in the data register and the least significant bits in the accumulator .
In a sense , the data register is the 64 - bit extension of the accumulator .
The data register also plays a part in IO instructions .
In this case , the accumulator holds the data to read or write from the port , and the data register holds the port address .
In your code , the data register is most useful for storing data related to the accumulator 's calculation .
In my experience , most calculations need only these two registers for storage if they are written properly .
ECX : The Count Register
The count register , ECX , is the x86 equivalent of the ubiquitous variable i.
Every counting - related instruction in the x86 uses ECX .
The most obvious counting instructions are LOOP , LOOPZ , and LOOPNZ .
Another counter - based instruction is JCXZ , which , as the name implies , jumps when the counter is 0 .
The count register also appears in some bit - shift operations , where it holds the number of shifts to perform .
Finally , the count register controls the string instructions through the REP , REPE , and REPNE prefixes .
In this case , the count register determines the maximum number of times the operation will repeat .
Particularly in demos , most calculations occur in a loop .
In these situations , ECX is the logical choice for the loop counter , since no other register has so many branching operations built around it .
The only problem is that this register counts downward instead of up as in high level languages .
Designing a downward - counting is not hard , however , so this is only a minor difficulty .
EDI : The Destination Index
Every loop that generates data must store the result in memory , and doing so requires a moving pointer .
The destination index , EDI , is that pointer .
The destination index holds the implied write address of all string operations .
The most useful string instruction , remarkably enough , is the seldom - used STOS .
STOS copies data from the accumulator into memory and increments the destination index .
This one - byte instruction is perfect , since the final result of any calculation should be in the accumulator anyhow , and storing results in a moving memory address is a common task .
Many coders treat the destination index as no more than extra storage space .
This is a mistake .
All routines must store data , and some register must serve as the storage pointer .
Since the destination index is designed for this job , using it for extra storage is a waste .
Use the stack or some other register for storage , and use EDI as your global write pointer .
ESI : The Source Index
The source index , ESI , has the same properties as the destination index .
The only difference is that the source index is for reading instead of writing .
Although all data - processing routines write , not all read , so the source index is not as universally useful .
When the time comes to use it , however , the source index is just as powerful as the destination index , and has the same type of instructions .
In situations where your code does not read any sort of data , of course , using the source index for convenient storage space is acceptable .
ESP and EBP : The Stack Pointer and the Base Pointer
Of the eight general purpose registers , only the stack pointer , ESP , and the base pointer , EBP , are widely used for their original purpose .
These two registers are the heart of the x86 function - call mechanism .
When a block of code calls a function , it pushes the parameters and the return address on the stack .
Once inside , function sets the base pointer equal to the stack pointer and then places its own internal variables on the stack .
From that point on , the function refers to its parameters and variables relative to the base pointer rather than the stack pointer .
Why not the stack pointer ?
For some reason , the stack pointer lousy addressing modes .
In 16 - bit mode , it can not be a square - bracket memory offset at all .
In 32 - bit mode , it can be appear in square brackets only by adding an expensive SIB byte to the opcode .
In your code , there is never a reason to use the stack pointer for anything other than the stack .
The base pointer , however , is up for grabs .
If your routines pass parameters by register instead of by stack ( they should ) , there is no reason to copy the stack pointer into the base pointer .
The base pointer becomes a free register for whatever you need .
EBX : The Base Register
In 16 - bit mode , the base register , EBX , acts as a general - purpose pointer .
Besides the specialized ESI , EDI , and EBP registers , it is the only general - purpose register that can appear in a square - bracket memory access ( For example , MOV [ BX ] , AX ) .
In the 32 - bit world , however , any register may serve as a memory offset , so the base register is no longer special .
The base register gets its name from the XLAT instruction .
XLAT looks up a value in a table using AL as the index and EBX as the base .
XLAT is equivalent to MOV AL , [ BX+AL ] , which is sometimes useful if you need to replace one 8 - bit value with another from a table ( Think of color look - up ) .
So , of all the general - purpose registers , EBX is the only register without an important dedicated purpose .
It is a good place to store an extra pointer or calculation step , but not much more .
Conclusion
The eight general - purpose registers in the x86 processor family each have a unique purpose .
Each register has special instructions and opcodes which make fulfilling this purpose more convenient or efficient .
The registers and their uses are shown briefly below :
EAX - All major calculations take place in EAX , making it similar to a dedicated accumulator register .
EDX - The data register is the an extension to the accumulator .
It is most useful for storing data related to the accumulator 's current calculation .
ECX - Like the variable i in high - level languages , the count register is the universal loop counter .
EDI - Every loop must store its result somewhere , and the destination index points to that place .
With a single - byte STOS instruction to write data out of the accumulator , this register makes data operations much more size - efficient .
ESI - In loops that process data , the source index holds the location of the input data stream .
Like the destination index , EDI has a convenient one - byte instruction for loading data out of memory into the accumulator .
ESP - ESP is the sacred stack pointer .
With the important PUSH , POP , CALL , and RET instructions requiring it 's value , there is never a good reason to use the stack pointer for anything else .
EBP -
In functions that store parameters or variables on the stack , the base pointer holds the location of the current stack frame .
In other situations , however , EBP is a free data - storage register .
EBX - In 16 - bit mode , the base register was useful as a pointer .
Now it is completely free for extra storage space .
As an example of how these registers fit together , here is an outline of a typical routine :
mov esi , source_address mov edi , destination_address mov ecx , loop_count my_loop : lodsd stosd loop my_loop
In this example , ECX is the loop counter , ESI points to the input data , and EDI points to the output data .
Some calculations , such as a blur , filter , or perhaps a color look - up occur in the loop using EAX as a variable .
This example is a bit simplistic , but hopefully it shows the general idea .
A real routine would probably deal with much more complicated data than DWORD's , and would probably involve a bunch of floating - point as well .
In conclusion , using the registers as Intel intended has several advantages .
In the fist case , it allows your code to take advantage of many optimizations and special instructions .
It also makes the code more readable , since registers perform predictable functions .
Finally , using the registers consistently leads to better compression by promoting more repetitive instruction sequences .

Your microwave may be a powerful weapon in protecting your family against disease - causing germs .
A new study shows zapping sponges and plastic scrubbing pads in the microwave can kill bacteria , such as E. coli , that can cause illness .
" Basically , what we find is that we could knock out most bacteria in two minutes , " says researcher Gabriel Bitton , professor of environmental engineering at the University of Florida , in a news release .
" People often put their sponges and scrubbers in the dishwasher , but if they really want to decontaminate them and not just clean them , they should use the microwave . "
Researchers say disease - causing bacteria and germs from uncooked eggs , meat , and vegetables often work their way onto countertops and cleaning tools , and the dampness of sponges , dish cloths , and scrubbers provide an ideal breeding ground for the bugs .
Why are we asking this now ?
It is the oldest Bible in the world .
The 4th - century book is considered to be one of the most important texts in existence .
Until this week , no one alive has seen all its 800 pages together in one place because in the 19th century the document was split into sections and is now in four different locations – London , St Petersburg , Leipzig and Egypt .
But the creation of an online virtual Codex Sinaiticus permits anyone to see the manuscript in its entirety at www.codexsinaiticus.org.
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Where did the Codex Sinaiticus come from ?
No one is sure but it was handwritten in Greek uncial letters at about the time of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great more than 1,600 years ago .
The work of four scribes , it was written on vellum parchment made from the skins of donkeys or antelopes .
It was preserved for centuries by the dry desert air at the 4th century Monastery of St Catherine at the foot of Mount Sinai in Egypt , the oldest continuously inhabited Christian monastery , which has the greatest library of early manuscripts outside the Vatican City .
The Codex was discovered at the monastery in 1844 by the German biblical scholar and archaeologist Constantin von Tischendorf ( 1815 - 74 ) , who brought sections of it back to Europe on three separate trips .
Von Tischendorf claimed to have found pages of it in a wastepaper basket but the monks deny this .
There is a dispute too about whether he stole it or was given it .
Von Tischendorf had a deed of gift dated 11 September 1868 signed by one of its archbishops .
The biggest portion of the codex ended up in St Petersburg , where it was bought by the British Museum in the 1930s out of fear that the Communist regime might destroy it .
Why is the Codex so important ?
To secular scholars it represents the turning point in literary history when the scroll gave way to the book .
The parchment was arranged in little multi-page booklets called quires , which were then numbered in sequence .
It is thought to be the oldest , large , bound book to have survived .
" The Codex Sinaiticus is one of the world 's greatest written treasures , " says Scot McKendrick , head of Western manuscripts at the British Library .
To Christian scholars , it offers key insights into which ancient religious texts were brought together in the unit we now know as the Bible .
In earlier centuries there were all manner of documents in scroll form of gospels , epistles and other Christian writings .
As time went by , some were judged to be authoritative and included in the canon ; others were deemed to be apocryphal or errant .
The Codex Sinaiticus as it survives is incomplete – originally it would have been about 1,460 pages long – but it includes half of the Old Testament , all the New Testament , and two early Christian texts not found in modern Bibles .
It offers the first evidence of the content and the arrangement of the Bible , and includes numerous revisions , additions and corrections made to the text between the 4th and 12th centuries , making it one of the most corrected manuscripts in existence , showing how the text of the Bible was transmitted from generation to generation down through the ages .
Why has it never been reunited before ?
Partly because the holders of the various bits were covetous of their prized pages , and partly because the pages are too delicate to be moved .
So the work of digitising the pages had to be carried out in all four locations .
Leaves of the Codex were first treated by conservation experts to ensure they were sufficiently stable to undergo the photographic process .
Each page had to be photographed from several different angles to get a strong , readable image of the text but also to convey the natural undulation of the parchment .
The result is so accurate that high - resolution digital images even show up insect bites in the skin of the animal made before the creature was slaughtered to make the vellum .
How does it differ from modern Bibles ?
The version of the New Testament has some few interesting differences .
It includes two works which have since been dropped from both Catholic and Protestant Bibles – " The Shepherd of Hermas " , a heavily allegorical work full of visions and parables and " The Epistle of Barnabas " , which contains highly - charged language about the Jews as the killers of Christ .
It also includes entire books which , after the Reformation , Protestants decided to drop from their Bibles : the Old Testament books of Tobit , Judith , Wisdom , Ecclesiasticus , Baruch , Maccabbees 1&2 and large chunks of Esther and Daniel .
And the running order of the books is different , reflecting subtle shifts in the priorities of the believers over the ages .
The Codex omits the words which Protestants add to the end of The Lord 's Prayer , and Catholics omit : " For thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever ( Matthew 6:13 ) .
Other differences include it saying that Jesus was " angry " as he healed a leper , where the modern text says he acted with " compassion " .
The story of the stoning of the adulterous woman – " Let he who is without sin cast the first stone " is not there .
Nor are Christ 's words about his executioners from the cross : " Father forgive them for they know not what they do " .
And its Gospel of Mark ends abruptly after Jesus 's disciples discover his empty tomb – omitting the 12 verses on the appearance of the resurrected Christ – and leaving the disciples exiting in fear .
The Codex leaves an unusual blank space where the verses should be .
" That 's a very odd way of ending a Gospel , " says Juan Garces , the curator of the Codex Sinaiticus Project .
Does all that have any real significance ?
The New Testament scholar , Bart Ehrman , has claimed the persecution of the Jews down the centuries might have been far worse had the Epistle of Barnabus remained canonical .
" His blood be upon us , " Barnabas has the Jews cry .
But that overlooks the fact that the Gospel of Matthew contains something very similar , if not worse : " His blood be on us and on our children ! "
And though the Resurrection is missing from Mark , it is there in the Codex 's other gospels .
Will this undermine the fundamentalists ' views ?
You might suppose it would upset those who believe the Bible is the inerrant , unaltered word of God , since the Codex shows there have over the centuries been thousands of alterations to today 's Bible .
But they can counter that there are earlier , individual manuscripts of almost all the books in the Bible ; the Codex just pulls them together into a single volume .
In any case , fundamentalists have long been adept at ignoring the evidence of historical biblical scholarship .
Will it change mainstream Christianity ?
Scholars of the New Testament have been using this Codex for years for textual criticism , so do n't expect anything very new .
The creation of a virtual Codex Sinaiticus will permit the rest of us to see the manuscript as a whole as never before , but no one is expecting anything very dramatic .

There never would have been any such thing to fight for as free speech , free press , free worship , or free soil , if nobody had ever put restraints on men in those matters .
We never should have heard of free trade , if no restrictions had ever been put on trade .
If there had been any restrictions on the intercourse between the states of this Union , we should have heard of ceaseless agitation to get those restrictions removed .
Since there are no restrictions allowed under the Constitution , we do not realize the fact that we are enjoying the blessings of complete liberty , where , if wise counsels had not prevailed at a critical moment , we should now have had a great mass of traditional and deep - rooted interferences to encounter .
Our intercourse with foreign nations , however , has been interfered with , because it is a fact that , by such interference , some of us can win advantages over others .
The power of Congress to levy taxes is employed to lay duties on imports , not in order to secure a revenue from imports , but to prevent imports — in which case , of course , no revenue will be obtained .
The effect that is aimed at , and that is attained by this device , is that the American consumer , when he wants to satisfy his needs , has to go to an American producer of the thing he wants , and has to give to him a price for the product that is greater than that which some foreigner would have charged .
The object of this device , as stated on the best protectionist authority , is : " To effect the diversion of a part of the labor and capital of the people out of the channels in which it would run otherwise , into channels favored or created by law . "
This description is strictly correct , and from it the reader will see that protection has nothing to do with any foreigner whatever .
It is purely a question of domestic policy .
It is only a question whether we shall , by taxing each other , drive the industry of this country into an arbitrary and artificial development , or whether we shall allow one another to employ each his capital and labor in his own way .
Note that there is for us all the same labor , capital , soil , national character , climate , etc. , — that is , that all the conditions of production remain unaltered .
The only change that is operated is a wrenching of labor and capital out of the lines on which they would act under the impulse of individual enterprise , energy , and interest , and their impulsion in another direction selected by the legislator .
Plainly , all the import duty can do is to close the door , shutting the foreigner out and the Americans in .
Then , when an American needs iron , coal , copper , woolens , cottons , or anything else in the shape of manufactured commodities , the operation begins .
He has to buy in a market that is either wholly or partially monopolized .
The whole object of shutting him in is to take advantage of this situation to make him give more of his products for a given amount of the protected articles , than he need have given for the same things in the world 's market .
" If any governmental coercion is necessary to drive industry in a direction in which it would not otherwise go , such coercion must be mischievous . "
Under this system a part of our product is diverted from the satisfaction of our needs , and is spent to hire some of our fellow citizens to go out of an employment that would pay under the world 's competition , into one that will not pay under the world 's competition .
We , therefore , do with less clothes , furniture , tools , crockery , glassware , bed and table linen , books , etc. , and the satisfaction we have for this sacrifice is knowing that some of our neighbors are carrying on business that according to their statement does not pay , and that we are paying their losses and hiring them to keep on .
Free trade is a revolt against this device .
It is not a revolt against import duties or indirect taxes as a means of raising revenue .
It has nothing to say about that , one way or the other .
It begins to protest and agitate just as soon as any tax begins to act protectively , and it denounces any tax that one citizen levies on another .
The protectionists have a long string of notions and doctrines that they put forward to try to prove that their device is not a contrivance by which they can make their fellow citizens contribute to their support , but is a device for increasing the national wealth and power .
These allegations must be examined by economists , or other persons who are properly trained to test their correctness , in fact and logic .
It is enough here to say , over a responsible signature , that no such allegation has ever been made that would bear examination .
On the contrary , all such assertions have the character of apologies or special pleas to divert attention from the one plain fact that the advocates of a protective tariff have a direct pecuniary interest in it , and that they have secured it , and now maintain it , for that reason and no other .
The rest is all afterthought and excuse .
If any gain could possibly come to the country through the gains of the beneficiaries of the tariff , obviously the country must incur at least an equal loss through the losses of that part of the people who pay what the protected win .
If a country could win anything that way , it would be like a man lifting himself by his boot straps .
The protectionists , in advocating their system , always spend a great deal of effort and eloquence on appeals to patriotism , and to international jealousies .
These are all entirely aside from the point .
The protective system is a domestic system , for domestic purposes , and it is sought by domestic means .
The one who pays , and the one who gets , are both Americans .
The victim and the beneficiary are amongst ourselves .
It is just as unpatriotic to oppress one American as it is patriotic to favor another .
If we make one American pay taxes to another American , it will neither vex nor please any foreign nation .
The protectionists speak of trade with the contempt of feudal nobles , but on examination it appears that they have something to sell , and that they mean to denounce trade with their rivals .
They denounce cheapness , and it appears that they do so because they want to sell dear .
When they buy , they buy as cheaply as they can .
They say that they want to raise wages , but they never pay anything but the lowest market rate .
They denounce selfishness , while pursuing a scheme for their own selfish aggrandizement , and they bewail the dominion of self - interest over men who want to enjoy their own earnings , and object to surrendering the same to them .
They attribute to government , or to " the state , " the power and right to decide what industrial enterprises each of us shall subscribe to support .
" The protectionists speak of trade with the contempt of feudal nobles , but on examination it appears that they have something to sell , and that they mean to denounce trade with their rivals . "
Free trade means antagonism to this whole policy and theory at every point .
The free trader regards it as all false , meretricious , and delusive .
He considers it an invasion of private rights .
In the best case , if all that the protectionist claims were true , he would be taking it upon himself to decide how his neighbor should spend his earnings , and — more than that — that his neighbor shall spend his earnings for the advantage of the men who make the decision .
This is plainly immoral and corrupting ; nothing could be more so .
The free trader also denies that the government either can , or ought to regulate the way in which a man shall employ his earnings .
He sees that the government is nothing but a clique of the parties in interest .
It is a few men who have control of the civic organization .
If they were called upon to regulate business , they would need a wisdom that they have not .
They do not do this .
They only turn the " channels " to the advantage of themselves and their friends .
This corrupts the institutions of government and continues under our system all the old abuses by which the men who could get control of the governmental machinery have used it to aggrandize themselves at the expense of others .
The free trader holds that the people will employ their labor and capital to the best advantage when each man employs his own in his own way , according to the maxim that " A fool is wiser in his own house than a sage in another man 's house " — how much more , then , shall he be wiser than a politician ?
And he holds , further , that by the nature of the case , if any governmental coercion is necessary to drive industry in a direction in which it would not otherwise go , such coercion must be mischievous .
The free trader further holds that protection is all a mistake and delusion to those who think that they win by it , in that it lessens their self - reliance and energy and exposes their business to vicissitudes that , not being incident to a natural order of things , cannot be foreseen and guarded against by business skill ; also that it throws the business into a condition in which it is exposed to a series of heats and chills , and finally , unless a new stimulus is applied , reduced to a state of dull decay .
They therefore hold that even the protected would be far better off without it .
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - A leaking Australian oil well is likely to pour oil into the Timor Sea for nearly two months before it can be stopped , the operator said on Sunday , as environmentalists expressed grave fears for rare wildlife .
Rig operator PTTEP Australasia said it planned to drill a relief well and pour mud to stop the leak , which began on Friday with a blow - out more than three kilometers ( two miles ) deep .
It would take 20 days to bring a new offshore drilling rig by barge from Singapore , plus four weeks to drill , the company said in a statement .
Asked if this meant the well would flow for nearly two months , a company spokesman told Reuters : “ That is pretty much the estimation . ”
Environmentalists have expressed concern about the giant slick , saying the entire area is ecologically significant and part of an “ ocean super highway ” for migrating animals between the Indian and Pacific Oceans .
Many breathe air and could surface in the oil , an official of WWF Australia said .
Earlier on Sunday the Australian Maritime Safety Authority used C - 130 Hercules aircraft to spray dispersant chemicals on the slick , which was in excess of 8 nautical miles in length .
Spokeswoman Tracey Jiggins said the results were encouraging but the agency was prepared for a long operation .
PTTEP Australasia , a unit of Thailand ’s PTT Exploration and Production PCL , said a team of international experts recommended drilling a relief well , to intersect the existing well and stop its flow .
Company spokesman Ian Williams gave no estimate of the amount of oil that would be released , but said the company believed it would be possible to prevent the slick spreading .
“ There is a blow - out of some kind .
It is very deep , ” Williams told Reuters , putting the depth at around 3,500 meters .
An air exclusion zone had been set up and ships advised to stay more than 20 nautical miles away from the rig , considered too dangerous to board .
WWF Australia called for changes to ensure better preparations for such disasters , noting it took three days for the first dispersant to be sprayed .
“ From a global scale this is one of the most important places on the planet for ocean wildlife , ” Gilly Llewelyn , WWF Australia ’s director of conservation , told Reuters .
Among the animals affected were three endangered species of turtles , plus sea snakes , she said .
Even a pygmy blue whale has been monitored there .
“ It seems to be one of these critical migration routes -- an oceanic super highway , ” she said .
The spill occurred at the Montara development , a project due to come on stream later this year .
The West Atlas drilling unit is owned by Norway ’s SeaDrill Ltd , but operated by PTTEP Australasia .
The location has been given as about 250 km ( 155 miles ) off the far north Kimberley coast of Western Australia state .
Australia ’s official overseer for the petroleum industry , the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority , was investigating the incident .
Hello !
I ’m back from a three - month posting hiatus .
Together , the Haskell Platform OSX installer I ’ve been working on and getting married have left me with precious little leftover project time .
In the last post in this series , we discussed the design of this website , which was a simple static happstack app with some dynamically - generated content .
In this post , I ’ll describe the new simple content management system ( code - named “ Blaaargh ” ) I ’m now using to power the site .
Features & Requirements
I do n’t need too many fancy features for this personal site .
I do n’t have much use for admin consoles or post editors ; I ’m most comfortable doing my editing in Emacs , and working with flat files .
What I do need : the ability to take a collection of marked - up text ( pages / posts / articles ) in a “ content area ” on the filesystem and have it published in HTML format using templates .
( I chose markdown format on the basis of its ubiquity and the very convenient pandoc library )
the ability to syndicate an RSS / Atom feed for posts in a subdirectory , while excluding parts of the tree ( static files , etc ) .
templatable , via a tree of cascading templates corresponding to the content area files — for example , requesting content / foo / bar / baz.md would cause us to search , in order : templates/foo/bar/baz.st templates/foo/bar/post.st templates/foo/post.st templates/post.st
would cause us to search , in order : the ability to deal with static files
requesting a directory will serve an “ index template ” instead , if it exists
reads configurable parameters ( site title , base URL , hostname , directories to exclude from the feed , etc. ) from a conf file .

Pictured : UFO spotted over theme park in Virginia
Is it or is n't it ?
Look closely at these pictures and video to make up your own mind .
But Denna Smith , a writer in the U.S. , says she knows what she saw .
She believes that the circle she caught on camera floating in the sky above the Kings Dominion theme park in Virginia is a space ship .
What is it ?
An unidentified circular object floats in the sky above the theme park in this footage
Officials at the park insisted the ring was simply smoke from the nearby Volcano ride .
But Ms Smith was not buying it .
The ring is well - formed and is not smoky , she pointed out .
' We were like what is that , we were all stopped and we were astonished . '
Ms Smith posted her video on YouTube , where it has received nearly 300,000 hits in one week .
American cable news channel CNN also picked up the story .
UFO investigator Cameron Pack said Ms Smith 's story has a ring of truth .
Her video is similar to two other recorded incidents , he said - one from Florida in 1999 , and one from Fort Belvoir , also in Virginia , in the 1950s .

[ Updated at 7:00 p.m. :
The summit has taken place and we now have the official beer tally .
President Obama and Sgt. Crowley stayed with their announced choices , but Professor Gates changed it up a bit and drank a Sam Adams Light .
Joe Biden , who joined the other three , enjoyed a nonalcoholic brew called Buckler .
For more details , read the account on The Caucus .
–Ed . ]
Yes , folks , the moment you ’ve all been waiting for has arrived .
The White House has revealed which beers will be consumed during President Obama ’s mediation session tonight with Henry Louis Gates , Jr. of Harvard University and Sgt. James Crowley , the Cambridge police officer who arrested him .
The President will drink Bud Light .
Professor Gates has apparently opted for Red Stripe , the Jamaican lager , while Sergeant Crowley has selected Blue Moon , a Belgian - style wheat beer .
A Huffington Post headline , noting the obvious , termed the choices “ Red , Light and Blue , ” and in fact it ’s hard to imagine that the selections were not subject to a bit of orchestration .
Yet if someone was semi-alert to the color scheme , the politics of the selections leaves at least something to be desired .
At the risk of over - analysis ( and honestly , is n’t that what politics is good for ? ) , we now look a little deeper at the significance of each choice .
The President , who like every Ivy League Democrat must battle the public impression that he ’s an effete snob , made the sensible political decision to go for an American everyman ’s beer .
But by choosing Bud Light rather than simply Budweiser perhaps he did n’t go far enough .
Instead of just grabbing a brew at the end of the day he ’s counting calories with a light beer , which might make sense if he were overweight .
But he ’s thin .
So the light beer comes off as a little too fussy , dare we say , a little too girly - man .
Professor Gates , of that elite Cambridge institution , also had to ground himself .
But you can look at his choice two ways .
The flipside of the serious academic is Spring Break , the seasonal ritual of debauchery , and Red Stripe is a party beer , associated ( at least from a northeastern point of view ) with loosening up the demanding strictures of academic life .
It ’s also from Jamaica , an island with a population primarily of African descent , so perhaps Professor Gates chose Red Stripe as an expression of racial solidarity .
Hard to tell how that plays .
On the one hand , this meeting is partly about overcoming racial attitudes that separate Americans .
On the other , ca n’t we overcome without giving up our individual identities ?
Sergeant Crowley ’s selection is the most puzzling of all .
Clearly , the police officer wanted to go against type .
Instead of the shot - and - a - beer brew one might stereotypically associate with a cop , he instead went with something that sounds like a craft beer .
Yet , as any craft beer fan will scornfully inform you , Blue Moon is made by Coors Brewing Company , and therefore lacks even a shred of craft - brew cred .
What ’s more , the Coors family is known for its conservative politics , which , whatever Sergeant Crowley ’s personal politics , may indicate insensitivity to the bigger picture .
And while Blue Moon could be read as a nod to Sergeant Crowley ’s colleagues in blue , the beer is of the Belgian style known as white ale .
Another nod to racial identity ?
Not well thought out !
Of course , each man may well have chosen the beer he likes best to drink , right ?
No way .
Nobody would choose any of these beers because he likes drinking them .
I ’ll tell you what I would have done if I were President Obama .
First of all , I would n’t give anybody a choice .
I ’d throw political symbolism out the door .
Then , I ’d import a keg of Guinness Stout directly from Dublin , because the kegs from Ireland are simply superior to anything out of a bottle or can .
Then I ’d import a Dublin publican to serve the Guinness because drawing a proper pint is an art that requires vast experience .
Then , I ’d sit ’em down at a bar ( because I ’d bring in the actual pub – this is the White House , it can do anything ) .
“ Gates , you , over there .
Crowley , you , here .
Sit. Publican , draw us some pints !’’
And as that smooth , deep , dark stout begins to pour forth , and the publican perhaps tells a few stories in his rich Irish brogue , a feeling of calm brotherhood settles over the room .
You cannot fight over the first Guinness .
Add in 10 more pints and a rugby match and you ’ve got a riot .
But a pint of Guinness in a Dublin bar at the White House ?
Skip ?
Jim ?
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship .
In the end , the two of them will be doing ads for Guinness .
For a slightly less fanciful reading of the situation , here ’s The Daily Beast ’s interpretation of the beer selections .
But enough from me .
What beers would you serve and drink at the White House tonight ?

KANSAS CITY , Mo. , June 10 ( Reuters ) - Jean Johnson is 81 years old and suffering from diabetes .
But instead of relaxing in retirement , she recently started a new job .
“ I need money .
My social security check just does n’t make it , with rent and the gas bill to pay , ” said Johnson , who took a job in March at a library in Danforth , Illinois .
“ I need to work . ”
Amid the economic downturn , shrinking retirement accounts , increasing costs for food and medicine , and stiff competition for even entry - level jobs , evidence is building that the dream of a comfortable retirement is dying for many Americans .
The ranks of the elderly looking for work has swelled more than 120 percent to more than 1.8 million in the last year .
Among that group , those who were 75 and older increased by 80 percent , according to data from the National Council on Aging .
There are some 29 million seniors - those 55 and older - employed or actively looking for work in the United States , which is about 18 percent of the civilian labor force .
And their numbers are expected to grow .
“ This economic crisis has had just a horrible impact on the entire population , but it has had a very severe impact on older people , ” said Sandra Nathan , workforce development vice president at the National Council on Aging .
Nathan said her organization was seeing a record number of people seeking assistance with job training and employment .
“ Before people used to retire and stay retired .
Now what we have are people 75 years old and older who are still in the workforce , ” Nathan said .
With a national unemployment rate at 9.4 percent , the highest in more than 25 years , the odds are stacked against older Americans seeking work .
An array of new or expanded programs , however , are aimed at leveling the playing field .
The U.S. government has allocated stimulus dollars to bolster programs targeted at getting older workers onto private payrolls and off of the shaky U.S. social security system .
Even individuals over 75 are being encouraged to get training and job hunting help .
“ The recovery act funds came about at exactly the right time , ” said Judith Gilbert , who heads the older worker program at the U.S. Department of Labor .

The department is funding efforts in all 50 states that employ low - income earners who are 55 and over and employed in government or nonprofit jobs that are considered to benefit communities .
The goal is to provide these workers an immediate source of income and ease entry into similar jobs in the private sector .
Lorraine Loy , 59 , found work in Raymondville , Missouri , through the program as a U.S. Forest Service clerk .
Johnson also found her job through the government program .
Loy said her job , which she started June 8 , was needed to pay living expenses for herself and her 65 - year - old disabled husband .
The idea of retirement is a “ farce , ” Loy said .
“ I do n’t ever see myself able to retire . ”
The Labor Department ’s Gilbert said the program , with a budget of $ 571 million for 2009 and $ 120 million in stimulus money received this spring , could pay wages to more than 100,000 seniors over the course of a year .
People must have annual income less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level , or about $ 14,000 , to qualify .
“ The money ... is a really direct stimulus to the economy .
Our folks ... they are not saving it .
They ’re spending this money on groceries , rent and medicine , ” said Gilbert , who added that the program only served an estimated 1 - 2 percent of seniors who wanted and needed to work .
This demand has spurred similar programs .
AARP , a nonprofit organization for people 50 and over , is promoting a national “ employer team , ” and its website features guidance on how senior can prepare a resume , handle tough interviews , and find coveted work - from - home jobs .
Some private employment specialists , such as “ RetirementJobs.com , ” work on ways to keep seniors in the labor force .
And the National Council on Aging also is offering job training and employment assistance .
“ We are really having to work hard and get creative , ” Nathan said .
“ But the thing that will get this economy turned around is putting people back to work . ” ( Editing by Paul Simao )
'' It 's not an easy concept to get your head around .
Many chefs do n't get it but once you do get it , you never go back , '' Best says .
In the process , the protein cells of the most delicate fish barely change , leaving its flesh cooked even though it looks raw .
The cartilage of the toughest brisket can be melted so it reaches a state of tenderness usually associated with fillet .
Even a watermelon can be prepared sous vide to hype its flavour .
Food prepared sous vide ( under vacuum , in French ) is sealed in plastic .
The absence of air lowers its boiling point , allowing proteins to be coagulated at a much lower temperature .
Often , the portion will be cooked in a bain marie , where a thermostat maintains the water temperature at levels precise to 0.1 of a degree .
Alternatively , a steam , or combi , oven is used .
Sometimes , it 's just the act of vacuuming that achieves the desired result of infusing flavour .
Just one mint leaf can flavour a dish of vegetables .
It is one part of a huge arsenal of techniques embraced by the chef - scientists who are dominating international restaurant rankings .
Spanish chefs , led by Ferran Adria of El Bulli restaurant , have created a market for kitchen instruments that would look at home in a laboratory : blast freezers , chrome griddles , water circulators .
There 's no need for a naked gas flame these days .
'' I have used the technology but I have n't made it so removed that [ diners ] do n't know what 's going in [ their ] mouths , '' says Universal restaurant 's Christine Manfield , who believes most patrons are unaware fine restaurants are cooking sous vide .
Beyond the city 's adventurous top chefs , cooking in a plastic bag is still regarded with suspicion , according to Robert Erskine , who sells high - tech gadgets and equipment for Spanish company International Cooking .
Erskine says they are not yet snapping up the thermostat , vacuum sealer and water circulator needed to cook sous vide .
'' Chefs are still looking at it .
They do n't buy it , '' Erskine says .
'' It 's a coming thing . ''
But Sydney 's three - hatted chefs have been doing it for years .
Tetsuya Wakuda of Tetsuya 's says reading about the method inspired his renowned confit of ocean trout in 1987 .
At first , he used oil to create the air vacuum .
It was n't until the early 1990s that he had success with the new equipment .
Fish expert and chef Greg Doyle says even bananas get the treatment in one of the desserts in his restaurant , Pier .
At Marque , strawberries are cooked sous vide with sugar at 65 degrees for 40 minutes .
Their grey carcasses are discarded and the remaining syrup is put back in a plastic bag with fresh strawberries and then vacuum sealed .
The process forces the syrup into the fresh strawberry , creating hyper-real , translucent flesh .
Similarly , Best says , watermelons and cucumbers are given an exaggerated flavour so a diner might think : '' This is like the watermelon I used to know . ''
The new technology has allowed food to be developed without pricey ingredients .
Best says high - end restaurants are no longer distinguished by a menu of overtly luxurious ingredients such as truffle , foie gras and caviar .
'' It 's the intrinsic quality of every ingredient we focus on .
Caviar is [ just ] slightly fishy eggs .
It 's the same with meat .
If you look at the fillet , its only qualities are [ its tenderness ] but , really , it 's not flavoursome and the texture can be a little mundane . ''
Best uses tough cuts like brisket and short rib , cooks them for 18 hours at 65 degrees , chills them in an ice bath , returns them to a water bath for 40 minutes at 55 degrees and then sears the portion before it is put on the plate and served .
The end product looks like a medium - rare steak but with much more flavour .
'' This is a third - class braising cut turned into a first - class product through this technology , '' Best says .
'' Traditionally , fillet was the cut that was only at the best restaurants …
Now there 's been a complete [ reversal ] .
Why would we bother with fillet ? ''
At Quay , Peter Gilmore does similar things to a shoulder of lamb , traditionally another cheap cut , cooking it for 24 hours .
Another beloved instrument is the Pacojet , which creates instant sorbets and ice - creams .
There is no need to add sugar to stop the ice - crystalisation process , Best says .
It enables him to put the humble pea at centre stage in a sorbet , with no other ingredients besides a little salt and pepper .
Best calls it the ' ' peasant mentality ' ' of using everything .
The same goes for fish .
'' There 's no waste from our kitchen . ''
Apart from those plastic bags .
Erskine estimates each of the top kitchens goes through 1000 bags a week .
Chef Shannon Bennett of Melbourne 's
Vue de monde says the wastage is a problem : '' You feel there 's a real trend that will start with this .
It 's so convenient and so healthy …
The only area I would like to see improved is the vacuum - pack bags . ''
There is something about this laboratory - like cooking that is a bit , well , frigid .
Fans of Anthony Bourdain 's Kitchen Confidential account , with all its heat , both allegorical and real , will not love what sous vide heralds : the cold kitchen .
There are no aromas with sous vide .
Everything is sealed into the food and saved for the plate .
It is now possible to set up without any exposed flame , thanks to the development of induction stoves , steam ovens , blenders that cook while they mix and water thermostats .
Bennett does it at his new outlet , Cafe Vue at 401 , Melbourne .
The advent of sous vide has allowed chefs to prepare more before service starts , taking the stress out of the kitchen environment .
In a traditional kitchen , '' people are trying to time things , putting them into the oven , tasting , saucing ' ' , Best says .
'' That 's a super - heated and stressful environment and that 's not conducive to quality . ''
Manfield agrees : '' For me it 's about efficient , calm cooking . ''
For something so apparently cutting edge , sous vide has been around a long time .
The method was developed in the 1970s in France for Pierre Troisgros , one of the fathers of nouvelle cuisine , to stop foie gras shrinking under heat .
It has been applied heavily in industrial food preparation , thanks to the work of food scientist Bruno Goussault .
After initially working with hotel chains and airlines on low - heat cooking , Goussault 's methods caught on with chefs such as Thomas Keller , who were becoming increasingly interested in the science of food .
The Roux brothers , who revived French cuisine in England and mentored hundreds of chefs , are also credited with spreading the word .
Dietmar Sawyere of Berowra Waters
Inn has been using the technique since he worked as executive sous chef for Regent International Hotels in Hong Kong in the mid-1980s .
'' Sous vide cooking started with a reheating method , then a lot of chefs around the world played around with it , '' he says .
Sawyere sees no reason to broadcast the method .
'' One of the things I have noticed is chefs will put on the menu ' cooked sous vide ' … I see it as an irrelevance .
I would n't put ' cooked in a roasting pan ' or ' baked in a baking tray ' .
It 's a cooking method . ''
By contrast , Quay restaurant 's Peter Gilmore wears the method loud and proud because customers are curious , he says .
'' There 's no doubt , the face of cooking through sous vide has changed , '' Gilmore says .

As a mere gag , they respond to a man 's newspaper ad for a date , only to find it will greatly complicate their lives .
China ’s worst ethnic violence in years broke out Sunday in the northwestern city of Urumqi , leaving 140 people dead and more than 800 injured .
The unrest pitted Uighurs , a long - aggrieved Muslim minority , against the Han Chinese , who increasingly dominate the far - flung Xinjiang region .
With the death toll climbing over the course of the day , the violence appeared to be far deadlier than that last year in the Tibetan region .
Images from the city of 2 million showed flames raging from overturned cars and black smoke billowing over downtown .
Urumqi was virtually closed down today , with vehicles barred in much of the city , telephone lines and the Internet down .

Chinese bloggers wrote that at least one bomb exploded during the incident and that about 100 public buses were destroyed .
The Chinese government accused Uighur exiles in the U.S. of masterminding what was described by state television as a rampage of “ beating , smashing , robbing and burning . ”
But representatives of the Uighurs , a Muslim minority , countered that they were holding a peaceful demonstration that turned ugly because of government brutality .
“ Under Chinese law , we should have the right for a peaceful protest against what the Chinese government is doing to our people , ” Dilxat Raxit , a spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress , said in a telephone interview from his home in Sweden .

He described the incident as the most serious unrest in Urumqi , capital of Xinjiang region , where 8 million Uighurs live uneasily among the majority Han Chinese .
Witnesses reported that riot police arrived on the scene in armored personnel carriers , dispersing the crowd with water cannons and tear gas , and firing warning shots into the air .
At least 300 people were reported to have been arrested and 828 injured .
The trouble began shortly after 3 p.m. , when about 300 Uighurs held a sit-in at People ’s Square .
Later , thousands of Uighurs began marching .
By nightfall , riots had spread throughout the city , concentrated around the traditional market area known as Erdaoqiao .

Video that circulated on the Internet for a few hours before being removed by Chinese censors showed a crowd that appeared to be about 3,000 - strong marching through the city .
In another scene , people subdued with cuffs and ropes were lying on the pavement .
In what was emerging as a battle of images , Chinese television countered with footage of rioters overturning a police car .
Two young women with blood streaming down their faces , who appeared to be victims , hugged each other and wept .
A man said to have been beaten by the mob was quoted by the official New China News Agency as saying , “ They took to the street , not peacefully , carrying knives , wooden batons , brick and stone . ”
The imagery bore an eerie resemblance to those that came out of Lhasa , the Tibetan region ’s capital , in March 2008 when years of suppressed rage by Tibetans erupted in rioting .
The Tibetan unrest dragged on through much of the year and threatened to mar the festivities around the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing .

It is unclear whether the Uighurs ’ protests will have a similar effect during another sensitive year , in which Beijing is planning massive celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the founding of communist China .
Sunday ’s protests were triggered by the June 26 killing of two young Uighur men at a toy factory in Guangdong province .
According to Uighur sources , the men were beaten to death by a mob , enraged by false rumors that they had sexually harassed Han women .
“ Uighurs have suffered for years under racial profiling and unjust government policies that have painted the entire Uighur population as criminals and terrorists , ” U.S. - based Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer said in a statement released last week .

China considers
Uighur activists to be criminals and terrorists for their opposition to Beijing ’s rule over Xinjiang .
The news agency today quoted an unidentified Chinese government official as saying that “ the violence was masterminded ” by Kadeer .
Alim Seytoff , secretary - general of the Uyghur American Assn. and Kadeer ’s spokesman , said in an e-mail from Washington late Sunday that the demonstrators were not separatists and that many had carried the Chinese flag on the march .
“ They only asked the Chinese government to stop racial discrimination against Uighurs . . . .
However , you will see what kind of brutal force they met , ” he wrote .

The Obama administration has been struggling in recent months to resettle Uighur detainees who had been held at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , since they were captured in Pakistan in 2001 .

EXCLUSIVE :
Associate Attorney General Thomas J. Perrelli , the No. 3 official in the Obama Justice Department , was consulted and ultimately approved a decision in May to reverse course and drop a civil complaint accusing three members of the New Black Panther Party of intimidating voters in Philadelphia during November ’s election , according to interviews .
The department ’s career lawyers in the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division who pursued the complaint for five months had recommended that Justice seek sanctions against the party and three of its members after the government had already won a default judgment in federal court against the men .
Front - line lawyers were in the final stages of completing that work when they were unexpectedly told by their superiors in late April to seek a delay after a meeting between political appointees and career supervisors , according to federal records and interviews .
The delay was ordered by then - acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King after she discussed with Mr. Perrelli concerns about the case during one of their regular review meetings , according to the interviews .
Ms. King , a career senior executive service official , had been named by President Obama in January to temporarily fill the vacant political position of assistant attorney general for civil rights while a permanent choice could be made .
She and other career supervisors ultimately recommended dropping the case against two of the men and the party and seeking a restraining order against the one man who wielded a nightstick at the Philadelphia polling place .
Mr. Perrelli approved that plan , officials said .

Questions about how high inside the department the decision to drop the case went have persisted in Congress and in the media for weeks .
Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler told The Washington Times that the department has an “ ongoing obligation ” to be sure the claims it makes are supported by the facts and the law .
She said that after a “ thorough review ” of the complaint , top career attorneys in the Civil Rights Division determined the “ facts and the law did not support pursuing the claims against three of the defendants . ”
“ As a result , the department dismissed those claims , ” she said .
“ We are committed to vigorous enforcement of the laws protecting anyone exercising his or her right to vote . ”
While the Obama administration has vowed a new era of openness , department officials have refused to answer questions from Republican members of Congress on why the case was dismissed , claiming the information was “ privileged , ” according to congressional correspondence with the department .
Rep. Frank R. Wolf , Virginia Republican and a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee who has raised questions about the case , said he also was prevented from interviewing the front - line lawyers who brought the charges .
“ Why am I being prevented from meeting with the trial team on this case ? ” Mr. Wolf asked .
“ There are many questions that need to be answered .
This whole thing just stinks to high heaven . ”
Ms. Schmaler said the department has tried to cooperate with Congress .
“ The Department responded to an earlier letter from Congressman Wolf in an effort to address his questions .
Following that letter , the Department agreed to a meeting with Congressman Wolf and career attorneys , in which they made a good - faith effort to respond to his inquiries about this case .
We will continue to try to clear up any confusion Congressman Wolf has about this case . ”
Ms. King and a deputy are expected to travel to Capitol Hill on Thursday to meet behind closed doors with House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. , Michigan Democrat , and Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas , the top Republican on the panel , to discuss continuing concerns about the case .
The department also has yet to provide any records sought by The Times under a Freedom of Information Act request filed in May seeking documents detailing the decision process .
Department officials also declined to answer whether any outside groups had raised concerns about the case or pressured the department to drop it .
Kristen Clarke , director of political participation at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in Washington , however , confirmed to The Times that she talked about the case with lawyers at the Justice Department and shared copies of the complaint with several persons .
She said , however , her organization was “ not involved in the decision to dismiss the civil complaint . ”
She said the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has consistently argued that the department should bring more voter intimidation cases , adding that it was “ disconcerting ” that it did not do so .
Mr. Perrelli , a prominent private practice attorney , served previously as a counsel to Attorney General Janet Reno in the Clinton administration and was an Obama supporter who raised more than $ 500,000 for the Democrat candidate in the 2008 elections .
He authorized a delay to give department officials more time to decide what to do , said officials familiar with the case but not authorized to discuss it publicly .
He eventually approved the decision to drop charges against three of the four defendants , they said .
At issue was what , if any , punishment to seek against the New Black Panther Party for Self - Defense ( NBPP ) and three of its members accused in a Jan. 7 civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia .
Two NBPP members , wearing black berets , black combat boots , black dress shirts and black jackets with military - style markings , were charged in a civil complaint with intimidating voters at a Philadelphia polling place , including brandishing a 2 - foot - long nightstick and issuing racial threats and racial insults .
Authorities said a third NBPP member “ managed , directed and endorsed the behavior . ”
The election - day incident gained national attention when it was captured by a voter - fraud citizen activist group on videotape and distributed on YouTube ( below ) .
None of the NBPP members responded to the charges or made any appearance in court .
“ Intimidation outside of a polling place is contrary to the democratic process , ” said Grace Chung Becker , a Bush administration political appointee who was the acting assistant attorney general for civil rights at the time the case was filed .
“ The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed to protect the fundamental right to vote and the department takes allegations of voter intimidation seriously . ”
Mrs. Becker , now on a leave of absence from government work , said she personally reviewed the NBPP complaint and approved its filing in federal court .
She said the complaint had been the subject of numerous reviews and discussions with the career lawyers .
Mrs. Becker said Ms. King was overseeing other cases at the time and was not involved in the decision to file the original complaint .
A Justice Department memo shows that career lawyers in the case decided as early as Dec. 22 to seek a complaint against the NBPP ; its chairman , Malik Zulu Shabazz , a lawyer and D.C. resident ; Minister King Samir Shabazz , a resident of Philadelphia and head of the Philadelphia NBPP chapter who was accused of wielding the nightstick ; and Jerry Jackson , a resident of Philadelphia and a NBPP member .
“ We believe the deployment of uniformed members of a well - known group with an extremely hostile racial agenda , combined with the brandishing of a weapon at the entrance to a polling place , constitutes a violation of Section 11 ( b ) of the Voting Rights
Act which prohibits types of intimidation , threats and coercion , ” the memo said .
The memo , sent to Mrs. Becker , was signed by Christopher Coates , chief of the Voting Section ; Robert Popper , deputy chief of the section ; J. Christian Adams , trial attorney and lead lawyer in the case ; and Spencer R. Fisher , law clerk .
None of the four has made themselves available for comment .
Members of Congress continue to ask questions about the case .
“ If showing a weapon , making threatening statements and wearing paramilitary uniforms in front of polling station doors does not constitute voter intimidation , at what threshold of activity would these laws be enforceable ? ”
Mr. Wolf asked .
Mr. Smith also complained that a July 13 response by Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich to concerns the congressman had about the Philadelphia incident did not alleviate his concerns .
“ The administration still has failed to explain why it did not pursue an obvious case of voter intimidation .
Refusal to address these concerns only confirms politicization of the issue and does not reflect well on the Justice Department , ” Mr. Smith said .
Mr. Smith asked the department ’s Office on Inspector General to investigate the matter , and the request was referred to the department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility .
Lawmakers are n’t alone in the concerns .
The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said in a June 16 letter to Justice that the decision to drop the case caused it “ great confusion , ” since the NBPP members were “ caught on video blocking access to the polls , and physically threatening and verbally harassing voters during the Nov. 4 , 2008 , general election . ”
“ Though it had basically won the case , the [ Civil Rights Division ] took the unusual move of voluntarily dismissing the charges , ” the letter said .
“ The division ’s public rationale would send the wrong message entirely — that attempts at voter suppression will be tolerated and will not be vigorously prosecuted so long as the groups or individuals who engage in them fail to respond to the charges leveled against them . ”
The dispute over the case and the reversal of career line attorneys highlights sensitivities that have remained inside the department since Bush administration political appointees ignored or reversed their career counterparts on some issues and some U.S. attorneys were fired for what Congress concluded were political reasons .
Mr. Weich , in his letter to the congressman , sought to dispel any notion that politics was involved .
He argued that the department dropped charges against three of the four defendants “ because the facts and the law did not support pursuing ” them .
He said the decision was made after a “ careful and through review of the matter ” by Ms. King .
He said :
• While the NBPP made statements and posted notice that more than 300 of its members would be deployed at polling places throughout the United States during the Nov. 4 elections , the statement and posting did not say any of them would display a weapon or otherwise break the law .
• While the complaint charged that the NBPP and Mr. Zulu Shabazz endorsed the activities at the polling places , the evidence was “ equivocal ” since both later disavowed what happened in Philadelphia and suspended that city ’s chapter after the incident .
• The charges against Mr. Jackson were dropped because police who responded to the polling place ordered Mr. Samir Shabazz to leave but allowed Mr. Jackson to stay .
He also noted that the department approved “ appropriately tailored injunctive relief ” against Mr. Samir Shabazz for his use of the nightstick .
The injunction prohibits Mr. Samir Shabazz from brandishing a weapon outside a polling place through Nov. 15 , 2012 , and Ms. Schmaler said the department “ will fully enforce the terms of that injunction . ”
On its Web page , the NBPP said the Philadelphia chapter was suspended from operations and would not be recognized until further notice .
It said the organization did not condone or promote the carrying of nightsticks or any kind of weapon at any polling place .
“ We are intelligent enough to understand that a polling place is a sensitive site and all actions must be carried out in a civilized and lawful manner , ” it said .

Witnesses who supported the Justice Department case said they were surprised by the reversal .
Stephen R. Morse , a blogger hired by Republicans to be at the polls and who videotaped the confrontation , said the NBPP members blatantly used racial insults on would - be voters and other poll watchers , telling one man , “ Cracker , you about to be ruled by a black man . ”
Mr. Morse , a University of Pennsylvania alumnus , said he was “ outraged ” that the complaint was dismissed , saying he hoped Democrats would join Mr. Smith and Mr. Wolf in attempting to ensure that the incident “ does n’t become a partisan issue , but rather an issue of right vs. wrong . ”
Chris Hill , national director of operations for a Gathering of Eagles , an organization dedicated to the support of U.S. troops , said the NBPP members visibly intimidated voters with racial slurs as they tried to enter the building .
Mr. Hill , a U.S. Army veteran who also served as a Philadelphia poll watcher for Republicans , said several voters at the location said they were afraid .
He said the NBPP members tried to deny him access to the poll although he was a certified poll watcher , telling him , “ White power do n’t rule here . ”
A Justice Department memo also says that a black couple , Larry and Angela Counts , both Republican poll watchers , told authorities they were scared , worried about their safety and concerned about leaving the polling place at the end of the day because of the actions of the NBPP members .
Mrs. Counts said she wondered whether someone might “ bomb the place ” and Mr. Counts said the NBPP members called him a “ race traitor , ” the memo said .
U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell in Philadelphia entered default judgments against the NBPP members April 2 after ordering them to plead or otherwise defend themselves .
They refused to appear in court or file motions in answer to the government ’s complaint .
Two weeks later , the judge ordered the Justice Department to file its motions for default judgments by May 1 — a ruling that showed the government had won its case .
The men also have not returned calls from The Times seeking comment .
On May 1 , Justice sought an extension of time and during the tumultuous two weeks that followed the career front - line lawyers tried to persuade their bosses to proceed with the case .
The matter was even referred to the Appellate Division for a second opinion , an unusual event for a case that had n’t even reached the appeals process .
Appellate Chief Diana K. Flynn said in a May 13 memo obtained by The Times that the appropriate action was to pursue the default judgment unless the department had evidence the court ruling was based on unethical conduct by the government .
She said the complaint was aimed at preventing the “ paramilitary style intimidation of voters ” at polling places elsewhere and Justice could make a “ reasonable argument in favor of default relief against all defendants and probably should . ”
She noted that the complaint ’s purpose was to “ prevent the paramilitary style intimidation of voters ” while leaving open “ ample opportunity for political expression . ”
An accompanying memo by Appellate Section lawyer Marie K. McElderry said the charges not only included bringing the weapon to the polling place , but creating an intimidating atmosphere by the uniforms , the military - type stance and the threatening language used .
She said the complaint appeared to be “ sufficient to support ” the injunctions sought by the career lawyers .
“ The government ’s predominant interest … is preventing intimidation , threats and coercion against voters or persons urging or aiding persons to vote or attempt to vote , ” she said .
The front - line lawyers , however , lost the argument and were ordered to drop the case .
Bartle Bull , a civil rights activist who also was a poll watcher in Philadelphia , said after the complaint was dropped , he called Mr. Adams to find out why .
He said he was told the decision “ came as a surprise to all of us ” and that the career lawyers working on the case feared that the failure to enforce the Voting Rights Act “ would embolden other abuses in the future . ”

Substantial numbers of terrestrial vertebrates are restricted to mangrove forests .
Many of these specialized species are listed as threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature .
Prospects for mangrove - restricted animals are bleak , because more than two percent of mangrove forests are lost each year .
More than 40 percent of a sample of amphibians , reptiles , mammals , and birds that are restricted to mangrove ecosystems are globally threatened with extinction , according to an assessment published in the July / August issue of BioScience .
The study , by David A. Luther of the University of Maryland and Russell Greenberg of the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center , was based on an extensive literature search and expert consultations .
The conclusions emphasize the vulnerability of animals that are dependent on a habitat rapidly being lost or degraded through coastal development , overexploitation , pollution , and changes in sea level and salinity .
Mangroves , which are salt - tolerant woody plants concentrated along coastal margins , generally in warm regions , have long been known to support many species of animals .
Hundreds of vertebrates are sometimes found in mangroves , but Luther and Greenberg concentrated on the 69 terrestrial vertebrate species and subspecies that seem restricted to mangroves : 48 birds , 14 reptiles , 6 mammals , and 1 amphibian .
These include several species with striking adaptations , such as specialized glands to excrete salt .
The ground foragers among them feed primarily on crabs , but many of the birds feed on insects .
For unclear reasons , mangrove - restricted species and subspecies are concentrated in Asia and Australia .
Between the early 1980s and 2001 , between 19 and 35 percent of the world 's mangrove forest area was lost .
At this rate of loss -- about 2 percent each year -- mangroves could be extinct in 100 years .
Only 27 of the terrestrial vertebrates that are dependent on mangroves have been assessed by the IUCN ( International Union for the Conservation of Nature ) , and 13 of those are classified as threatened on the IUCN Red List , Luther and Greenberg report .
They urge research aimed at predicting how continuing changes to mangrove forests are likely to affect the species found there : such information could guide attempts to conserve these specialized ecosystems .

R. Allen Stanford complains about heat in Conroe cell Stanford feels the heat in Conroe cell
Lawyers for R. Allen Stanford want him moved from a private prison in Montgomery County because there 's no air conditioning , and at times no lighting , in the cell he shares with up to 10 other inmates .
The head of Stanford Financial Group has been held at Joe Corley Detention Facility in Conroe since he was arrested and brought to Texas from Virginia last month .
He and other Stanford executives are accused of running a multibillion dollar fraud through an offshore bank and a Houston financial services firm .
He has pleaded not guilty .
Although other defendants are free on bail , a Houston federal judge ordered that Stanford remain in custody , saying he is a flight risk .
In court filings , attorney Dick DeGuerin says the cell Stanford shares was without power for part of last week when temperatures topped 100 degrees and “ has been without air conditioning for at least a week .
There are no windows for light or ventilation and the conditions are intolerable . ”
DeGuerin also noted without elaborating that the Corley facility 's rules against the use of electronics on site interfere with Stanford 's ability to work with lawyers to prepare his defense .
The detention facility is run by Boca Raton , Fla. - based GEO Group .
Company spokesman Pablo Paez declined comment on the jail 's conditions .
DeGuerin is asking that Stanford be moved to the Federal Detention Center in downtown Houston , which is run by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons .

U.S. Atty . Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said Wednesday that the Justice Department has no plans to prosecute pot dispensaries that are operating legally under state laws in California and a dozen other states -- a development that medical marijuana advocates and civil libertarians hailed as a sweeping change in federal drug policy .
In recent months , Obama administration officials have indicated that they planned to take a hands - off approach to such clinics , but Holder ’s comments -- made at a wide - ranging briefing with reporters -- offered the most detailed explanation to date of the changing priorities toward the controversial prosecutions .
The Bush administration targeted medical marijuana distributors even in states that had passed laws allowing use of the drug for medical purposes by cancer patients , those dealing with chronic pain or other serious ailments .
Holder said the priority of the new administration is to go after egregious offenders operating in violation of both federal and state law , such as those being used as fronts for drug dealers .
“ Those are the organizations , the people , that we will target , ” the attorney general said .

Medical marijuana activists and civil libertarians embraced Holder ’s latest statement as the most forceful affirmation of what long had been anticipated : a landmark turnaround from the Bush administration ’s policy of zero tolerance for cannabis use by patients .
“ Whatever questions were left , today ’s comments clearly represent a change in policy out of Washington .
He ’s sending a clear message to the DEA , ” said Ethan Nadelmann , executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance .
Cultivating , using and selling medical marijuana are allowed in some instances under California law .
But such actions are outlawed entirely under federal law , which supersedes those of the states .
A dozen other states have laws similar to California ’s , according to the Marijuana Policy Project , an organization that supports the legalization of the drug .
In the 13 years since California voters made the state one of the first to legalize medical marijuana , federal officials have won all the major legal battles , including one at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2001 in which their right to prosecute marijuana sellers was upheld .
But supporters of medical marijuana have fought back on the political front , and Holder ’s announcement is their biggest victory so far .

Thom Mrozek , a spokesman for Thomas P. O’Brien , the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles , said the office already focused on egregious offenders such as those who sell drugs to minors and people with bogus prescriptions or those who operate away from their approved location .
“ In every single case we have prosecuted , the defendants violated state as well as federal law , ” Mrozek said .
Despite the abundance of medical marijuana dispensaries in Southern California , Mrozek said prosecutors have charged only four operators and their associates in the last seven years .
Obama suggested during the presidential campaign that medical marijuana dispensaries operating within state law would not be subject to prosecution if he were elected .

But soon after his inauguration , the Drug Enforcement Administration raided several dispensaries in the Los Angeles area and near Tahoe , in what appeared to be a continuation of policies enforced under previous administrations .
At Wednesday ’s briefing , his first major sit - down with reporters , Holder was asked if the Justice Department planned to raid any more clinics .
“ The policy is to go after those people who violate both federal and state law , to the extent that people do that and try to use medical marijuana laws as a shield for activity that is not designed to comport with what the intention was of the state law , ” Holder said .
“ Those are the organizations , the people , that we will target .
And that is consistent with what the president said during the campaign . ”
A Justice Department official confirmed that Holder ’s comments effectively articulated a formal Obama administration policy of not going after such clinics .
“ Before , he did n’t really lay out the policy .
Today , he stated the policy , ” said the Justice Department official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly .

“ If you are operating a medical marijuana clinic that is actually a front , we ’ll come after you , ” the official said .
“ But if you are operating within the law , we are not going to prioritize our resources to go after them . ”
Bruce Mirken of the Marijuana Policy Project said he still has some concerns :
What happens to dispensary operators caught up in raids during the last days of the Bush policy , and would federal drug agents resist “ trumping up ” violations to circumvent the Obama administration ’s edict .
“ The devil is going to be in the details of implementation , ” Mirken said .
“ I think you have to assume that there are people within the DEA and some in local law enforcement who still do n’t like medical marijuana and would like to find an excuse to continue making arrests of law - abiding dispensary operators . ”

Times staff writer Eric Bailey contributed to this report .
In 1999 , Paul Krugman ( 2008 's Nobel prize winner in economics ) published The Return of Depression Economics , a sort of catalog of the catastrophic failures in the industrialized economies of Asia and Latin America throughout the 1990s .
Between 1991 and 1998 , severe financial crises struck Japan , Russia , Brazil , Mexico , Thailand , and Indonesia .
Although the trigger for crisis was slightly different in each instance , the commonality was that when things went wrong , they began to spiral out of control very quickly .
Upon reading Krugman 's work , one is hardly so surprised by the current economic crisis .
But if this crisis was so foreseeable , how come so few people foresaw it ?
Let me divert your attention momentarily to something more important : baseball .
Each year , baseball teams bid against one another for free agents — players like CC Sabathia , Mark Teixeira , and A. J. Burnett , the trio of stars whom the ( apparently recession - proof ) New York Yankees have signed for more than $ 400 million .
One might assume that with that sort of money at stake , teams would do their homework .
After studying the free - agent bidding process for many years , however , I have concluded that this money is not generally well spent .
Teams tend to discount risk , particularly the risk of injury .
And they tend to place too much emphasis on recent performance as opposed to a player 's longer track record , invariably overpaying for a player who had a career year .
These contracts are one manifestation of a phenomenon known as recency bias — the tendency to place too much weight on recent events .
Think of the gambler who doubles her bet at the blackjack table because she 's won her past couple of hands — her odds have n't changed any , but her perception of them has .
The invisible hand of the market is supposed to uncover such inefficiencies .
If home buyers are obviously overpaying for properties , for instance , a well - informed investor like a large hedge fund ought to be shorting mortgage stocks .
If the American economy is weakening , possibly into recession , a venture - capital firm ought to be liquidating its assets .
A few prescient investors , certainly , did exactly these sorts of things .
But for the most part , the economy was caught with its invisible hand in the cookie jar .
Could recency bias have been the culprit ?
" Most economists are so caught up in the theory du jour that they fail to study economic history , " Maggie Mahar , author of Bull !
A History of the Boom and Bust , 1982 - 2004 , wrote in an e-mail to me .
" The most successful investors I have ever known were steeped in market history .
History did n't mean ' what 's happened in the past 15 years since I have been on Wall Street ' — it meant what has happened since World War II . "
I decided to set up a rudimentary statistical experiment .
Suppose it 's January 2008 and you 're an investor — or an economist — trying to forecast the probability of a major downturn in the United States economy .
We 'll define such a downturn as occurring any time real GDP falls at an annualized rate of 4 percent in any one quarter , which is about equal to the decline experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Between 1947 and 2007 , quarterly GDP fell by this amount on eleven separate occasions .
About the simplest economic model one can build is to assume that fluctuations in GDP occur randomly and follow a normal bell - curve distribution .
From there , it is reasonably straightforward to calculate the percentage chance of a " crash " — a 4 percent decline in GDP — in any given quarter .
If you had done this calculation in January 2008 , using data from the past sixty years — roughly since the end of World War II — you would have estimated the chance of a crash in the upcoming quarter to be 3.17 percent , implying about one crash for every eight years of economic activity .
Not exactly an everyday occurrence , but certainly something you would need to be prepared for .
But suppose instead that your time horizon is shorter .
You decide to look only at data from the past twenty years — or essentially since Alan Greenspan took over as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1987 .
With that time horizon , the risk of a crash appears to be very low indeed .
In fact , you would assess the probability to be just 0.04 percent — meaning one crash for every 624 years .
This deceptively simple choice of assumptions , then , turns out to make a huge amount of difference .
If you 'd looked at data from the mid-eighties onward , instead of from World War II onward , you 'd have underestimated the risk of a crash by a factor of about 80 .
Moreover , if you were to conduct this " crash - risk " calculation retroactively and graph it over time , you 'd identify a couple of inflection points at which the potential impact of recency bias increases .
Using a twenty - year time horizon , your perceived risk of a crash would fall dramatically as of about 1995 , once you started to " forget " about the oil crisis of the mid-1970s — this happens to coincide with the beginnings of the dot - com bubble .
Then a few years later , as of 2001 or 2002 , the risk of a crash would fall almost to zero , as the economic turmoil of the early 1980s begins to be written off by investors .
This happens to coincide with the start of the housing bubble .
It does n't necessarily take an unforeseeable combination of events , then , to precipitate a market crash like the one we 're now experiencing ; a short memory span would suffice .
Still , market crashes do not always precipitate economic catastrophe .
The crash of 1987 was hardly felt by the broader economy , and the dot - com bust was weathered relatively well .
The difference today might have been that the crash was triggered by a collapse of housing prices , something that had ramifications far deeper down the wealth pyramid .
( As of 2004 , the top 10 percent of American income - earners held about 78 percent of the value of stocks but just 34 percent of home equity . )
Some economists certainly understood that the housing bubble was occurring .
But there were few recent examples to draw from in terms of gauging its impact on the broader economy .
( The last precipitous decline in American housing prices came during World War I . )
What the profession might have done is to overestimate the strength of the American economy 's immune system .
There are two seemingly contradictory conclusions to this parable .
First , economists and investors ought to be wary of unknown unknowns — what Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls " black swans . "
The feedback mechanisms of the economy are sufficiently complex that no amount of foresight or sound fiscal policy will be able to entirely stave off the possibility of a crash , no matter how much stability the economy seems to have achieved .
And second , they also need to remember just how long the long run is .
In fact , perhaps our recency bias has led us to conclude that the situation today is worse than it actually is .
Housing prices are significantly off their peaks , for instance , but have still increased by roughly 20 percent since January 2000 , after adjustment for inflation .
And we remain wealthier now than we were at almost any other point in the past ( per capita disposable income is about 18 percent higher than it was a decade ago ) .
If the good times are never as good as they seem , neither , perhaps , are the bad ones so bad .

Gene scientist Craig Venter has announced plans to develop next - generation biofuels from algae in a $ 600 m ( £ 370 m ) partnership with oil giant Exxon Mobil .
His company , Synthetic Genomics Incorporated ( SGI ) , will develop fuels that can be used by cars or aeroplanes without the need for any modification of their engines .
Exxon Mobil will provide $ 600 m over five years with half going to SGI .
" Meeting the world 's growing energy demands will require a multitude of technologies and energy sources , " said Emil Jacobs , vice president of research and development at ExxonMobil .
" We believe that biofuel produced by algae could be a meaningful part of the solution in the future if our efforts result in an economically viable , low - net carbon emission transportation fuel . "
Transport accounts for one - quarter of the UK 's carbon emissions and is the fastest growing sector .
Finding carbon - neutral fuels will be crucial to the government meeting its target to reduce overall emissions by 80 % by 2050 .
Algae are an attractive way to harvest solar energy because they reproduce themselves , they can live in areas not useful for producing food and they do not need clean or even fresh water .
In addition , they use far less space to grow than traditional biofuel crops such as corn or palm oil .
" Algae consumes carbon dioxide and sunlight in the presence of water , to make a kind of oil that has similar molecular structures to petroleum products we produce today , " said Jacobs .
" That means it could be possible to convert it into gasoline and diesel in existing refineries , transport it through existing pipelines , and sell it to consumers from existing service stations . "
The Carbon Trust , a government - backed agency that promotes low - carbon technologies , has forecast that algae - based biofuels could replace more than 70bn litres of fossil fuels used every year around the world in road transport and aviation by 2030 , equivalent to 12 % of annual global jet fuel consumption or 6 % of road transport diesel .
In carbon terms , this equates to an annual saving of more than 160 m tonnes of CO2 globally with a market value of more than £ 15bn .
Ben Graziano , research and development manager at the Carbon Trust , said that alge - based biofuels offered the potential for " major carbon savings " .
" Exxon Mobil is estimating that algae could yield just over 20,000
litres of fuel per hectare each year , which is in line with our own forecasts .
However , producing biofuel from algae on such a massive commercial scale is a major challenge , which will require many years of research and development . "
Venter , who is best known for his role in sequencing the human genome , said the new partnership was the largest single investment in trying to produce biofuels from algae but said the challenge to creating a viable next - generation fuel was the ability to produce it in large volumes .
" This would not happen without the oil industry stepping up and taking part , " he said .
" The challenges are not minor for any of us but we have the combined teams and scientific and engineering talents to give this the best chance of success . "
The research programme will begin with the construction of a new test facility in San Diego , where Venter says different techniques to grow and optimise algae will be tested .
These will include open ponds as well as bioreactors , where the algae are grown in sealed tubes .
" We will be trying out these different approaches … using newly - discovered natural algae to test the best approaches we can come up with to go into a scale - up mode . "
Venter has spent several years trawling the world 's oceans in search of environmentally - friendly microbes that could be used , in one way or another , to bring down the world 's carbon emissions .
The organisms he has found include those that can turn CO2 into methane , which could be used to make fuels from the exhaust gases of power stations , and another that turns coal into natural gas , speeding up a natural process and reducing both the energy needed to extract the fossil fuel and the amount of pollution caused when it is burned .
Power Switches that Aren’t
A few weeks ago , I noticed a colleague at work had a Kill - A - Watt power usage meter , which he allowed me to borrow .
It ’s a great device , and relatively inexpensive , so I quickly bought one for myself .
I went around the house measuring all sorts of devices , particularly things like my networking gear that is on all of the time , some of the computers , and entertainment equipment .
As expected , many of these devices draw some power in their standby modes ; this is necessary if they have a clock , or can be turned on via a wireless remote .
I was expecting the DVR ( DirecTV HD model ) to take a significant amount of power on standby , but I was shocked by the comparison between “ off ” and “ on ” power usage :
On : 40 watts
Off : 38 watts
That ’s right , there is only a 2 watt difference between being turned on and turned off !
It seems that all that the “ power ” button must do is to turn on the front - panel LEDs and turn on the video output circuitry .
Of course , there are a lot of nice features you get by having the receiver effectively on all the time : the program guide is continuously up to date and the remote recording feature allows one to request a recording via the Web or an iPhone app .
So I checked our bedroom set , which is connected to an older - model , non-HD , DirecTV receiver :
On : 11 watts
Off : 10 watts
Only 1 watt different !
The program guide still needs updating for this receiver , but of course one can’t remotely request a recording from it .
Does it have to be that way ?
I ’d be happy with a program guide that ’s a few hours old , and with remote recording that requires that I give it a little bit of advance notice .
So why not have the receiver ( and recording processor and disk in the DVR ) switch to a “ real ” standby mode most of the time , with a timer that wakes it every so often to receive instructions and updates from the satellite ?
It would also wake when a remote - control or front - panel command is received .
How much power are we talking about ?
At the end of 2008 , DirecTV had 17.6 million subscribers .
Let ’s assume ( I think very conservatively ) that there are 10 million DVRs and 10 million non-DVRs ( since some subscribers have more than one TV ) .
Suppose , through power cycle management , we can reduce power consumption 90 % of the time to 2 watts for the non-DVRs ( typical of home audio equipment ) and to 10 watts tor the DVRs ( typical of a sleeping home computer ) .
That works out to a savings of 324 megawatts , just for DirecTV customers .
Other satellite receivers , DVRs , and cable set - top boxes have this problem as well , although I do n’t know to what extent .
Another way to look at this is that a more efficient DVR could save about 221 kWh per year , and a more efficient non-DVR receiver could save about 65 kWh / year .
The irony is that on both receivers , the button is labeled “ Power ” .
It ’s almost as if they felt they needed that button as a feel - good measure .
The adoption of a charter or bill of rights would represent the final triumph of elitism in Australian politics : the notion that typical citizens , elected by ordinary Australians , cannot be trusted to resolve great issues of public policy , and that the really important decisions should be taken out of their hands and given to judges who , after all , have a superior capacity to determine these matters .
The three great guarantees of Australian democracy are a robust parliamentary system , an independent and incorruptible judiciary and a free and sceptical press .
Our parliamentary system has many flaws but ultimately it sets the tone of national debate and ought to be the ultimate decision maker .
It is the identifiable and collective representation of public opinion .
For as long as I was in Parliament , and I am sure it will continue , there was a periodic concern about a perceived decline in the public 's respect for the institution of Parliament .
The explanations were many and varied .
Politicians were only interested in themselves ; they misbehaved at question time ; they were too partisan ; there were too many professional politicians with a diminishing number having had real - life experience in business , genuine community service , a profession or a trade .

In a multi-user environment ,
security of user and system data is very important .
Access should be given
only to users who need to access the data .
Since Linux is essentially a
server OS , good and efficient file security is built right into Linux .
Of
course , such security does create problems for users , especially novice

Many user queries are due to incorrect file permissions or just
because a user ignores that fact that the file permissions do not allow

First , let 's check out the file permissions .
File permissions are defined
for users , groups and others .
User would be the username that you are
logging in as .
Further more , users can be organized into groups for better
administration and control .
Each user will belong to at least one default
group .
Others includes anyone the above categories exclude .

the file permissions .
The third and the fourth column show the owner of
the file and the group that the file belongs to .
The first entry here is tmp .
The first character in the first column is
' d ' , which means the tmp is a directory .
The other entries here are files ,
as indicated by the ' -' .

The next 9 characters define the file permissions .
These permissions are
given in groups of 3 each .
The first 3 characters are the permissions for
the owner of the file or directory .
The next 3 are permissions for the
group that the file is owned by and the final 3 characters define the
access permissions for everyone not part of the group .
There are 3
possible attributes that make up file access permissions .
r - Read permission .
Whether the file may be read .
In the case of a
directory , this would mean the ability to list the contents of the
directory .
w - Write permission .
Whether the file may be written to or modified .
For
a directory , this defines whether you can make any changes to the contents
of the directory .
If write permission is not set then you will not be able
to delete , rename or create a file .
x - Execute permission .
Whether the file may be executed .

Dear brother Nicholas ,
Thank you so much for your very nice email .
You sound like a very caring person , and I hope that God rewards your hard work appropriately and I am sure he will look after you and ensure you receive everything that you deserve .
I will most certainly pray for you this evening and ensure my members do the same .
I am sorry but in this instance I am unable to help you with your current proposition .
Please do note that my church give yearly donation and financial help to the underprivileged , sick and needy every year .
In total we give approximately $ 12 million a year to the less fortunate and needy of the world .
What can I say , my church is very generous !
Sadly I am afraid that I am unable to help you at this time .
You see the rules of my Christian ministry forbid members of my church from any business dealings personal , charitable , business or otherwise with people who are not part of our church or faith , so although I would normally be most pleased to help you my hands are tied .
I would like to help your very noble cause by sending a generous donation of perhaps $ 40,000 or $ 150,000 to help you to help others as you are trying .
But because you are not a member of my church it is sadly out of the question .
It seems there is no hope for Nicholas .
But wait , there 's a light at the end of the tunnel :
Of course , if you were to go through the induction procedure and join our church then of course I could help you , and even send a donation for you to pass on to the less fortunate and spread the word of our church , but of course I do not and would not expect you to go through the induction procedure for our church because it requires a lot of commitment to our church so of course I can understand if you refuse .
Odds on Nicholas refusing anyone ?!
So once more , I apologise that I cannot help you at this time , but I will pray for you this evening that you find the help that you require .
God be with you , Father Bruce Corbin

Dear Brother Okorie ,
Thank you very much for your kind email
Brother Okorie , I have to tell you that I am extremely thrilled that you are indeed considering joining our church .
Your commitment is to be admired greatly .
However you must understand that in order for me to be able to help you it means you will have to join our church , and you must ( like all our members ) prove your absolute devotion to our cause and church .
You must complete our short induction procedure before you can join with us .
The induction procedure is simple , but you must be warned that it must not be taken upon lightly .
I must tell you that to join our church you must show great commitment , however the rewards are great .
Once you have become a member and have completed the induction procedure I am sure that my board members can help you with a most generous donation , especially if as you say you are interested in setting up a branch of our ministry in your country to help spread the word our church .
I cannot give you a firm commitment as to the amount of the donation we can send to you to help others , but it is normal in these types of cases for my church to offer sums of between $ 40,000 to $ 150,000 if you are indeed serious about helping us to spread the word of our ministry .
Of course , in order to receive such financial help you must become a full and willing member of our church .
Again I must repeat I that to enter our ranks does take great commitment .
All members of our church ( myself included ) must bear the tattoo mark of our saint , Saint Bartholomew Shiver .
This mark of faith is tattooed on to each individual member of our church .
Not only does this serve as a graphic reminder of our commitment to our faith , but all over the world it helps us to recognise our brothers and sisters .
It is a golden rule of our church that our members must do everything in their power to help and aid fellow members .
So , to be inducted into our church , you must agree to the following :
1. Agree to have a tattoo showing the mark and name of Saint Bartholomew Shiver .
This can be placed on any part of your body .
2. Provide photographic proof of the tattoo mark .
3 . Agree to use any donations sent to you for the good of your fellow men & women .
If you can agree to the above requirements then I see no reason why we cannot start your induction procedure immediately .
On receipt of the photographic proof of your tattoo mark of St. Bartholomew and on receipt of the completed induction form we can provide you with a generous donation and regular help within 24 hours of receiving the photographic proof .
We will also of course send much information by posts contain information about the church , and how we would like you to help spread word of our church and cause .
Let me know if you are in agreement to the above requirements and I will forward you more detailed information and also a picture of the tattoo mark of St. Bartholomew so that you can make your own arrangements to have the tattoo applied at your place of choosing .
Of course agreeing to have a tattoo placed upon your body is a very important one , and committing yourself to this is a great request , but it is exactly this which will show us your willingness to be a part of our ministry .
Please note that you must be able to fund the tattoo and photographs yourself .
We will of course refund you all your costs as well as provide the donation to you , however this can only be given once the induction procedure has been completed successfully .
Thank you again for your email .
God be with you ,

Dear Brother Okorie ,
Thank you so much for your reply .
I am very excited that we are soon to have a new member from your country , indeed , so far we have no members at all in your area and we would be thrilled if you are able to help spread the word about our ministry there .
As you have requested , the induction information is as follows .
Please take care to follow the procedures very carefully .
The four church board members will decide on your donation amount which depends on how strictly you have kept to our procedure .
The induction procedure , which we call " the baiting of the faithful " should take very little time to complete .
How long this takes is completely up to you and how quickly you are able to present the photographic evidence that you have completed our procedure to the satisfaction of the four church board members .
As I told you previously , the faster that you are able to complete the procedure the faster you will receive our financial help .
INSTRUCTIONS
1 . I have attached a sample image of our induction logo .
It bears the name of our Saint , St. Bartholomew Shiver .
Phase one of the induction procedure is to have a copy of this logo tattooed onto a part of your body .
2 . You may choose the part of the body which you feel comfortable with having the tattoo , however you must ensure that the completed tattoo is large and clear so as to be able to be photographed clearly .
To aid you , I have also included a photograph of one of our recent inductees , Mary Jane Branson .
As you can see , Mary chose to have the induction logo tattoo on her right shoulder .
3 . You must ensure that photographs of as much of the tattooing procedure are taken as possible .
Take photographs of the various steps of having the tattoo applied .
4 . You must supply various photographs of the tattoo from different viewing angles , and also a photograph of yourself for identification , and if possible , showing the tattoo at the same time .
To aid you further I have attached a picture of one of our latest inductees Miss Mary Clifton showing her tattoo mark of Saint Shiver .
** VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY ***
You must understand that the tattoo MUST be a real tattoo , not a drawing or other type of fake tattoo .
In other words , being a real tattoo you will of course have it with you for life , so it is important that you are absolutely sure and happy about your decision to join our church .
Photos MUST be supplied so as to provide proof that a real tattoo has been applied .
Sadly , some people have tried to fool us by applying fake tattoos , but I must warn you that our four man board are extremely diligent and can recognise a fake tattoo very easily .
If your tattoo shop need it , we are happy to provide them with payment for their services and allowing you to take photographs of the tattooing process .
Payment to the tattoo shop can be up to US $ 1,000 .
If you provide us with a receipt after the tattoo has been applied we will send payment to them immediately the photographs have been received .
NOTE : One photograph is not enough .
You must provide MULTIPLE photographs showing as much of the tattooing as possible .
We require at minimum for you to send by email attachment HIGH QUALITY PHOTOGRAPHS of the following :
1 . The first stage of the tattoo being applied to the inductee .
If possible , photographs showing the tattoo artist actually applying the tattoo would give great encouragement to the board members and will result in your donation payment being a higher amount .
2. Photographs of the tattoo immediately after it has been completed , so that the board members will be able to ascertain it is real because of normal scarring or marking .
3. Photographs taken 24 hours later , showing the healed tattoo .
It is your decision what colour to make the tattoo , but please ensure you choose a colour which can be photographed clearly .
Most of our members choose to have a black tattoo applied .
Again , it is entirely your decision what part of your body to have the tattoo applied to .
All you need to do is ensure the tattoo is large and clear enough to be photographed clearly .
Places that our members usually choose are : arms , top of the legs , or back shoulders .
I must stress to you again that the tattoo must be real , and the photographs you send will be inspected very carefully to ensure that they are .
I am sorry that I have to keep repeating this to you brother but as I have already told you , sadly there are ungodly people out in the world who try to take advantage of our church by applying for donations by sending in fake photographs , this is why it is very important that the photographs you send by email attachment are very large and clear so that the validity of the tattoos can be checked easily .
Poor quality or small images will be rejected by the board members .
I offer one piece of advice brother ; the board members usually give larger donations depending on the size of the tattoo .
So the larger the tattoo the larger the donation payment is liable to be , but the very minimum we send to help is $ 40,000 so as you can so you will be able to do a lot of very good work with such an amount .
Of course , once you become a member you will be invited to our yearly gathering here in the UK ( your flight fees and expenses will of course be paid by us ) and you will be able to meet many of our members and well as myself .
I hope that explains things clearly to you brother , and if you have any questions please feel free to contact me any time .
Please will you reply to this email as soon as possible to let me know when you expect to be able to email me the photographs .
The four board members work all across the UK so they will need to be gathered to examine your photographs and make the donation payment .
This may take 2 or 3 days , so if I know in advance when you are likely to be ready to send the photographs I can ensure that the board members are gathered together in readiness for your photographs .
Please also let me know by what means you would prefer the donation payment to be made .
God be with you ,
Father Bruce Corbin

Dear Brother Okorie ,
Thank you for your reply .
Please note this reference number : 11871-232
Please use this reference number on all future communications .
This number will be used in processing your payment and also for identification / security purposes .
The induction form will be sent to you on receipt of the photographs .
One of your photographs has to be included on the forms ( again for identification purposes ) .
The form is very simple and really only requires your signature .
Well , no it does n't , but I do n't want to put Okorie off at this delicate stage !
Please can you advise me how you would like your donation payment to be made ?

Looks painful .... hopefully !
And here 's the proud owner ( for now ) of a new tattoo
A close - up of some fine work !
Congratulations to Nicholas Okorie for being the first scammer on the planet to be suckered into having a tattoo !
I 'm quite surprised how easy this was to achieve .
I have a few more scammers going through the same process , and they are showing a little more resistance than Okorie .
Just shows what sheer greed can do to you I suppose .

Dear Brother Okorie ,
Thank you so much for sending your induction photographs enlarged this morning , it is very much appreciated .
Unfortunately the board members do not meet on Saturday or Sunday so it will be Monday before I am able to announce your donation amount but I can tell you that you should be happy with the amount awarded .
" Happy " is a very relative term here by the way folks !
I am happy to inform you that from what I myself have seen you have performed the procedure perfectly , thank you again .
I will forward the induction application form to you shortly .
This just requires your details filling in and your signature .
One this is completed your award amount can be paid immediately .
Also , please will you forward me a copy of any official ID that you have that bears your photographs , such as a passport , driving license or other governmental identification .
Some details need to be included on the induction form .
Blessings ,

Dear Brother Okorie ,
I am sorry brother Okorie , but that ID is totally unacceptable .
The image is too small and too blurred .
Unless you are able to scan the original ID to a proper size and NOT just try to stretch the tiny original image then we cannot accept it .
Also , that particular ID is unacceptable as it is not an official governmental ID such as your driving license or passport image .
Your church ID is not acceptable I am afraid .
I am afraid that sending the incorrect ID is causing a delay in your payment .

Holy Church of The Tattooed Saint INDUCTION FORM ATTACHED
A note from the webmaster
On the heels of Canada ’s change in labeling laws , the FTC is stepping up enforcement against manufacturers making misleading claims about bamboo fabric that violate labeling requirements .
If you ’re using bamboo fabrics or blends and making similar claims , you ’ll need to change your labeling and marketing practices quickly .
The FTC has charged four firms - the tip of the iceberg - with violating the Textile Act by , in part , labeling rayon products as “ bamboo ” .
Legally and technically , fabric made of bamboo is rayon and must be labeled as such .
[ The FTC will permit companies to label products as “ rayon made from bamboo , ” if one can prove it … and supplier dishonesty is a topic best left to another day . ]
I think confusion has risen because considering the context , it ’s common to label fabric products according to basis of component fibers used in them .
Such examples are cotton , silk , linen , wool etc .
The difference with rayon is that although it is a natural cellulose based fabric ( made of wood , bamboo and even cotton lintner ) , it is man-made - but man -made fabrics are not labeled according to ingredients .
For example , just as you do n’t see “ petroleum ” listed on the care labels of polyester products , you wo n’t see “ wood ” listed on the care labels of rayon products .
Therefore it holds that rayon made of bamboo must also be legally labeled as rayon .
Also consider the example of lyocell , another cellulose based rayon - like fabric .
Lyocell is the generic name while Tencel is the brand name .
Products made of Tencel must be labeled as lyocell on care labels to comply with FTC regulations .
In some ways , it might be easier to define rayon as a process rather than a product .
The FTC enforcement action is intended to hold producers accountable and to reduce consumer confusion over greenwashing .
Here ’s the gist of it :
The Federal Trade Commission has charged four sellers of clothing and other textile products with deceptively labeling and advertising these items as made of bamboo fiber , when they are made of rayon .
The complaints also charge the companies with making false and unsubstantiated “ green ” claims that their clothing and textile products are manufactured using an environmentally friendly process , that they retain the natural antimicrobial properties of the bamboo plant , and that they are biodegradable …
The FTC also charges three of the companies [ … ] with violating the Textile Act and Rules by advertising or labeling their products without disclosing where the products were manufactured …
The proposed orders do allow the companies to describe their products as “ rayon made from bamboo , ” as long as this is true and can be substantiated .
The FTC has provided guidance to manufacturers which will be useful to amend your labeling practices .
In any event , not labeling where your products are manufactured is a big no - no .
I ca n’t count the number of companies on the web who do not list the country of origin in the descriptions for individual items on the catalog pages of their websites .
Why this matters
The FTC is concerned that consumers are being misled by greenwashing .
Although rayon is a natural but man made fabric , rayon production is highly toxic ( Avtex , the largest EPA Super Fund clean up site was a rayon plant ) .
Of all the fabrics in the rayon family , lyocell is considered to be the most eco-friendly because Lenzing , the firm that manufacturers lyocell , has a certified closed loop system .
While many bamboo producers claim they use a closed loop system , the claims are dubious for two reasons .
The first is that lyocell is a proprietary process patented by Lenzig which has not licensed the process to any bamboo producers .
Secondly , while it ’s possible bamboo producers have developed their own proprietary closed loop processes , no firms to date have permitted inspectors on site to verify these claims .
Claims of bamboo superiority are widespread on the internet and must be critically considered .
For example , one site attempts to make the case for bamboo ( rayon ) by comparing it to cotton when a fairer comparison is to compare bamboo rayon to regular rayon .
In truth , the only advantage appears to be that bamboo is quickly replenished but caveats ( below ) abound .
Regardless , this advantage is comparatively negligible because regular rayon is made of wood recycled from lumber processing .
Another site bolsters their claims of bamboo ’s lower toxic load by employing a bait and switch , launching into a description of the lyocell process that is not ( yet ) used in bamboo rayon production .
Unless one reads carefully , one can be easily misled to believe bamboo rayon production is less toxic and superior to regular rayon or cotton production and this has yet to be proven .
Examples of questionable claims :
Claim : Organic bamboo fiber clothing is naturally anti-microbial …
It … prevents bacteria from cultivating on it .
Fact : Rayon , regardless of input ( wood pulp or bamboo ) and whether organic or not , does n’t mildew as easily as some other natural fabrics .
If “ anti-microbial ” is intended to convey the characteristic of preventing bacteria growth ( mildew resistance ) , then this would be true - of all rayons , not just bamboo .
Claim : Bamboo apparel is thermal regulating , anti-fungal , anti-static and will keep you cooler , drier , warmer and odor free .
Fact :
This is characteristic of rayon , regardless of whether made by wood or bamboo .
Claim : Bamboo is grown without pesticides .
Fact :
Trees used to make rayon are also grown organically without pesticides .
The only trees sprayed with pesticides are fruit and nut trees and this wood is not likely to be used in rayon production because the lumber harvested at the end of the tree ’s life cycle is highly coveted .
Fruit and nut lumbers are used in expensive furniture , veneers and consumer products .
Furthermore , it is not possible for residual pesticides to remain in the fiber at the end of the rayon process .
Claim : Bamboo is hypoallergenic , breathable , and absorbent .
Fact : Again , true of all rayons .
Claim : Growing bamboo improves soil quality and helps rebuild eroded soil .
The extensive root system of bamboo holds soil together , prevents soil erosion , and retains water in the watershed .
Fact :
This is also true of trees used to make rayon .
Claim : Bamboo grows naturally without the need for agricultural tending and large diesel exhaust - spewing tractors to plant seeds and cultivate the soil .
Fact :
Also true of trees used to make rayon .
Claim : Bamboo fabrics and clothing can be manufactured and produced without any chemical additives
Fact :
This is wildly untrue of any rayon regardless of the material used for the cellulose base .
Claim : Bamboo grows rapidly and naturally without any pesticides , herbicides or fertilizers .
Fact :
On the face of it , this is all true .
As a practical matter , the rise of bamboo ’s popularity has led to the hazards common to commercialization .
For example , clearing vast tracts for bamboo production has contributed to deforestation , rendering a mono - culture at the expense of biodiversity .
Similarly , acreage formerly used for food production has given way to bamboo cultivation .
What ’s more , herbicides are increasingly used to reduce competing foliage .
Summary :
The point of this discussion is not whether you should use rayon whether made of bamboo or anything else because rayon has many desirable properties , but that rayon made of bamboo should be labeled and marketed according to the law .
However , if your purchasing decisions are motivated by sustainability , experts agree that hemp and organic cotton are better alternatives to rayon .

Despite the fact that science has proven we descended from the same common ancestor as primates did millions of years ago , it 's a known fact that most humans today have a remarkably similar DNA , a fact that until now raised questions as to how we failed to diversify among ourselves more .
Some researchers have proposed that the catastrophe that followed the eruption of the Toba supervolcano , in what is now Sumatra , some 74,000 years ago , is the main culprit for this .
It may be that the devastation that came after the unimaginable eruption was responsible for reducing the hominid population to just a few hundred thousand individuals altogether .
While investigating the human DNA , geneticists arrived at the conclusion that a massive die - off of humans must have occurred between 90,000 and 60,000 years ago , a time frame that is consistent with the timing of the Toba eruption .
The “ bottleneck ” in human development explains why we still have almost the same genetic make - up – rather than evolving for millions of years , as first thought , we may have only had about 76,000 years to do so .
While this may seem like a lot , it 's but a wink on the geological time scale , which stretches back billions of years , LiveScience reports .
A favored explanation among scholars has been that the supervolcano 's eruption brought forth an Ice Age that led to the development of thick glaciers , which covered the land feeding countless animal and plant species .
A massive extinction event occurred , and only few species managed to survive .
However , while modeling this scenario in computer simulations , researchers noticed that none of the six versions of the idea that they 'd tried led to the onset of a glacial epoch , not even when considering changes in sunlight and planetary chemistry , as well as drops in global temperatures .
However , Rutgers University expert Georgiy Stenchikov and his team noticed that , while no Ice Age ensued , the weather patterns indeed changed , and , in all models , a decade of severe volcanic winter appeared .
“ The ' volcanic winter ' following a supervolcano eruption of the size of Toba today would have devastating consequences for humanity and global ecosystems .
These simulations support the theory that the Toba eruption indeed may have contributed to a genetic bottleneck , ” the experts wrote in a study published in the latest issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmospheres .
Brought to the “ black site ” in diapers , the paper says , the prisoner ’s head and face were shaved , he was stripped and photographed and sleep deprivation and a diet limited to Ensure Plus , a dietary drink , began .
“ The interrogators ’ objective , ” the background paper says , “ is to transition the HVD to a point where he is participating in a predictable , reliable and sustainable manner . ”
The policy was to use the “ least coercive measure ” to achieve the goal .
The harsh treatment began with the “ attention slap , ” and for three prisoners of the nearly 100 who passed through the program , the endpoint was waterboarding .
Waterboarding might be an excruciating procedure with deep roots in the history of torture , but for the C.I.A. ’s Office of Medical Services , recordkeeping for each session of near - drowning was critical .
“ In order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations , it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented , ” said medical guidelines prepared for the interrogators in December 2004 .
The required records , the medical supervisors said , included “ how long each application ( and the entire procedure ) lasted , how much water was used in the process ( realizing that much splashes off ) , how exactly the water was applied , if a seal was achieved , if the naso - or oropharynx was filled , what sort of volume was expelled , how long was the break between applications , and how the subject looked between each treatment . ”
When the doctors gauged what a drenching in a cold cell might do to a prisoner , they did their research , consulting a textbook entitled “ Wilderness Medicine , ” in particular Chapter 6 on “ accidental hypothermia , ” as well as a Canadian government pamphlet , “ Survival in Cold Waters , ” according to footnotes .
Lawyers at the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , likewise , were immersed in the details of investigations .
A week before he completed the first major legal opinion that authorized the use of physical pressure , John C. Yoo , the national security specialist in the counsel ’s office , was faxed a six - page C.I.A. “ psychological assessment ” of the first man the brutal methods would be used on , Abu Zubaydah .
“ Subject is a highly self - directed individual who prizes his independence , ” the assessment said .

1. Above is the photo of normal Perodua Kenari that you can easily find on Malaysian road .
However , during the crash with a container trailer last week , the car had " lost " its original - well - being .
2 . The impact of the crash threw four of the victims out of the car and the baby 's body was sadly found in a drain .
The Perodua Kenari was dragged for about 80 m before coming to a stop at the edge of a hill .
Based on words from the witnesses , the trailer rammed into the middle road divider and a lamp post which broke into two before colliding with the car from the opposite lane .
3 . Fatigue is the most probable cause of the accident .
Based on words from trailer driver assistant , the trailer driver had driven for 48 hours in a row without sleep and rest .
As for any braking marks , the investigation team found them on the trailer travelling lane but cannot confirm as yet because they are probably due to brake marks from other vehicles which suddenly stopped after saw the accident .
Plus , the widths of the skid marks were not matched with the width tire of the trailer .
Below are some more post - crash photos of the unlucky Perodua Kenari .
4 . And this is the photo of the trailer which hit the Perodua Kenari .
5 . Well , it is not the lorry driver was 100 % to be blamed .
Instead , we should blame the trailer company because they were not implementing a good safety , health and environment ( SHE ) procedures for their employees .
Look what has happened ?
It is not impossible that same accident will happen again in the future if the fleet company still do nothing and can easily escape during this kind of incident .
6 .
In conclusion , fatigue can really kill people .
So , please make sure before you drive any vehicles , you are in a good shape , getting enough sleep and eating well .
If not , we might kill people without intending to do it .
Five persons were not a small number to begin with .
So let 's drive safe .
( CNN ) --
When it comes to taking spirited vacations , wandering a vineyard falls flat in the face of handcrafted brew .
With more than 1,500 breweries across the United States , beer is not just a drink -- it 's a destination .
Wooden barrels of beer are just part of the draw at The Lost Abbey Brewery in San Diego , California .
" What 's happened is that the old world has influenced the new world ; the U.S. is now a travel destination for beer , [ even ] for people from outside of the country , " said Julia Herz , craft beer program director at the Brewers Association .
" What 's so great about beer is that you have this range , " said Randy Mosher , author of " Tasting Beer : An Insider 's Guide to the World 's Best Drink . "
" It 's from 3 percent alcohol to 20 percent , from super malty to very hoppy , and then you throw in stuff like fruit , spices -- you have an enormous range of possibilities . "
With such a wide flavor profile , said Stephen Beaumont , author of " Premium Drinker 's Beer Guide , " beer travel is less about hanging out at the brewery and more about the tasting .
In other words , do n't look just for an incredible brewer , but also for an incredible city in which to drink beer .
Although it 's a highly contested question that Herz calls " fodder for late - night philosophical conversations , " there are a few brew towns that these beer aficionados identify as the cream of the hops .
Eat , drink and brew local
If you did n't know that Portland , Oregon , is synonymous with " Beervana , " then you clearly need an introduction to the beer scene .
" In a lot of ways , [ it 's ] a very highly developed town for craft beer , " Mosher said .
The city has a reputation for going local , and Portland thoroughly applies that philosophy to brewing .
" When you live in Portland , you become entrenched in the whole hops and malts [ thing ] because you 're living right where it 's being produced , " said Portland resident Angelo De Ieso of beer site Brewpublic.com .
Thirty percent of the world 's hops come from the Pacific Northwest and Idaho , De Ieso said .
The other major pull is the " high concentration of breweries , " Beaumont said .
" Portland is a fairly small compact area , [ but ] they 've got a free transit system , and they 've got brewpubs chockablock . "
Higgins Restaurant and Bar is a great place to get advice on navigating the local beer scene , according to Beaumont .
And while you 're there , you can sample their impressive beer list including Oregon - bottled Rogue Morimoto Imperial Pilsner and The Bruery 's " Trade Winds " Triple out of California , a brewer that Beaumont notes is " up - and - coming , doing phenomenal stuff . "
As for breweries , De Ieso said " the one that really stands out is Upright Brewery with their Belgian farmhouse style beers . "
Another stop has to be Hopworks Urban Brewery , an all - organic brewpub fully powered with renewable energy .
" They do a lot of the standard styles of Northwest beers , like the IPA , which is our flagship beer , " De Ieso said .
Try the signature Hopworks IPA for a taste of Pacific Northwest flavor .
SoCal brew style
Much further south , in San Diego , California , you 'll find what Beaumont calls " a hotbed of innovation , " where the beer tends " to be a little stronger , with more alcohol . "
And while " all of California could be considered the state from which the innovators of craft beer came , San Diego specifically grabbed the golden ring from the merry go round and ran with it , " said Matt Simpson , a craft beer consultant .
So when you 're talking San Diego - style beer , for most beer geeks you 're talking about The Lost Abbey .
" The most notable guy right now is Tomme Arthur at Lost Abbey .
He was one of the early adventurous brewers in Southern California , " beer tasting expert Mosher said .
Known for Belgian - style beers and a " flavor first " philosophy , beer expert Beaumont said " they 're doing some really innovative , interesting stuff in terms of barrel aging and unusual fermentations , beyond basic brewers yeast . "
Beer experts also fawn over AleSmith , a microbrewery that has been pumping out diverse , high quality ales since 1995 .
" The special beers that they do are astounding , if not sublime , " Simpson said .
" They do a barrel - aged series , and those beers are limited to 250 bottles or less , so you can imagine the supply and demand market for them . "
Flavors of the South
Although other beer lovers often skip over the South because of restrictive brewing laws in some areas , Simpson insisted that some of the best brew can be found below the Mason - Dixon line .
" One of my top three is North Carolina , with Asheville being the center of that .
Not only is it a really fun place to visit , they make amazing beers , " he said .
" There 's Foothills , a brewpub that has a breakout hit called Sexual Chocolate , an imperial stout that put them on the map of craft beer . "
Simpson also touts his home stomping grounds , Atlanta , Georgia .
" We have one of the top five beer bars in the world in the Brick Store Pub , across the board , " Simpson said .
" You can go to Greatbeers.com , Ratebeer.com , Beeradvocate.com -- they 're rating the Brick Store Pub as one of the top beer bars in the world .
And if you 're here for a few days you can hit breweries like Sweetwater , 5 Seasons , and Twain's . "
Whether your drink town of choice is San Diego or Philadelphia , San Francisco or Boston , Beaumont recommends chatting up locals for clues on the local beer scene .
" Beer is a social drink , and beer people love to talk about the beer , " he said .
" You can find a local or savvy visitor who can tell you about something you 've never heard of , and that makes it a phenomenal experience . "

FTC Sues , Shuts Down N. Calif .
Web Hosting Firm
In an unprecedented move , the Federal Trade Commission has taken legal steps to shut down a Web hosting provider in Northern California that the agency says was directly involved in managing massive global spam operations .
Sometime on Tuesday , more than 15,000 Web sites connected to San Jose , Calif. , based Triple Fiber Network ( 3FN.net ) went dark .
3 FN's sites were disconnected after a Northern California district court judge approved an FTC request to have the company 's upstream Internet providers stop routing traffic for the provider .
In its civil complaint , the FTC names 3FN and its various monikers , including Pricewert LLC -- the business entity named on the 3 fn. net Web site registration records .
The FTC alleges that Pricewert / 3FN operates as a " ' rogue ' or ' black hat '
Internet service provider that recruits , knowingly hosts , and actively participates in the distribution of illegal , malicious , and harmful content , " including botnet control servers , child pornography and rogue antivirus products .
3FN also operates by the names APS Telecom and APX Telecom .
In an interview with Security Fix , FTC Chairman Jonathan Leibowitz
said the agency 's action targets one of the Web 's worst actors .
" Anything bad on the Internet , they were involved in it , " Leibowitz said .
" We 're very proud , because in one fell swoop we 've gone after a big facilitator of some of the utterly worst conduct . "
The FTC chairman confirmed that this was the first time the agency had sought and been granted an order to shut down an Internet service provider .
Efforts to contact 3FN via phone , instant message and e-mail were unsuccessful .
I will update this post in the event I hear back from them .
The FTC alleges that even though Pricewert officially is registered in Oregon , its principals and staff are located outside of the United States .
" Pricewert markets its services to domestic and overseas criminals by placing ads in the darkest corners of the Internet , including forums set up to facilitate communication between criminals , " the FTC complaint said .
( The image on the right is a screen shot of an ad for 3 FN 's services I found running on verified .ru , one of the busiest Russian online forums dedicated to identity theft and the sale of stolen identities ) .
" Pricewert hosts very little legitimate content and vast quantities of illegal , malicious , and harmful content , including child pornography , botnet command and control servers , spyware , viruses , trojans , phishing related sites , illegal online pharmacies , investment and other Web - based scams , and pornography featuring violence , bestiality , and incest , " the FTC said .
The FTC also said that not only was 3FN hosting sites promoting illegal activities , but that its owners and operators were directly facilitating and brokering those businesses .
The commission references several Internet chat logs in which the head of programming for Pricewert / 3FN is observed directly participating in the creation and configuration of a botnet .
" The customer informs Pricewert that he controls 200,000 bots and needs assistance configuring the botnet .
The head of Pricewert 's Programming Department agrees to assist , but complains upon learning of the size of the botnet that it will require a lot of work , " the FTC 's complaint alleges .
Botnet experts
I have spoken with over the past eight months have found that 3FN housed many of the command and control networks for " Cutwail , " one of the world 's largest spam botnets .
As late as mid-April , Joe Stewart , a botnet expert and director of malware research at SecureWorks , tracked nearly a dozen Cutwail control networks hosted at 3FN .
Indeed , in February , Security Fix began tracking malware samples from Cutwail and its cousin Pushdo that traced back to 3FN , dating back to at least October 2008 .
These reports were listed at ThreatExpert.com .
A copy of that record -- with citations from malware analysis reports is available at this link here ( Microsoft Excel document ) or in HTML format .
The Internet addresses colored yellow in those charts belong to 3FN .
Among the most popular sites on 3 FN 's hosting servers was botmaster .net , the home of an extremely popular service and software product used to blast out massive amounts of blog comment spam .
Mark Rasch , a former cyber crime prosecutor for the Justice Department and a principal at the Arlington , Va. , based Internet Law Group , said the FTC 's authority gives it the power to shut down companies that appear to be engaged in unfair and deceptive practices , whereas criminal law enforcement agencies have a much higher standard for proving wrongdoing in order to convince a court to shut down an ISP .
" It could be that other law enforcement organizations are using the FTC as a front in order to obtain evidence for later criminal prosecutions , " Rasch said .
" What 's interesting about that approach is that in order for these guys to get out from under this court order , they 're going to have to show that they 've taken steps to clean up their act .
But if there is a criminal investigation ongoing against 3FN , then anything their operators say in trying to convince a court to lift the order can and will be used against them later . "
The FTC's Leibowitz declined to say whether other law enforcement agencies were investigating 3FN , but said his agency was assisted by several organizations , including : cyber investigators at NASA ; Spamhaus ; The Shadowserver Foundation ; the University of Alabama at Birmingham ; The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ; and Symantec Corp. ,
Interestingly , the Russian blogosphere is beginning to light up about 3 FN 's closure .
This blog post notes that large numbers of 3FN customers were forced to move their sites to other providers .
Meanwhile , the 3FN operators are telling customers that they will be back online in another location within hours or days .
Christopher Barton , lead research scientist at McAfee , said a number of 3FN domain name servers already have popped up at new locations online .
" The rats are running , " Barton said .
Leibowitz said his agency would continue to pursue other ISPs that " provide a haven for Internet criminals . "
" This is a signal that we 're going to go after you , and you 're not going to be able to hide behind the shroud of the Internet and be immune from enforcement action , " Leibowitz said .
A signed copy of the FTC 's complaint is available here ( PDF ) .
Update , Jun. 14 , 10:57 p.m. ET 3FN released a lengthy statement responding to the FTC 's action and allegations .
That statement is available here , via PRWeb .
Backstory
About a year ago I bought an external SATA drive for backups .
My normal usage consisted of :
Power on and connect the drive mount / media / backup Run my backup script umount / media / backup Power off and unplug the drive
This seemed to work pretty well –at the very least , I was n’t losing data–except the drive made a strange sound when I powered it off .
It was n’t a normal drive spin down sound ; it was louder and shorter .
So , I googled for authoritative instructions on using external drives with Linux .
While most sources suggest doing exactly what I did , it ’s not ideal .
It turns out that most cheap external USB / SATA / firewire enclosures do n’t properly issue a stop command to the drive when you flick the power switch .
Instead , the power switch simply cuts power to the drive , which forces the drive to do an emergency head retract .
If you think that sounds bad , you ’re right .
Emergency retracts are n’t going to brick your drive immediately , but if they occur regularly they ’re putting a lot of unnecessary wear and tear on the drive .
In fact , some drives monitor how often this happens with S.M.A.R.T. attribute 192 . ( Check Wikipedia ’s S.M.A.R.T. page for a comprehensive list of attributes )
Solution
The solution is to spin down the drive via software before turning it off and unplugging it .
The best way to do this is with a utility called scsiadd .
This program can add and remove drives to Linux ’s SCSI subsystem .
Additionally , with fairly modern kernels , removing a device will issue a stop command , which is exactly what we ’re looking for .
Run :
$ sudo scsiadd -p
which should print something like :
Attached devices : Host : scsi0 Channel : 00 Id : 00 Lun : 00 Vendor : ATA Model : SAMSUNG HD300LJ Rev : ZT10 Type : Direct - Access ANSI SCSI revision : 05 Host : scsi4 Channel : 00 Id : 00 Lun : 00 Vendor : LITE -ON Model : DVDRW LH -20A1L Rev : BL05 Type : CD - ROM ANSI SCSI revision : 05 Host : scsi5 Channel : 00 Id : 00 Lun : 00 Vendor : ATA Model : WDC WD10EACS - 00Z Rev : 01.0 Type : Direct - Access ANSI SCSI revision : 05
Identify the drive you want to remove and then issue :
$ sudo scsiadd -r host channel id lun
substituting the corresponding values from the scsiadd -p output .
For example , if I wanted to remove “ WDC WD10EACS - 00 Z ” , I would run :
$ sudo scsiadd -r 5 0 0 0
If everything works , scsiadd should print :
Attached devices : Host : scsi0 Channel : 00 Id : 00 Lun : 00 Vendor : ATA Model : SAMSUNG HD300LJ Rev : ZT10 Type : Direct - Access ANSI SCSI revision : 05 Host : scsi4 Channel : 00 Id : 00 Lun : 00 Vendor : LITE -ON Model : DVDRW LH -20A1L Rev : BL05 Type : CD - ROM ANSI SCSI revision : 05
You can double - check the end of dmesg .
You should see :
[ 608188.235216 ] sd 5:0:0:0 : [ sdb ] Synchronizing SCSI cache [ 608188.235362 ] sd 5:0:0:0 : [ sdb ]
Stopping disk [ 608188.794296 ] ata6.00 : disabled
At this point , the drive is removed from Linux ’s SCSI subsystem and it should not be spinning .
It ’s safe to unplug and turn off .
Using scsiadd directly can be inconvenient because it requires looking up the host , channel , id , and lun of the drive .
I wrote a short script that will take a normal Linux device file like / dev/sdb , figure out the correct arguments to scsiadd , and run scsiadd -r .
I use this script in my larger backup script .
#!/bin/sh if [ $ # - ne 1 ] ; then echo " Usage : $ 0 " exit 1 fi if !
which lsscsi >/dev/null 2>&1 ; then echo " Error : lsscsi not installed " ; exit 1 fi if !
which scsiadd >/dev/null 2>&1 ; then echo " Error : scsiadd not installed " exit 1 fi device=`lsscsi | grep $ 1` if [ - z " $ device " ] ; then echo " Error : could not find device : $ 1 " exit 1 fi hcil=`echo $ device | awk \ ' {split ( substr ( $ 0 , 2 , 7 ) , a , " : " ) ; print a [ 1 ] , a [ 2 ] , a [ 3 ] , a [ 4 ] }'` scsiadd -r $ hcil
It does require the lsscsi command to be present on the system .

A heaping plate of bacon washed down with a frosty mug of beer is the perfect start to any day , but why can't scientists unite those two divine tastes into a single swallow ?
True , there is a German beer called Rauchbier , which means " smoked beer " and reportedly tastes like bacon , but it 's not literally made with cured pig flesh .
But at long last , Brooklyn Brewery brewmaster Garrett Oliver has heard the call of drunken gluttons and is developing a beer made with a special malt smoked in the same room with bacon made by " the legendary " Allan Benton .
Oliver tells the Times , " It ’s almost terrifying how much the malt smells like bacon . "
His ingenious plan involves infusing a brown ale with the flavor of Benton ’s bacon fat through a technique known as " fat washing . "
The bacon - fat - infused ale is aged in bourbon barrels , and one historic day ( t.b.d. ) he will blend it with the bacon - smoked malt .
And Oliver promises this to a world hushed with anticipation : " Either this will be the most amazingly disgusting thing you ’ve ever tasted in your life .
Or I shall rule the earth . "
EAST JERUSALEM – Israel ’s continued policy of Judaizing East Jerusalem in order to establish facts on the ground before the future of that part of the city is decided has left dozens of Palestinians homeless and sleeping on the streets .
Hundreds more are at risk , amid allegations of document forgery by Israeli settlers who have taken over Palestinian homes .
Israeli riot police have forcibly evicted 53 Palestinian refugees , including 20 children , from their homes in the East Jerusalem suburb Sheikh Jarrah .
Many sustained injuries during the process .
The refugees are from the Hanoun and al - Ghawi families .
At the beginning of August the neighborhood was placed under curfew and declared a closed military zone .
Media crews were prevented from entering the area , and those that filmed from a distance were roughed up by soldiers and police .
The belongings of the Hanoun and al - Ghawi families were dumped in a nearby street .
Shortly afterward , the police helped Israeli settlers move into the evacuated houses .
The entire Hanoun family now sleeps on mattresses on the pavement across the road from their former home as they watch the new tenant settlers come and go .
" The settlers have thrown stones at us and called us bad names , " says Maher Hanoun , who was evicted along with his family and the families of his two brothers .
The settlers attempted to get a court order to force the Palestinian families to move away from their street encampment , but an Israeli court said the families could remain there as long as they did n’t " harass the settlers . "
The Hanouns and other Palestinians in the same predicament are relying on the goodwill of neighbors for food and toilet facilities .
" It is very hard to see strangers move into your home where you have brought up three children , especially when you know the house does not belong to them , " says Nadia Hanoun , 43 , mother of three .
" It is humiliating and uncomfortable living on the streets .
We have no privacy .
I ca n’t even take a shower or use a toilet without having to ask for permission .
My children are due back at university and school but they have nowhere to study , " Nadia tells IPS .
The homes of the Hanoun and al - Ghawi families were built by the UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) together with the Jordanian government in 1956 .
The houses , together with a number of others , were built specifically to house 28 Palestinian refugee families who had either fled Israel or were expelled during the war that followed the establishment of the state in 1948 .
Jerusalem Mayor Uri Lupolianski first outlined Israel ’s efforts to Judaize East Jerusalem ’s Wadi Joz neighborhood in a letter to the housing ministry in 2004 .
" Zoning the neighborhood for a Jewish population is likely to contribute significantly to the unification of the city .
The move will strengthen the link between the Jewish neighborhoods and public institutions in the Mount Scopus area and the eastern part of the Old City , " he said .
When Israel annexed and occupied East Jerusalem following the 1967 Arab - Israeli war , it started implementing a number of legal and administrative procedures to take control of land there .
In 1982 several Israeli settler groups took what they claimed to be a document dated 1875 ( when the area was part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire ) to the Israeli Land Registry , claiming that this proved their ownership of the Hanoun and al - Ghawi homes .
But Israel ’s war on Gaza in January and a souring of relations with Turkey enabled the Hanouns ’ lawyer to access Ottoman archives that proved , according to Turkish authorities , that the document the settlers were citing was forged .
When the Hanoun family was given an eviction notice in February this year , their lawyer presented the Israeli High Court with the new evidence from the Turkish , Jordanian , and Islamic authorities .
But the court upheld the eviction order stating that the matter had been challenged two years too late , as disputes over land ownership have to be settled within 25 years of registration .
" Had the family known about the forged document they would have taken the issue to court years ago .
But it only became known this year when the Turkish authorities became more helpful , " the family lawyer Hosni al - Hussein told IPS .
However , al - Hussein is determined to fight the issue .
" We ’re now working on presenting new Turkish documentation to the Israeli courts , further proving the settlers used forged documentation . "
The al - Ghawis and Hanouns have been getting support from several international solidarity groups as well as sympathetic Israelis who have visited them and slept on the streets along with them .
They are not overly optimistic , however , about their chances of returning home .
" It might be too late for us to ever move into our home again , but we will fight to the end , as this is not just about our family but about hundreds of other Palestinians who have been evicted and who will be evicted in the future as part of Israel ’s ethnic - cleansing policy , " Maher told IPS .
In the interim the Hanouns have been fined over $ 50,000 by the Israeli authorities for refusing to vacate their home " voluntarily , " and each day they fail to pay , interest is added .
The police are also monitoring the homeless families , with patrol cars passing periodically through the day .
According to a report by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( Ocha ) , 475 Palestinians in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood are at risk of forced eviction .
Ocha says the settlers are attempting to build 540 illegal housing units in the area .
This figure does not include other areas of East Jerusalem under threat .

So , whenever a storm brews off the Cape of Good Hope , do n't look into the eye of it , because you will see the Flying Dutchman ...
And whoever sights the ship will die a terrible death .
Most people agree the " history " of the Flying Dutchman is merely a legend , and still the ship has been sighted on various occasions in the Cape of Good Hope by reliable witnesses .
Lighthouse keepers reported seeing her and here is a selected list of famous sightings :
In 1823 , captain Owen of the HMS Leven recorded two sightings in the log .
In 1835 the sailors of a British vessel saw a ship approach them in the middle of a storm .
It appeared there would be a collision , but the ship suddenly vanished .
On 11 July 1881 , the Royal Navy ship Bacchante was rounding the tip of Africa , when the crew was confronted with the sight of The Flying Dutchman .
The midshipman , who later became King George V , recorded that the lookout and the officer of the watch had seen the ship and used these words to describe it : " A strange red light as of a phantom ship all aglow , in the midst of which light the mast , spars and sails of a brig 200 yards distant stood out in strong relief . "
Soon after the sighting , he accidentally fell from a mast and died .
In 1879 , the crew of the SS Pretoria saw the Flying Dutchman and in 1911 a whaling ship almost collided with her before she vanished .
In 1923 , some members of the British Navy sighted the haunted ship and gave documentation to the Society for Psychical Research .
In 1939 the Flying Dutchman was seen by people ashore and German admiral Karl Doenitz maintained his U Boat crews logged various sightings .
In 1941 people at Glencairn Beach saw the phantom ship vanish before she crashed into the rocks .
In 1942 four witnesses saw the ship enter Table Bay and in 1959 the Magelhaen nearly collided with the phantom ship .
He said : " We need to decontaminate as much of the surfaces as possible before we can cut them up .
The normal agents we 'd use on steel and glass need time to dry and this slowed us down .
I wanted ' ReelJunkie ' but someone had taken it already .
Fucker .
I may be going out on a limb here , but I think it ’s safe to say that the first generation Camaro ’s ( 1967 - 1969 ) are some of the most restored , most collected , most modified , and most desired Camaro ’s out there .
The 1969 Camaro in particular is the golden standard in the world of Camaro fans .
Head to any car show , any collector car dealer , or pick up any car muscle car magazine – and you ’ll be almost guaranteed to find a 1969 Camaro there .
There are always at least a few ’ 69 ’s listed here at The MuscleCar Place .
Believe it or not , if you ’re so inclined , you can purchase a brand new 1969 Camaro from Year One in the crate and build it from the ground up with all of your favorite performance goodies ….. no need to muss and fuss with rust repair , right ?
That being said , I do like the 1969 Camaro and would take one in a heart beat ….. but it ’s not my favorite .
For my money , the coolest Camaro in the world is a ’ 67 ….. specifically , the black 1967 Camaro from the 1980 ’s cult classic movie ‘ Better Off Dead ‘ !
The ’ 67 was an RS / SS 350 car and spent about 3/4 of the movie parked on the main character ’s ( John Cusack ) front lawn under a tarp .
Cusak ’s character lacked the self confidence and knowledge to get the car running , especially after his girlfriend dumped him for the Captain of the Ski Team …. and honestly , who ca n’t relate to that ?
Moving on .
Luckily for Cusack , the French foreign exchange student girl next door knew all about 67 Camaro ’s and helped him get the car , and in turn , his self confidence back in shape .
The scene where the car takes it ’s maiden voyage may be one of my favorite car movie scenes of all time .
It ’s definitely in my top 10 .
The scene starts tightly focused on the grill of the Camaro ….. and then ‘ Mannish Boy ’ ( by Muddy Waters ) starts playing …. and then the Camaro fires up …. and then Cuscak ever so slowly pulls the car out of the garage , heads down the driveway , and off into the world .
Since the wrap of the movie , the car ( like most movie cars ) disappeared and headed into a state of disrepair unfitting of a huge Hollywood movie star .
Luckily though , someone much more dedicated than I went on a quest to find the car and restore it …… and he did !
Better yet , he ’s got a full website dedicated to the car , the find , the restoration , and the like !
I ’m hoping to have him on a future podcast show as a guest .
http://www.betteroffdeadcamaro.com/
From the day I saw the movie Better Off Dead I ’ve always loved ’ 67 Camaro ’s , especially RS models with hidden headlights – thanks to the scene in the movie I described .
If you ’re a Camaro fan ( or just a muscle car fan ) , head out and find yourself a copy of Better off Dead and watch it sometime soon .
I think you ’ll agree that the ’ 67 Camaro is the COOLEST Camaro there is ….. and if you do n’t , well , at least you ’ll get a couple of hours of fun 1980 ’s entertainment .

NEW YORK -- Lenny Dykstra , the former star
center fielder for the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies , has filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection .
The 46 - year - old has no more than $ 50,000 of assets and
between $ 10 million and $ 50 million of liabilities , according
to a petition filed Tuesday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
the Central District of California .
Dykstra 's filing comes in the wake of more than 20 lawsuits
he faces tied to his activities as a financial entrepreneur ,
including The Players Club , a glossy magazine for athletes he
had helped launch in 2008 .
According to an April article on ESPN.com , Dykstra put his
net worth at $ 60 million , and also owned a black Rolls Royce
Phantom and Gulfstream II jet .
Known as " Nails " and " The Dude , " Dykstra played for 12
years with the Mets and the Phillies before retiring in 1996
with a lifetime .285 batting average , 81 home runs , 404 runs
batted in , and 285 stolen bases .
He helped the Mets win the World Series in 1986 , and as a
Phillie was the National League runner - up to Barry Bonds in MVP voting in 1993 .
The Phillies lost the
World Series that year .
Walter Hackett , a lawyer for Dykstra , said the event
triggering the bankruptcy filing was a planned foreclosure sale
of a southern California residence that Dykstra bought from
hockey legend Wayne Gretzky for $ 17.5 million in 2007 .
Dykstra is " in good spirits , " Hackett said in an interview .
" He understands now that bankruptcy is truly a protective act .
I do expect that Lenny is going to emerge from Chapter 11 , and
make those people whole who have legitimate claims . "
According to the bankruptcy petition , Dykstra 's largest
unsecured creditors include units of JPMorgan Chase & Co. , owed $ 12.9 million , and Bank of America Corp ,
owed a combined $ 4.2 million .
Hackett said Washington Mutual , now part of JPMorgan , was
the main lender on the 2007 home purchase , and that the bank
misled Dykstra about his ability to afford the property .
The
lawyer said the bank deserves nothing on its claim .
JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly said : " We do n't comment on
individual cases , but we expect our customers to repay their
legal obligations under their mortgages when possible . "

Practice speeds up the part of the brain that lets us tackle many jobs at once .
The brain is not very good at multitasking but improves with practice .
Punchstock
Researchers in the United States have pinpointed the region of the brain that limits our ability to carry out more than one task at the same time — and have shown how , with training , the brain gets better at multitasking .
" Our brain is lousy at handling multitasking situations , " says neuroscientist René Marois of Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tennessee , who led the work together with Paul Dux , a cognitive scientist who is now at the University of Queensland in Brisbane , Australia .
Even if the tasks are very simple , such as walking and chewing gum , " as soon as either needs concentration , we can't do them both without our performance suffering " , says Marois .
When we try to pay attention to multiple stimuli — a red traffic light and an SMS alert on a mobile phone , for example — the stream of information flowing from sensation to action gets clogged up .
Using a suite of neuroimaging and analysis techniques , Marois , Dux and their colleagues identified a region of the brain that holds up multitasking , and discovered that training gives this region a speed boost .
Easing the bottleneck
Neuroimaging studies have previously demonstrated that multitasking increases brain activity in the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) .
This area houses the executive control centres that are responsible for directing our attention to important things in our surroundings and selecting the ideal response .
As we practise multitasking , the PFC becomes less active , but it was not clear how this helped — although several ideas have been proposed .
The theory that has received the most attention predicts that when we practise a task , the brain starts to automatically reroute information from the PFC to regions that are more directly involved .
" When we 're not familiar with a task , we need all our attention and reasoning , " says Marois .
According to the theory , he says , " After you practice , the thinking part of your brain is no longer needed , and task performance becomes encoded into the sensory and motor systems . "
“ Our brain is lousy at handling multitasking situations . ” René Marois
Vanderbilt University
Another possibility is that the PFC learns to segregate the information to separate groups of neurons .
At first , the same ensemble would be responsible for processing two different tasks , but with training , the neurons specialise and process the two tasks in parallel .
A third idea is that the PFC continues to treat the tasks one after the other but learns to do so more quickly , thus shortening the processing queue .
In a study published in the 16 July issue of Neuron , the team tested each of these theories by scanning people using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , a technique that tracks neural activity by following blood flow and blood oxygenation in the brain .
The participants were scanned before , during and after they were trained to perform two simple tasks at the same time .
First , the researchers searched for regions in the PFC that might limit multitasking performance .
By looking for areas that were more active when performing both tasks at once than each on its own , and that became less active as the participants ' multitasking skills improved , they honed in on the inferior frontal junction ( IFJ ) .
They discovered that communication between the IFJ and other regions did not change as the subjects improved in performance , indicating that neural circuits were not reorganizing to route information away from the region .
Neither did they detect any IFJ neurons separating into different groups to process the information streams in parallel during training — ruling out the second hypothesis .
In a final experiment , the authors used a type of fMRI that was able to track changes in neural activity over short periods of time , and discovered a crucial change : with training , the IFJ responded earlier and for a shorter duration than before , indicating it was processing information more quickly .
" This suggests our brain becomes better at the task with training , not by reducing the dependence on [ the PFC ] but rather by improving the processing efficiency [ of each task ] through this bottleneck , " says Marois , who acknowledges that other regions are also likely to be involved .
Other interpretations ?
The results " push the field in a different direction " , says Russ Poldrack , a psychologist at the University of California , Los Angeles .
" Most people had n't thought about this in terms of timing .
Most thought of it as switching [ from the PFC ] to other networks .
This is an interesting finding , and a nice way to use convergent methods of fMRI analyses , " he says .

Psychologist Kirk Erickson at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania agrees .
" These theories have all been around for a while , " he says , " but the difficulty was coming up with ways to test them .
Changes in brain - activation patterns can be interpreted in a number of ways .
Here they came up with very novel and interesting ways to do this , and really tried to exhaust all alternative possibilities . "
But Poldrack also has some reservations .
" I'm a little wary of putting too much faith in the null results " — those showing that the IFJ was not getting better at rerouting information to other areas .
Other analysis techniques may have produced different conclusions , he notes .
" But this is a reasonable first pass , and a good start to resolving this question about why it is that we always see decreases [ in PFC activity ] when people learn . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Fans of English third division club Tranmere Rovers were bemused to find their club up for sale on popular online shopping and auction site eBay this week -- a move prompting an angry reaction from owner Peter Johnson .
Johnson appointed American firm Dornoch Capital earlier this year to find a buyer for the club but said on Friday he was shocked to discover it had been listed on the website for 6 million pounds .
“ This is not a second - hand bike we ’re selling , ” Johnson was quoted in the Daily Mail on Friday .
An official statement on the club ’s website ( www.tranmererovers.co.uk) said Johnson had told Dornoch to withdraw the advert immediately .
“ Mr. Johnson was very disappointed to discover that Dornoch Capital had chosen eBay.com as a route to find a potential buyer and would not have given them permission to do so had he been asked , ” the statement said .
Last month Tranmere appointed former England winger John Barnes as manager .
Even the sight of spiders and snakes makes some people yell and run ��� and women are more likely to get scared than men .
Now , a new study has shown that females are genetically predisposed to fear creepy - crawlies and dangerous animals .
During the study , scientists found that baby girls only 11 months old rapidly start to associate pictures of spiders with fear .
However , baby boys remain blithely indifferent to this connection .
In an initial training phase , David Rakison , a developmental psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , showed 10 baby girls and boys a picture of a spider together with a fearful face .
In the following test phase , he let them watch the image of a spider paired with a happy face , and the image of a flower paired with a fearful face .
Despite the spider ''s happy companion , the girls looked significantly longer at it than at the flower .
The researchers took this to mean that the girls expected spiders to be linked with fear .
The boys looked for an equal time at both images .
With a different group of babies , Rakison first showed a spider with a happy face , and a flower with a fearful face .
Now the girls too looked at both images for the same length of time ��� implying that they did not have an inborn fear of spiders .
The results suggest that girls are more inclined than boys to learn to fear dangerous animals .
On the other hand , modern phobias such as fear of flying or injections show no sex difference , Rakison said .
He attributes the difference to behavioral differences between men and women among our hunter - gatherer ancestors .
An aversion to spiders may help women avoid dangerous animals , but in men evolution seems to have favoured more risk - taking behaviour for successful hunting .
It makes evolutionary sense to acquire spider fear at a certain age , rather than to be born with it , Rakison said .
" There is little reason for an infant to fear an object unless it can respond to it , for example by crawling away , " New Scientist quoted him as saying .
The study has been published in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior .
Right now , the OMB is projecting a debt / GDP ratio of 77 percent by 2019 — 69 percent if you net out financial assets acquired via the TARP and all that .
This may be somewhat over - optimistic , but stay with it for a bit .
As I ’ve been pointing out , the projected debt / GDP ratio will be high by US historical standards , but within a range that a number of advanced countries have entered without catastrophe in the past .
Still , it ’s not good .
And I had a thought that I have n’t seen anyone else explore ( apologies if someone has already done this . )
Namely , what would things look like if we had n’t had 8 years of gross fiscal irresponsibility from the Bush adminstration ?
There were two big - ticket Bush policies .
One was the tax cuts , which cost around $ 1.8 trillion in revenue ; add in interest costs , and we ’re presumably talking about more than $ 2 trillion in debt .
The other was the Iraq War , which has cost at least $ 700 billion , and will cost more before we finally extract ourselves .
Without these gratuitous drains on the budget , it seems fair to assert that we’d be coming into this economic crisis with a federal debt around 20 percent of GDP ( $ 2.8 trillion ) smaller than we are .
And that , in turn , means that we’d be looking at projected net debt in 2019 of around 50 percent of GDP , not 70 .
And that would definitely not be a scary number .
Net federal debt was 49 percent of GDP in 1993 , at the end of the Reagan - Bush years ; Bill Clinton did move to reduce that number , and succeeded , but the nation was n’t facing imminent crisis .
The bottom line , then , is this : the irresponsibility of the Bush years has left us poorly positioned to deal with the current crisis , turning what should have been an easily financed economic rescue into a more difficult , anxiety - producing process .

When Apple announced the new iPhone 3GS and the 3.0 software at their annual WWDC keynote , the world was abuzz with excitement and anticipation .
While the new device 's video features may have stole the show , the practical bunch of us saw immediate value in the new Find My iPhone feature for OS 3.0 .
In case you forgot , Find My iPhone is powered by MobileMe .
If you lose your phone , it will not only help you track it down , but it will also let you display a custom message on the home screen and / or remotely wipe your personal content .
Sounds pretty neat , right ?
15 year - old Colorado resident Dustin Simantob certainly thinks so , as the service recently helped him recover his stolen property and catch some criminals in the process .
We received the story via email , and thought it was so remarkable that we'd share Simantob 's account of the incident in its entirety .
So , here 's the story as Simantob tells it , as confirmed by The Mesa County Sheriff 's Department in Colorado :
" so , my dad and I went on a 3 day father and son river trip and parked the car where we get out of the river to leave , so we get up to the cars and all 4 cars had one window broken and all the valuables taken from the car , so we ended up submitting our case to the near by cop and started on our 5 hour journey home , when we got back i remembered that i had set up the " track my iphone " on the mobileme site and immediately got on and tracked it .
it ended up being at a house near by where it was stolen , so i called up the cop that had taken our case and told him where it was located .
as soon as i told him the address , he started to laugh , apparently the family had done a few things like this before and the local police had been trying to catch and arrest them but could never get proof that they had been the culprits .
now they had proof .
so 4 police showed up at the door of this house and ended up getting mine and my dads iphones back along with my wallet and the Garmen GPS , they also were able to recover the two phones and wallet that was taken from the other car that was broken into .
so thanks to mobileme we will all be getting our belongings back and a family of criminals will be put in jail . "
To recap : Simantob and his father get robbed and his iPhone happens to be one of the stolen items .
Find My iPhone tracks down the phone to an exact address , where the police are able to recover the stolen property and arrest the criminals in question .
If that story does n't sell the Find My iPhone feature , than I do n't know what will .
It 's a good thing Apple ( AAPL ) does n't actually need its home entertainment business to make any money .
While Apple 's competitors continue to improve in the Web - to - TV - gadget market , the Apple TV set - top box has n't received a major update in more than 18 months .
( And sales can't be impressive :
It 's currently numbers 575 and 1,104 on Amazon 's best - selling electronics list . )
The latest competitor to step things up : Roku , whose Web video set - top box is $ 99 , or $ 130 cheaper than Apple's , and continues to add cool features to its box that Apple TV does not have .
Last night , Roku added the ability to stream live Major League Baseball games in hi-def to your TV .
It looks gorgeous .
Roku is going to keep adding new video and audio sources in the next several weeks , in addition to the Netflix and Amazon streaming it already supports .
Other rivals are getting better , too , like Microsoft 's Xbox 360 .
It 's surprising that Apple , which has had so much success with its iPhone App Store , has n't yet brought a similar framework to the Apple TV .
Maybe that 's the next step -- it would certainly make the hardware more attractive .
( Or maybe they 've just been waiting to ship one with Blu-ray . )
We had heard secondhand earlier this year that Steve Jobs did n't want to invest more in Apple TV hardware until its software is improved .
That explains why Apple has n't done much with Apple TV hardware since it launched in 2007 .
But it does n't explain why the company has n't done much with the software since then .
Perhaps the best news is that this market is still tiny and niche , and Apple can still catch up quickly .
Apple 's real competition here -- and Roku's , and Microsoft's -- is going to be the cable company that owns your broadband pipe and your existing TV set - top box .
So that 's who Apple should be thinking about disrupting .
Opening the Apple TV up to any content provider who wanted to distribute video to it -- like MLB.TV , Blip.tv , and especially iTunes rivals like Amazon and Netflix , who do n't compete with Apple 's hardware business -- could help .
But who knows if Apple 's inner control freak will ever allow that to happen .
Ryan and Corin Boyko collected 223 samples of village dog blood from Egypt , Uganda and Namibia .
The small gene question has not yet been assessed , but their samples , reported in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , have called into question a finding on the origin of dog domestication from wolves .
Image ONCE A WOLF Scientists had thought that dogs , like these in Tibet , were domesticated from wolves in East Asia , but new work calls that into question .
Credit ...
Agence France - Press
The origin is thought to be East Asia , based on a 2002 survey of both village dogs and breed dogs .
But most of the village dogs in that survey came from East Asia , which could have tilted the outcome .
The African village dogs turn out to have much the same amount of genetic diversity as those of East Asia .
This is puzzling because the origin of a species is usually also the source of greatest genetic diversity .
The Boykos and Dr. Bustamante do not think dogs were domesticated in Africa  there are no wolves in Africa now , apart from the Ethiopian wolf  but they say the origin may not be East Asia .
The issue is better addressed by looking just at village dogs , they think , and by excluding European breeds , which are mostly of recent origin .
They are now collecting samples from village dogs throughout the world  Ryan and Corin Boyko are at present catching dogs in New Guinea  in hope of tracing not just the place or places where dogs were first domesticated , but also the travels that dogs then took around the world with their masters .
The lack of any sharp gradient of genetic diversity between East Asian and African village dogs could mean that once domesticated , dogs spread very quickly from their point of origin .
Another explanation , Dr. Boyko said , is that they originated at some point halfway between the two regions , like in the Caucasus mountains .
The latest work also sounds a cautionary note against underestimating a body part or dismissing it as vestigial , expendable or past its prime .
In an accompanying essay , Ting Jia and Eric G. Pamer of Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center admit that “ the spleen lacks the gravitas of neighboring organs ” like the liver or the stomach “ because we can survive without it . ”

Spleens can rupture during contact sports , say , or in a motorcycle accident , at which point surgeons have no choice .
“ It ’s such a vascularized organ , and the risk of big - time hemorrhaging is so great , that if the spleen ruptures , it ’s a surgical emergency , ” said James N. George , a hematologist with the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center .
“ You have to remove it . ”
The new findings in no way counter the necessity of excising a ruptured spleen , the researchers said , but they do suggest that the loss of the organ is more than a mere “ inconvenience , ” as it has often been depicted , and could help explain previous reports showing an enhanced risk of early death among people who have undergone splenectomies .
In one study that appeared in The Lancet in 1977 , for example , researchers compared a group of 740 American veterans of World War II who had had their spleens removed as a result of battle injuries with a similar size sample of veterans who had suffered other war injuries but had kept their spleens .
The splenectomized men , the researchers found , were twice as likely to die of cardiovascular disease as were the veterans in the control group .
All of which means that despleening should be diligently guarded against , particularly among our little sports warriors , perhaps through the wearing of appropriate protective gear .
Researchers cite other cases in which organs were presumed to be so dispensable that they could be removed “ prophylactically ”  often with unfortunate outcomes .
In recent years , for example , many older women undergoing hysterectomies have been advised to have their healthy ovaries removed at the same time , the rationale being : if you are past your childbearing years , why hang on to reproductive organs that might turn cancerous and kill you ?
Yet follow - up surveys have shown that women who underwent elective ovariectomy had a heightened risk of dying during a given study period , were more susceptible to heart disease and lung cancer and were twice as likely to develop Parkinson ’s disease compared with women who had kept their ovaries .
“ Evolution has an edge on us , ” Dr. Nahrendorf said .
“ I would be very careful about saying , ‘ You do n’t need this organ , get rid of it . ’ ”
Another reason to esteem the spleen  a purplish , fist - size , five - ounce organ in the upper left quadrant of the abdominal cavity , just behind the stomach and under the diaphragm  is its illustrious medical and poetic history .
Galen considered the spleen to be a source of one of the four bodily humors , specifically the black bile associated with irritable , melancholic cranks .
In his poem , “ Spleen , ” Charles Baudelaire describes a young narrator so weary and despondent , unresponsive even to beautiful women and jesting men , that it is as if the “ green waters of Lethe ” fills his veins .
Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman could face up to 31 years in prison on a string of corruption charges Israeli police said yesterday , announcing the end of a long investigation into the far - right politician .
But the country 's attorney general must approve the police 's recommendations before Lieberman can be charged .
It could be weeks or months before a decision is taken .
If approval is given , Lieberman may have to stand trial on a slew of corruption charges which include receiving bribes , committing fraud , deception , breach of a trust by a public servant , money laundering , obstruction of justice and tampering with a witness .
The police statement said the investigation began in 2006 and covered events going back to 2000 .
Lieberman denies wrongdoing and says police have been hounding him for 13 years .
In a statement released by his office last night , he maintained that he was the victim of political persecution designed " to cast me out from public activity " .

In March , Lieberman petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court about the investigation , which subsequently ordered police to quickly wind up their inquiries .
" There was no serious reason to open the investigation against me and if the suspicions had any foundation the investigation would not have lasted more than a decade , " he said in a statement .
One of the most controversial politicians in the country , Lieberman 's family emigrated to Israel from Moldova in 1978 .
Among his hotly discussed ideas are the re-drawing of the border between Israel and the West Bank to include large Jewish settlement blocks , and the exclusion from citizenship of Arab Israelis who refuse to sign an oath of loyalty to the state .
He first entered the Knesset in 1999 and has held numerous government posts .
Lieberman became foreign minister in March after his ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu Party took third place in a general election .
The party has drawn criticism for positions which its opponents disparage as discriminatory toward Israel 's Arab minority .
He most recently sparked controversy when he instructed Israeli embassies to circulate a photograph of Adolf Hitler meeting the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , Palestinian cleric Haj Amin al - Husseini in 1941 , a Palestinian nationalist who led violent campaigns against Jewish immigrants in the 1920s and Thirties .
Analysts say the stimulus package seems to be working China 's economy grew at an annual rate of 7.9 % between April and June , up from 6.1 % in the first quarter , thanks to the government 's big stimulus package .
The country 's quickening economic expansion comes as most nations in the West continue to experience recession .
Beijing now expects China to achieve 8 % growth for 2009 as a whole , which compares with a predicted contraction of between 1 % and 1.5 % in the US .
However , the Chinese government warned that some economic challenges remain .
' Numerous challenges '
The BBC 's correspondent in Shanghai , Chris Hogg , said China 's latest economic growth was largely due to the government 's 4 trillion yuan ( $ 585bn , £ 390 bn ) economic stimulus plan unveiled last November .
Compare China 's economic growth with the UK and US Yet Chinese officials said the increased economic expansion between April and June could not obscure continuing problems .
ANALYSIS Chris Hogg , BBC Shanghai correspondent China 's economy is recovering earlier than many had expected .
That 's largely due to the government 's massive economic stimulus package unveiled last November , but the private sector is doing its part too .
China 's state controlled banks have lent huge amounts of money to the country 's state owned and private sector businesses .
Companies have used the cash to try to avoid shedding jobs and to invest in new equipment .
The many new government infrastructure projects have provided employment for many of the migrant workers who have been laid off - mainly in the export sector .
The slowdown elsewhere in the world means exporters are still suffering , but the rest of China 's economy is in much better shape .
Optimistic Chinese signs
Why China bankrolls the US Are China 's savers key ?
" The difficulties and challenges in the current economic development are still numerous , " said National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS ) spokesman Li Xiaochao at a news conference .
" The basis of the rebound of the people 's economy is not stable , " he said .
In a statement distributed ahead of a news conference , the NBS said : " The base for recovery is still weak .
Growth momentum is unstable .
The recovery pattern is unbalanced and thus there are still uncertain and volatile factors in the recovery process . "
It said that urban per capita incomes were up 11.2 % from a year earlier , and that real rural per capita incomes were up 8.1 % .
Meanwhile , China 's consumer price index fell 1.7 % in June compared with the same month a year earlier , the fifth consecutive monthly decline .
Last week , the government said that exports in June were down 21.4 % compared with a year earlier .
Public private progress
Our correspondent said that while the public sector was leading the speed up in the rate of economic expansion , the private sector was also doing its part .
China 's state controlled banks have lent huge amounts of money to the country 's state owned and private sector businesses .
Companies have used the cash to try to avoid shedding jobs and to invest in new equipment .

Meanwhile , the many new government infrastructure projects have provided employment for many of the migrant workers who have been laid off - mainly in the export sector , our correspondent added .
Analysts broadly welcomed China 's latest economic data .
" It 's very encouraging : the 8 % growth target [ for the year ] is in sight , " said Daniel Soh , an economist at Forecast in Singapore .
" It 's by now clear that the fiscal stimulus package has offset the contraction in export activity . "
However , Wang Tao , head of China economic research at bank UBS , told the BBC that the increase in the country 's economic growth rate " may or may not be sustainable " .
She pointed to the fact that exports remained weak due to the global recession .
Ms Wang added that despite China 's continuing fast economic growth , it could not be relied upon to pull the whole world out of recession .
She said this was because other than raw materials , China was not a major importer .
Growing factory output Industrial output - a measure of activity in the nation 's factories and workshops - grew by more than 10 % year on year in June .
Urban fixed asset investment - a measure of government spending on infrastructure - rose by more than 35 % over the same period .
China 's economic growth in the first quarter of 6.1 % , had been the weakest growth since quarterly records began in 1992 .
The country experienced double - digit growth from 2003 to 2007 , and recorded 9 % growth in 2008 .

Josh Hamilton claims he 's been sober since October 2005 .
Since then he 's rejuvenated his career , saved his marriage , devoted himself to Jesus , and become America 's flawed , homer - derby hero .
Last winter , while he was alone in Tempe , Arizona , Hambone kinda slipped .
Advertisement
These photos are from the beginning of March .
January .
Hamilton was doing some pre-Spring Training workouts at the Athlete 's Performance on ASU 's campus .
He supposedly rented a condo nearby , which also happened to be near the popular ASU hangout , Maloney 's Tavern .
One night , Hamilton went in .
Here is a paraphrased account from people who were there the evening Josh Hamilton showed up .
They wish to remain anonymous .

Because it was Spring Break and relatively early on a weeknight , the bar was kind of empty .
According to one person who was there , a former employee , this big guy strolled into the bar and politely asked if they could change the television station to the MLB Network .
You can see Al Leiter 's head in the background of this photo .
The MLB Network , you remember , first hit the airwaves in January of 2009 .
So these photos were taken well after he 's been power - hitting for Jesus .
And , also , this is what Josh Hamilton looked like in 2005 .

One of the waitresses went to get the manager to change the station .
The manager came out and saw Hamilton at the bar .
Hamilton introduced himself , " Hi , I 'm Josh . "
They made smalltalk .
" Baseball season did n't start yet , right ? " the bar manager inquired .
Hamilton revealed he was a player .
The manager , a baseball fan , but not a huge one , finally recognized the man sitting in front of him .
" Oh , you 're the home run derby guy . "
Josh said yes .
" Well , just for that , lemme buy you a beer , " the manager said , not knowing the full extent of Hamilton 's history .
Josh said yes again .
Advertisement
From there , things got weird .
Josh drank .
Josh was charming .
Josh was a hit with the waitresses and bartenders who were hanging out between shifts .
Shots were poured .
Lots of shots .
Josh kept drinking .
Advertisement
The person who took these photos arrived around 9 .
By then Hamilton was pretty wrecked .
He was friendly , though and , obviously , having a really good time .
He did n't even mind that photos were be taken of him as he did body shot after body shot off of some of the off - work waitstaff .
He joked with Hamilton that he was going to send these photos to ESPN .
" I 'll kill you , " Hamilton said , half - joking .
Advertisement
The girls left .
According to one patron , Hamilton , piss - drunk by that point , asked the manager where he could buy blow .
The manager did n't know .
" Let 's go to a strip club , " Hamilton said .
Someone drove Hamilton to Les Girls in Phoenix , Arizona .
Advertisement
Nobody knows what happened to Josh after the strip club that night .
Advertisement
Now , Hamilton is n't drinking in these photos ; he 's not doing drugs , either .
He 's just at a bar , shirtless , doing things with some strange women that most married men devoted to The Word Of God would n't usually partake in .
That 's it .
But would a sober Josh Hamilton agree to be photographed laying across the bar shirtless , covered in whip cream with his head between a random girl 's crotch ?
Advertisement
Maloney 's closed down soon after these photos were taken .
I originally heard about this story second - hand from a tip way back in March .
It seemed , at the time , implausible given how upfront and rigid Hamilton has been about his sobriety and his religious awakening .
But then there was another tip about another night during the same time period , also from a Maloney 's Tavern patron in Tempe .
Then the pictures appeared and the story became more legit .
Advertisement
So now , here we are .
Much will be made that Hamilton 's sub-par season and injuries were a direct result of him backsliding during the off - season .
Maybe this was isolated — a brief moment of weakness where Hamilton , possibly alone for the first time in years , just fell headfirst off that wobbly wagon .
Advertisement
Hamilton homered last night , though , and the Rangers beat the Angels 11 - 6 .
And Hamilton 's been better at the plate lately , which he claims is because he ditched his ADD medicine .
Last night 's performance even prompted to DMN writer Rob Stroope to proclaim , " It looks like he 's back in the groove . "
Hope so .
The Rangers are investigating .
Hamilton is aware these photos exist .
Statements , no comments , excuses , explanations shall be forthcoming .
UPDATES : Narron speaks .
UPDATES : Josh Hamilton speaks .
The word " totalitarian " while politically loaded , is still a useful concept .
As brutal and authoritarian as 18th and 19th Century England was it could not be considered a totalitarian state .
Plain old authoritarianism is separated from totalitarianism by the high level of invasiveness of the latter .
Also , the old authoritarian states were so inefficient and the techniques and technologies of domination so crude , they were highly ineffective .
Even if they wanted to totally dominate the lives of the people they could not do so .
The kings and tyrants of old wanted you to work for them obediently , fight in their wars and pretend to love them .
Other than that , you could more or less do what you wanted .
Except , of course , for the Church .
This was the real ancestor of totalitarianism .
The first powerful institutions seriously interested in what you thought , what you ate , your sex life , what you read and talked about .
And through their indoctrination , hierarchies of priests and their assistants , confession booths , Inquisitions , schools and media , they actually had the ability to dominate in a totalistic way .
Indeed , the authoritarian churches are one of the roots of totalitarianism , both in the origins of fascism and the liberal tendencies to " benevolently " control the thought and actions of the general populace .
As everyone knows , " classic " totalitarian systems are facism , nazi - fascism and Stalinism .
The idea was to mold humanity in the image presented by the state ideology .
This was achieved through terror , but also mass media , the education system , a party hierarchy that one had to join to get ahead , the creation of scape goats and demonic figures and an economic system geared to the needs of the state .
But classical totalitarianism suffered from a number of serious flaws .
For the ruling classes , the the dictators they backed were unwilling to remain as puppets and had ideas of their own .
Having the police and the army in their control they were able to attempt those plans .
The second was the problem of succession , always a problem in a dictatorship .
The third was inefficiency .
Attempting to control everyone and anything proved an impossible task and the regimes bogged down in bureaucracy , corruption and gross inefficiency .
People soon tired of their strutting tyrants and resented being directly told what to do and think , day in and day out .
While overt unrest was impossible , the sullenness of the masses contributed greatly to inefficiency .
Due to the immense cruelty as well as the aforementioned flaws , serious revolutionaries have rejected the totalitarian ( Stalinist ) model of revolutionary governance .
The ruling classses , in turn , have rejected classical fascism as an alternative .
Consider the new form of " soft tyranny " as the ruling class version of EuroCommunism .
( Do away with the really nasty stuff , but still have the same goal in mind . )
Where old style fascism is still used , is as thugs against the popular movements , pseudo - gangs and scary puppets .
They are handy for murdering trade union leaders and form the core of the Latin American Death Squads .
The swastika flag popped up during the recent attempts by the far - right to break up Bolivia .
P2 and Operation Gladio attempted to destabilize Italy on the CIA 's orders in the 1970's .
Otherwise , " old style " totalitarianism as a serious alternative to liberalism or democracy is in history 's overflowing ash can .
Beginning with the Tri-lateral Commission 's 1973 observation that there was " too much democracy " , the rulers have concocted a new form of totalitarianism that lacks the obvious faults of the earlier variety .
Politically " democracy " , still exists with multi-party elections .
But the differences between parties has been narrowed to the cosmetic and any group that seriously tries to criticize the system is marginalized and demonized .
The political spectrum has been moved sharply to the right .
Yesterdays conservatives would be reviled as dangerous " socialists . "
Newspapers and the media all spew the same line , once again with cosmetic differences .
Protest is disarmed by tactics such as no-protest areas , massive police presence , " kettling " and campaigns of slander and demonization .
With " terrorism " as an excuse , our ability to travel has been restricted , and people are forced to " show their papers . " just like in the old movies .
Public space and the freedom that used to go with it , has been sharply reduced by replacing streets full of shops with shopping malls .
These , under a bizarre legal interpretation , are considered " private " spaces and so patrons are subject to the whims of the owners .
By - laws have been enacted to prevent people from building their own homes , building small dwellings , using composting toilets instead of the sewage hook up .
etc .
Home owner associations and condo regulations infringe upon democratic rights ( no election posters in the window ) and all sorts of other invasive regulations apply .
Indeed , in a supposed " age of individualism " , the individual in North America has rarely had less freedom than now , with all the petty authoritarianism of city by - laws and strata councils .
Corporations have taken over virtually every aspect of life .
Not only have businesses which were once local – hamburger joints , convenience stores , hotels etc. been swallowed by multi-nationals , but their advertising is everywhere , in schools , on people 's clothing .
Children are indoctrinated from birth to identify with corporate advertising .
The spread of US style suburbs with shopping malls means the loss of the uniqueness of towns and a sameness everywhere .
The notion of service is gone , every government institution must now make a profit and act like a corporation .
Public - private institutions have amalgamated the corporation and the state , creating the corporate state of Mussolini 's dreams .
Massive corporatization of public services and agreements like NAFTA , which protect corporations from being nationalized , or in any way impinged upon , have stripped democracy of any meaning .
The corporations are now a law unto themselves .
However , this " soft totalitarianism 's " destruction of democracy and gagging of protest will backfire .
By making improvement impossible , by eradicating the possibility of reform , by making us total slaves of corporate capitalism , they leave the people only one alternative .
That is to cast aside the dream of petty reform and to overthrow the entire system .

SQLite is a great little embeddable database engine that ’s meant to be self - contained , easy to use and not require configuration .
However when I tried to use it in my Ruby code I found that it was n’t that straight forward getting everything to work , especially if you ’re using Ruby on windows .
The information on the old WWW was rather sparse .
I worked it out eventually , so in the interests of being a helpful web denizen I thought I ’d share .
What To Download And Where To Put It
First thing first , before we involve Ruby directly lets download set up everything we need .
You need to download two things from the SQLite website ( well strictly speaking you only actually NEED one , but we ’ll download both since the other one is useful ) :
sqlitedll -3_6_16.zip – you can think of this one as actually being the SQLite database that you will install on your machine
sqlite -3_6_16.zip – this one is a command line utility that can be used to administer a SQLite database
Both of those files are located on the downloads page – http://www.sqlite.org/download.html, under the ‘ Precompiled Binaries For Windows ’ section .
Once you unzip both of those you will have several files , the important ones are :
sqlite3.dll – this is the actual database
– this is the actual database sqlite3.exe – this is the command line utility
You need to take the DLL and put it somewhere , where Ruby would look for libraries when you execute a script , some possible locations would be , your windows system folder or the bin folder of your Ruby installation ( Note : as reader Luis Lavena noted in the comments below , the ruby installation bin folder is by far the best place to put the DLL ) .
On my machine it was :
1 2 3 C:\ruby1.8\bin C: \WINDOWS\system C:\WINDOWS\system32
You can also put the command line utility in any of those places as well , but you do n’t have to as you can use that one from anywhere ( if you do put it in another location make sure that location is in the PATH environment variable otherwise you will have to specify the full path to it every time you want to use it ) .
You ’re now ready to install the SQLite Ruby interface gem .
You will need to do the following :
1 gem install sqlite3 - ruby
After it completes you will have a gem similar to the following in your gem repository , in my case :
1 C:\ruby1.8\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\sqlite3-ruby-1.2.5-x86-mswin32
You ’re now ready to work with SQLite in your Ruby application .
Note that you need to install the ‘ _sqlite3 - ruby_ ’ gem and not the ‘ _sqlite - ruby_ ’ one , as that is the old one .
If you did not install the DLL correctly you might get an error similar to the following when you try to run your ruby script :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/1.8/dl/import.rb:29:in `initialize ' : unknown error ( RuntimeError ) from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/1.8/dl/import.rb:29:in `dlopen ' from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/1.8/dl/import.rb:29:in `dlload ' from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/1.8/dl/import.rb:27:in `each ' from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/1.8/dl/import.rb:27:in `dlload ' from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/sqlite3-ruby-1.2.5-x86-mswin32/lib/sqlite3/driver/dl/api.rb:31 from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `gem_original_require ' from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `require ' from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/sqlite3-ruby-1.2.5-x86-mswin32/lib/sqlite3/driver/dl/driver.rb:1 from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `gem_original_require ' from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `require ' from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/sqlite3-ruby-1.2.5-x86-mswin32/lib/sqlite3/database.rb:619:in `load_driver ' from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/sqlite3-ruby-1.2.5-x86-mswin32/lib/sqlite3/database.rb:617:in `each ' from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/sqlite3-ruby-1.2.5-x86-mswin32/lib/sqlite3/database.rb:617:in `load_driver ' from C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/sqlite3-ruby-1.2.5-x86-mswin32/lib/sqlite3/database.rb:72:in `initialize ' from D:/ruby - projects / search - engine/search - engine/lib/search-engine-main.rb:21:in `new ' from D:/ruby - projects / search - engine / search - engine/lib/search-engine-main.rb:21
This is because the SQLite ruby interface is trying to use a deprecated driver ( it ’s called DL and it is buggy and does n’t work ) because it can’t find the native one , you need to make sure you put the DLL in the appropriate spot mentioned above .
Also note that putting the DLL in the same directory as the script you ’re executing does not work and produces a different error possibly because it has a dependency on MSVCRT .
DLL .
How To Use SQLite With Ruby
We can now write some ruby code to test that everything is working , as well as learn to use SQLite a little bit .
```ruby require ‘ sqlite3 ’ database = SQLite3::Database.new ( “ new.database ” )
database.execute ( “ create table sample_table ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY , sample_text TEXT , sample_number NUMERIC ) ; ” )
database.execute( “ insert into sample_table ( sample_text , sample_number ) values ( ‘ Sample Text1 ’ , 123 ) “ ) database.execute( “ insert into sample_table ( sample_text , sample_number ) values ( ‘ Sample Text2 ’ , 456 ) “ )
rows = database.execute( “ select * from sample_table ” )
p rows```
Running this code will create a new file called ‘ new.database ’ in the same folder where you ran the script .
This is the sqlite database you ’ve just created ( sqlite stores data as files ) .
To execute any SQL code using sqlite , you simply call the ‘ execute ’ method on your database instance and provide it some SQL code as a string .
This is what we did to create a table and to insert two rows into it .
Our little script produces the following output :
1 [ [ " 1 " , " Sample Text1 " , " 123.0 " ] , [ " 2 " , " Sample Text2 " , " 456.0 " ] ]
Which shows that we can get the two rows that we inserted back from the database .
If you attempt to re-run this script , it will simply pick up the database file since the file persists past the execution of the script .
Incidentally the script would fail a second time since the table ‘ sample_table ’ already exists in the database .
You now have the basics down , from here the going is a little easier .
You can look at the following resources :
SQLite / Ruby FAQ – all the different ways to use sqlite from a Ruby script
SQLite Documentation – self explanatory
Supported SQL Syntax – self explanatory

The propulsion unit of Johannes Kepler is taking shape
" It 's clear from space history that often it was not the prototype that experienced the problems ; it was the mission that came later .
That 's why specific attention has to be paid to what we do now . "
Nico Dettmann is in charge of producing the European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) next space freighter .
THE ATV - THE FIRSTS
The ATV is the first completely automated rendezvous and docking ship to go to the ISS The ATV is the largest and most powerful space tug going to the ISS over its mission life
It provides the largest refuelling and waste elimination capability for the space station
It is the only vehicle on the current timeline able to de-orbit the ISS when it is retired
He knows the near - flawless maiden voyage of the Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) last year does not mean the second flight is guaranteed to turn out the same way .
Attention to detail is everything .
The follow - up ship - dubbed Johannes Kepler - is in the process of being assembled .
Its propulsion and avionics units are being prepared in Bremen , Germany .
Its pressurised module which will hold the cargo - air , water , scientific equipment , food , and clothing - to be taken to the space station is being built in Turin , Italy .
The various segments should come together in September , into a single line of assembly that will lead to a launch in November 2010 .
Thereafter , ATVs will fly every year for three years .
The vehicle is no longer an experimental spacecraft ; it is a production spacecraft .
And to emphasise the point , if you walk through the cleanroom at EADS Astrium in Bremen , you can already see ATV - 3 components .
" The whole integration process , from the first day until launch , is 28 months .
So if you want to launch every 12 months , obviously you have to produce in parallel , " explained Esa 's Mr Dettmann .
The brains of ATV - its parallel computers - are inside the avionics bay
The space freighter has huge significance for Europe .
On one level , it is the " subscription " Europe must pay to be part of the International Space Station " club " .
If Europe can deliver about six tonnes of supplies a year to the platform , it is guaranteed six - month residencies at the ISS for its astronauts .
But ATV has also been a test of European competency .
It is the biggest , most sophisticated vehicle the bloc has ever flown in space .
Its automatic rendezvous and docking technology allows it to find its own way to the station and attach itself without any human intervention .

The European Space Agency believes the vehicle 's capabilities will feed into many other exploration activities , at the Moon , Mars and other Solar System destinations .
Esa is even looking into the possibility of upgrading the robotic truck so that it can carry people - an independent European crew transportation system .
Astrium Bremen is in sole charge of manufacturing Johannes Kepler .
The company 's Les Mureaux plant in France had a bigger role on the previous vehicle ( known as Jules Verne ) but with the switch to routine production , it was felt the lines of responsibility should be simplified .
" In the past , we had one organisation dedicated to development and one to production .
At the end of Jules Verne , it was decided to have just one organisation in order to have maximum consistency going forward , " said Astrium 's ATV project manager , Olivier de la Bourdonnaye .
" All of what we did on the Jules Verne adventure belonged to the development of ATV ; and it finished a couple of months ago with the post flight analysis . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Germany carries about 50 % of the production effort ; and all the sub - contractors - including Europe 's other major space concern , Thales Alenia Space - are reporting direct to the German centre .
Very little is having to be changed on ATV - 2 , such was the success of Jules Verne .
There were only two significant hardware issues .
One , early in the flight , saw the vehicle 's propulsion system switch to a back - up chain when anomalous pressures were detected in the complex network of pipes and valves that feed the engines .
The other saw a segment of thermal blanket on the exterior of the craft lift away from its Velcro fittings .
Neither event affected the mission and should be easily remedied on Johannes Kepler .
The pressurised cargo module is being prepared by Thales in Turin
Perhaps more significant was the slight mismatch that occurred in the advanced GPS systems used on ATV and the Russian Zvezda module on the ISS to align the vehicles prior to docking .
Had the discrepancy been more serious , Jules Verne could have been triggered into aborting its approach to the platform .
It was n't - and a software correction on the Russian side should fix this issue before Johannes Kepler arrives in 2010 .
The ship will be heavier this time - by some 600 kg .
This will take it over 20 tonnes , making its launch the heaviest payload in the history of Esa missions .
The supplies ATV - 2 carries will be gratefully received : with six permanent residents now living on the platform , Europe 's logistics effort is paramount ( the US shuttle should be close to retirement by November 2010 ) .
Its role in boosting the ISS will be significant , also .
With no shuttle visiting the station , the ATV 's power will be needed to lift the platform higher into the sky to avoid the drag from residual air molecules at the top of the atmosphere .
" We 're supposed to lift the station significantly because after the shuttle retirement the ISS will raise its average altitude from 330 - 350 km to almost 400 km to produce less drag , " said Mr Dettmann .
" Today the ISS altitude is linked - let 's say - to low shuttle performance .
After shuttle is gone , ISS can fly higher but ATV will have to deliver a major part of that altitude increase . "
Total cargo capacity : 7.6 tonnes , but first mission flew lighter Mass at launch : About 20 tonnes depending on cargo manifest Dimensions : 10.3 m long and 4.5 m wide - the size of a large bus Solar panels :
Once unfolded , the solar wings span 22.3 m
Engine power : 4 x 490 - Newton thrusters ; and 28 x 220N thrusters Development cost : 1.3bn euros ; Subsequent missions : 400 m euros

Business Opportunities
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Math majors do n't always get much respect on college campuses , but fat post - grad wallets should be enough to give them a boost .
The top 15 highest - earning college degrees all have one thing in common -- math skills .
That 's according to a recent survey from the National Association of Colleges and Employers , which tracks college graduates ' job offers .
" Math is at the crux of who gets paid , " said Ed Koc , director of research at NACE .
" If you have those skills , you are an extremely valuable asset .
We do n't generate enough people like that in this country . "
This year Rochester Institute of Technology hosted recruiters from defense - industry firms like Lockheed Martin ( LMT , Fortune 500 ) and Northrop Grumman ( NOC , Fortune 500 ) , as well as other big companies like Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) and Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ , Fortune 500 ) .
" The tech fields are what 's driving salaries and offers , and the top students are faring quite well , " said Emanuel Contomanolis , who runs RIT 's career center .
Specifically , engineering diplomas account for 12 of the 15 the top - paying majors .
NACE collects its data by surveying 200 college career centers .
Energy is the key .
Petroleum engineering was by far highest - paying degree , with an average starting offer of $ 83,121 , thanks to that resource 's growing scarcity .
Graduates with these degrees generally find work locating oil and gas reservoirs , or in developing ways to bring those resources to the Earth 's surface .
" Exploration for new energy sources is high , " Koc said .
" The oil and gas industry has done relatively well the past year , even though oil prices are off right now . "
Other highly - paid engineering majors include chemical engineers , who employ their skills to make everything from plastics to fuel cells and have an average starting offer of $ 64,902 .
Mining engineers start at $ 64,404 on average , while computer engineers , who have an expertise in both coding and electrical engineering , pocket roughly $ 61,738 their first year out of school .
Left behind .
Of course , not every student with an engineering degree will score a fat paycheck .
RIT 's Contomanolis noted that " average " graduates are feeling the pinch of fewer job offers .
Still , in a tough job market , graduates with technology degrees have an advantage .
" It 's a tech - driven world , and demand [ for engineers ] is only going to grow , " said Farnoosh Torabi , employment expert and Quicken blog editor .
" You can't say that about many fields , especially in a recession . "
Perhaps that 's why more and more college students are picking their majors based on a field 's earning power , ultimately " choosing a major that pays , " Torabi said .
Top non-engineering fields .
Only three of the 15 top paying degrees were outside the field of engineering -- but they each still require math skills .
For computer science majors , who specialize in programming and software , the average salary was $ 61,407 .
Graduates with degrees in actuarial science took home about $ 56,320 ; and jobs for students in construction management paid about $ 53,199 .
Each of these fields has paid well throughout the years , Koc said .
What happened to well - rounded ?
There are far fewer people graduating with math - based majors , compared to their liberal - arts counterparts , which is why they are paid at such a premium .
The fields of engineering and computer science each make up about 4 % of all college graduates , while social science and history each comprise 16 % , Koc noted .
As a result , salaries for graduates who studied fields like social work command tiny paychecks , somewhere in the vicinity of $ 29,000 .
English , foreign language and communications majors make about $ 35,000 , Koc said .
" It 's a supply and demand issue , " he added .
" So few grads offer math skills , and those who can are rewarded . "
The Obama administration , seeking to increase pressure on Honduras ’ de facto government to accept a peace deal , has revoked the diplomatic visas of four Honduran officials , the State Department said Tuesday .
Spokesman Ian Kelly said the targeted officials worked in the Honduran government ousted in a coup one month ago , but stayed on to serve in the government that took over .
He said U.S. officials were reviewing the visas of all officials in the de facto government , as well as those of family members .
The moves are the latest steps by the administration to try to persuade the coup government of Roberto Micheletti to make peace with the former government headed by Manuel Zelaya .
Peace talks mediated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias have been deadlocked .

Honduras ’ National Assembly and Supreme Court have been considering an Arias proposal that would allow Zelaya to regain limited power , and would provide a limited amnesty for those involved in the coup .
Zelaya , now encamped with hundreds of supporters just inside the Nicaraguan border , has been threatening to reenter Honduras to try to regain power , a move the Obama administration opposes as reckless .
“ We ’re trying to do everything we can to support this process that was begun by Costa Rican President Arias , ” Kelly said .
He said the visa revocations were consistent with the American policy of refusing recognition of the Micheletti government .
He said the administration urges Honduran legislators to “ send a strong signal of support ” for the peace proposal .
The Obama administration has been taking gradual steps to increase pressure on leaders of the impoverished country , which is heavily dependent on U.S. trade and aid .
Although Washington has withheld $ 18.5 million in military aid , it has not yet cut off the $ 180 million Honduras has been promised in development assistance .

I ’ve had a great week at OSCON .
The talks are excellent but the real value is in the relationships formed and renewed in the “ hallway track ” .
I ’m honoured and humbled to be able to call many great people my friends .
My talk on Devel : : NYTP rof seemed to go well .
This year I covered not just NYTProf and the new features in v3 ( not yet released ) but also added a section on how to use NYTProf to optimize your perl code .
Here ’s a quick summary , with links to the slides and screen - cast , and outline what ’s still to be done before v3 gets released ( getting closer by the day ) .
The first two - thirds of the talk covered general profiling topics and an overview of NYTProf v3 .
This was an updated and compressed version of the talk I gave last year .
The final third covered optimization techniques .
I began with stern warning against optimization unless there ’s a clear need , followed by a selection of quotes , among which is the well known classic from Donald Knuth : “ premature optimization is the root of all evil ” .
What few people remember is that that ’s just a fragment of a more balanced statement :
“ We should forget about small efficiencies , say about 97 % of the time : premature optimization is the root of all evil .
Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3 % . ”
After getting an implicit nod from Donald I quoted Rob Pike on the importance of measurement :
“ Bottlenecks occur in surprising places , so do n’t try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you have proven that ’s where the bottleneck is . ”
Then I outlined the sequence of steps I usually take when performance profiling and optimizing code .
These were grouped into three phases : “ Low Hanging Fruit ” , “ Deeper Changes ” , and “ Structural Changes ” .
I ’ve generated a PDF of the slides and made it available on slideshare .
net .
I ’ve also uploaded the 45 minute screencast to my blip.tv channel .
Let me know if you find them useful .
p.s. This was originally a large post highlighting features of NYTProf v3 .
I hate talking about vapourware and with every day that passes the code is getting closer to being ready .
In the end I decided to split the post in two .
The shiny goodness in v3 will get its own blog post when it ’s released .
Meanwhile the slides and screencast will give you a sneak peek .
You are on your way to work or maybe school , you drive along the road and suddenly you see a giant bus driving towards you .
Do n’t worry , it ’s only an illusionary billboard sticker .
Everyone would be frightened by this huge ad that an insurance company created to rise attention about their service .
The pace of modern life and the restless search for short - term material gain in a globalised economic system constitute a threat both to the planet and to human identity , Tony Blair has warned fellow Catholics .
In a speech to the prestigious Communion and Liberation conference at Rimini in Italy the former prime minister and Middle East Quartet envoy also told people of all faiths around the world that their own conflicts and divisions " allow aggressive secularism in part of the West to gain traction " when the faiths should be united in standing up for justice and solidarity .
" This is surely the role of faith in modern times .
To do what it alone can do .
To achieve what neither a person , nor a state , nor a community , on their own or even together , can achieve .
" To represent God 's Truth , not limited by human frailty , or by the interests of the state or by the transient mores of a community , however well intentioned ; but to let that truth bestow on us humility , love of neighbour , and the true knowledge that indeed passes all understanding . " .
Blair spoke on a stopover during his family summer holiday in the Mediterranean where he was photographed and – not for the first time – criticised as a guest on Rising Sun , the five - deck yacht of American software billionaire Larry Ellison , anchored off the Sardinian coast .
The speech , delivered on Thursday , was partly personal , but also political in tone .
In remarks which he admitted were " humbling " – as a new member of the Church addressing such a body – Blair credited his Catholic wife , Cherie , for his eventual formal conversion from Anglicanism shortly after leaving Downing Street in 2007 .
" Ever since I began preparations to become a Catholic , I felt I was coming home ; and this is now where my heart is , where I know I belong , " he said .
Blair , who runs his own faith foundation , said his frequent visits to China had allowed him to see how both government and people of all faiths – including Catholics – were edging their way towards accommodating both modernisation and a sustainable , low carbon environment in ways that Westerners would recognise .
Nokia just announced “ Nokia Money ” which will be shown off next week at Nokia World .
We told you about the Nokia Money trademark a little over a month ago , and it looks like the service is going to launch some time early next year .
Similar to how Nokia purchased Twango and rebranded it Ovi Share , Nokia is going to be built on top of Obopay ’s mobile payment platform .
More details will be revealed next week and it can not be stated enough how important this is at helping Nokia remain relevant going forward .
In my open letter to Nokia earlier this month , I told them to become a bank .
I hope this is the first of many steps in achieving that transformation .
Note : Obopay only works in the United States and India at the moment .
Nokia also invested roughly $ 70 million into Obopay in March of this year .
Current Obopay users pay $ 0.25 to send any amount of money , up to $ 1000 .
Receiving a payment is free .
Full press release after the jump , with relevant information made bold .
Nokia Money , a new mobile financial service enables financial management and payments from a mobile phone
Espoo , Finland – Nokia today introduced Nokia Money , a new mobile financial service offering consumers with mobile device access to basic financial services .
For many consumers , this will be the first time they have had any access to such financial services .
Nokia Money has been designed to be as simple and convenient as making a voice call or sending an SMS .
It will enable consumers to send money to another person just by using the person ’s mobile phone number , as well as to pay merchants for goods and services , pay their utility bills , or recharge their prepaid SIM cards ( SIM top - up ) .
The services can be accessed 24 hours a day from anywhere , meaning savings in travel costs and time .
Nokia is building a wide network of Nokia Money agents , where consumers can deposit money in or withdraw cash from their accounts .
4 billion mobile phones but only 1.6 billion bank accounts
“ We believe mobile financial services offer a market opportunity with long term growth potential .
In many countries , mobile phone ownership significantly exceeds bank account usage , suggesting that many mobile phone users have very limited or no access to basic financial services .
With more than 4 billion mobile phone users and only 1.6 billion bank accounts , global demand for access to financial services presents a strong opportunity to combine mobile devices with simple but powerful financial services such as Nokia Money ” , said Mary McDowell , EVP and Chief Development Officer , Nokia .
Mobile payments will be the next step for delivering financial services to hundreds of millions of people , both urban and rural , who are underserved by existing payment means , especially in emerging economies .
“ Rural consumers will particularly benefit from money transfers and , for urban consumers used to online services , we are enabling services such as payment of utility bills , purchase of train and movie tickets , top-ups , all through their mobile phones .
Nokia
Money is simple to use , secure and available across different operator networks and on virtually any mobile phone .
This means millions of new consumers will soon be able to manage all their financial needs from their mobile phone ” , said Teppo Paavola , VP and Head of Corporate Business Development , Nokia .
Building a new ecosystem for mobile payments
The Nokia Money service will be operated in cooperation with Obopay , a leader in developing global mobile payment solutions , which Nokia invested in earlier this year .
The service is based on Obopay ’s mobile payment platform , with unique and newly developed mobile elements .
Nokia intends the service to be open and interoperable with other payment services as well .
“ Obopay shares Nokia ’s vision for bringing mobile financial services to millions of people worldwide .
We ’re excited that Nokia has chosen Obopay ’s platform .
Nokia ’s leading market position , strong brand recognition and global distribution channel , using the Obopay platform with uniquely developed mobile elements , means the Nokia Money service is well positioned to bring the next generation of mobile payment services to the world , ” said Carol Realini , Founder and CEO of Obopay .
Nokia Money is the result of a powerful collaboration Nokia is forging between different partners in different markets around the world .
It is designed to work in partnership with mobile network operators and financial institutions , involving distributors and merchants in a dynamic ecosystem to seamlessly provide the new services .
“ As a result of the innovative partnerships and comprehensive ecosystem we are forging with the banking and financial industry , as well as leading network operators , we believe Nokia Money will bring financial inclusion to many who currently have limited or no access to financial services .
Uniting the strengths of the mobile and financial services industries will change the way people around the world can manage their money in the future ” , added McDowell .
“ Mobile financial services present a high growth sector for Nokia .
Nokia ’s asset strengths , including consumer brand awareness , distribution capabilities and global relationships should serve as logical and necessary extensions to drive innovation in the mobile payments and banking sector .
To be successful Nokia must provide a legitimate bridge between operators , banks networks and security infrastructure in order to unlock the broad uptake of mobile financial services , ” said Bob Egan , Global Head of Research and Chief Analyst , Towergroup .
The Nokia Money service will be shown for the first time at Nokia World on the 2nd and 3rd of September 2009 in Stuttgart , Germany , and it is planned to be rolled out gradually to selected markets , beginning in early 2010 .
But Twitter users yesterday continued to circulate information from within the protest movement that sprang up to press the claims of the presidential candidate Mir-hossein Mousavi , who is contesting President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's claim he has been re-elected .
Although the volume of posts had fallen there also appeared to be attempts by official organisations to spread disinformation in the guise of opposition supporters .

A and B are exactly the same shade of gray .
This essay is about the meaning of life , and how realizing there is none is the beginning rather than the end .
If you ’re a smart and / or educated person the beginning will be familiar .
Stick with it .
The Basic Argument
Meaning << Emotion << Chemistry << Physics
The “ meaning ” of life comes purely from emotional experience , which is chemically based .
We know that emotion , and even spiritual experiences , are chemical in nature .
It is already possible , using current science , to use drugs and / or direct manipulation of the brain in order to induce “ spiritual ” experiences .
Of course , it ’s possible that these modifications simply make us receptive to signals from an actual spirit world , but I find that possibility remote enough to be dismissed with little discussion .
This is the same way I dismiss the possibility that a “ floor demon ” used telekinesis to pull a cup of coffee to its bosom when I accidently let it slip from my grasp and it falls to the ground .
In short , when there ’s a transparent , scientific explanation for something there ’s little reason to buy into another one that requires the supernatural .
My assertion is that all goals and aspirations , regardless of how lofty or “ selfless ” they may be , are little more than ultimately equal illusions based in biology , which is based in chemistry , which is based in physics .
In short , meaning is contrived by humans as an explanation for why we do what we do .
We build this illusion because the alternative is too unbearable .
Goals
All of my goals , and all anyone else ’s goals I ’ve ever encountered in person or via extended experience , are based on emotions .
Let ’s take me for example , since I can speak to that authoritatively .
Speaking very honestly , here are the primary things I desire in life ( not necessarily in order ) :
To feel in control of my life and my destiny
To be respected by those around me , both at work and away from it
To have love and romance with one woman , but be sought by others
To be knowledgeable and wise enough to understand the world
To use said knowledge to help improve the lives of others
To share beautiful experiences with smart , interesting people
The first ones are pretty standard , and most agree they have these to some degree .
The latter ones are generally considered “ higher ” goals , reserved for those who are more selfless in nature .
But they are n’t .
We ’ve all heard the concept of altruism being selfish because it brings pleasure to the person doing the giving .
Well , this is a model that explains that observation .
Just as the desire to be powerful is natural and emotion - based , so is the desire to help others .
In both cases the result is a chemical squirt of pleasure into the brain of the person who accomplishes their goal .
The only difference in selfish and selfless desires is whether the outcome of the desire is positive for others in addition to you , not whether or not it ’s positive for you at all .
Desires are always for you .
Even when you desperately want to sacrifice yourself for someone you love you are still doing so because not doing so would cause you even more pain .
This is not a selfless act ; it ’s the result of being compelled to do something - just like being compelled to seek food , shelter , or a mate .
Animals have desires too .
They desire to control their territory and kill competitors , to mate , to reproduce , etc .
Many animals even like to masturbate , and mourn the loss of loved ones .
Our desires are no different , really ; we ’ve just conned ourselves into believing they are through elaborate self - deception .
As an example , go and ask the average parent why he or she had kids .
You ’ll get the same answer as if you asked an ape why it threw poop at someone .
“ Um , because you ’re supposed to ? ”
And if you ’re lucky and get a “ higher ” thinker he / she will respond that kids give them a strong feeling of accomplishment , or even that they provide a way to live after they ’re dead .
In all cases it ’s for the parent ’s benefit .
But if you think about it there ’s really no other option .
Unborn kids care very little about the fact that they are n’t born .
People have children for themselves , not for their unborn children .
People have children because chemicals tell them to , which manifests as emotion , i.e . “ I just really want children … ” Yes , of course you do .
And we call this our identity ?
Higher vs. Lower Goals
So let ’s be more forward with this .
I believe that all human goals –whether they are base and overtly selfish ( to have enough money to be able to have sex whenever a person wants to ) , or are higher - order such as ( I want to help Africa , even if it means my career … ) –are fundamentally the same .
They are all chemically - based and offer chemical rewards .
The desires of a 45 - year - old accountant with a paid off house , a beautiful wife , two children , and a healthy 401 K are no different than the desires of a 17 - year - old drug dealer who still lives at home and is trying to get his ex-girlfriend back .
Let ’s evaluate the desires :
Banker
Be a good father
Be respected at work and at home
Make the wife happy
Get the next promotion
Keep bad guys away from his family ( he votes Republican )
Get his kids in good colleges
Get that summer home
Drug Dealer
Make enough to get my own place
Get a nicer car so I can impress my ex
Get a gun so people will know not to mess with me
Get some nicer clothes
Go to the gym more so I ’ll be more attractive / menacing
Ok , so now for the real fun .
Let ’s do a gopher ( yeah , a real gopher ) :
Gopher
Get more sticks for a better house
Find more food
Attract that female
Protect the babies
Get more sticks for …
Now let ’s do a Buddhist Monk .
Monk
Abandon meaningless connections to the material
Learn to let go of a sense of self
Focus on the immediate moment , not before , not after
What do all these things have in common ?
They all result in the same thing if they are attained .
Squirt .
That ’s the sound of pleasurable chemicals being injected into your brain .
It ’s pretty much the same chemicals for the banker , the drug dealer , and the monk .
And it ’s being received by pretty much the same hardware within the brain .
That squirt is the source of happiness .
Everything else , e.g. spirituality , meaning , purpose , etc. , is added to the mix after the fact .
Animals do n’t have meaning in their lives because they are n’t complex enough to create it as an explanation for what they do .
We are , therefore we have it .
I ’ve written before about my belief that free will does not exist .
Interestingly enough , the concepts of “ meaning ” and “ free will ” are identical in one crucial sense : neither of them really exist , yet we desperately need them in order to maintain a healthy society .
So What Do We Do With This Knowledge ?
Once you are awake , and you realize that all of your desires and pleasures ultimately reduce to chemical interactions , there are a few different ways you can go .
Realize how depressing that is and immediately cast it from your mind and go on pretending that meaning is real .
Go back to sleep , essentially .
Realize how central emotion is and abandon all “ higher ” aspirations .
Dedicate your life to seeking pleasure , since it ’s the only source of meaning anyway .
Maintain dual awareness .
Realize that this is an illusion , but participate in it for your own sanity .
Pursue a path in life that allows more people to experience happiness , and fewer people to experience suffering .
I ’ve chosen three .
I ’ve chosen with meaning , just as I have with free will , to accept that it does n’t really exist , but to operate as if it does because there is no practical alternative given my limitations as a human being ( or as a society ) .
An interesting question rises to the surface here : how many other people who are asleep have simply chosen option one ?
Implications
The most staggering realization that comes from this knowledge is that the ignorant and deluded in life are fundamentally no different than I am .
The fact that I ’m awake does n’t change the fact that I derive meaning from chemicals .
So when I ’m in an elevator full of Bush - supporting Christians , and I ’m looking down at them for being so foolish , I ’m really not much different .
Yes , I ’m aware of my own limitations , but this does n’t make them go away .
I received pleasure from realizing how superior I was , right ?
Like knowing I ’m in on a secret that they do n’t get .
Well , how different is that from them receiving pleasure in church on Sunday ?
Or from eating a nice bowl of ice cream .
It ’s no different .
A squirt is a squirt .
It ’s all the same .
I can tell you that this realization gives me a different outlook on the religious .
Religion and spirituality is the ultimate manifestation of the illusion because they create alternate worlds where meaning comes from .
Again , I wonder how many have done so because they ’ve seen through the illusion , and it was too much to bear .
Another interesting point is that being a non-spiritual atheist who believes in intrinsic meaning is even more absurd than being religious .
At least a religious person has a backing to their claim–even if it ’s a false one ; an atheist who believes in intrinsic meaning has no such support .
The only atheists with any solid ground to stand on in terms of meaning are those who create it within the context of the illusion .
And when the CEO gets in the elevator with us , and then a monk on the next floor , the same sorts of things are going on in each of our heads .
I say the monk does n’t get it because he ’s abandoned too much that is pleasurable in the this material world .
The CEO does n’t think any of us get it because we do n’t have two vacation homes and a yacht .
And the Christian looks down at us because they know that Jesus is the answer .
We ’re all subscribed to our own little fantasies , and they all result in squirts of pleasure .
We like knowing that we ’re part of a small group that “ gets it ” .
Still , I say I ’m better of because I get that none of it ’s real , which brings me to my next point .
Conclusions
There are only two types of people : those who know they are participating in an illusion , and those who still believe in intrinsic meaning .
These are the two fundamental classifications of animal .
Animals and 99 % of the world are on one side , and people who are awake are on the other .
The question of “ why ? ” is simple : we are chemical machines being driven by evolution .
We desire power and attractiveness and happiness all because those who achieve those things are successful at propagating themselves .
Perhaps meaning itself is a meme “ employed ” by evolution to coax us into doing its bidding .
It ’s a method of obscuring the tedium of day - to - day life .
Meaning is a necessary illusion .
So the question is n’t whether you can shed your worldly , selfish desires .
You can ’t .
No matter what you desire , regardless of how selfless it is , fulfilling it will still result in happiness for yourself .
That ’s the nature of an animal , and that ’s what makes them your desires .
The real question is whether or not you can evolve your goals into being helpful to others while they fulfill you as well .
This is morality in this new world of awareness .
Increasing happiness and reducing suffering is n’t something to do for another world ; it ’s something to do just because we know what both feel like , and we should try and make others feel happiness just as we would like to .
This is also the definition of an advanced society .
An advanced society is one that works from within the illusion and strives to attain linkage between the world ’s happiness and suffering .
In other words , when one person suffers the world suffers , and when people are happy the world is happy .
Awareness of the illusion also makes the concept of virtual worlds quite a bit more interesting .
Once you embrace this illusion it becomes significantly less weird to seek pleasure from within alternate worlds of fantasy .
Those other worlds are ultimately achieving for us the same thing as we get in the “ real ” world , i.e. a squirt .
What ’s the fundamental difference in where that squirt came from ?
In summary , I do n’t see this awareness as completely depressing , which I know will be the main complaint ( and hence the reason to reject it ) .
But instead of seeing this as evidence of a complete lack of meaning in our lives , let ’s make the distinction between intrinsic meaning and meaning we can make for ourselves .
Let ’s use it to create our own .

While the rest of us shelter from another horrible domestic summer , lucky BBC executives have been relaxing by the Mediterranean .
A Freedom of Information request by the Guardian has revealed that the corporation has been using a distant sun-kissed villa as a base for entertaining .
We learn that for years the corporation has regularly hired Mickie Most 's old villa , at a cost to date of £ 90,530 , raising the question of " whether it is really necessary for the BBC to commit that amount of money " , as John Whittingdale , the Tory chairman of the Commons culture and media committee , puts it .
" At a time when the BBC claims to be short of cash , it does seem somewhat extravagant , " he says .
And his colleague Ed Vaizey , the shadow media and arts spokesman , sends a starker message by saying he wants to freeze the licence fee and to sell off Radio 1 .
Whenever another drama erupts around the BBC , preordained positions are taken up again , for and against .
The Daily Mail and the Murdoch press never miss an opportunity to give the corporation a kicking , while for some on the liberal left it's an instinctive reflex to defend the BBC as a great national institution .
Indeed it is that – even now .
But whatever the motives of the BBC 's enemies , those reflexive apologists have n't noticed how far it has changed , in a way that reflects the spirit of the age as much as greedy bankers or corrupt MPs , and which invites serious , disinterested criticism .
Once upon a time the BBC was rather a puritanical sort of organisation , and I do n't just mean the stern Sir John Reith 's insistence that adultery was a sacking offence .
Nobody used to join the corporation to get rich .
That did n't stop it attracting plenty of talent .
I well remember how BBC traineeships were the hottest , most sought - after ambition for graduates in the late 1960s .
They were ambitious , that is , to make good programmes , have fun and , no doubt , meet glamorous , liberated girls – but not to make a pile .
Since then we 've lived through the enrichissez - vous Thatcherite decade , with what the patrician high Tory Sir Peregrine Worsthorne memorably called its bourgeois triumphalism , and then a new Labour government totally relaxed about people becoming filthy rich .
After that , even if we 're disgusted by the greed of bankers , we are n't necessarily surprised .
But is it any more surprising if the same spirit has infected parliament – and broadcasting ?
In truth , that has happened at the BBC on a dramatic scale .
A comparison of the incomes of public figures between half a century ago and now is instructive .
In 1958 the salaries of the prime minister , the lord chief justice and the director general of the BBC were easy to remember as they were all the same , £ 10,000 a year .
Last year the prime minister was paid £ 189,994 , the lord chief justice £ 236,300 – and the director general £ 816,000 ( plus bonuses ) .
There are now at least 47 BBC executives paid more than the prime minister .
Everyone who works in the media has heard the stories about people retiring early from the BBC with personal pension pots of anything between £ 4 m and £ 8 m , and the their expenses must have impressed even MPs adept at claiming for champagne flutes or " flipping " residences .
The director general himself is defiant .
An unabashed Mark Thompson says he is good value for money , and that he could earn far more elsewhere .
That 's what senior BBC executives all tell us , but is it true even in its own terms ?
Max Hastings has said that when he was a newspaper editor he would n't have hired some of the BBC personnel he met in any capacity or for any salary .
And David Elstein , the former chief executive of Channel 5 , described Thompson 's claim as " complete nonsense " .
There is no true comparison between the BBC and commercial companies , Elstein says .
" At the BBC you have effectively got security for life , a gold - plated pension , you 've got wonderful perks and security of revenues into the distant future .
None of that applies in the private sector . "
What the BBC 's defenders fail to notice is that contradictory arguments are invoked on its behalf .
In America they say that the Republican party 's creed is " Free enterprise for the poor , socialism for the rich " .
Selfish " welfare moms " have their benefit cut , but billions of dollars are given in subsidies to rich cotton farmers , while Wall Street is bailed out by the taxpayer – after vast bonuses have been pocketed , and before , as it transpires , they are pocketed all over again .
That happened here too , of course .
As Vince Cable has said with his usual lucidity ( why is n't he leader of the Liberal Democrats , or chancellor ? ) , it 's intolerable , not to say simply absurd , for these City slickers to claim they deserve their bonuses once more after they have been rescued from the brink by the rest of us .
The bankers have had a wonderful each - way deal .
When profits roll in , they take the winnings ; when losses engulf them , the taxpayer foots the bill .
If only one could have an arrangement with the bookmakers like that .
And yet the BBC also uses two standards , in a way not dissimilar to the Republicans : public service broadcasting principles when it comes to collecting revenue , but the free market when it comes to paying the DG , or Jonathan Ross .
However objectionable Ross is , his money would be his own business if he made it in a true marketplace , like Jeffrey Archer or Didier Drogba .
But he does n't .
We pay him £ 3 m a year whether we like it or not .
What Thompson and his colleagues conveniently forget when defending their salaries and contracts is that the licence fee is a form of taxation , not to say a regressive poll tax .
They forget that the BBC is a public corporation , and its employees public officials .
Is n't it time they started behaving in a public spirit ?
This is written with a tinge of regret .
I was formed by the BBC , from the Third Programme to Panorama , not to say from Take It from Here to Round the Horne , and from Test Match Special to Match of the Day .
But a sharp culture shock is now needed .
Those rapacious bankers have it coming , as well as the light - fingered MPs , but then so do Thompson and his colleagues , with their villas , cashmere socks and pension pots .
If they are wise , they will anticipate the coming age of austerity , before it hits them hard .
Once teeming with salmon and other species , most fish disappeared from the river at the turn of the 20th century , wiped out by toxins from industrial , farming and domestic pollution , as well as dams preventing them from reaching the sea .
SpaceX's DragonEye to Fly on STS - 127 Posted : July 9 , 2009 , compiled from public domain sources .
Offically , STS - 127 Detailed Test Objective ( DTO ) 701B , will test the sensor SpaceX's Dragon vehicle will use to approach the International Space Station .
NASA 's press kit says :
On behalf of SpaceX of Hawthorne , Calif. , NASA 's Commercial Crew and Cargo Program Office ( C3PO ) is sponsoring the investigation of " DragonEye , " a pulsed laser navigation sensor that SpaceX's Dragon vehicle would use to approach the International Space Station .
The test is to gain confidence and experience with how the Dragon Eye sensor performs before the system is used on the vehicle 's third demonstration which includes rendezvous with the station .
The C3PO office manages the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services ( COTS ) projects which has a Space Act Agreement with SpaceX .
COTS is an effort by NASA to stimulate a commercial market for spaceflight services .
According to SpaceX , its recoverable Dragon spacecraft is being designed to carry both pressurized and unpressurized cargo to the station .
The Advanced Scientific Concepts ( ASCs ) " DragonEye " flash Light Intensification Detection and Ranging ( LIDAR ) relative navigation sensor is being tested on this mission .
DragonEye has been baselined as SpaceX 's primary relative navigation sensor .
The DragonEye will mount to the shuttle 's existing Trajectory Control System ( TCS ) carrier assembly on the Orbiter Docking System ( ODS ) .
SpaceX will be taking data in parallel with the shuttle 's Trajectory Control Sensor ( TCS ) system .
Both TCS and DragonEye will be " looking " at the retroreflectors that are on the station .
After the flight , SpaceX will compare the data Dragon Eye collected against the data TCS collected and evaluate Dragon Eye 's performance .
The DragonEye will use a flash Light Intensification Detection and Ranging ( Range ) ( LIDAR ) , which provides a three - dimensional image based on the time of flight of a single laser pulse from the sensor to the target and back .
It provides both range and bearing information from targets that can reflect the light back such as the Pressurized Mating Adapter ( PMA ) 2 and those on the nadir side of station 's Japanese Experiment Module ( JEM ) .
The DragonEye sensor unit will also be able to operate with retroreflectors in the Field Of View ( FOV ) even at close range .
The DragonEye sensor is eye - safe and will also be unpowered when docked to the station , so there are no safety concerns for spacewalks .
SpaceX also will perform a ground - based space qualification program to ensure the sensor can withstand the rigors of launch and operation in a space environment , including tests such as vibration and thermal - vac .
More Flight Tests To Come The COTS UHF Communications Unit ( CUCU ) is set to fly on STS - 128 later this year .
A unit on the Dragon vehicle and another on the ISS will provide dual - redundant digital radio communications during final approach and docking .
SpaceX CEO
Elon
Musk reports , the units will communicate health and status telemetry from the Dragon to the ISS crew , and basic commands from the ISS crew to the Dragon .
The test units have passed qualification testing and four units are now in production .
About SpaceX SpaceX is developing a family of launch vehicles and spacecraft intended to increase the reliability and reduce the cost of both manned and unmanned space transportation , ultimately by a factor of 10 .
With the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 vehicles , SpaceX offers highly reliable / cost - efficient launch capabilities for spacecraft insertion into any orbital altitude and inclination .
Starting in 2010 , SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft will provide Earth - to - LEO transport of pressurized and unpressurized cargo , including resupply to the space station .
Founded in 2002 , the SpaceX team now numbers over 700 , with corporate headquarters in Hawthorne , Calif .

Neopets Scam , originally uploaded by Paperghost really begins .
... and that child is , officially , doomed .
Asking for paintbrushes on the trading areas of Neopets will mean that they 're likely to be the recipient of a Neomail ( private messaging on the Neopets website ) that looks like this :
From there , it 's just a case of said child visiting the external link , downloading a file and being keylogged into infinity and beyond .
Then the funbegins .
Additionally , the PC is quite possibly used by other people , or indeed belongs to someone else altogether ....
... which would be , as you can imagine , a " bad thing " .
Shall we see some of the reaction to this attack method from the peanut gallery ?
Wave goodbye to your rare items , kids - and you did n't want your XBox Live account ( that potentially has credit card details attached to it ) anymore either , did you ?
The attackers then use the familiar tactic of taking a previously trusted source and using it to attack their friends & other newcomers to the site .
Alongside hanging out in the handily labeled " Newbies " section and spamming messages , they 'll also post fake " It worked " messages from compromised accounts to the forums of threads started by the attacker , much like people do on Youtube to give the impression that fake programs actually work ( scroll down to " positive comments " ) .

I regularly see a lot of extremely dubious and rather slimy techniques deployed to get end - users to run horrible things or fall for scams .
Generally , the targets tend to be the technologically inept or granny , sitting in the corner .
See granny ?
Sure you do , she 's right over there replying to the Third King of Nigeria and helping him out with his cash relocation problem .
However , I 've come across a scam rapidly spreading across numerous underground forums and IRC channels that is truly one of the scummiest tactics I 've seen in some time .
How bad ?
Allow the following screenshot to spell it out for you .
Ladies and Gentlemen , allow me to present you with the winner of the Lowest Tactic Used in 2009 award .
Do your kids play Neopets ?
If they do , you might want to read this and gently warn them of the dangers .
From Wikipedia
The scam is based around one of the core mechanics of Neopets : kids love rare items and things that nobody else has .
Neopets has magical paintbrushes - stay with me on this - and they 're rather hard to get hold of nowadays .
As an example of that , here 's a petition posted in 2004 ( ! ) that people areposting comments to .
In addition , here 's a list of current prices - now consider a newcomer to Neopets starts with the rather paltry sum of 1000 Neopoints , and you can see why there 's a desire for these items .
This is where we target some 12 year olds with social engineering .
Oh dear ... Neopets is effectively social networking for younger kids and some teenagers .
Or , as someone on a hacking forum put it while discussing this particular attack , ... ouch .
No surprise , then , that the site has many communal areas where people can chat , hang out , send each other messages and see what 's going on .
Our hackers will move to the trading areas , where kids can post requests for items they 'd like to buy , sell or trade .
Then it 's just a case of hunting out posts like this ....
Would you like to watch a video of Cheech and Chong debating the impact of the economic crisis on the price of dime bags while racing on psychedelically - enhanced Tron lightcycles ?
Now 's your chance !
Allow me to set the scene : Cheech and Chong , the world 's most famous pair of stoners , are concerned about the price of marijuana .
Will inflationary pressures force the price of a dime bag to $ 30 ?
Or will economic stagnation driven by declining consumer confidence keep those pressures in check and the price of a dime bag at $ 20 ?
The debate rages back and forth until the duo realizes there 's only one way to settle the matter :
Tron for it .
The clip is part of the Cinemash series of digital videos available on MSN that lets users see " reinterpretations , from a comedic perspective , of classical scenes from popular movies for free . "
The version distributed by Microsoft is an edit , while the one kicking around on YouTube is the full version by Color Stampede , which includes some behind - the - scenes footage showing how the video was created .
I 'm not sure how much more can be said about this , because it 's obviously not something that 's suddenly going to make sense if only it 's explained more carefully .
Cheech and Chong debate finances and ride lightcycles ; you either want to see that , or you do n't .
Enjoy !

" Why are we ignoring things we know ?
We know that the sun does n't always shine and that the wind does n't always blow . "
So wrote former U.S. Energy Secretary James Schlesinger and Robert L. Hirsch last spring in the Washington Post , suggesting that because these key renewables produce power only intermittently , " solar and wind will probably only provide a modest percentage of future U.S. power . "
Never mind that Schlesinger failed to disclose that he sits on the board of directors of Peabody Energy , the world 's largest private - sector coal company — a business with much to lose if a solar - and wind - powered future arrives .
But at least he and his co-author got it partly right .
The benefits from wind and solar are mostly intermittent — so far .
But the pair somehow missed the fact that a furious search for practical , affordable electricity storage to beat that intermittence problem is well underway .
For decades , " grid parity " has been the Holy Grail for alternative energy .
The rap from critics was that technologies like wind and solar could not compete , dollar - for - dollar , with conventional electricity sources , such as coal and nuclear , without large government tax breaks or direct subsidies .
But suddenly , with rapid technological advances and growing economies of manufacturing scale , wind power is now nearly at grid parity — meaning it costs roughly the same to generate electricity from wind as it does from coal .
And the days when solar power attains grid parity may be only a half - decade away .
So with grid parity now looming , finding ways to store millions of watts of excess electricity for times when the wind does n't blow and the sun does n't shine is the new Holy Grail .
And there are signs that this goal — the day when large - scale energy storage becomes practical and cost - effective — might be within reach , as well .
Some technologies that can store sizeable amounts of intermittent power are already deployed .
Others , including at least a few with great promise , lie somewhere over the technological horizon .
New storage approaches include improvements to existing lithium ionbatteries and schemes to store energy as huge volumes of compressed air in vast geologic vaults .
Another idea is to create a network of small , energy - dense batteries in tens of millions of homes .
Under such a " distributed storage " scheme , utility computers could coordinate electricity flows over a " smart grid " that continually communicates with — and adjusts the flow of power to and from — local batteries .
This would even include batteries in future plug - in hybrid or all - electric vehicles .
And one 2008 breakthrough could even fulfill chemists ' long - held dreams of producing a squeaky - clean and storable fuel by using excess electricity generated from renewable sources to cheaply produce hydrogen , which could then be used in fuel cells to power homes and cars .
In a world run mainly on fossil fuels , finding ways to store electricity was not a pressing concern :
Power plants across a regional electrical grid could simply burn more fuel when demand was high .
But large - scale electricity storage promises be an energy game - changer , unshackling alternative energy from the constraints of intermittence .
It would mean that if a wind or solar farm were the cheapest and cleanest way to generate power , it would n't matter when the sun shone or the wind blew .
One storage approach seems obvious : to improve battery technologies .
Picture efficient , enormous batteries that can store tens of millions of
watt - hours of juice .
Today , the vast majority of new rooftop solar photovoltaic panels are connected to the grid , using it as a giant battery , pushing excess power onto the grid when solar panels provide excess power .
The building then draws power from the grid when the sun does n't shine , with its meter spinning backward and forward with the ebb and flow of power .
With relatively few solar roofs yet in play , utilities manage any ebb and flow by drawing down and ramping up generation at conventional power plants designed to balance fluctuating supply and demand .
A more robust world of solar and wind power might be better served by some sort of giant battery — or , more likely , many of them , widely distributed .
The basic concept has been proven .
Since 2003 , the world 's largest battery backup has been storing energy for an entire city : Fairbanks , Alaska .
Isolated as it is , and not part of any regional electricity grid , the metropolitan area of about 100,000 residents needs an electricity backstop more than most :
In its sub - zero winters , pipes can freeze solid in as little as two hours .
Six years ago , the city installed a huge nickel - cadmium battery , the same technology used for years in laptop computers and other portable devices .
Housed in a giant warehouse , the 1,300 - metric ton battery is larger than a football field , and can crank out 40 million watts of power .
Still , the Fairbanks battery provides only enough electricity for about 12,000 residents for seven minutes .
That was enough to prevent 81 blackouts in the city in the battery 's first two years of operation .
Yet effective storage of electricity from solar or wind arrays that generate power equivalent to one large coal plant implies batteries on a breathtaking scale — hundreds of units the size of the Fairbanks array .
One possible answer ?
In Japan , so - called " flow " batteries have been used for years to store backup power at industrial plants .
Conventional batteries store energy in chemical form .
With flow batteries , charged chemicals are pumped into storage tanks , allowing still more chemical to be charged and pumped away , then pumped back into the active portion of the battery and drawn down as needed .
One big advantage : Battery " size " can be expanded by simply adding more chemicals and more storage tanks .
In 2003 , the local utility on small King Island , off the coast of Australia , installed a large flow battery to sop up and later release excess power from a wind farm .
As with the alternative generation technologies , cost will be key for determining which battery or other storage technologies might prevail .
Aside from such typical economic concerns as raw material and maintenance costs and durability , storage technologies all face some losses in " round - trip efficiency . "
Inevitably , some energy is lost as it goes into storage , and more is lost as it comes out .
Right now , hopes are riding high on lithium ion batteries , because they have impressive round - trip efficiencies , can pack in high densities of energy , and can charge and discharge thousands of times before becoming degraded .
Because of those attributes , lithium - ion battery technology has become increasingly dominant in laptop computers and cell phones .
On a far larger scale , a powerful lithium ion battery pack powers the pricey all - electric Tesla Roadster , and is slated to power the plug - in hybrid Chevy Volt next year .
On the grid , lithium ion experiments are already underway .
One company , General Electric - backed A123 Systems , announced late in 2008 that it had been contracted to install a two - megawatt lithium ion storage unit at a California power plant owned by global utility giant AES .
Still , lithium ion remains a relatively expensive technology — 10 times more expensive than lead acid batteries with equivalent capacity .
Technological improvements and manufacturing scale should bring lithium costs down over time , but by the time that happens , the world could be beating a path to the door of someone who 's found a way to build an even better battery .
Early this year , IBM revealed that it was launching a major research program into what looks like an even more promising technology — the lithium metal - air battery .
Last month , a company called PolyPlus announced that it had already succeeded in developing one .
The PolyPlus battery and the IBM technology deliver an astonishing 10 times more energy density than even today 's best lithium ion technology .
That means that , pound for pound , they offer about the energy density of gasoline .
The key reason they can store so much energy is that they use oxygen , drawn from the air , in place of some of the chemical reactants used along with lithium in their lithium ion cousins .
There 's one big rub :
Air is n't just oxygen .
Notably , it also contains humidity , and the lithium has a bad habit of acting like ignited gasoline when exposed to moisture , creating a real risk of fire and explosion .
Chandrasekhar Narayan , manager of science and technology at IBM's Almaden Research Center near San Jose , Calif. , has suggested that it will take five to 10 years to develop an effective membrane that will let oxygen into the battery while keeping moisture out .
Still in pie - in - sky mode , there 's " vehicle to grid " storage , or " carbitrage . "
This enticing notion relies on idled storage in the batteries of the millions of plug - in hybrid or all - electric automobiles that will be in use in the future .
There 's reason to believe this scheme could work .
More than 90 percent of the time cars sit idled , and aside from days they 're used for long trips , most of their full energy storage capacity goes unused .
A single idle , electric - powered car could generate as much as 10 kilowatts of power , enough to meet the average demand of 10 houses , according to Willett Kempton , director of the Center for Carbon - free Power Integration at the University of Delaware .
With vehicle - to - grid technology , controlled by an array of smart meters , car owners plugged in at home or work could allow the grid to draw off unused chunks of power at times when short - term demand is high .
Conversely , cars could be recharged when demand is low .
The stored power in those electric cars , or anywhere on the grid , might not come from batteries after all .
In March , Texas - based EEStor announced that it had received third - party verification of its " ultracapacitor " technology .
The company claims the lightweight device , which was awarded a U.S. patent last December , can bottle up huge amounts of electricity far more quickly than any battery and can do so at lower cost .
Like batteries , capacitors store and mete out electricity .
Small conventional capacitors have been ubiquitous in electronic devices as far back as the early days of radio .
But capacitors , so far , have n't been able to store electricity for long enough to come close to competing with batteries .
They have found use as devices that level out fluctuations in voltage or that briefly store power for near - instant release .
EEStor claims that its device , which is one - quarter the weight of a similar
lithium ion battery , can hold a large charge for days .
Its patent describes a 281 - pound device that would hold almost the same charge as a half - ton lithium ion battery pack installed on the Tesla Roadster .
The company 's ultracapacitors have yet to prove themselves in commercial products .
But industrial giant Lockheed Martin has already signed up with EEStor to use future ultra capacitors in defense applications , and Toronto - based Zenn Motors , which has also taken an ownership stake in EEStor , says it will have electric cars on the road using the technology in 2010 .
If advanced batteries or ultracapacitors are n't the ultimate answer , maybe using excess electricity to make hydrogen that can be stored will do the trick .
Hydrogen can be produced through simple electrolysis , but technical and cost hurdles have made electrolysis impractical .
Today , industrial - scale hydrogen is produced using natural gas as a not - so - clean feedstock .
But that may have begun to change last summer when MIT announced that a team lead by chemist Daniel Nocera had made a " major discovery " that employs a new kind of catalyst using cobalt and phosphate — abundant and non-toxic materials — to kick - start electrolysis .
Outside observers say the process could be revolutionary : opening up the possibility that electricity made at any time by the sun or wind could be stored by simply splitting ( and later recombining ) abundant water molecules , perhaps even undrinkable sea water .
The breakthrough has been hailed by scientist British scientist James Barber of Imperial College London as having " enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind . "
The website Xconomy reported in April that Nocera had quietly formed a startup company called Sun Catalytics .
Efforts to reach Nocera for comment were unsuccessful .
And there is progress being made on an entirely different front — using excess electricity to pump compressed air into caverns , salt domes , and old natural gas wells , and then releasing the air to help state - of - the - art natural gas power plants spin turbines , lowering the amount of fuel consumed by as much as 70 percent .
A consortium of utilities in Iowa , Minnesota , and the Dakotas is already working with the U.S. 's Sandia National Laboratories to develop a giant , 268 - megawatt compressed air system .
Called the Iowa Stored Energy Park , it would store excess energy from the region 's burgeoning wind industry .

This month marks the birth date of perhaps the greatest Swede who ever lived .
Raoul Wallenberg .
He helped save 100,000 Hungarian Jews from the Nazis before being swallowed up by Stalin 's gulags .
Jews consider Wallenberg 's name a blessing , and young Swedes should be inspired by his peerless courage and compassion .
Yet instead of celebrating this national hero , now comes from Sweden 's largest newspaper , Aftonbladet , a revival of the age - old blood libel against the Jews that would have caused Wallenberg to lead a national protest .
" They plunder the organs of our sons , " reads the quote from a Palestinian that serves as the headline across a double spread in the Swedish equivalent of " The Style Section " of the New York Times or the Washington Post .
Outrageous Report Swedish foreign minister :
We 're not anti-Semitic Associated Press Carl Bildt rejects calls to condemn unsubstantiated story accusing Israeli troops of plundering Palestinian organs , draws parallel to Muhammad cartoon outrage ; ' Freedom of expression very strong in our constitution , ' he says Swedish foreign minister :
We 're not anti-Semitic
Boström 's major contribution is not just to popularize this anti-Semitic libel in Scandinavia but to update it by accusing New Jersey rabbis , arrested for money laundering , as somehow involved with Israeli soldiers in an international Jewish organ harvesting ring - accusations that make The Protocols of the Elders of Zion seem tame by comparison .
If there were an Ignoble Prize for the world 's most odious anti-Semitic journalist , Boström would be this year 's winner .
The truth is that Iran 's vicious regime is guilty of some of the very crimes it accuses Israel of .
Hence , while the Israelis are alleged to be returning mutilated corpses to their Palestinian families for burial , Tehran 's jailers are actually returning the bloodied corpses of young protesters tortured to death in prison to Iranian families - and charging them for the coffins !
' Israel the Jew among nations '
The real scandal is not the Israeli military 's nonexistent harvest of Palestinian organs , but the ideology of extremists like Hamas ' Khalid Mashaal .
Their culture of death is transforming societies across the Middle East into an assembly line turning young people into suicide bombers and " human shields " in the name of martyrdom " Child martyrs " are harvested and deployed against Israelis , Westerners , and increasingly , other Muslims .
The international seal of approval for open season on Israel came at the UN Anti-Racism Conference in Durban South Africa in 2001 that was hijacked by Arab and Muslim countries and their international NGO allies .
Durban I revived 1975 UN Resolution equating " Zionism with racism " in order to delegitimize Israel as a pariah state .
Since then , Israel , as Alan Dershowitz has said , became " the Jew among nations . "
Now an influential Scandinavian newspaper has shamefully become the conduit for Mideast ideological exports with roots in horrific medieval accusations that Jews harvested non-Jewish children for their blood .
Like a patient with a compromised immune system , Scandinavian countries too often are failing to resist the plague of classic Jew hatred .
Norway 's government , with the royal family 's blessing , is currently rehabilitating with a national celebration and museum in his honor Knut Hamsen , the Hitler groupie who in 1943 gave his Nobel Prize to Propaganda Minister Josef Goebbels .
While Sweden , where a few years ago a third of young people doubted there was a Holocaust , has enabled Moroccan expatriate Ahmed Rami - whose Radio Islam is a 22 - language flagship of Holocaust denial , Jew - hatred , and demonization of Israel - to poison the well of non-Muslim as well as Muslim public opinion .
Far from being " free speech in action , " Sweden 's anti-Israel hatred is too often subsidized by the government .
A recent report by the respected NGO Monitor shows that the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency ( SIDA ) , Diakonia , the multi-national NGO Development Center ( NDC ) , and the Swedish Mission Council ( SMR ) fund 20 major NGOs that " routinely accuse Israel of ' genocide ' , ' ethnic cleansing ' , and ' apartheid ' , and some compare Israeli military and political officials to Nazis . "
As Professor Gerald Steinberg puts it , " The path from this demonization to the blood libels of Aftonbladet is short and direct . "
Kudos to the few Swedish voices who have spoken out fiercely against the blood libel promoted by Aftonbladet .
The Swedish Foreign Ministry initially " distanced " itself from the libel - but then backed away when criticized by the pro-Palestinian Swedish Left .
Raoul Wallenberg would be ashamed by the absence of outrage from Sweden 's political elite and vaunted human rights group .
Maybe the memory of his courage and humanity will inspire the silent Swedish majority and decent people everywhere to vanquish the newest toxic incarnation of the world 's oldest hatred .
G8 leaders meeting in Italy agreed this week that average global temperatures should not rise more than 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) from pre-industrial times .
But Group of Eight member Canada said it will not adjust its plan to combat global warming , despite the fact that it falls short of the new commitment .
Canadian Environment Minister Jim Prentice called his country ’s planned reduction of 70 percent by 2050 “ realistic , ” in contrast to the G8 ’s number of 80 percent , given “ the climate we have , the industrial base we have , our population growth . ”
Data collected in 2007 placed Canada as the seventh largest annual emitter of CO2 gases , and a recent study by the German insurer Allianz has found that among major economies they , along with Russia , are making the least progress in combating climate change .
In light of this , and the United States ’ newfound commitment to reducing emissions , Canada has assumed “ bad boy ” status among the G8 countries , according to Bloomberg .

Suminia lived at a time when all other known vertebrates lived on the ground and tree leaves were an ' untapped resource , ' said University of Toronto paleontologist Robert Reisz .
(( Diane Scott / Field Museum ) )
An ancestor of mammals first took to the trees before the age of dinosaurs , evolving the first known opposable thumbs on the way , a group of Toronto researchers reports .
The animal , dubbed Suminia getmanovi , lived at a time when other known vertebrates , including both predators and plant - eaters larger than itself , spent all their time on the ground , said University of Toronto paleontologist Robert Reisz , who studied its complete fossil remains with his PhD student Jörg Fröbisch .
" This is a small plant eater that was not only able to get away from the predators by climbing into the trees , " Reisz said in an interview Tuesday , " but also to access an untapped food resource — that is , the leaves of the trees . "
Reisz and Fröbisch , who has since graduated to become a postdoctoral fellow at the Field Museum in Chicago , publish their findings in Wednesday 's issue of Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
Suminia lived 260 million years ago in the Late Paleozoic era , just before the Mesozoic era , dominated by the dinosaurs .
At the time , the Earth was an ice - free world with a single continent , and Suminia lived in the temperate and sub-tropical forests of its north — a climate similar to modern - day Florida — in what is now central Russia , Reisz said .
Not a reptile
Suminia 's opposable thumb was well adapted for climbing trees and may have allowed it to bring food to its mouth , Reisz said .
(( Christina Stoppa / Field Museum ) )
While Suminia may have looked lizard - like , he added , the anatomy of its skull and skeleton show that it actually was an ancestor of modern mammals , and not part of the evolutionary branch that led to reptiles and birds .
The first Suminia fossil was reported in the 1990s , and the description of its teeth — indicating it was a plant eater — caught Reisz 's eye .
He decided to do some more digging near where the fossil was found in Russia 's Kirov region , about 800 kilometres east of Moscow .
As part of the project , his research group trained local villagers and provided them with equipment to help in the excavation .
A little museum was even set up in the village .
The excavation yielded more than 20 Suminia skeletons .
" These large blocks came out with a whole slew of these little animals that basically died together , " Reisz said .
He added that the most exciting parts of the fossils were the hands .
" What really grabbed my attention was the first digit , the thumb - like structure .
It does look opposable , " he said , adding that Suminia was " obviously beautifully adapted to climb trees . "
It likely could also bring food to its mouth using its hands .
The researchers also found fossil dung indicating the animal ate plants .
Suminia 's thumb is n't built the same way as human opposable thumbs and those of other primates , which evolved separately , Reisz said .
Because Fröbisch is German , the research was funded by both the Canadian and German governments , as well as the National Geographic Society and the Field Museum .

3 year note auction | The Big Picture :
The 3 year note auction , the easiest of the big three this week because of its short maturity , was very good .
The yield was about in line with expectations but the bid to cover of 2.89 is well above the average this year of 2.52 and the highest since Nov ‘08 .
Indirect bidders totaled 62.5 % which is above the prior two which reflected the new methodology of calculation .
With many , particularly the Chinese , shifting to the shorter end of the curve from the longer end , today was an easy sale .
The tough part though comes tomorrow when the 10 yr benchmark note auction takes place with the 30 yr following on Thursday .
I must say that our country ’s finances are in such a state of affairs that the biggest economy in the world has to now cross its fingers right before the published results of debt auctions .
The standard Chicago " Ricardian equivalence " argument is that government deficits have no effect on nominal aggregate demand because private savings rise dollar - for - dollar with the government 's deficit .
The magnitude of the tax cuts associated with the stimulus package are running at about $ 25 billion per quarter -- an extremely small share of the rise in Treasury borrowings .
Otherwise , Chicago says , supply - and - demand are supposed to rule -- and a sharp increase in Treasury borrowings is supposed to carry a sharp increase in interest rates along with it to crowd out other forms of interest sensitive spending .
Has n't happened .
Has n't happened at all :
it is astonishing .
Between last summer and the end of this year the U.S.
Treasury will expand its marketable debt liabilities by $ 2.5 trillion -- an amount equal to more than 20 % of all equities in America , an amount equal to 8 % of all traded dollar - denominated securities .
And yet the market has swallowed it all without a burp ...

I only ever got to read a single issue of 2000 AD , and I understood the stories within it about as well as one can understand four different narratives halfway through their story arcs , without any prior knowledge of the characters or situations .
Other than that , though , I liked it .
I 'm somewhat bummed that I never got to read any Rogue Trooper strips , because then I might have something more profound or intelligent to say about this week 's forgotten game than " this is a pretty good but flawed game that should have received more attention than it did . "
... Still , this is a pretty good but flawed game that should have received more attention than it did .
Despite some crappy level design and less - than - enthralling graphics , Rogue Trooper is a remarkably solid 3rd - person shooter that simply came out too late for its own good .
Hit the jump for the lowdown on this underrated kinda - classic .
Story :
The titular Rogue Trooper is one of an army of genetically engineered clone troops , who are dropped onto a planet called Nu-Earth to fight the Nort army .
I guess they get betrayed by their own high command and Rogue has to kill the crap out of his former employers , or something .
The coolest thing about the story of Rogue Trooper -- arguably the only cool thing , based on what I got from the videogame -- is the fact that after Rogue 's friends get torn apart by gunfire , he plants their personality chips into his equipment so he can not only continue to talk to them , but use their respective talents to modify his existing weaponry .
After his fortunately - named friend Gunnar dies , Rogue can plop his main weapon down wherever he wants and it'll function like an automated turret .
Sort of like the Laptop Gun from Perfect Dark , but with a personality .
Gameplay :
Moreso than any game I 've played short of Mirror 's Edge , Rogue Trooper 's intrinsically satisfying mechanics are set against level design that seeks to undermine them at nearly every turn .
Rogue can switch between his regular machine gun , shotgun , and sniper rifle instantaneously , because they 're all a part of the same gun ; this can lead to some satisfyingly fast - paced fights where you 'll mow down a half - dozen dudes with rapid fire , then immediately press down on the right thumbstick to active sniper mode and finish off the last two .
When used in tandem , the weapons build a pace that would befit a game like Serious Sam or Smash TV : lots of enemies , lots of gunfire , no time to catch your breath and relax .
This makes it all the more disappointing that Rogue Trooper is a pretty standard 3rd- person shooter , otherwise .
You 'll rarely come across more than five or six enemies at one time , and you 'll be forced through linear levels with boring " activate this crane , then backtrack across the level and run across the bridge you just made with it " objectives .
Every once in a while , though , the level design will pick up -- just for a second -- and you 'll be blasting away at a large group of baddies with the reckless aplomb so befitting the Rogue Trooper 's arsenal .
Beyond moments such as that , Rogue Trooper actually dabbles in some light stealth and RPG elements , which surprisingly do n't detract from the overall experience .
You 're never outright forced to be stealthy , so every silent kill feels like a real accomplishment than an obligation .
You can buy more advanced weaponry by picking up the guns of dead soldiers , which contributes to a relatively satisfying feeling of power progression as the game wears on .
Overall , I 'd call Rogue Trooper a solid game .
I dunno why , but something about that adjective just feels appropriate : its base mechanics are wonderful , but the level design squanders them more often than not .
The act of playing the game through is a wholly satisfying one , but seldom mindblowing .
There 's a lot of potential here that I 'd love to see further explored in a sequel , but I highly doubt we 'll ever see one .
Why you 're probably not playing it :
Rogue Trooper sadly came out pretty late in the sixth console generation , just as our attentions were beginning to focus on the Next Big Thing that was the Xbox 360 .
Additionally , Rogue Trooper is n't exactly a blockbuster franchise .
The only other recent game to be based of a 2000 AD comic , Judge Dredd : Dredd vs. Death , sucked complete balls .
I doubt that had a huge impact on public perception of the Rogue Trooper game , but it certainly could n't have helped .
There was talk of a Wii port , but as of yet there 's been no new news regarding a North American release .
Either way , the game only costs 100 Goozex points regardless of which platform you want it on ( PS2 , Xbox , PC ) .
For that price , I 'd highly recommend checking it out .
Retailers Gamestop and Game Crazy have managed to maintain relevance despite facing a two front battle against increasing competition and a market gravitating towards digital downloads .
Bestbuy ’s latest strategy , however , could serve as the last nail in the coffin for both used - game giants .
The photo above , taken at a Bestbuy in West Jordan , Utah , reveals what seems to be Bestbuy ’s latest effort to dethrone Gamestop and Gamecrazy from their reign over the used game market .
Apparently , Bestbuy is currently testing an extension of their price matching policy which allows consumers to purchase new games at the same price Gamestop or Game Crazy sells them used .
Whether Bestbuy plans to expand this promotion to other regions is uncertain .
However , with profit margins on software estimated to be anywhere between $ 4 and $ 10 , we ca n’t help but wonder how much Bestbuy is willing to lose in their attempt to achieve a dominant position in the video game market .
Likewise , how much is Gamestop or Game Crazy willing to risk to maintain their piece of the pie ?

Abstract
This paper assesses the appropriate cigarette tax needed to address potential market failures .
There is no evidence of inadequate risk decisions by smokers regarding their own welfare .
Detailed calculations of the financial externalities of smoking indicate that the financial savings from premature mortality in terms of lower nursing home costs and retirement pensions exceed the higher medical care and life insurance costs generated .
The costs of environmental tobacco smoke are highly uncertain , but of potentially substantial magnitude .
Even with recognition of these costs , current cigarette taxes exceed the magnitude of the estimated net externalities .
NaCl is a new crypto library , courtesy of Dan Bernstein of qmail fame and Tanja Lange .
After my series of posts on why crypto libraries have seriously hurt web security by offering an API that is too low - level , I was pleased to find NaCl ’s main interface is high - level .
In addition to the kind of fanatical attention to security you can expect from DJB , it also has his unique ( some would say quirky ) viewpoint .
On a related note , I ’m sorry to say I have to withdraw my recommendation of Google Keyczar .
It has had another vulnerability announced , this time in the random source for the python library .
This is exactly the same attack against DSA I described previously .
I may reconsider this decision as it matures .
There ’s a lot Keyczar gets right .
Its high - level API and key management make a lot of sense .
Up until recently , there have n’t been many high - level libraries I could recommend .
Gutmann ’s cryptlib is probably the best one .
It has been around a while and is implemented in C with multiple language bindings .
It is covered by the Sleepycat license , so it works like the GPL or you can pay for closed - source use .
GPGME provides well - reviewed crypto with the simple PGP usage model .
However , it only offers a C API .
It also works by forking the command - line gpg underneath , something that may bother some developers .
It is covered by the LGPL license .
While cryptlib and GPGME have been around a while , I have not personally reviewed either of them and ca n’t vouch for their implementation security .
When I found the timing attack in Keyczar ’s HMAC verification , I took a brief look around .
It seemed ok overall , but I did not do a thorough review .
I was so glad to see another high - level library that I included Keyczar along with cryptlib and GPGME as a good alternative to implementing your own crypto in a recent talk .
I should have emphasized that while these libraries are taking the right approach , we need much more thorough reviews by cryptographers before standardizing on them .
Keyczar , as the newest library of those three , deserved a note that it especially needed review .
NaCl is the latest entry on the scene and it shows a lot of promise .
Take a moment to read its design features .
The code is public domain .
It offers a set of high - level functions such as :
Public - key authenticated encryption : establish a shared key with an authenticated partner , encrypt , and integrity - protect each message .
Analogy : the SSL protocol
Analogy : the SSL protocol Secret - key authenticated encryption : encryption and integrity protection for messages , using a pre-selected secret key .
Analogy : IPSEC with encryption and authentication using a pre-shared key
Analogy : IPSEC with encryption and authentication using a pre-shared key Secret - key authentication : integrity protection for a message using a pre-selected secret key
Analogy : HMAC - protected cookies
Analogy : HMAC - protected cookies
Other low - level primitives such as a stream cipher and hash .
There are some good things to be excited about here .
The design is extremely high - speed , although that is n’t my personal priority .
The high - level APIs are good but not perfect .
For example , the caller is expected to specify a nonce and set certain bytes to zero for crypto_box .
This is a little too much control for a high - level API .
It might be better if NaCl created its own nonce using its PRNG ( / dev/urandom , actually ) , and then focused on making sure it was seeded well .
The design and implementation security , as expected for DJB , is excellent .
( Note that I have not done a thorough review and thus can not yet recommend it . )
For example , he focuses on side channel resistance , creating a non-branching scalar multiplication routine and an API for comparing secrets that resists timing attacks .
Also , his design choice of using ECDH , a stream cipher , and a MAC algorithm to implement crypto_box fit together well .
However , that ’s where the quirkiness comes in .
As with qmail , DJB has a really unique way of doing things .
The default ECDH implementation uses Curve25519 , the stream cipher is Salsa20 , and the authenticator is Poly1305 .
All of these are primitives designed by DJB in the past four years .
If it was n’t DJB , you ’d think I was crazy to even consider a library that implements all new ciphers and constructions .
Even though I respect him and these may turn out to be good choices , four years is not enough time to review all of these to be certain they are sound .
This will limit NaCl ’s appeal until more standard ciphers are available .
While NaCl is a good start , here ’s what is missing before it can be more widely adopted :
Language bindings : NaCl is C - only for now and needs at least Java , python , and C# bindings
More standard crypto primitives : NIST P -256 or other curves , AES , and SHA2 - HMAC
Signature API : ability to do public - key signatures
Since all these items are marked TODO , it ’s clear that Dan recognizes the need for them as well .
Perhaps NaCl will mature into the library of choice in the future .
If you ’re a cryptographer and have a chance to review it , please publish your findings .
If you ’re a developer , how about contributing language bindings ?
On a side note , I ’m convinced that the right way to create a crypto library is to do a single implementation in C with architecture awareness ( e.g. , cache layout , some assembly language ) and then offer language bindings .
This is the route NaCl and cryptlib took .
It ’s nearly impossible to prevent side channel attacks when your crypto is implemented in a high - level language .

She went to college to boost her chances of finding a great job once she got out of school , but now that that has n't happened , Trina Thompson wants her money back .
Thompson , a graduate of Monroe College , is suing her school for the $ 70,000 she spent on tuition because she has n't found solid employment since receiving her bachelor 's degree in April , according to a published report .
The business - oriented school in the Bronx did n't do enough to help her find a job , Thompson alleges , so she wants a refund .
The college says it does plenty for grads .
The 27 - year - old information - technology student accuses the school 's Office of Career Advancement for not living up to its end of the deal and offering her the leads and employment advice it promised , according to The New York Post .
" They have not tried hard enough to help me , " the beleaguered Bronx resident wrote in her lawsuit , filed July 24 in Bronx Supreme Court .
Thompson 's mother is proud of her daughter for completing her college education , but acknowledges Trina is upset that all her high hopes have n't panned out .
The mother and daughter live together , but Trina 's mother , Carol , is a substitute teacher and the only one of the two who makes any money .
They 're barely scraping enough together to get by , reports the Post .
On top of her unemployment woes , Trina now faces mounting debt from student loans .
" This is not the way we want to live our life , " her mom told the paper .
" This is not what we planned . "
Monroe defends its career - advice programs and is adamant that its staff assists young professionals in their careers .
" The lawsuit is completely without merit , " school spokesman Gary Axelbank told the Post .
" The college prides itself on the excellent career - development support that we provide to each of our students , and this case does not deserve further consideration . "
On the school 's Web site , the career program boasts that it provides free services for graduates at any point in their lives .
It ’s probably selfish of me to be reasonably pleased that el Nino conditions have reappeared in the Pacific .
El Nino means real hardship for real people in Australia , Indonesia , and India , and some will lose their livelihoods and / or lives as a result of the droughts that come with el Nino .
Similarly , el Nino tends to produce more eastern Pacific hurricanes , stronger storms in the U.S. that could cause flooding and , as a result , the death of innocent people .
So on one hand , it ’s morbid of me to be happy for the return of el Nino .
On the other hand , complaining about el Nino is about like complaining about a volcano that erupts and destroys a village – it ’s sad that the village was destroyed , but the eruption is a great source of new data for vulcanologists around the world .
And it ’s not like humanity has control over the weather , so worrying about it , or feeling guilty about a little pleasure from it , is pretty much pointless .
So I ’m feeling a little selfishly happy about el Nino right now .
After all , it ’s like a shiny new toy with which climate activists get to beat up climate disruption deniers .
To explain my small joy , a little historical context is probably in order .
1998 was the hottest year on record because of an extraordinarily powerful el Nino that heated up the entire planet dramatically .
But because it was so hot , climate disruption deniers have been using it as the starting point from which they claim , wrongly , that “ the global temperature has been cooling for a decade now . ”
This false claim was strengthened by the lucky coincidence that 2008 turned out to be a la Nina year , when the global temperature dropped significantly .
Climate disruption deniers then took advantage of an unfortunate fact of least - squares linear trend estimates – they ’re VERY sensitive to endpoint variation , especially in short , noisy datasets .
And not only is global temperature noisy on a monthly and yearly basis , but ten years is a woefully short amount of data .
And do n’t even get me started on Joe D’Aleo ’s , Lord Monckton ’s , and Ross McKitrick ’s 5 - year “ trend ” from 2003 to 2008 which , conveniently enough , has another el Nino to la Nina transition .
So now , with a new el Nino heating up the summer and autumn global temperatures by some as - yet - unknown amount , climate disruption scientists and activists have their own convenient endpoints to the data .
1999 was a la Nina year , after all , and 2009 is an el Nino year , so any trend calculated from 1999 to 2009 will be huge , given that global temperatures for July through December are significantly warmer on average than January through June .
It ’s not outside the realm of possibility that 2009 could be warm enough to turn the supposed “ cooling trend ” into a “ warming trend ” all by itself .
And that ’s the first reason I ’m happy about a new el Nino .
Of course , we ’re talking weather here , not climate , and the exact same statistical tools that I and others use to debunk the bogus cooling trends touted by deniers could be used against any climate scientist who touts a hot 2009 .
But that brings me to the second reason I ’m happy about el Nino – I ’m actually looking forward to climate disruption deniers screaming “ a hot year in 2009 is only weather , the cooling trend since 1998 is a real trend ! ”
Because in return , I get to call the denier a hypocrite .
Math is math , after all .
If the data statistics says that there ’s too much noise in the data to extract a meaningful trend from 1998 to 2008 , the the same will almost certainly be true from 1999 to 2009 .
And as a result , any denier who looks at the 99-09 trend and says “ that ’s just weather , not climate ” or “ the trend has endpoint problems that make it inaccurate ” or even “ you cherry - picked your endpoints ” will immediately be revealed as a liar and a hypocrite .
Of course , any climate scientist who actually does tout the 1999 to 2009 “ warming trend ” but who complained about the 1998 - 2008 “ cooling trend ” would also be revealed as a hypocrite .
[ I checked the trends using HadCRU3v data , and these are the results for 1998 - 2008 vs. 1999 - 2009 , if the average for the first half of 2009 ends up the annual average temperature .
2008 to 1998 was a trend of - 0.017 deg/dec with an autocorrelation adjusted standard error of 0.189 .
This means that there ’s 10 x more noise than signal , and so the trend could be anywhere between +0.172 and - 0.206 deg / decade .
The 1999 -2009 ( to date ) trend is about 0.043 deg/ decade with an autocorrelation adjusted standard error of 0.099 .
This means that there is only 2 x more noise than signal for 1999 - 2009 , and the real trend range could be anywhere between +0.142 and - 0.056 deg / decade .
There ’s still more noise than signal , though , so no firm conclusions can be drawn about the trend from such a short period / limited sample size . ]
So I ’m happy about el Nino this year .
I ’d have been happier if it had come on strong earlier , so that the news could have had horror stories of droughts just in time to scare the House into voting on a much stronger Waxman - Markey bill than what actually passed , but better late than never .
At least el Nino arrived before the Senate got going on a climate bill .
Maybe el Nino can do what an army of environmentalists and climate scientists could n’t – convince the Congress to serioulsy address climate disruption instead of playing politics .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Some of the biggest U.S. investors and two former top securities regulators warned that a “ tarnished ” Federal Reserve should not be put in charge of preventing systemic risk in the financial system , a central plank of the administration ’s response to the credit crisis .
The Investors ’ Working Group , representing some big money manager firms and led by former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairmen William Donaldson and Arthur Levitt , said on Wednesday the United States should instead create an independent body to serve as watchdog of risk management across the financial sector .
The body proposed by the investors -- the Systemic Risk Oversight Board , or SROB -- would have full - time staff and independent of government agencies and financial institutions .
The SROB would appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate , and would be accountable to Congress .
The Investors ’ Working Group said the United States should consider limiting banks ’ proprietary trading , regulating derivatives more , boosting capital requirements , subjecting insurers to federal supervision , and forcing credit rating agencies to submit to more “ meaningful ” oversight .
While calling reforms proposed June 17 by President Barack Obama “ a start , ” the group said “ bolder ” measures are needed to extricate markets from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
It rejected as “ disastrous ” the idea that agencies should use a “ light touch ” in policing markets .
“ The lack of sufficient authority , resources and will on the part of regulators helped fuel the financial meltdown at least as much as the absence of systemic risk oversight , ” the report said .
The Fed ’s “ credibility has been tarnished by the easy credit policies it pursued and the lax regulatory oversight that let institutions ratchet higher their balance sheet leverage and amass huge concentrations of risky , complex securitized products , ” it added .
Since September , the government has bailed out several companies , some more than once , including American International Group Inc AIG.N , Bank of America Corp BAC.N , Citigroup Inc C.N , mortgage financiers Fannie Mae FNM.P and Freddie Mac FRE.P and General Motors Corp MTLQQ .PK .
The investor group said creating a systemic risk oversight board is a short - term solution , although the board could later evolve into a full - fledged regulator .
It said the administration ’s proposal to give the Fed more oversight of systemically important companies has “ serious drawbacks ” because the central bank already has “ competing responsibilities ” to oversee monetary policy and manage the U.S. payments system .
The group also faulted a proposal by some lawmakers to create a council of regulators , citing the potential for jurisdictional disputes and “ blurred lines of authority ” where ultimately no one would be held accountable .
Obama ’s plan also envisions the creation of a consumer finance protection agency , which is generating strong opposition from banks .
The report was sponsored by the CFA Institute Center for Financial Market Integrity and the Council of Institutional Investors .
Among the investor group 's members are Brooksley Born , a former chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ; Harvey Goldschmid , a former SEC commissioner ; Bill Miller , chief investment officer of Legg Mason Capital Management Inc LM.N and personal finance columnist Jane Bryant Quinn .

Armour is not enough for these ground crickets
Armoured crickets have a bizarre and striking way to avoid being eaten .
To become unpalatable , the insects squirt toxic blood out of gaps in their body and make themselves sick by throwing up food they 've just eaten .
A few insect species including beetles and katydids actively bleed when attacked , but the benefits of taking such extreme measures were not clear .
Now scientists have shown the tactic really does work to deter predators such as lizards .
Armoured ground crickets ( Acanthoplus discoidalis ) are fat , flightless insects that live in the African bush across Namibia , Botswana and South Africa .
They are relatively large , growing up to 5 cm long , have sharp spines across their thorax and legs and a pair of strong biting jaws .
Males are also able to make a harsh loud noise by rubbing body parts together in a behaviour called stridulation .
The blood is pale green and rather acrid smelling
Entomologist Bill Bateman
Each feature adds to an arsenal of defence mechanisms that the insects use to avoid being eaten by predators .
However , the crickets also use two highly unusual and quite bizarre tricks to stymie any attack .
Firstly , the crickets regurgitate through their mouths food they have just eaten .
They also squirt blood , which in insects is called haemolymph , from gaps in their exoskeleton on their backs and under their legs .
Blood squirting A number of insects , including blister beetles , stonefly larvae and bushhoppers behave in similar way when attacked .
One katydid is so renowned for this tactic that in German it is called a ' blutspritzer ' , or ' blood squirter ' .
But while this bizarre behaviour is well known , its effectiveness has never before been tested .
" When I was moving them to larger quarters I was thinking about how they would grip a branch and when I pulled I would inevitably feel the squirt of the blood jetting out from under their legs , " entomologist Bill Bateman of the University of Pretoria in South Africa told the BBC .
" This is a recognised defence mechanism and has been mentioned in other invertebrates , but no one had published on what exactly makes them do it or whether it actually is effective against predators . "
So Bateman and colleague Trish Fleming of Murdoch University in Western Australia tested the defensive abilities of the armoured ground crickets .
First he mimicked attacks by predators by grabbing the insects from the side or above with tweezers .
The crickets responded differently depending on the mode of attack .
When attacked from the side , the crickets stridulated and tried to bite their attacker .
About two - thirds of the time , they also squirted out acrid -smelling haemolymph from seams in the connective tissue of their legs and from just behind the head .
Attacked from above , a direction in which they could not bite , the crickets oozed toxic blood almost nine times out of ten , Bateman reports in the Journal of Zoology , the journal of the Zoological Society of London .
Sometimes the crickets squirted their own blood up to 6 cm .
Green and acrid " The blood is pale green and rather acrid smelling .
I could n't bring myself to actually taste it fresh but it leaves an acidy , tobacco - like taste on your fingers if you do not wash it off , " he says .
He then further tested how the crickets responded to both bearded dragon lizards ( Pogona vitticeps ) and striped skinks ( Trachylepis punctatissima ) .
When he placed a male cricket in a cage with four bearded dragons , one lizard immediately tried to eat the insect .
Instantly it autohaemorrhaged , forcing the lizard to drop it and retire to wipe clean its jaws .
A second lizard seized it for the same to happen .
A third lizard approached the insect but refused to attack it .
Bateman also tested the power of the haemolymph and regurgitated food , by painting another smaller species of cricket in either substance , and then seeing if striped skinks would eat them .
While the lizards ate all of 24 clean crickets , they often refused to eat those covered in haemolymph , and occasionally those covered in regurgitate .
" What impressed me is that they control the release depending on how they are grabbed , " says Bateman , describing the actions of the armoured ground cricket .
" If it 's from above the blood wells out and coats your hand .
If grabbed by forceps from the side , by a leg , they lean towards it and crouch down , then there is a slight cracking sound and the blood jets right along the line of attack . "
" Any predator would get a faceful , and our experiments indicated that lizards do not like it all . "
Bateman say he was surprised by how sophisticated the crickets ' defence responses are .
For example , they target their blood squirting according to the angle of attack , while females , which do not stridulate , rely on squirting and biting and vomiting up food they 've eaten more than males .
Cannibal crickets
This blood and guts defence has one downside however .
Ground crickets often swarm in search of new sources of food including protein and salt .
But one of the best sources of both is other crickets , and if given the chance ground crickets become cannibals , feasting on each other .
" When the swarms in the African bush meet a road , lots get squashed and the others gather for a feast , so more get squashed until there can be a thick , acrid pancake of dead and moribund crickets on the roadside , bleeding and attracting more cannibals , " says Bateman .
That means that any crickets with haemolymph on their bodies attract the attention of other cannibalistic crickets that assume it is injured .
" Crickets that I induced to squirt blood would assiduously clean any droplets off their limbs when put back in the colony , presumably to avoid cannibalism , " Bateman explains .
" I saw other crickets approach a bloody one and begin nipping at it .
If intact , the bloody one usually runs off . "

Hope you liked it :)
Let 's start off with the raw materials , i got these images from stock.xchng which offers free stock images .
1 . Create a New File , with the Concrete image as your background and the Splatter effect on top of it .
Change the blending mode of the Splatter layer to Darken ( highlighted below ) and change the Hue / Saturation ( Ctrl+U ) , see settings below .
2 . Go to Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Gradient Map , click OK ( Step 1 on the image below ) and Select the Black , White gradient ( Step 2 ) , click OK then make sure the Blending Mode is set to Multiply .
( This layer should be on top of the Splatter Layer ) .
3 . Create a new Layer ( Ctrl + Shft+N ) , select the Gradient Tool ( G ) and following the settings highlighted below .
Click on the center then drag the pointer to get the effect below .
Set the Blending option of this Layer to Overlay .
4 . Create another Layer , and Select the Brush tool and choose the Rough Round Brush Tool , lower the opacity , you may follow the settings below .
Paint on the Layer randomly , particularly on the sides .
Men tend to want the woman they see in front of them , while women want the man other women see :
Are women more interested in men who are already in a relationship ?
Female and male participants who were single or in a relationship viewed information about an opposite - sex other and indicated their interest in pursuing this target .
Half of the participants were told that the target was single and half read that the target was currently in a relationship .
The results showed that only single women were more interested in pursuing an attached target rather than a single target . …
According to a recent poll , most women who engage in mate poaching do not think the attached status of the target played a role in their poaching decision , but our study shows this belief to be false . …
Across ten world regions , 57 % of men and 35 % of women indicated they had engaged in an attempt at mate poaching , … people who mate poach are more likely to be low in agreeableness and conscientiousness than those who do not . ….
Research on animal mating ( e.g. , ﬁsh , birds ) has shown that female animals are more likely to choose a male that has already been chosen by other females …
Research on human preferences does show that women rate men as more desirable when they are surrounded by other women , compared to being alone or surrounded by other men .
Conversely , men rate women as less desirable when they are surrounded by other men , compared to being alone or surrounded by other women .
Yet another way in which we do n’t know why we do what we do .

Today is the 10th annual System Administrator Appreciation Day , a special event that encourages everyone to thank your SysAdmins for all the long hours spent on the front line of technology battles , preventing and / or cleaning up our computer messes .
They deserve a little love , at least one day of the year .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .

While you are contemplating what gift you can give today — here are a few suggestions for proper use SysAdmin ’s time — we pause to give thanks for their contributions to parenting , as well .
Taking a cue from Iowa State University ’s best practices for system administration , here are five strategies employed by System Administrators that can make us better parents .
Have a Backup Plan
Losing files is always a drag , but even the best of Geeks might get a bit sloppy when it comes to implementing an effective backup strategy .
Enter the SysAdmin , who is often responsible for maintaining daily copies of data files for everyone in an organization .
They do this by coming up with a plan , routinely evaluating it , and training operators to help support it .
Data has to be prioritized — you ca n’t just beam everything to another storage media at once .
SysAdmins also plan for worst - case scenarios and practice disaster recovery .
As parents , we can take similar precautions for small but surprisingly challenging activities , like going to a restaurant to eat .
We take a Felix “ bag of tricks ” to help distract kids who suddenly have no concept of an inside voice or insist on asking the neighboring table for some of their french fries .
Preparing for breakdowns may be a easy as remembering to pack some pencils and paper , or a favorite book .
Children who struggle in transition may also need to review what is coming to avoid making surprises unpleasant .
Talking through possible scenarios in advance arms kids with choices , helping them make good decisions in the future moment .
Learn About Your System
A good SysAdmin will keep up - to - date on the servers and software that person must maintain .
Reading security bulletins and understanding relevant issues with a particular configuration can help Administors adjust what they are looking for when keeping tabs on the network .
Similarly , parents can help themselves by reading the academic and popular literature on raising children .
Online forums and offline support groups are also good sources of information about what to expect as your children develop .
While there is no operator ’s manual for babies , there is no shortage of other people who have gone or are currently going through the same kinds of struggles you are .
Define Critical Hosts
Critical hosts are the machines in a network that could most harm an organization , if compromised .
The damage could range from injuring reputation , interrupting tasks , or the disclosure of confidential information .
There could be legal issues that arise from failure with a critical host , so SysAdmins have to be aware of which information flowing through the organization is the most important to protect .
Psychologist Ross Greene explains criticality in parenting in terms of three strategies , or plans , we invoke to address challenging behavior .
Plan A makes your expectations the top priority , at the sacrifice of understanding the problem ( my way , or the highway ) .
Plan C is where you drop expectations completely , if only temporarily .
There is no teaching here , and you wo n’t solve any problems , but it might allow you to deal with higher priority issues .
In between is Plan B , or collaborative problem solving , where the parent and child work together to understand what is behind challenging behavior .
Understanding when a child ’s behavior fails to rise to the level of Plan A can help increase the teachable moments .
Configure Only Essential Services
Although this can sometimes be a headache for the technologically - savvy user who just wants the latest freakin’ upgrade to critical software ( breathe , Kevin ) , closing TCP / UDP ports and taking a deny - then - allow approach to permissions is a sound strategy for secure system administration .
Turn on only the essential components and necessary services , and deal with the outliers individually .
The same proactive restraint can help relationships with some children , too .
Mary Sheedy Kurcinka wrote a great book about raising spirited children .
Often labeled as “ difficult ” or “ strong - willed , ” spirited children exhibit traits we value in adults , but try to suppress in youth .
These kids are hard - wired to be more intense , sensitive , perceptive , and adverse to change than the average child .
As a result , “ more ” may be the kid equivalent of spiking your processors or suffering a DoS attack .
Things do n’t operate as well under those conditions and struggle to regain a productive level .
The parenting equivalent of “ essential services ” is to give kids only what they can handle and avoid overloading them with things they can’t .
Monitor Your System
Finally , a good SysAdmin — and ( at least today ) , are n’t they all good ? — devotes some time toward periodically reading log files and scanning system metrics .
To an untrained eye , there is a lot of detail that appears overwhelming , but regular monitoring of the system footprint will give an Administrator some insight to quickly notice when something is amiss .
Parents used to keep scrapbooks , write letters , and keep diaries .
Today , the digital equivalent is storing a copious number of documents in applications like iPhoto , WordPress , and YouTube .
One of Twitter ’s unrealized values is likely to be the long - term record of the detail of one ’s life .
Since that life includes the children , parents can use social media tools to facilitate reflection on their interactions with kids .
Even better , use these records as a catalyst for family time by encouraging kids to contribute to the family footprint , and by periodically remembering together how those moments may be different than where you are now .
The artifacts of the past can help inform the future .
Now , go hug the kid or SysAdmin of your choice .

[ The Case Against the Fed • By Murray N. Rothbard • Ludwig von Mises Institute , 1994 • 158 pages ]
" If Rothbard is correct , the entire basis of modern deposit banking , the fractional - reserve system , is a type of counterfeiting that must be abolished . "
Murray Rothbard begins this outstanding book by calling attention to a paradox .
The Federal Reserve System enjoys virtual immunity from congressional investigation .
The few who propose to subject the Fed to even minimal scrutiny , such as Henry Gonzales of Texas , at once find a consensus arrayed against them ( pp. 1 ff . ) .
They threaten the stability of the market , since – it is alleged – only the Fed 's independence blocks the onset of uncontrollable inflation .
Here lies the paradox .
Inflation results from the infusion of new money into the economy , and it is the Fed that is responsible for its creation .
" The culprit solely responsible for inflation , the Federal Reserve , is continually engaged in raising a hue - and - cry about ' inflation ' for which virtually everyone else in society seems to be responsible " ( p. 11 ) .
How did this odd situation come about ?
As one would expect from a top - flight economist , Rothbard responds by tracing the problem to its roots .
He briefly and clearly explains how money originated in a barter economy .
Some commodities are much easier to market than others , and " [ o ] nce any particular commodity starts to be used as a medium , this very process has a spiraling or snowballing effect " ( p. 13 ) .
Soon , one or two commodities emerge into general use as a medium of exchange .
And this , precisely , is money .
Gold and silver have almost always been the commodities that win the competition for marketability .
" Accordingly , every modern currency unit originated as a unit of weight of gold or silver " ( p. 17 ) .
Why has Rothbard gone to such pains to describe a historical process that seems very remote from the Fed ?
By beginning with a simple case , he can elucidate the basic mechanism that underlies the Fed 's operation .
To explain a complex event by starting with a simple method and gradually complicating it is a basic procedure of modern science .
Galileo termed this " resoluto - compositive " method , and Descartes described it at length .
Once one grasps how money has emerged , the key to understanding the mysteries of the Fed lies at hand .
We already can answer the following question ; what is the optimum quantity of money ?
If one has understood the explanation of money 's genesis , the answer is apparent .
An increase in the supply of money does not increase real wealth , since money is used only in exchange .
( The exception owing to nonmonetary uses of gold and silver can , for our purposes , be ignored . )
" Any quantity of money in society is ' optimal ' " ( p. 20 ) .
And , to add one complication , the answer remains the same when paper money has been introduced .
A problem now arises for the analysis so far presented .
If an increase in the supply of money does not increase real wealth , why have governments continually resorted to inflation ?
Rothbard 's response involves another fundamental insight of Austrian economics .
Inflation does not affect everyone equally ; quite the contrary , those who first obtain new money gain a great advantage , since they can purchase goods and services before most people become aware that the purchasing power of money has fallen .
Inflation is thus a form of counterfeiting ( pp. 27–9 ) .
But it is not the only form ; another type of counterfeiting arose out of deposit banking .
Because of the inconvenience of carrying gold and silver , people often deposited the metals in banks , obtaining in return a receipt .
These receipts , since they are promises to pay gold or silver , soon began to circulate as money substitutes .
However , a temptation presented itself to the bankers .
The receipts normally did not specify particular gold or silver coins to be returned to the depositor ; they were , rather , entitlements to specified amounts of the money commodity .
( Rothbard notes that the great nineteenth - century economist W. S. Jevons warned against these " general deposit warrants " [ p. 37 ] ) .
Since they need only return the amount of money specified in the receipt , bankers might give out more receipts than they had gold or silver on hand , trusting that not all depositors would demand redemption at the same time .
For those willing to assume this risk , the prospect of vast profits called appealingly .
But is not this practice a blatant instance of fraud ?
So it would appear , and so Rothbard firmly avers that it is .
Unfortunately , several nineteenth century British legal decisions held otherwise , and these verdicts were adopted by the American courts as well .
Rothbard describes the legal situation with the sure hand of a master historian ( pp. 42–4 ) .
Our banker - counterfeiter , one might assume , can now proceed happily on his way to illicit fortune .
But an obstacle confronts him ; should he issue more receipts than he can redeem , the clients of other banks may ruin him through demands for payment that he can not make good .
The solution is obvious ; by unifying the banks in a centralized system , this check to fraudulent wealth creation would be ended .
Hence the movement for a central banking system , whose history in Britain and the United States Rothbard deftly summarizes .
The Federal Reserve System , as Rothbard makes crystal clear , was the culmination of efforts that continued throughout the nineteenth century to centralize banking .
By the 1890s , the leading Wall Street bankers were becoming disgruntled with their own creation , the National Banking System … while the banking system was partially centralized under their leadership , it was not centralized enough .
( p. 79 )
As he describes the movement to cartelize banking , Rothbard introduces a dominant theme in his interpretation of twentieth - century American history : the struggle of competing groups of bankers for power .
From the 1890s until World War II , much of American political history … can be interpreted not so much as ' Democrat ' versus ' Republican ' but as the interaction or conflict between the Morgans and their allies on the one hand , and the Rockefeller - Harriman - Kuhn , Loeb alliance on the other .
( p. 92 )
In the agitation to establish the Fed , the House of Morgan was in the ascendant ; and Rothbard stresses the importance of the conference – under Morgan control – held at Jekyll Island , Georgia , in November 1910 ( pp. 114ff ) .
The entire section of the book ( pp. 79 –118 ) that deals with the origin of the Fed shows Rothbard 's incredibly detailed historical knowledge .
Though he was too modest to do so , he could had he wished have echoed the boast of Fustel de Coulanges : " It is not I who speak , but history who speaks through me . "
Rothbard brings the historical section of the book to a close with a discussion of the Fed 's early years in which the governor of the New York Fed , Benjamin Strong , guaranteed Morgan control ( pp. 124–9 ) .
Only with the coming of the New Deal were the Morgan interests relegated to a lesser role , as the Rockefellers assumed leadership of the Eastern Establishment .
Rothbard draws attention to the research of Thomas Ferguson , who has interpreted the New Deal as an anti-Morgan coup ( p. 131n40 ) .
" Philosophers have only interpreted the world ; the point however is to change it . "
For once , Rothbard agreed with his ideological antipodes , Karl Marx ; and the present work is not only an academic study but a plan for action .
And the plan in question is a radical one .
If Rothbard is correct , the entire basis of modern deposit banking , the fractional - reserve system , is a type of counterfeiting that must be abolished .
Under present arrangements , " the Fed has the well - nigh absolute power to determine the money supply if it so wishes " ( p. 144 ) .
In response , the Federal Reserve System must be liquidated and the gold standard restored " at one stroke " ( p. 146 ) .
Again and again , the reader will be struck by the way in which Rothbard 's grasp of fundamental economic principles enables him to overturn conventional thinking .
A brilliant example of this is his unmasking of the fallacy involved in deposit insurance ( pp. 134–7 ) .
Wittgenstein says in his Tractatus , " Whatever can be said , can be said clearly , " but few have been able to live up to his exacting dictum .
Murray Rothbard 's writing always displayed the clarity of a first - rate mind .
Those who wish to see this mind in action , as well as learn from someone in total control of the literature of American economic history , should immediately secure a copy of The Case Against the Fed .
Shocking Facts About American High Schools
25 Shocking Facts About American High Schools
Parents of teens understand being kept in the dark as their teens begin to strive for more independence from their parents .
While this may be a natural part of growing up , it does n’t mean that parents should be in the dark about their children ’s schools .
It may surprise you to learn about the educational statistics , condition of the school buildings , teacher salaries , and even the safety of teens at Americans high schools .
Education
From funding issues to under - educating students to innovative ways to reach at - risk students , the following facts all revolve around high school education .
Teen Safety
From date rape to firearms at school to bullying , read about these facts surrounding teen safety .
A presenter for a NSW community radio station that specialises in multicultural programming has been reprimanded after she was revealed to be an administrator of several racist , anti-immigration groups on Facebook .
Terrie - Anne Verney , a presenter and sales representative for Griffith FM radio station 2MIA , was the administrator of the group " F--- Off , We 're Full " and had also joined several Facebook groups including " Stop the Islamisation of Australia while we still can " , " Australian Conservative United Party " , the " Australian Protectionist Party " and " Australians against Multiculturalism " .
Terrie - Anne Verney .
In posts on the site she ridiculed foreigners who did not have a good grasp of English , claimed the Islamic faith was destroying the Australian way of life and said that attacked Indian students should go back home to study .
She also wrote that groups of immigrants tended to develop a " mob mentality " , claimed KKK members she knew were " intelligent " and that she did not want immigrants who did not speak English or assimilate into " the Australian life " to be allowed into the country .
I hope Harry Reid and Max Baucus saw this , from President Obama 's AARP townhall today :
And the other thing that we do want to do — now , this is controversial , and I understand some people are worried about this — we do think that it makes sense to have a public option alongside the private option .
So you could still choose a private insurer , but we ’d also have a public plan that you could choose from that would be non -for - profit , would n’t have , hopefully , some of the same high administrative costs , and would be potentially more responsive to your needs at a lower cost .
I think that helps keep the insurance companies honest because now they have somebody to compete with .
And I have to say , the reason this has been controversial is a lot of people have heard this phrase " socialized medicine " and they say , we do n’t want government - run health care ; we do n’t want a Canadian - style plan .
Nobody is talking about that .
We ’re saying , let ’s give you a choice .
You can choose the private marketplace , or this other approach .
And I got a letter the other day from a woman ; she said , I do n’t want government - run health care , I do n’t want socialized medicine , and do n’t touch my Medicare .
( Laughter . )
And I wanted to say , well , I mean , that ’s what Medicare is , is it ’s a government - run health care plan that people are very happy with .
But I think that we ’ve been so accustomed to hearing those phrases that sometimes we ca n’t sort out the myth from the reality .
God is not your bitch /
This just in :
It is hugely unlikely God cares much about your sex life
-- Associated Press
You know what God loves ?
Meddling .
Meddling and poking and adjusting and maybe , just maybe , forgiving .
Sometimes .
OK wait .
What God really loves is meddling and poking and maybe forgiving , and also psychoanalyzing and scrutinizing and prying , gossiping and complaining and moderating , sighing and punishing and condemning , all while He shakes
His big , shaggy head in your general direction at your various petty sins and misbehaviors every single day regarding pretty much every single thought you have .
Did you know this about God ?
Of course you did .
After all , if much of organized religion and nearly every conservative / fundamentalist adherent thereof are to be believed -- and they most definitely are not --
God is essentially the most obsessed , niggling micromanager of all time .
He is all about being hugely , nay downright obscenely interested in the trivial minutiae of modern life , from the food eaten on a particular day to the touchdown made during the Big Game to the brand of TV you watch it on , right on over to what book you 're reading and where you live and if you have the right guns and foreign policy and facial hair , and of course whether or not you judge gay people and demean women and nonbelievers in just the right way .
Because only then , when all preposterous criteria are met , might God absolve you , or lead you toward happiness , or grant success to your new laundromat , or forgive you your trespasses and your recreational drug use and your pornographic thoughts about your massage therapist , or even how many soft , cooing sounds you made over the body of a sexy Argenitine female .
Is n't that right , Gov. Sanford ?
Let us ponder .
Because once again and for the billionth time , a deeply sad and hypocritical conservative is now claiming that he will be turning to God not merely for forgiveness for his lusty irresponsibilities , but he is also claiming that , in order to set things right , God will now be actively stepping into his life to help put him back on track , fix his mangled moral compass , tell him the what - what and the do n't - stick - that - there .
Is n't that terrific ?
Is n't it wondrous to hear that God cares so much , so specifically , for Gov. Mark Sanford ?
Is it not heartening to hear that God will now happily jump into the rather wretched role of Sanford 's own personal therapist , helping the wayward governor bury his heart and nix his one true love so he may return to his unhappy marriage and unhappy job and unhappy life ?
Yay God !
So good of Him to take the time .
I , for one , am utterly delighted at how Sanford has effortlessly reduced the grand concept of timeless , universal divine metaconsciousness down to a bit of a tool , essentially making God his own personal knave .
What a fantastic conceit !
What glorious gall !
We should all try that someday .
In fact , most major religions encourage exactly that .
I find I am in a constant swoon of giddy amazement at this universal phenomenon , the fabulous , hubris - loaded idea that God is not actually an unfathomable river of cosmic energy to be supped from like liquid light , while you still take complete responsibility for your own life and choices .
Nor is God simply the idea of universal love and compassion , coursing through all things at all times everywhere .
How silly to think .
No , God is , apparently , actually far more like some sort of heavyset , hectoring grandmother who reads your email and pokes through your underwear drawer and hates your girlfriend and is , for the most part , very , very disappointed in you .
Great !
Really , it almost does not matter in which God you believe , what sect or major denomination .
Nearly all are of the same idea , offer up the same unquestionable truth :
Of course God cares what you do , who you screw , upon which sliver of dust - choked holy land you live , how high you raise your flag and which statue you kneel before .
This is the greatest wonder of all :
In the impossible vastness of time and space , God cares most desperately , most fanatically about this particular swirling blue dot of inconsequential dust we call home .
Hey , we invented God , right ?
We can do with Him whatever we want .
Now , you may say , if you have some broader understanding of matters religious and spiritual , that the point is not that God is literally a human - like micromanager -- which is , obviously , a rather childish anthropomorphization of an abstract theological construct .
Most Jews , for example , do not try to observe 10,000 impossible , arcane regulations and proscriptions and kosher Coca - Cola because they actually believe God will be furious if they go for the ham on rye on a Friday .
Rather , you can say most religious rules and rituals merely exist to reinforce commitment and membership in a given club , to give your ego some sort of reliable identity and shape , to bind the believer more devoutly to a given faith -- and sometimes , if you 're lucky , deliver a lovely means to personal transformation .
It 's easy to say that what most God - is - watching - you beliefs and behaviors do best is solidify our allegiance to whatever tribe we believe gives us our identity .
It 's all merely a series of elaborate , profoundly felt secret handshakes .
God could not really care less .
Put another way , the notion that this eternal divine consciousness , this grand and unquenchable , vibrating pulse of existence spanning all spheres and organisms and dimensions for all time everywhere , gives a flying communion wafer over the fact that you , say , enjoy sodomy on Sunday mornings ?
Well , that 's just all sorts of hilarious , dangerous reductivism .
It is and has always been , throughout history , the most glorious conceit of man .
No matter .
We do it anyway .
Mark Sanford and his ilk will never cease in reducing divine consciousness into such shallow and sad dimensions , to serve their particular needs and egos and power struggles .
Which is , perhaps , the greatest human tragedy of all .
Because really , we do the divine no favors by making it our bitch .
We only keep God in this little box , taking him out when it suits us , our political goals or our need for redemption and meaning , and to assuage our ego 's trembling fears .
You know , like a psychotherapist .
Like a crutch .
Like an excuse .
Like a vibrator .
Like milk .
Like a gemstone .
Like a flowerpot .
Like a drug .
Like a gun .

Wind farm
Aggressive investments in 2008 helped the United States surpass Germany to become the world ’s leader in wind power , according to a report recently released by the U.S. Department of Energy .
And for the fourth consecutive year , the United States is home to the fastest - growing wind power market in the world .
Wind power capacity increased by 60 percent , or 8,558 megawatts , in 2008 , representing $ 16.4 billion in federal and private investments in new wind projects .
Total U.S. wind capacity at the end of 2008 was 25,369 megawatts , compared with 23,933 for Germany , the Energy Department said .
That raised to nearly $ 45 billion the total wind power investment in the United States since the 1980s .
One megawatt of electricity generally is enough to power 750 to 1,000 homes .
Wind now delivers nearly 2 percent of the nation ’s electricity supply .
“ Wind energy will be a critical factor in achieving the president ’s goals for clean energy , while supporting news jobs , ” Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a statement with the report .
“ While the United States leads the world in wind energy capacity , we have to continue to support research and development as we expand renewable energy deployment . ”
The report , prepared by Ryan Wiser and Mark Bolinger of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , provides an overview of trends in the U.S. wind power market in 2008 .
While the $ 16.4 billion figure is impressive — total investment in wind was about $ 9 billion in 2007 and about $ 4 billion in 2006 — investments are expected to drop this year , Bolinger said in an interview .
“ The economic situation that is causing trouble elsewhere in other industries is also impacting the wind industry , ” he said .
Among the report ’s findings :
• Wind projects accounted for 42 percent of all new electric generating capacity in the United States last year .
• Growth is distributed across much of the country .
Texas leads the nation with 7,118 megawatts of new wind capacity installed , followed by Iowa ( 2,791 megawatts ) and California ( 2,517 megawatts ) .
For a long time , California led the United States in installed wind capacity .
“ It ’s easier to build wind in Texas because the regulatory and permitting process is not as onerous as it is in California , ” Bolinger said .
He noted that Texas also benefits from more widespread wind development , while California has essentially three or four concentrated areas where wind resources are strong .
• Market growth is spurring manufacturing investments in the United States .
Several major foreign wind turbine manufacturers either opened or announced new U.S. wind turbine manufacturing plants last year .
Likewise , new and existing U.S. - based manufacturers either initiated or scaled up production .
The American Wind Energy Association estimates that roughly 8,400 new domestic manufacturing jobs were added in the wind sector in 2008 alone .

BEN NELSON DOESN’T CARE FOR CRITICISM ….
A couple of weeks ago , Sen. Ben Nelson ( D ) of Nebraska and a handful of centrist and center - right allies insisted that the Senate not vote on health care reform before the chamber ’s August recess .
Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee ( PCCC ) took out an ad in Nebraska criticizing Nelson ’s move .
Yesterday , the senator ’s office suggested the criticism might lead Nelson to help kill health care reform altogether .
Senator Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) lashed out Friday at the ads being run against his position on health care reform in his home state , saying they would backfire — and might even derail the entire reform process .
In a statement issued late in the afternoon by Nelson ’s office , spokesman Jake Thompson warned that if the new series of ads calling out the Senator ’s “ stalling ” on reform were “ an indication of the politics going into August , then health care reform may be dead by the end of August . ”
“ Nebraskans do n’t need outside special interest groups telling them what to think .
Senator Nelson has nothing but praise for Nebraska groups working toward health care reform .
Unfortunately , he says , these outside groups undermine the sincere and dedicated efforts of people in our state , ” Thompson wrote .
“ Recently , similar ads have run in Nebraska .
Those ads by other special interests prompted hundreds of Nebraskans to call our offices , with 9 to 1 urging Senator Nelson to do exactly the opposite of what the special interest group wanted .
In short , the ads backfired . ”
Now , it ’s true that DFA and the PCCC are not Nebraska organizations , but it ’s worth remembering that the groups ’ ad features a small businessman , who owns a shop in Ralston , Neb. , who supports reform and opposes the delays Nelson has demanded .
The ad is not “ outside special interest groups telling them what to think ” ; it ’s one voice — that of a Nebraska shop owner — urging his senator to do the right thing .
Nelson is up for re-election next year , and it ’s not surprising that he ’d like to avoid any and all criticism .
But threatening to kill health care reform because a couple of groups are running a television ad he does n’t like seems rather petty .
People are allowed to express their political opinions , even if they ’re critical of Ben Nelson .
The ad does n’t make any false claims ; it does n’t include any personal attacks ; and the criticism itself is a little out of date since we already know the pre-recess deadline wo n’t be met .
For that matter , it ’s my understanding that it was n’t an especially large ad buy anyway .
So , with so much on the line , and the health and hopes of millions in the balance , perhaps Nelson can drop the threats ?
Couchepin is the current president of Switzerland .
He also heads the Federal Department of Home Affairs , where he oversees the implementation of LAMal , a law passed in 1994 requiring all citizens to buy health insurance -- with the state paying for the poor .
In return , the new law guarantees a comprehensive package of medical care for all .
At the time the law was passed , Switzerland 's health care system resembled America's : Medical insurance was voluntary and generally linked to employment .
Losing your job meant you could lose coverage -- and many did .
This is an edited transcript of an interview conducted Oct. 30 , 2007 .
We 're here because , as you know , Americans are very unhappy with our health care system , but each time we try to change it , the political forces are too strong to bring about much change .
Then we look at Switzerland , and you 've passed LAMal , and you 've made major changes .
And we 're interested in how a democratic , capitalist country can make that kind of change .
So can you tell us the circumstances that led to LAMal ?
Yes .
First of all , there is a long story of health insurance in Switzerland .
It was created in many cantons in the end of the 19th century .
...
It was a work of solidarity among same - minded people .
Groupe Mutuel was a health company of the liberal voters , ... and on the other side there was a Christian social health company .
So each political grouping had its own health insurance ?
Yes , and in most of the cantons of Switzerland it was the same .
So people were accustomed to being members of a company , and when the LAMal was voted at the end of the '90s , more than 95 percent of the people were insured ... on a voluntary basis .
So it was not a great step to make the LAMal compulsory for everybody ; it was only 5 percent .
I 'm not sure today that it was a real good idea , but at the time , it was considered as absolutely necessary to bring more solidarity in the system .
...
When you say solidarity , you mean equal treatment for everybody ?
Equal [ insurance ] premium , ... and that everybody can be insured .
As long as it is voluntary , it means that the health companies are not obliged to accept any new member .
Before LAMal , they could turn people down ?
They could , but they did n't do it practically , because the 5 percent who were not insured were the people [ who were ] absolutely poor , that we have to pay the health insurance premium for them --
The government pays it ?
Yes , through subsidies .
Or the very rich , who say , " We do n't care to have an insurance ; we can afford to pay the real costs of our treatments . "
But we decided [ everyone must have insurance ] , and I supported that as a member of the parliament .
Today I am not sure that it was a very [ good idea ] , because [ since ] then , there was a huge increase in the expenses of the health insurance .
But medicine costs more all the time anyway .
Why --
I accept that , ... but with such a huge scale , the growth probably is partially due to the fact that we decided it is compulsory , because when it is compulsory , people change their attitude .
They say , " If it is compulsory , at least I want to get back my money , and so I expend more . " ...
So you 're saying , when the insurance became mandatory for everyone , more people went to the doctor more ?
Yes . ...
But it is over .
Nobody will propose to go back and to have a voluntary system .
I think it will be impossible to go back .
...
...
When it passed and you supported it , what were the political forces driving this ?
Was it just concern for these 5 percent who did n't have coverage ?
No .
There was the idea of this 5 percent , but also the idea that with the increase of the expenses in this matter , solidarity will be more and more necessary to be able to give to everybody good service .
I think it was more future - oriented .
But I can hear in what you 're saying that that concern that everyone get covered , everyone get equal care , that 's really important .
Oh , yes .
...
For the Swiss , whether you are right or left does n't matter ; I think there is a consensus on that .
We want that every [ one ] of our citizen [s ] can get the best medical treatment when they need it .
...
One of the things really striking for Americans is that under LAMal , you now say the insurance companies can't make a profit on basic coverage .
What 's the thinking there ?
The idea is very simple :
If it is a social insurance , and everybody is obliged to be a member of a health insurance system , you can't ask them to pay so that the shareholders get a better revenue .
It is a little the same , if I can compare with SBB , our railway system .
We are very attached to the railway system ; Switzerland is a country of railway .
... I think that the people would n't [ have ] agreed to privatize the railways [ as ] it is done now in Great Britain .
To think that they can [ make ] a profit on the railway system , it [ would ] be against equality in this matter .
Naturally , you can question that , ... but till now we were able to afford a good railway system , to improve it and to have a high quality in transportation .
...
We want also high quality for everybody in the health system , and after that you can earn more money than your neighbor .
...
School , health care , railway system , aging , to have a good place for nursing homes for old people , retired people , we think that we must have equality of that -- not quite complete equality , it is impossible , but to have a great sense of solidarity among the people .
Now , see , that 's striking for an American , because we would certainly say everyone is entitled to an education , everyone is entitled to legal protection if you get in trouble with the law , but we do n't say that everyone is entitled to health care .
Why ?
Because it is a profound need for people to be sure that , if they are struck by a stroke of destiny , they can have a good health system .
...
So if you ask the people of Switzerland , is everyone entitled to decent health care , the Swiss would say ?
Everybody has a right to health care .
You would say , yes , they have a right , and you provide it .
Yes , and high quality .
Naturally , you can have a better quality .
To be in a room with only one bed , you have to pay something supplementary .
But even that , I see in my own canton , which is not a rich canton -- and hospitals belong to the cities or to the canton now ; they belong to the canton -- they intend to improve the system so that the people can be alone in a room when they are in hospital , rich or poor .
...
When you said to the insurance companies , " No more profit on the basic health plan , " what did they say ?
They accept it ; they have no choice .
And [ all these ] companies are [ heirs ] of former social companies .
For instance , the Groupe Mutuel ... was built on this idea : no profit ; everything must be given to the people who are members of it .
So there is a tradition of social attitude in these systems .
I am not systematically against the idea of having profits in the health insurance system , but if we introduce it , it is more with the idea to balance the power in the health insurance system , because now there is a lack of balance of power .
Who has the power ?
Who has the power ?
The small group of the people who leads these companies .
And it is something for me which can be dangerous , because it is a business with a billion of Swiss francs , and the check and balance is not optimal in the present system .
...
But you have government regulation , what we might call regulated competition .
Does that work ?
It is regulated competition .
It is in order , but I think , as a Democrat , ... it could be not bad that once a year they [ the company managers ] have to go in front of a public assembly to answer questions about their salaries , about the way they see the future , about improvement in the quality of the services .
It would be , my opinion , not so bad .
And it could be possible through a system of shareholders , but not for profit , more for control .
So you 're now the home affairs minister ; you 're in charge of the system .
How would you say LAMal is working ?
Well , if you look [ at ] the output , it is working well .
Output meaning the quality of care ?
The quality .
...
Somebody who lives in France , and who is very well - acquainted with the system , told me , " If I get ill , I would prefer to be in Switzerland rather than in France . "
Although France is a very good system , but probably the comfort is better in Switzerland .
France was ahead of us not because of the quality of the services but because of the way premium [s ] are paid .
The fairness ?
The fairness notion .
[ We ] consider that it is fair as we do it , but according to these criteria , this French public health system , [ which ] is paid through taxes , is more fair than the Swiss system , [ in which ] premiums are paid per head .
You are rich or not rich , you pay the same premium according to your age , not according to your wealth .
I think [ this ] system is very good , good quality .
Most of the people are satisfied .
It is one of the only systems in Europe which is not near bankrupt .
In other words , the premiums are paying the bills .
Yes .
And if the costs increase , you increase the premiums .
In countries [ such ] as France , where the financing of the system is through the public taxes , you have political decisions to take , and you wait from time to time , and so they have great deficits .
In Switzerland , the system not only [ has ] no deficit , they have even reserves , provisions --
Making a surplus .
Making a surplus .
And it is compulsory that they have a surplus to be able to answer to changes .
...
So the system is good in itself , but the problem is [ in ] the long term , the increase of the costs will endanger the system .
...
...
One of the problems we have in America is that many people -- it 's a huge number of people -- go bankrupt because of medical bills ; some studies say 700,000 people a year .
How many people in Switzerland go bankrupt because of medical bills ?
Nobody .
Does n't happen .
It would be a huge scandal if it happens .
Even to one ?
... You [ can ] go bankrupt because you 're not [ able to ] pay your premium , 2,000 or 3,000 Swiss francs , but it is not because of that but because of your general situation .
But that the normal situation [ is to ] become bankrupt of health costs , it would be for us something absolutely unbelievable .
...
Do you have a good enough supply of doctors ?
Is there a shortage of doctors , as in some countries ?
If you look at figures , we have a good supply of doctors .
They always say that in the future we shall have a lack of home doctors , family doctors .
I 'm not sure of that , but we have a problem of formation .
...
Every year there [ are ] about 1,000 students beginning medical studies , and at the end of the formation there are only 600 young people getting the diploma .
It means that about 40 percent of the students fail during the studies , although there is a selection at the beginning .
...
Forty percent is too much as failure , so probably there is a problem in the formation , education .
But 600 graduates per year , that 's enough to keep up the --
No , it is not enough .
We need about 1,000 to 1,200 .
...
The difference is covered by immigration of medical people , first of all from Germany .
And to Germany there is immigration [ of ] people from Eastern Europe .
So there is a kind of migration of medical people from Eastern Europe to Germany , from Germany to Switzerland , and Switzerland to nowhere ; they stay in Switzerland .
Well , once you 're here , why not [ leave ] ?
Because they are the best paid doctors in Europe . ... [ It is ] also true that they [ have ] taxes , but at the end of the day , they are in a very good situation , the doctors in Switzerland .
...
...
This year , there was an effort to change the health care system .
Not completely .
There was a ... public referendum , and the idea was to have only one health company in Switzerland , which would be controlled very narrowly by the state .
This is what we call " single payer " in America .
Single payer , yes .
...
We rejected it because we think if you have a single payer , which is also the only [ party ] who makes contracts with ... all the providers , it will be dangerous , because there is too much power in the hands of the health insurance system .
We think that if there is competition between the health insurance companies , there will be a certain control among themselves ; they will denounce the excesses of the others , ... and also they will try to provide better services , and so you can compare .
On the other side , the Social Democrats who wanted that ... thought that you could [ have an ] economy of scale if you only had one company .
It is true , ... but if you compare with the disadvantages of one provider of health insurance , probably there [ are ] more benefits to keep the present system with competition .
And perhaps we have too many health companies , it 's true , but through competition the number will be reduced .
How many companies [ are there ] now ?
Now , 90 .
Ten years ago there was almost 1,000 .
So 90 for a country of 7.5 million people .
It 's a big number , I think .
It is a big number .
But you must say that among these 90 companies , many belong to the same group , and for historical reasons they have kept various names or various companies with various systems .
And there are what we call niche companies .
...
There is a company for the sisters , the Catholic nuns of Ingenbohl .
...
So there are many companies like that in a small village , mountain people who are accustomed to know each other and to help each other .
And it 's tradition .
That really matters .
Yes .
People like the state .
... [ The ] state must care about regulation , about the school , about the railway , but not about everything .
You know , we have a lot of health insurance companies in America , but I do n't think there 's any that limits its sales only to nuns from a particular [ order ] .
That 's really striking .
Legally it is forbidden .
They can't reject --
Oh , I see . ...
So if I come to the insurance company and say , " Well , I have diabetes , and my child has --"
...
They are obliged to take everybody , and they are not allowed to ask questions about the health situation of the people .
So you 're not sure now that you would support LAMal if it came up today , but basically the system has worked .
Yes .
On the other hand , although ... the cost of it looks like a bargain to Americans , it 's the most expensive system in Europe .
Does this bother you ?
Yes , ... but it is the cost of a high - quality system with high access for everybody , and probably the best quality for everybody .
...
We want to pay that ; I do n't know how long .
Every year is a protest .
It 's the same when you get to pay taxes .
... I always say , in Switzerland there was a kind of a liturgical year .
In October , [ when ] you know the new premiums for next year , there is a huge wave of protests .
Every year you say , " Here 's what you 're going to pay next year " ?
Yes .
Huge wave of protests , and in November starts a huge wave of protest against limitation of services in the health service .
And during the next 11 months , every [ one ] protests and say[s ] , " We want the new vaccines ; we want improvement of that ; we want these new drugs . "
And one month in the year , they protest against the consequences of the rest of the year .
So you 're saying they spend 11 months demanding more service , and then one month they complain about paying more for it .
That sounds like the United States .
Yes .
It is human nature .
...
You have some of the world 's greatest pharmaceutical companies .
Do you have a problem controlling [ drug costs ] ?
Yes .
The cost of drugs are controlled , and the prices of drugs are fixed by the government .
... [ But ] if we compare the prices of drugs in Switzerland and the neighboring countries , it is higher in Switzerland .
You pay more for the same pill ?
Yes .
And ... we wanted to discuss the problem , and we took some measures to reduce the prices .
First of all , we decided that where it is possible to have generics , people have to take generics , or if they do not take generics , they have to pay part of the price [ on ] their own .
...
And after that , we systematically compare the price of the most - used drugs with the cost of the most - used drugs in the neighboring countries , and we reduce the prices of the drugs in Switzerland .
You reduce the prices .
And then what does this big Swiss pharmaceutical industry say ?
Two things .
First of all , they accepted generics , ... and they also accepted to reduce the prices of the original drugs , which were more expensive in Switzerland .
...
What they want is that we pay much more for the new drugs with a great value added , and we accept that .
For cancer [ drugs ] , perhaps we pay a little too much , in my opinion ; we can still have a discussion about that .
But we are very open for new drugs with huge therapeutic advantage .
...
We try to support innovation and not to support profits in [ and of themselves ] .
...
...
We have big drug companies in America , and they say , " Americans should pay high prices because that 's the price of innovation . " ...
Do you buy that argument ?
Is it legitimate ?
Partially .
But if you look at the expenses of a great pharmaceutical company , ... they pay between about 10 to 15 percent of their expenses for research , but they use 30 to 40 percent of their incomes for marketing and promotion .
...
It is not completely wrong that they spend so much , but it is not correct to say that there is a direct connection between the price of drugs and the cost of research .
It could be more between the cost of marketing and the cost of the drugs .
Are you trying to limit the treatment or put some limits on doctors to keep the costs down ?
There is , first of all , a will to limit the number of doctors themselves , because with new bilateral agreements with the European Union , there is what we call the " free flow of persons " ; that our borders are open to immigration .
And as the Swiss doctors are better paid than others , we could have a huge increase of immigration of doctors , more than we need .
So we decided some years ago to limit the numbers of doctors [ coming into ]
Switzerland , and when somebody wants to open a new practice , they have to apply and to get an authorization from the cantonal state .
It is not a very intelligent system , but it is the best one that we have found to limit immigration of doctors .
Do you limit the number of hospitals , too ?
Hospitals belong normally to cities or cantons .
We reduced the number of beds in hospital , and in the future we shall have to reduce the number of hospitals .
But it is politically very difficult , because people do n't accept the [ disappearance ] of hospitals in their neighborhood .
But it will be necessary .
We tried to make competition between the hospitals so that the hospitals who are not efficient will disappear .
...
With regards [ to ] the supply of care , it is a very difficult system .
I know in Oregon , I think , in the States , there is a commission which discusses about --
What it will pay for , what treatments it will cover .
And when you are old , is it still necessary to make this treatment ?
I am , as a liberal in the European sense of the word , very , very critical about intervention of the state saying , " This person can get this treatment ; this person cannot get this treatment . " ...
We must find the mechanism which helps the doctors and the responsible hospital to make these decisions .
...
Have you paid any attention to the United States ' health care system ?
Do you know anything about it ?
Yes .
Naturally , it is another philosophy .
But I read the book of -- I always forget the name ; what is the name of the man in Harvard ?
... Michael Porter ?
Yes .
I read his book , [ Redefining Health Care , ] and I asked my people to read this book .
The idea behind this book is to say , until now we measured the health system according to unrealistic [ criteria ] .
In the future , you must measure according to the health results , only that .
And I think we can learn very much from this kind of reflection ; we can learn from the HMO - American system and of all these innovations in the health service .
I do n't think that we have very much to learn about the philosophical attitude ... but the practical answers , because America is a laboratory for the world also in this field .
Well , you told me that a big reason you adopted LAMal was that 5 percent of the people did n't have insurance coverage .
Well , in America , it 's 16 percent do n't have health insurance coverage .
Yes . ... I will think it is impossible in Switzerland .
We would never accept that , although we are a very capitalistic system and capitalistic country , but we can't understand that .
But it is your tradition .
You have the same lobbies we do .
How do you handle these lobbies ?
Oh , it is terrible .
It is terrible , and every day you can only expect to be criticized .
Fortunately , I have good shoulders , and secondly , I am not elected by the people but through the parliament .
...
...
So this gives you some independence from all this .
Yes .
But it is very difficult .
With the pharmaceutical companies , we find a good agreement .
They say , " Let us get money from the innovative drugs , and we accept the rest , " because they know that the public opinion will never accept something else .
With the doctors it is very much difficult , because they do not want any restriction in the number of doctors .
They want to be paid without control .
But they also know , if they go to the public ... and they lose the referendum , after that there is weakness in the situation .
So they have to think twice before attacking a law .
There are also the trade unions of the people working in hospitals that usually support the most socialist views , which are not extreme but more left .
It is very difficult job .
You know , during the time of Stalin , ... there was a saying which said that , " To be minister of agriculture is the last step before the firing squad . "
And I think now that being health minister in Switzerland is the last step before the firing squad .
...
Switzerland has a health care system that covers everybody ; the quality is good ; the costs are lower than in America , per capita .
Is it socialized medicine here ?
What do you mean by socialized medicine ?
Run by the government ?
No , it is not considered as socialized medicine .
...
The doctors are paid by the mandatory health insurance system , so it is not quite a free market .
On the other side , there is a kind of competition between the health insurance companies , between the hospitals .
So it is probably not a socialized system , but it is a step further into the direction than the American system .
... I do n't think it is a free - market system 100 percent -- by at least , let us say , 70 percent .
Could a 100 percent free - market system work in health care ?
No , I do n't think so .
If you do that , you will lose solidarity and equal access for everybody .
Which is what you were finding in the late ' 80s .
Yes .
We think that is a basic value of living in our society .
On Thursday , the Bank of England said that it would run its printing press a bit faster while the European Central Bank hinted that theirs might slow down sooner than expected .
In the United States , the Federal Reserve ’s printing press is running low on ink , and Ben Bernanke has his own choice to make :
Buy a new cartridge or shut the thing down .
He should shut it down .
In particular , I ’m referring to the Fed chairman ’s commitment to print $ 300 billion to buy Treasury bonds by the end of September .
So far the Fed has purchased $ 243 billion since the program began in March .
He ’s on schedule to hit the $ 300 billion mark next month , right on schedule .
The question is whether he should buy more .
( Click table to enlarge in new window )
With some signs pointing to a recovery , the conventional wisdom is that the Fed can let the program expire .
That ’s right , but for the wrong reasons .
The problem with quantitative easing , and with all programs fiscal and monetary intended to artificially support asset prices , is that they badly distort markets , preventing them from grappling with the underlying problem of leverage .
They also send false signals to market participants that it ’s safe to take risk .
Leverage is still at record highs .
To take just one measure , according to the Fed ’s first quarter flow of funds report , total credit market debt to GDP stood at 376 percent .
( Click chart to enlarge in new window , ht Comstock Partners )
We ’ve run up more debt that we can possibly pay .
As any overextended borrower can tell you , the way to deal with excessive debt is to pay it down , or declare bankruptcy .
But quantitative easing encourages people to take on more debt .
Take homes , for instance .
Mortgage rates are tied to Treasury rates , which are held artificially low thanks to the Fed .
Low mortgage rates lead to higher house prices and higher house prices provide collateral to take on more debt .
But when the Fed ’s artificial support is removed , prices will continue their march downward and borrowers will find they can’t pay off their last loan .
Every time we hit a recession , the Fed ’s solution is to hit the gas , encouraging folks to go deeper into debt .
For a time , credit expansion provides the illusion of economic expansion .
Until , that is , inflation fears force the Fed to hit the brakes .
We ’re addicted to debt .
But instead of trying to kick the habit , we invent ever more creative ways to find our next fix .
Once upon a time , low interest rates were enough .
Not anymore .
So the Fed devised a dangerous combination of zero interest rates and quantitative easing .
Before we were snorting the junk .
Now we ’re injecting it .
And the high is causing market participants to take more dangerous risks than they should .
People jumping back into the housing market are in for a rude awakening as prices continue to fall and their equity evaporates .
If house prices trend back up , it wo n’t be because people can pay more , it will be because credit markets have loosened up again and they can borrow more .
Then we ’re back where we started , but with an even larger pile of unpayable debt .
The economy wo n’t be on a sound footing until debt levels fall , and that wo n’t happen as long as the Fed stands in the way .
It should let its three quantitative easing programs expire on schedule , and make a firm commitment that they ’re not coming back .

Advertisement North Korea 's latest launch is not missiles , but a TV advertising campaign for a locally - brewed beer .
In a rare nod to commercial motives in the resolutely communist nation , the TV advert features a thirsty worker holding a mug of frothy beer .
Young women in traditional Korean dress are shown serving trays of beer to men in Western suits .
Billed as the " Pride of Pyongyang " , the advert promises drinkers that the beer will help ease stress .
" It represents the new look of Pyongyang , " the two - and - a - half minute advert says .
" It will be a familiar part of our lives . "
Taedonggang Beer Factory has been making the brew since buying a British brewery and shipping it lock , stock and barrel from the UK in 2002 .
The beer has been occasionally available in South Korea and is said to be of high quality .
North Korean leader Kim Jong - il , said to have a fondness for fine wines and brandy , has taken a personal interest in the brewery .
" Watching good quality beer coming out in an uninterrupted flow for a long while , he noted with great pleasure that it has now become possible to supply more fresh beer to people in all seasons , " North Korea 's state news agency , KCNA , said after he visited the brewery in 2002 .
A selection of your comments : Yes , I have tasted Taedonggang many times .
I even visited the brewery in Pyongyang 18 months ago .
The draught beer they served was really good ( something to do with the rice they added ) .
Generally , draught Taedonggang was not sold to foreigners .
Occasionally , you could buy a 20 litre barrel for 20 euro for a party .
The bottled beer on the other hand was not so good .
If your first beer was Taedonggang , it tasted ok , but if you had a western beer first and then switched to Taedonggang , it tasted sour and very bitter and was sometimes cloudy .
The quality of the beer changed often .
When the German crew came to Pyongyang and cleaned the tank and the pipes , it tasted quite good .
The brewery belonged to a German company before being sold to Britain , and then being sold to North Korea .
Also , the sale of the beer depended on the availability of bottles .
No bottles , no beer and the supermarket shelves stayed empty .
The bottled beer was sold in 660 ml bottles for 0.33 euro per bottle .
It was served by women in 1/2 litre glasses to male customers only .
The beer was poured into the glass from a rubber hose .
It cost about 0.10 euro in the local currency .
The locals received beer vouchers , for which they queued for hours in advance before the drinking houses open at 15:30 .
You could n't smoke in the drinking houses they were always full and also served dried fish .
North Koreans love their Taedonggang and drink it at all times of the day not caring if it is cooled or not !
Phil Meyer , Hanoi , Vietnam
When the 1966 North Korean football team came over in 2002 , the beers they loved were the darker ales , like London Pride and I think John Smiths .
They did n't really get the hang of Guinness .
I remember North Korean beer as being heavy to be the point of being cloudy , pretty tasty stuff with more weight than ABV so you were just kept inert .
What was lovelier for me in Pyongyang in 2002 and 2003 was the pear cider , which was streets ahead of this new Magners stuff .
Robert Willoughby , London , Author of the Bradt Guide to North Korea
All food coming out from North Korea is very good because it's made with fresh ingredients - in other words , not influenced by pollution and chemical substances .
Perhaps it 's a good thing to be un-open and un-developed .
Bright , Seoul
You can find it here in a few places in Seoul .
Surprisingly enough , it 's actually a really good beer .
Paul , from Canada living in Seoul I love the beer !
I would have some every day if I can and I am glad to see it can be advertised .

Insurance , Reputation , and Kristallnacht By Bryan Caplan
In 1938 , Jewish businesses and synagogues through Germany were burned and looted in a massive pogrom .
Historians call the incident Kristallnacht .
The Nazis naturally blamed the Jews .
So the Nazis were horrified when they realized that Aryan - owned insurance companies were liable for the damages !
The obvious solution for the Nazis was to let the insurance companies weasel out of their contracts .
But contrary to what critics of private health insurance would have you think , insurance companies aggressively lobbied against this solution .
Why ?
Because they greatly valued their reputation .
As the Holocaust History Project explains :
Insurance was an international business and insurance companies were
worried about their loss of reputation if they did not keep their
contracts to indemnify the losses .
In a meeting after Kristallnacht ,
Göring compromised with the nervous insurance industry by allowing them
to pay out the damages , even to Jews .
To offset those losses , Göring
then imposed a huge fine on the Jewish communities in order to offset
the losses of the insurance companies .
Thus , the Jews themselves
ended up paying for the damages in an indirect way .
“ The Nazis made me do it . ”
What better excuse is there for an insurance company to renege ?
But the German insurers refused to take the easy way out – even though most of them were probably anti-Semites themselves .
Here ‘s the key passage from official Nazi documents ( Hilgard was a leading figure in German insurance industry ; as far as I can tell , all of the other people in the transcript are Nazi officials ) :
Hilgard : … We ’d like to make it our point , Mr .
General Field Marshall , that we shall not be hindered in fulfilling the
obligations for which our contracts call .
Goering : But I have to .
That is important for me .
Hilgard :
If I may give reasons for this request , I ’d like to say
that it simply has to do with the fact that we carry out , to a large
extent , quite a number of international transactions .
We have a very
good international basis for our business transactions , and in the
interest of the equilibrium of the Foreign exchange in Germany , we have
to make sure that the confidence in the German insurance shall not be
ruined .
If we now refuse to honor clearcut obligations , imposed upon us
through lawful contract , it would be a black spot on the shield of
honor of the German insurance .
Goering :
It would n’t the minute I issue a decree - a law sanctioned by the State .
Hilgard : I was leading up to that .
Heydrich :
The insurance may be granted , but as soon as it is to be paid , it ’ll be confiscated .
That way we ’ll have saved face .
Hilgard : I am inclined to agree with what General Heydrich has just
said .
First of all , use the mechanism of the insurance company to check
on the damage , to regulate it and even pay , but give the insurance
company the chance to …
Goering : One moment !
You ’ll have to pay in any case because it is
the Germans who suffered the damage .
But there ’ll be a lawful order
forbidding you to make any direct payments to the Jews .
You shall also
have to make payment for the damage the Jews have suffered , but not to
the Jews , but to the Minister of Finance .
( Hilgard : Aha ! )
What he does with the money is his business .
Schmer : Your Excellency , I should like to make a proposal .
A certain
rate should be fixed , say 15 % or maybe a little higher , of all the
registered wealth , I understand one billion is to be confiscated so
that all Jews shall pay equally , and from the money raised this way ,
the insurance companies shall be refunded .
Goering : No .
I do n’t even dream of refunding the insurance companies
the money .
The companies are liable .
No , the money belongs to the
State .
That ’s quite clear .
That would indeed be a present for the
insurance companies …
You ’ll fulfill
your obligations , you may count on that .

Only a few hours left to Double your gift
Glenn Beck has uncovered a plot !
( Yes , another one . )
Turns out Van Jones , President Obama ’s green jobs czar , is going to coordinate a vast radical / communist / black nationalist takeover of our sweet , virginal land of liberty .
Most diabolical of all , he ’s going to do it by organizing efforts to train and employ low - income people in private sector jobs .
Do n’t you understand ?
They ’re going to take over from the inside !
You know : them .
Admit it , it ’s brilliant .
Here Beck exposes the cabal of Big Labor , Big Green , Big Business , and Big Commie , orchestrated by the many - tentacled Apollo Alliance :
Can you talk me out of the crazy tree ?!
No .
No , I ’m afraid not .
You ’ve found them .
Right in the last place they thought you ’d look .
Jones was undercover for a while , collecting degrees from University of Tennessee at Martin and Yale Law .
But then he became an advocate .
A ( shudder ) community organizer .
We all know what that means , right Sarah ?
Recently he tried to throw tireless commie - hunters like Beck off his trail by writing a book — 2008 ’s The Green Collar Economy — that argued for saving the US free - market economy from stagflation by investing in green innovation , infrastructure , and industries , creating millions of jobs in the private sector .
But do n’t be fooled .
It was all in the name of bringing down The Man !
Here he is , talking about destroying capitalism by greening the economy :
Scary , right ?
You gonna trust this guy ahead of Glenn Beck ?
I did n’t think so .
Of course , the shadowy Apollo Alliance … are they Soros - funded ?
Probably ! … wants the government to support the evolution of a clean energy economy .
Yeah , you heard right :
They want the government to provide incentives to businesses to invest in green technologies and services .
Needless to say , this kind of Stalinistic , top - down central planning leads only to disasters like the internet , the Interstate Highway System , the polio vaccine , and velcro .
And , my god , flouridation .
Do n’t forget flouridation .
The sinister plan was going perfectly well until the radios in Glenn Beck ’s teeth told him how much danger we ’re in .
And thank Reagan they did !
Never be afraid to shout at the clouds , Glenn .
They ’re looking at you funny .

Hear My Voice
January 26 to October 25 , 2015
Featured here is the only known recording of Alexander Graham Bell , created in 1885 .
“ Hear my voice , ” Bell declares , from a time when listening to recorded sound was not today ’s commonplace , but an amazing new experience .
.
Let 's begin with beer .
Near my home I drive past a billboard advertisement for Coors Light .
The slogan is , " Coors rocks Harrisburg . "
Now , does anybody actually believe that Coors does in fact " rock Harrisburg ? "
No .
Does the Coors corporation itself believe it ?
No .
Does anyone believe that Coors believes it ?
No .
It is a lie , everyone knows it is a lie , and no one cares .
Everyone automatically writes it off as an ad slogan , an image campaign .
The next sign advertises Miller Beer with the phrase , " Fresh beer tastes better . "
Does anyone actually think Miller is fresher than Budweiser , Coors , or Pabst ?
No .
Does anyone at Miller Brewing think that ?
No .
It is another obvious and unremarkable lie , beneath the threshold of most people 's awareness .
But it contributes to a feeling of living in a phony world where words do n't matter and nothing is real .
Here is another beer slogan , for Carlsburg : " Probably the best beer in the world . "
Obviously , the word " probably " has been chosen to suggest that someone devoted great consideration to this question , sampled all the world 's great beers , and finally issued an impartial judgment .
Of course , nothing of the sort happened .
No one thinks it did .
Everyone knows that actually what happened is a bunch of advertising pros thought up a slogan in an effort to create an " image . "
Is n't it remarkable that lies are still effective even when no one believes them ?
Unfortunately , when it hardly matters whether words are truth or lies , then words lose their power to convey the truth .
Continuing on my way , I drive past the Colonial Park Mall , a generic , boxy edifice amidst a vast expanse of concrete .
There is no park here , nor is there actually any connection with anything " colonial , " a word chosen to evoke an image of simple times , kind folk , and quality craftsmanship .
The mall is home to a food court called " Café in the Park , " a name chosen to evoke ( who knows ? ) a Parisian café with outdoor tables under the shade of the trees .
Basically , the entire name is a lie .
No café , no park , nothing colonial .
And this lie is , again , completely unremarkable .
Increasingly , words do n't mean anything .
In politics , campaigning candidates make statements that flatly contradict their actions and policies , and no one seems to object or even care .
It is not the routine dissembling of political figures that is striking , but rather our near - complete indifference to it .
We are as well almost completely inured to the vacuity of advertising copy , the words of which increasingly mean nothing at all to the reader .
Does anyone really believe that GE " brings good things to life ? "
Or that a housing development I passed today – " Walnut Crossing " – actually has any walnut trees or crossings ?
From brand names to PR slogans to political code - words , the language of the media that inundates modern life consists almost wholly of subtle lies , misdirection , and manipulation .
We live in a ubiquitous matrix of lies , a sea of mendacity so pervasive that it is nearly invisible .
Because we are lied to all the time , in ways so subtle they are beneath conscious notice , even the most direct lies are losing their power to shock us .
The most shocking thing about the lies of the Bush administration was that those lies were not actually shocking to most people .
Why do we as a society seemingly accept our leaders ' gross dishonesty as a matter of course ?
Why does the repeated exposure of their lies seem to arouse barely a ripple of indignation among the general public ?
Where is the protest , the outrage , the sense of betrayal ?
It is certainly not to be found in the person of Barack Obama .
Just as there is little difference between Coors and Miller , so also is there little difference in the policies of Bush and Obama .
I realize that this statement will provoke outrage from many of my readers .
Sure , there are some differences between them – enough to establish Obama as a new brand – but the basic course of empire , of finance , the military , medicine , law , education , of all the defining institutions of our society remains unchanged .
Significantly , during the campaign most of the media commentary on his speeches was about the image they created , their emotional effect , and not their content .
Today , the content barely matters except for what image it creates .
Words become merely emotive signs , not semantic ones .
Therefore , even though I do n't think Obama tells deliberate lies as did his predecessors , the change in the way we use and receive language makes it impossible for him to tell the truth either .
Everything is heard through a filter of meta - interpretations ; we hear not words but code - words , not semantic meaning but signals and " messages . "
Words do n't mean what they mean .
Speaking into such a listening , it becomes impossible to really tell the truth .
Even if a politician speaks plainly , we hear an attempt to create an image of plainspokenness .
Thus it is that people detect a certain indefinable insincerity underneath Obama 's words – insincerity is now built in to the language of politics .
( It is also inherent in the contradictions of our civilization 's deep ideology , but that is a different matter . )
Playing by the rules of the political game , as Obama most definitely does , he can do naught but lie .
His " hope " and " change " will be exposed as the brands they are .
People will see that there is little cause to hope , and that not much has changed .
The despair , cynicism , and sense of betrayal that will result will foment a dangerous crisis and , in the end , a profound renewal of public discourse that demands truth and has no patience with inauthenticity .
Above I asked , " Where is the indignation , the outrage , at the lies in which we are immersed ? "
Clearly , the answer lies deeper than the machinations of one or another faction of the power elite .
It lies deeper than the subversion and control of the media .
Part of our society 's apathy arises from a subtle and profound disempowerment : the de-potentiation of language itself , along with all other forms of symbolic culture .
Words are losing their power to create and to transform .
The result is a tyranny that can never be overthrown , but will only proceed toward totality until it collapses under the weight of the multiple crises it inevitably generates .
As we acclimate ourselves to a ubiquitous matrix of lies , words mean less and less to us , and we do n't believe anything any more .
As well we should n't !
We are facing a crisis of language that underlies and mirrors all the other converging crises of the modern age .
Just as a growing profusion of material and social technology has failed to bring about the promised Utopia of leisure , health , and justice , so has the profusion of words and media failed to bring about better communication .
Instead , the opposite has happened .
We are faced with a paradox .
On the one hand , in a technological society , words are themselves actions .
The entire modern world is built on language , on symbol .
Any endeavor requiring the coordination of human activity beyond a very small scale requires language .
You cannot build a microchip , run an airport or a government , wage a war , organize a peace movement , or build a wind turbine without a vast apparatus of codified instruction books , technical manuals , educational curricula , time schedules , planning documents , memos , instructions , measurements , and data .
If the President decides to bomb Iran , do you know how he will do it ?
With words .
He literally has the power to speak a war into being .
Like the Old Testament Jehovah , we create the world with our words .
Neither the President nor Congress really ever does anything but talk ( and write ) .
Unless you work with your hands as a carpenter or garbage collector , you are probably the same .
What are we to do , then , when words , our primary creative tool in the modern world , have become impotent ?
Surely political activists must ask this of themselves , as they shout the truth from the rooftops , loud and clear , to so little effect ( yes there are some small victories , but the inferno rages on ) .
We feel the urge to stop talking and get out there and DO something .
But to do is to speak .
An exception might be the activists who , impatient with all the talk , go out there and sabotage tractors and spike trees .
Ironically , the main impact of such operations usually comes from their symbolic power , which has quickly diminished ( in the public consciousness ) to the status of gimmicks and stunts .
Something similar might be said of mass protests , which began to lose their power after the civil rights and antiwar movements of the 1960s .
Originally , marches and demonstrations were intended not only to attract media attention , but carried the threat of actual physical action .
Their essence was , " We 're sick of sitting around talking , we 're going to do something about this ! "
But as protests turned into media events , whose success was defined by the amount and kind of coverage , they became just another form of talking : they " raise awareness " and " send a message . "
Not since Seattle in 1998 has the physicality of street action had much of an effect .
( In other parts of the world it is a different story .
In China , for instance , protestors in rural villages are wont to [ literally ] tar and feather corrupt local officials .
In Europe , mass demonstrations paralyze commerce and government . )
It is not that the symbolic aspect of such actions is unimportant , but when they become wholly symbolic , the symbol loses its connection to – and impact on – reality .
It is not only that the powers that be so completely dominate the narratives of our time that any dissent seems irrational or illegitimate .
The words of the dominant powers are losing their potency as well !
The primary method by which governments increase their control is by creating fear .
In this atmosphere , it is easy to declare new wars , impose new restrictions on freedom , make people accept new sacrifices , etc .
With this in mind , I was gratified to see the utter failure of the " terrorism threat level " color - coding system to instill panic .
You may have heard the message in airports : " the Department of Homeland Security has raised the terror alert threat level to orange … "
Does anyone say , " Oh my God , it is orange !
That 's just one step short of a red alert ! " ?
No .
The words impact us as the buzzing of a fly .
Another example is the recent failure of government scaremongering about the swine flu , a fine opportunity to implement mandatory vaccination programs , build mass quarantine facilities , etc .
Perhaps the most significant failure of the language of the rulers is the futility of their rosy economic pronouncements to reverse the progressive unwinding of the global financial system .
( For money , too , is a story , a system of meanings and symbols that assigns roles , focuses collective intentions , and coordinates human activity . )
When governments fail , such as in the breakup of the Soviet Union , a terminal symptom is the failure of the credibility of their leaders ' words .
When reality conflicts more and more obviously with the pronouncements of leaders , then when they say , " This shall be , " no one believes that either .
Laws , authority , currencies , and so on are all systems of symbols .
When they break down , what remains is as Chairman Mao described : " Power comes from the barrel of a gun . "
That is why I think the finale of the de-potentiation of public speech will be an interlude of rule by naked force .
I note as an aside that it is not only public language that is losing its power and suffering a crisis of meaning .
The same is happening to all symbolic communication .
To quote from The Ascent of Humanity , " Another symptom of the breakdown of semantic meaning is the routine use of words like ' awesome , ' ' amazing , ' and ' incredible ' to describe what is actually trivial , boring , and mundane .
We are running out of words , or words are running out of meaning , forcing us into increasingly exaggerated elocutions to communicate at all . "
We might say that the crisis of our civilization comes down to a crisis of language , in which words have seemingly lost their ability to create .
We have all the technology and all the knowledge we need to live in beautiful harmony with each other and the planet .
What we need is different collective choices .
Choices arise from perceptions , perceptions arise from interpretations or stories , and stories are built of words , of symbols .
Today , words have lost their power and our society 's stories have seemingly taken on a life of their own , propelling us toward an end that no sane person would choose and that we seem helpless to resist .
And helpless we are , when all we have are impotent words .
It is as if , as in The Emperor 's New Clothes , the boy has cried , " The emperor is completely naked " and everyone hears him but no one cares .
The parade marches on , an increasingly contrived and ruinous spectacle that no one , not even its leaders , truly believes in .
What , then , are we as writers , as speakers , as humans , to do ?
Shall we stop writing ?
No .
But let us not labor under any illusions .
The truth has been exposed again and again , but to what effect ?
What have forty years of correct analysis of the environmental and political state of the world brought us ?
The reason that the entire staff of Counterpunch , The Nation , and Truthout is not in a concentration camp is that it is not necessary .
Words themselves have been robbed of their power .
Thoreau said , " It takes two to speak the truth : one to speak and another to hear . "
Who hears now but the already - converted ?
A picture is worth a thousand words – perhaps the image can rescue us from the crisis of language .
Unfortunately , it cannot .
The same air of unreality has come to infect the realm of images as has debilitated the power of words .
In an age of virtual reality , immersive video games , on - line interactive worlds like Second Life , computer 3D animation , and routine graphic depictions of violence on screen , images of real atrocities are losing their power to shock .
For the viewer , there is little observable difference between images of real violence and its on - screen simulation – both are just a set of pixels and neither impacts the viewer 's off - screen reality in any tangible way .
It 's all happening in TV - land .
Perhaps this explains the absence of any national sense of shame or soul - searching in the wake of Abu Ghraib .
For many , it was just another bunch of images , just as 600,000 Iraqis dead is another string of digits .
Like words , images have become divorced from the objects they are supposed to represent , until the very word " image " itself has taken on connotations of inauthenticity : a corporate image , a politician 's image .
In a world of lies and images , nothing is real .
Immersed in such a world , is the political apathy of the American public so difficult to understand ?
The danger when we operate wholly in a world of representations and images is that we begin to mistake that world for reality , and to believe that by manipulating symbols we can automatically change the reality they represent .
We lose touch with the reality behind the symbols .
Grisly death becomes collateral damage .
Torture becomes enhanced interrogation .
A bill to gut pollution controls becomes the Clear Skies Act. Defeat in Iraq becomes victory .
War becomes peace .
Hate becomes love .
Slavery becomes freedom .
The Orwellian ambition to render language incapable of even expressing the concept " freedom " has nearly been fulfilled .
Not by eliminating the word , but by converting it into a mere image , an empty shell , a brand .
How can the voices of protest be effective when everyone discounts all speech as image , spin , and hype ?
Whatever you say , it is in the end just words .
Take heart : the evisceration of the language that makes our tyranny impregnable also ensures its eventual demise .
The words , numbers , and images over which it exercises complete control are less and less congruent to reality .
Such is the folly of the infamous " Brand America " campaign , designed to burnish America 's " image " abroad .
The image has become more important than the reality .
Bombs blow up innocent civilians to send a " message " to the " terrorists . "
No matter that this message exists only in the fantasies of our leaders .
They are , like those they rule , immersed in an increasingly impotent world of symbol and cannot understand why the world does not conform to their manipulation of its representation , the pieces on their global chessboard .
However we play with the statistics to cover up the converging crises of our time , the crises continue to intensify .
We can euphemize the autism crisis away , the obesity epidemic , the soil crisis , the water crisis , the energy crisis .
We can dumb down standardized exams to cover up the accelerating implosion of the educational system .
We can redefine people in and out of poverty and manipulate economic statistics .
We can declare – simply declare – that the forests are not in precipitous decline .
For a while we can hide the gathering collapse of environment and polity , economy and ecology , but eventually reality will break through .
As we rebuild from the wreckage that follows , let us remember the lesson we have learned .
The power of the word , like all magical powers , will turn against us or wither and die if not renewed by frequent reconnection to its source .
Abstracted too many levels from its source , language maroons us in a factitious fantasy world , an unconscious story that turns us into its victims .
Those of us dedicated to creating a more beautiful world must not lose ourselves in abstraction .
Let us not imagine that we are more intelligent than the Neo-cons in their think tanks or the liberal professors in their universities .
They are just as clever as anyone else at manipulating logic .
All they say follows logically from their premises .
It is the premises that are at fault , and these can not be reasoned out .
Remember that the Neo-cons too believe they are creating a better world .
Only arrogance would say that we , being smarter than they are , can do better .
Indeed , it is arrogance that defines them , and the opposite of arrogance is humility , and to be humble is to constantly open to new truth from the outside , from the real world and not one 's interpretation of it .
That is the only thing that can keep us honest .
Horror results when we get lost in a world of axioms and ideals .
Many before us on left and right have reasoned atrocity out to a nicety .
We stay honest by grounding ourselves again and again in the reality outside representation .
When environmentalists focus on cost - benefit analyses and study data rather than real , physical places , trees , ponds , and animals , they end up making all the sickening compromises of the Beltway .
Liberal economists with the best of intentions cheer when a poor country raises its GDP ; invisible to their statistics is the unraveling of culture and community that fuels the money economy .
Visit a real " mountaintop removal " operation and you know that there is no compromise that is not betrayal .
Visit a real third - world community and the vacuity of free - trade logic is obvious .
See the devastation of a bullet wound or a bomb strike , lives strewn across the street , and the logic of national interest seems monstrous .
Increasingly isolated in a virtual world , the people fear authenticity even as they crave it .
Except in the young , the fear usually prevails over the craving until something happens to make life fall apart .
Following the pattern experienced by Cindy Sheehan , the fundamental corruption of first one , then all of our civilization 's major institutions becomes transparent .
I have seen this many times in various areas of activism .
Someone discovers that the pharmaceutical industry , or the music industry , or the oil industry , or organized religion , or Big Science , or the food industry is shockingly corrupt , but still believes in the basic soundness of the system as a whole .
Eventually , in a natural process of radicalization , they discover that the rot is endemic to all of these and more .
Each institution supports , affirms , and draws its own legitimacy from the others .
So we discover eventually that the wrongness permeates every institution , and we desire to find and uproot its source .
As activists for the truth , we are midwives to this process .
It is not quite true that no one heeds the boy 's cry that the emperor is naked .
Those who are ready to hear will hear , and they are made ready when their world crumbles .
The exposing of all that is wrong serves an important purpose in guiding people from the old world to the threshold of a new – but only to the threshold , not across it .
To enter into the new world requires that we recover the tools of world - creation : first and foremost , the power of word .
A nicer term for a " ubiquitous matrix of lies " would be a " ubiquitous matrix of stories . "
I am not suggesting that we abdicate the creative power of language .
Language is an essential means to coordinate human activity , for beauty as well as for destruction .
The stories we tell with words unite masses of people toward a common goal , and assign the meanings and roles necessary to attain it .
To be sure , images , music , and art , both representational and non-representational , contribute to the weaving of a story , especially evoking the emotional energy that powers it , but information is indispensable as well .
In a new world we will not cease to tell the story of what is and what shall be , but we will become conscious of our storytelling .
The sequel to this essay will explore what I call " storyteller consciousness " on a cultural and personal level , so that we may prepare to tell the story of a more beautiful world , and to speak that world into existence as presidents and kings have spoken wars into existence for thousands of years .
As these old stories fall apart , the time ripens for new ones .
And the old stories are indeed falling apart , of which our increasing immunity to political and commercial speech is a symptom .
No more or less significant a symptom is the crumbling of our great social institutions – education , politics , medicine , money – that are themselves built of a matrix of stories .
When stories fall apart , the world falls apart .
As the crises of our age converge and infiltrate the fortresses we have erected to preserve the virtual world of euphemism and pretense , the world is falling apart for more and more people at once .
The stories that have defined us and bound us are dying .
We sense , as counterpart to the existential anxiety that comes as the old world and our identity within it disintegrates , an invigorating newness close at hand .
So let us cease to be afraid as we stand at the threshold .
It is time to learn the technologies , linguistic and otherwise , of world - creation .

It may be , as offline readership continues to decline , that the mere fact of a bound , printed book with a paper dust jacket is something to celebrate .
But every book jacket designer has at least one that got away — a fresh , inventive cover that was shot down en route to the bookstore shelf .
These “ lost ” covers form a parallel universe in which the books we read and love exist in entirely different skins .
The reasons why cover designs get killed vary :
The author ’s spouse did n’t like it .
The marketing or sales department did n’t think they could sell it .
The chain bookstores said they would only stock it if the cover was red instead of white .
Designers can produce hundreds of compositions before finding one that makes everyone happy .
But does anyone really know whether a given cover sells a book ?
“ We all assume we know something about this body , whatever it is — the buying body or the body politic , ” says Knopf designer Peter Mendelsund .
“ But , frankly , no one has a clue . ”
We asked eight designers to show us their favorite runners - up , and to explain how and why these covers were nixed .
In most cases , the designers were surprisingly sanguine .
“ It ’s actually a good exercise to have to redesign something , ” says free­lance designer Gabriele Wilson .
“ Quite often , the designs end up being stronger than when they started . ”
Carol Devine Carson / Dogwalker by Arthur Bradford / Knopf
Outside the office of Carol Devine Carson , art director for Knopf , is a gallery of also - rans — mocked - up copies of books by Alice Munro , Toni Morrison , and others , all with killed covers .
The one closest to Carson ’s heart is for Arthur Bradford ’s Dogwalker ( 2001 ) , a collection of stories with a cast of half - pet , half - person mutants .
Carson came up with a cheerful baby - puppy hybrid .
“ I showed it to [ Bradford ’s ] editor , ” says Carson , “ and the reaction was really funny , a sort of ‘ Eek ! ’
She said , ‘ It ’s kind of repulsive , it ’s kind of scary , but it ’s kind of charming . ’
So I thought it stood a chance . ”
Bradford admired the cover ’s “ strangeness and creativity , ” he says , but “ something about that dog - baby ’s face struck me as sinister and mocking . ”
After a detail of a pooch from an Old Master painting was rejected , Bradford and Carson chose a quieter canine close - up ; both love the finished product .
“ Looking at [ the original ] cover now , it does n’t seem as ill - fitting as I ’d first thought , ” says Bradford .
“ I have children of my own now , and perhaps a baby ’s face is n’t quite so scary to me . ”
John Gall / Remainder by Tom McCarthy / Vintage
Rare is the designer who ends up killing his own design .
John Gall , art director for Vintage Books , had already received approval for his cover of Remainder , the critically acclaimed 2007 debut novel by British writer Tom McCarthy .
For the story of a man with head trauma who uses his settlement money to stage recreations of his scant remaining memories , Gall ’s initial idea was “ to treat the cover as if it were a slightly damaged artifact , ” he says .
( The concept also nods to the shopworn state of remaindered books . )
But Gall had doubts about his own de­sign , and worried that it was too sedate for a first novel being published as a paperback original .
“ I thought it needed a little something , ” he says , “ some color . ”
His concern led to a series of experiments submerging type in blue liquid , complete with a water tank , various shades of blue dye , and an assistant to swirl the fluid .
At the last minute , a new cover was born .
“ It ended up feeling like we were rehearsing one of the scenes in the book as we slowly lowered the book in and out of the water again . ”
Paul Buckley / God Is Dead by Ron Currie , Jr. / Viking
Paul Buckley , executive creative director for Penguin Books , came up with a bounty of possible covers for God Is Dead , a 2007 collection of short stories by debut writer Ron Currie , Jr. Each expands on the book ’s fantastic premise :
God lands on Earth in the Darfur region , taking on the form of a poor woman , who dies and is eaten by a pack of wild dogs .
The dogs begin to speak about the deicide ; Currie ’s stories recount the frantic effect the news has upon various characters .
Buckley says that his favorite idea was a collage of a falling coffin superimposed
on a seascape , which “ reminded me of the Pink Floyd aesthetic that I ’m so fond of . ”
Unfortunately , Buckley ’s design followed the successful release of a special series of Penguin Classic “ Deluxe Editions ” with covers reconceived by graphic novelists .
The editor and author requested a comix - style jacket ; Buckley asked them to take a second look at his designs , but says that the “ sheer number made them lose focus . ”
In the end , Buckley hired graphic novelist Anders Nilsen , “ who has done fantastic images of talking dogs . …
He nailed it right away . ”
Rodrigo Corral / Stranger Than Fiction : True Stories by Chuck Palahniuk / Anchor
Freelance designer Rodrigo Corral is the visionary behind the sometimes stomach - churning covers of Chuck Palahniuk ’s shock - punk novels .
When Palahniuk published Stranger Than Fiction : True Stories ( 2004 ) , a collection of journalism and personal es­says , Corral designed a photographic cover that visualized a gruesome bit of family history : Palahniuk ’s grandfather going on a murderous rampage as his father hid under the bed .
For the paperback edition , Corral wanted to take the cover in an entirely different direction .
He created a pattern of tiny icons — hatchets , dildos , cockroaches — drawn from every piece in the book , with a half - bear , half - bodybuilder figure ( a reference to Palahniuk ’s ad­ventures with steroids ) in the center , then scribbled out each image with a marker .
It ’s the only one of Corral ’s covers that has ever been rejected .
“ I feel they made a big mistake , ” says Corral , who reverted to the original ominous - shoe cover for the paper­back .
“ Unless you know that particular story , it ’s not as powerful . ”
John Gray / Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer / Houghton Mifflin
East London–based designer Jon Gray of gray318 is best known for his covers — many hand - lettered — for some of fiction ’s bright­est lights .
Gray receives commissions from both American and British publishers , and oversees the design of the U.K. editions of Jonathan Lethem , Jonathan Coe , and Ali Smith .
In the U.S. , how­ever , it ’s his covers for Jonathan Safran Foer that have be­come iconic .
After designing the jacket of Foer ’s massively successful Everything is Illuminated , Gray was given the assign­ment to work on the novelist ’s highly anticipated 2005 follow - up , a story about a boy grappling with the aftermath of September 11 .
The book ’s original title was I ’M OK .
With only a partial manu­script to work with , he came up with an intricate hand - drawn pattern of angels , griffins , and curlicues .
But the cover did n’t prove vi­able when Foer renamed his book Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close .
“ Some­thing told me that maybe this approach was n’t going to work with the new title , ” Gray says .
In the end , though , the designer ’s “ hand ” cover became one of the most in­stantly rec­ognizable book jackets of the year .
Gabriele Wilson / How Perfect Is That by Sarah Bird / Knopf
“ Editors sometimes need to see what does n’t work , in order to figure out what does work , ” says freelance designer Gabriele Wilson .
That process was taken to extremes when Wilson con­ceived a cover for Sarah Bird ’s How Perfect is That .
The novel , originally titled Weightless , has at its center a fallen Texas soci­ety woman who hopes to re-enter her old milieu by opening a high - end catering service .
Wilson ’s earliest comp showed a woman out cold .
“ But they felt that she looked dead , ” Wilson says .
Pushed to make the jacket “ lighter , more fun , ” she says , she experimented with putting status symbols in floating bubbles .
When the title changed , the direction shifted , and Wilson thought the braying ladies in Jessica Craig - Martin ’s party photographs were ideal — “ very decadent and over - the - top . ”
The consensus :
The women were too old .
In the end , Wilson collaborated with Portland , Oregon photographer John Clark to create a great leg shot : “ He had all these models coming in and standing on their heads , ” she says .
Wilson is happy with the finished cover , which is n’t too different from her earliest concept .
Paul Sahre / Notable American Women by Ben Marcus / Vintage
“ It ’s a little like navel - gazing talking about killed work , ” says freelance designer Paul Sahre .
“ It ’s such a part of what you do that putting it out there and going , ‘ See , look how great this was , ’ or ‘ Are n’t I a victim ? ’ is kind of terrible . ’”
Most of the time , he thinks , “ you end up at some better place after something gets killed . ”
He cites as an example his initial design for Ben Marcus ’s debut novel Notable American Women , which was released as a paperback original by Vintage in 2002 .
Marcus ’s story turns on a group of women called the Silentists , who try to get rid of all emo­­tion by not speaking or moving .
Sahre visualized this with stock photos of a brick and a rock .
When the cover got rejected , he came up with a line - drawn - based design .
“ I ’m actually very happy with this .
Still , I look at [ the original cover ] again , and this would have been a better cover .
But then that other cover would n’t have happened . ”
Happily , he was able to recycle the initial science - textbook concept to illustrate a New York Times op - ed column .
Peter Mendelsund / Send : The Essential Guide to Email for Office and Home by David Shipley and Will Schwalbe / Knopf
Peter Mendelsund , a senior designer at Knopf , did “ hundreds ” of comps for Send , a 2007 guide to e-mail etiquette .
The book met with “ huge excitement ” at the house , he says .
One of his earliest designs was a rude twist on the Macintosh cursor icon .
“ I think that maybe alone would have helped sell the book , ” says Mendelsund .
But initial enthusiasm from the sales and mar­ket­ing departments turned to concern over whether chains would stock the title .
A later design mimicked an e-mail window , with symbols standing in for the kind of ill - advised language the authors warn against transmitting .
“ There ’s nothing particu­larly arty or fantastic about it , ” says Mendelsund , “ but it has some­thing that maybe makes you smile a little bit . ”
At the last minute , even those symbols made people balk , and a tamer cover made the cut .
Mendelsund believes that the excitement of posi­tioning the book eclipsed the wit and charm of the authors .
Sales were disappointing .
This fall , Knopf is giving Send another chance , re­-launching it with a brand - new , non-Mendulsund cover .
" I guarantee that this game could n't be working on XBox 360 .
It would be impossible .
I 'm 100 percent sure of this . "
Christophe Balestra , co-president of Naughty Dog , spoke with Ars about the technology behind Uncharted 2 , the hugely anticipated follow - up to one of the PS3's best games : Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune .
" First of all , we fill the Blu-ray 100 percent , we have no room left on this one .
We have 25 GB of data ; we 're using every single bit of it . "
Naughty Dog is owned by Sony , and while the developer makes wonderful games , it 's very clear why we were there : to talk about the power of the PlayStation 3 .
Balestra pointed out how important it is to ship every system with a hard drive .
" The fact that every PS3 has a hard drive is huge for us . "
He went on to describe how the game takes advantage of Sony 's offerings .
" It 's the combination of Blu-ray and hard drive .
You can play the entire game without loading .
We do n't require an install .
We 're doing all the post - processing effects on the SPUs [ Synergistic Processing Units ] .
The quality of the depth of field we have , you can't do that on the Xbox . "
He was blunt about what Uncharted 2 means for the PlayStation 3 .
" We 've invested a lot of time maximizing the power of the machine , " he stated .
" That 's our job , to make the PS3 shine . "
What they 've learned
For the first game , Balestra estimated that they used around 30 percent of the power of the SPUs , now the team was able to use them to 100 percent capacity .
Naughty Dog understands the Cell processor , and knows how to get it to sing .
" The ability to use the RSX [ the PS3's graphics processor ] to draw your pixels on the screen , then you use the Cell to do gameplay and animations — we kind of took the step of using the Cell process to help the RSX .
All those things are done on the Cell processor , " he explained .
" It really helps us getting that quality of lighting per pixel ; the amount of computation is pretty crazy . "
Naughty Dog also used the SPUs to add physics to the sound so things occlude properly .
That means that if you 're behind a door , the sound will reflect that .
Effects will sound different depending on where your character is in relation to the source .
" All that math is done on SPUs to immerse players into the environment , " he said .
If you have a surround - sound setup for your PS3 , this could very well be your new showcase title .
The other improvements from getting closer to the metal with PS3 development will be more easily seen by even those without high - end audio systems : better performance , and better AI .
" We had a pretty good AI system on Uncharted , but we wanted to have more [ non- player characters ] , we wanted to have also more enemies on the screen . "
All this goes on behind the scenes , but it leads to a game world that feels real .
The characters react realistically to what 's going on , the sound is shaped by where you are and what you 're doing , and the amount of action Naughty Dog was able to put on the screen is impressive ; the set pieces we 've seen from the game so far look more like a heavily choreographed film than something that 's interactive and playable .
It takes a lot of horsepower to make that happen , and Naughty Dog now has the experience to squeeze every drop from the PS3 .
Being first - party has its responsibilities
Uncharted 2 is going to be a showpiece title for the PlayStation 3 , and Balestra notes that the knowledge and technical know - how used to create the game is something the team shares .
" One thing we did for Uncharted is that we made the source code available to all the first parties , " he explained .
There is a team at Naughty Dog that 's separate from those working on the game ; their mandate is to work on technology that 's shared with both first - and third - parties .
" They know how we 're using the SPUs ; they are free to look at how we 're doing things and package it in such a way that it can be shared with third parties , " Balestra told Ars .
Developers from Naughty
Dog give talks at GDC , and the team often has third - party developers coming into the offices to discuss PlayStation 3 tech .
Balestra said they have time set aside to speak with other developers after the game is finished — as of this writing they 're nine days away from submission .
" We 're very open , yes .
That 's part of our jobs . "
All this technology serves one goal : to make a good game
It 's hard to think about the technical aspects of gaming and still keep one fact in mind : if it 's not fun , all that work is for nothing .
Thankfully , Uncharted 2 has personality and character to spare .
We asked Balestra to name the one thing he wanted to improve from the first game , and he became somewhat philosophical .
" Sometimes people ask us about what is the one thing [ we improved ] on Uncharted 2 , and it 's hard to answer .
We 're trying to increase the quality of the game , so we 're design - driven .
No matter what it takes , we 'll find a way to figure it out , to squeeze what we need to squeeze out of [ the system ] to make it happen . "
The artist says his gnomes ridicule , rather than glorify , the Nazis A garden gnome giving the Nazi salute has landed a German artist in trouble with the authorities in Nuremberg .
Prosecutors are investigating whether the gnome , which went on show in one of the city 's galleries , breaks the strict law banning Nazi symbols and gestures .
The Bavarian city is particularly sensitive about the Nazi era because Adolf Hitler used it for big rallies and leading Nazis went on trial there .
The artist , Ottmar Hoerl , says his gnomes poke fun at the Nazis .
" I 'm astonished that a single garden gnome , in what is for me an obscure gallery in Nuremberg , has unleashed such a public discussion because of an anonymous denunciation by someone , " Mr Hoerl said .
The 59 - year - old artist has been president of Nuremberg 's Academy of Fine Arts since 2005 .
" I did n't put it in the art gallery .
Someone must have bought it and put it there .
But I do n't know what all the fuss is about .
" With my gnomes I 'm highlighting the danger of political opportunism and right - wing ideology .
I get the feeling that this gnome has reopened an old wound , " he said .
It 's a comical figure - all kinds of people have made that gesture
Erwin Weigl
Gallery owner
The results of the investigation are expected in a few days , the BBC's Berlin correspondent Steve Rosenberg reports , adding that the 40 cm ( 15.7 - inch ) figure still reminds Germans of a terrifying past .
Last year hundreds of Mr Hoerl 's " Nazi " gnomes went on show in the Belgian city of Gent , in an exhibition called " Dance with the Devil " .
He said that Belgians had well understood the political meaning " when one portrays the master race as a garden gnome " .
" In 1942 I would have been murdered by the Nazis for this work , " he said .
A spokesman for the Nuremberg public prosecutor 's office , Wolfgang Traeg , said " we 're checking to see if garden gnomes fall into the same clear category as posters that show the swastika crossed out " .
He said the aim was to establish whether the artist and the gallery owner had intended the gnome as an endorsement of the Third Reich or as a rejection of Nazi ideology .
Mr Traeg referred to a previous case : a swastika which had been graffitied onto a wall .
No prosecution was brought because the picture featured a fist smashing the Nazi symbol .
The gallery owner who put the gnome in the window maintains he has done nothing wrong .
" I think it 's quite harmless , " Erwin Weigl told the BBC .
" It was sitting in the window for two weeks and no one complained .
It 's a comical figure .
All kinds of people have made that gesture .
Julius Caesar did it .
Even Barack Obama does it now .
To me , it looks a bit like when you gesture to a dachshund to jump up to your hand . "

The Federal Reserve chose a labor leader to succeed a former Goldman Sachs executive as the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of New York 's private - sector board of directors .
Denis Hughes , president of the New York state branch of the AFL - CIO , had been serving as acting chairman of the New York Fed board since May , when Stephen Friedman stepped down from the position .
Mr. Friedman , a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chairman and adviser to President George W. Bush , had faced questions about his purchases of Goldman stock while serving on the New York Fed 's board .
The Fed decision formalizes Mr. Hughes 's role as chairman through the end of 2009 .
The Fed board in Washington will announce in November or December who will serve as chairman in 2010 .
Columbia University President Lee Bollinger was named deputy chairman , a position that Mr. Hughes previously held .
Mr. Bollinger has been a New York Fed director since January 2007 .
The New York Fed chairmanship typically has gone to prominent Wall Street executives or academics .
The ascension of a labor leader is a new twist for the New York Fed and a sign of the public pressure the Fed has been under to loosen its close ties to Wall Street .
TPM Reader DM :
It really is amazing to watch a fringe right - wing movement completely dominate the narrative surrounding the health care debate .
The Democratic Party has the strongest governing coalition we have seen in years , and yet , they are being run over by misinformation campaign that includes lies so bold and outrageous that one actually grows to gain begrudging respect for the Machiavellian mindset that allows otherwise seemingly rational people to perpetuate this stuff on a public whose gullibility should never again be underestimated .
So , what should the Dems do ?
For one thing , is n’t it time to just once call a lie a lie ?
Although I support a rational - deliberative approach to politics as a principle , there are some contexts where it just does n’t work .
There are some conversations , we have all had them , that start with premises that are so outrageous that in the process of stumbling about about looking for a way to respond that we actually , and quite unintentionally , end up giving credibility to the craziness of the initial premise .
It seems to me that our Democratic representatives are becoming caught up in these types of conversations time - after - time at the so - called town meetings .
Would n’t a much more effective approach at this point in the game be simply be to look at one of these tea baggers in the eye and say “ sir , you are misinformed , you are listening to lies . ”
Simple , quick clean and strong .
We need to change the optics of this debate and it is getting painful to watch our representatives stumble around responding to the lunacy of the fringe right - wing .
We should start treating their lies with the clarity it deserves … ” you are being mislead sir .
You are being lied to . ”

Let us contemplate the day in the near future when the consequences of financial chicanery finally outpace the ability of the governments , central banks and big media to cover up and obfuscate the truth .
Many respected voices have now gone on record that September 30 or thereabouts will be that day .
Bob Chapman [ Internationalforecaster.com ] revealed that the US State Dept has advised embassies worldwide to stock up on a year 's worth of the local currency in anticipation of collapse of the US dollar .
Look for a temporary banking shutdown timed for around September 2009 .
As under Roosevelt , some banks wo n't reopen .
96 % of bank reserves are currently held with the Federal Reserve who tells the banks not to loan the money , but rather to save it for further banking acquisition and consolidation .
Chapman foresees a bank holiday lasting 4 - 5 days .
Chapman thinks this first bank holiday presages a much more significant bank holiday months to years later which will involve simultaneous devaluations of multiple currencies as well as other significant changes in the banking system .
Harry Shultz [ as quoted in marketwatch.com ] says " Some U.S. embassies worldwide are being advised to purchase massive amounts of local currencies ; enough to last them a year .
Some embassies are being sent enormous amounts of U.S. cash to purchase currencies from those governments , quietly .
But not pound sterling .
Inside the State Dept. , there is a sense of sadness and foreboding that ' something ' is about to happen ... within 180 days , but could be 120 - 150 days . "
Benjamin Fulford [ http://benjaminfulford.
typepad.com/benjaminfulford/ ] states that for almost a century the US Treasury Dept has been issuing specialized debt instruments to countries with which the US has had a trade surplus .
These complex debt instruments are tailored by complex treaties .
Unfortunately , the recent US Treasury funding needs exceed the willingness of these creditor nations to extend additional credit .
Fulford writes , " The problem is that after nearly a century of issuing these debt instruments , the chickens are coming home to roost .
President Obama tried at the recent G8 plus 5 meeting in Italy to borrow more money than George Bush junior did in 8 years .
He was told a resounding no .
The result should be total economic chaos in the U.S. by September 30th . "
Jim Willie [ goldenjackass.com ] writes of an Asian led initiative ending dollar hegemony beginning this weekend .
Willie suspects that the Fed / Treasury is covertly loaning foreign central banks the money with which the central banks are now using to buy US debt .
Increasingly , US debt is being bought by foreign central banks taking up the slack of investors abandoning US Treasury debt .
Willie confirms Chapman 's comments and says he solicited and received " multiple confirmations . "
He adds , " CHAOS WILL PREVAIL WITHIN SEVERAL MONTHS , PERHAPS A YEAR AT MOST {his emphasis} . "
Jim Sinclair [ jsmineset.com ] has recently visited China meeting with its leaders .
He states that China is increasingly more willing to take on the United States in its apparent maneuvers to inflate its way out of its debt crisis .
In early July Sinclair started a 120 day countdown till breakdown of the US dollar ends market manipulation and all those sour economic chickens come home to roost .
OUT OF TRICKS
Seemingly the Federal Reserve / US
Treasury have exhausted their bag of tricks .
The Fed is fighting rising interest rates , a difficult task given the hyperinflationary debt financing it is now doing .
Once rising pressure on interest rates become too much for the Fed to control , there will probably be several sudden economic and financial surprises cascading with currently known dilemmas : crashing dollar ; increasing home mortgage defaults ; commercial mortgage defaults reaching critical mass ; falling bond and stock markets extending insolvency of pension funds ; defaults on debt by state and local governments .
And do n't forget derivatives and further exposure of corruption and criminality on Wall Street .
Bernie Madoff may soon have lots of company .
Unable to produce any more financial wizardry , the cynical federal government is arrayed in full battle dress uniform : 1 ] Mass forced swine flu vaccinations scheduled this fall performed under the specter of martial law ; 2 ] Rumblings of extending the wars in Asia into Iran and Pakistan ; 3 ]
Rekindling the Korean conflict may also be in the cards .
Of course , do n't forget that both Iran and North Korea are client states of the British World Order .
All the recent saber rattling involving Iran and North Korea is wholly orchestrated .
We need the distractions from the economic crisis , so our clients Ahmadinejad and Kim provide us with the necessary theater .
So what will come first , further banner headlines of dollar collapse and market crashes or the distracting theater of more war or 911 type events ?
What will this fall really bring ?
It is not too far away so we shall soon know .
Unfortunately , it may make last fall look pretty tame .
When the government answers economic distress by preparing for the worst , then the worst may very well be what happens .

This morning , I was helping a homeowner understand why nobody had connected with her yet to walk her through the basics of solar and give her a quote .
You ’d think solar installers out there would be happy to speak with anyone interested in solar , right ?
Actually , where you get your power from can be just as important as what incentives are available in your state to make going solar more sensible .
Take the case of the Guernsey - Muskingum Electric Cooperative in Southeastern Ohio .
They get a lot of their electricity from nearby nuclear and coal plants .
This is pretty typical .
What is not typical however is how they bill their customers for the electricity they use .
On the left here , look at this .
The co-op is creating an incentive for ordinary homeowners to USE MORE POWER ?!
That ’s right , as you move above 6000 kwh in the calendar year , you get a lower electric rate .
This is a regressive tax !
Rich people with giant electricity sucking homes are going to be paying less on average for their electricity than those that live more modest lifestyles and conserve power .
How backwards is that ?!
I do n’t know what geniuses made up this rate schedule , but they sure as hell did n’t learn from the success of the tiered rate schedules in California .
Californians conserve more electricity and pursue other options to get it ( including solar ) not just because they are hippy liberals .
It ’s because of those tiered rate schedules .
When Californians use more electricity , they have to pay more for each kilowatt at higher and higher levels of use .
One of the reasons solar makes so much sense there is because the electricity produced by the PV system gets homeowners out of higher rate tiers , making payback a hell of a lot faster .
Until some of these cooperatives get their heads out of the sand , we ’ve got a long way to go for solar energy to reach parity with the electric grid in many parts of the country .

A Beverly Hills , California man is suing Apple , the St. Louis Police Department , the FBI , an auto mechanic , and others for aiding and abetting the Italian Mafia 's attempt to force him to become a New York fashion model .
Plaintiff George McKenna filed a painstakingly detailed 124 - page pro se complaint with the US District Court of the Eastern District of Missouri contending that his troubles began when " three members of the alleged Italian Mafia proceeded to threaten to murder Plaintiff at a nightclub called Velvet located in St. Louis , Missouri . "
The nefarious Mafiosi , it seemed , made McKenna an offer he could n't refuse in their plot to force him to continue working as a fashion model at a New York agency called Bossmodels .
" We 're going to kill you if you do n't model for us in New York , " the bad guys allegedly threatened the refusenik Brüno .
A few weeks later , when the Mafia appeared at his home , McKenna - as would any right - minded citizen - called the St. Louis Police Department .
And that 's when things got weird .
" Despite being held at gunpoint and receiving threats of imminent death from the Mafia members , the STLPD officers wrongfully refused to arrest the perpetrators and left the scene of the crime , " which allowed the miscreants to " stalk , make extortion threats , attempt rape , and kidnap Plaintiff . "
McKenna tried to get help from the FBI .
But no dice .
They said it was an STLPD matter .
Then the Mafia began to harass McKenna through " illegal communication devices planted in his home , vehicle , residence , workplace , church , and other places that he publicly frequents . "
Understandably , he hired a private investigations company with the reassuringly professional name of A - 1 Private Investigations to sweep his home for bugs - which the complaint alleges were found in his " bedroom , living room , upstairs bathroom , and Toyota Camry . "
However , after McKenna presented the bug - discovering report to the STLPD , A - 1 denied it .
" As a direct and proximate result , the Mafia was allowed to continue stalking , extorting , and torturing Plaintiff . "
The auto mechanic entered the saga when he diagnosed a loud sound coming from the rear passenger side of McKenna 's 1998 Audi A4 Quattro as being a loose wheel bearing , which McKenna contends was actually caused by " illegal communication devices being used by the Mafia to stalk , extort , and torture Plaintiff . "
McKenna discovered that the mechanic was in on the plot when he began to hear the same sound in other cars in which he was a passenger .
He bought himself a bug detector , which he says proved his suspicions correct .
Then he bought an iPod shuffle on eBay , but discovered to his dismay that Apple had " manufactured it with an illegal receiver " to aid and abet those pesky Mafiosi .
So he switched to an iPod nano .
But he says that it too was bugged and that it played " ' I 'm about to kill him ' in unison with a song . "
An iPod mini was also in on the plot , he says , along with an iBook G4 , PowerBook G4 , and the sound systems in McKenna 's Camry and Quattro , plus his mom's Honda Accord .
There the Mafia - presumably in concert with Apple et al - modified the song Still Tippin by Mike Jones to insert the word " herpes " into the rap , thusly : " Tippin ' on four fours , wrapped in four vogues , HERPES " ( emphasis in the original ) .
Finally , McKenna switched to an iPod touch .
But he says Apple was ahead of him , having programmed the device to " generate death threats stating ' I 'm going to kill him ' " when he listened to " Cafe Style 1 " by the Toka Project .
Although McKenna complained directly to Apple about the bugged iPod touch , " Defendant APPLE , INC .
proceeded to ignore Plaintiff 's complaint . "
We know how you feel , Mr. McKenna .
All through this tale of woe and intrigue , the STLPD and FBI have been of no help whatsoever , even though McKenna has filed a total of 53 complaints with them since September 2000 .
So now he wants his day in court - plus $ 1 million from each of the nine defendants , $ 100 per day or $ 10,000 ( whichever is greater ) since the beginning of the ordeal , $ 550,000 per year in lost income , and damages to be determined by a jury .
It 's not for us to say whether McKenna is a few sandwiches short of a picnic .
In fact , some aspects of his tale , especially in the early days of the ordeal , have more than a wisp of plausibility .
Perhaps he had a tenuous hold on reality to begin with and his grasp slipped away under pressure from actual evildoers .
Besides , just because you 're paranoid does n't mean that someone - perhaps even the Italian Mafia - is n't out to get you . ®
He is dirty and frail , his speech punctuated by a hard , rasping cough that buckles his small frame .
He frequently spits up a brownish gunk on to the sludge outside G - hostel , the hub of illegal mining activities in Thabong , a township outside Welkom .
Sipho Mahabane is 22 but looks 10 years older .
He ’s worked as a zama zama ( illegal miner ) for four years and is a resident of G - hostel .
He stays with his grandmother in the hostel .
“ She took me from my mother when I was still a child .
My siblings live nearby in an RDP site called Smarties .
I do n’t want to stay with them because there are no opportunities there .
I like it here at G - hostel . ”
Despite the recent disaster that has so far claimed the lives of 85 of his manyora ( homeboys or comrades ) , he is sure that illegal mining will not stop .
“ We are all waiting for the noise to die down and then we will go down again , ” he says , lowering his voice to avoid being heard by hostel residents passing by .
“ There ’ll always be a demand for gold on the black market . ”
Learning to operate underground is not “ a choice but a must for survival ” .
According to Mahabane , foreign gold smugglers – mainly from Limpopo and Mozambique — and local business people control illegal mining operations in the area .
He says the kingpins operate syndicates , which include legal miners , shift managers and security guards .
The kingpins regularly visit G - hostel .
“ We do n’t organise for ourselves to go down — the managers help us .
They are known in the township and they like hanging around the hostel in their nice cars . ”
Hostel dwellers regularly approach them for work .
Once a team of between 60 and 80 miners has been assembled they are sent underground to mine ore , often staying for periods longer than three months .
“ The longest I ’ve been down was eight months .
I worked for a local businessman from Welkom , ” Mahabane says .
It ’s dusty , stuffy and cold down there , he says , and miners light fires to keep warm .
There are designated areas for relieving yourself — and with all the digging plenty of sand to cover up the mess .
Communication with the surface is by walkie - talkie .
For entertainment the miners hold parties and “ drink a lot ” .
But for that they pay .
Although the kingpins supply them with food , water and security when they ’re underground , miners pay inflated amounts for anything extra .
Cigarettes go for between R200 and R400 a pack of 20 ( depending on the brand ) , Oudemeester brandy from R800 to R1 000 and Fish Eagle whisky close to R1 500 .
Those with a sweet tooth fork out R20 for a lollipop .
The kingpins pay the guards R1 500 to R2 000 a go to secure access to the shafts for illegal miners .
“ When we are down we know that we are safe from the police or any danger from outside because they tell us when there ’s something wrong , ” Mahabane says .
“ The kingpins are our buyers .
We work hard for them and they reward us .
We know that they make more from the gold but we do n’t care , so long they give us something . ”
Illegal miners do not only enter at disused mine shafts , they also use active ones .
There are several points of entry such as “ Pamodzi ’s President Steyn shaft and the Intermines ” .
He says access to these two mines is extremely easy because the kingpins have good relations with managerial staff .
Life underground is often violent because miners fight for spots .
“ A lot of people have been killed underground for causing problems and some have been killed because they were hated , ” Mahabane says .
“ There are committees underground and once these guys decide that you should be killed , it ’s over .
The worst I saw was when they used a cutting torch and burned a guy to pieces . ”
About five skilled legal miners are needed to supervise a large group of illegal miners .
They supply equipment such as dynamite , pickaxes , sledgehammers , lights and cutting torches .
They also show the illegal miners where to dig and blast .
Digging is done in shifts , ensuring a 24 - hour operation .
“ We dig and blast the rocks and afterwards we put them and the soil particles inside sacks .
Then we crush the rocks and the soil inside the sacks until they are fine particles .
Afterwards we start smelting the ore underground , ” says Mahabane .
Producing a lump of gold the size of a fist can take about three months underground , depending on the quality of the rock or sand .
Mahabane has been paid a lot of money in the past but he remains poor .
The largest amount he claims to have received is R80 000 in 2006 .
“ I was stupid then .
I bought a second - hand Golf GTI from some of the thugs at the hostel .
I drove it for only a few months and it was finished . ”
He admits they were warned three weeks ago by some Harmony miners that there was a gas leak .
“ They said the leak seldom happens but that when it happens everybody underground should go to the surface because it could get very dangerous .
We went out and a week later we heard about the Eland accident . ”
On Wednesday scores of Lesotho nationals waited outside the Welkom mortuary for another round of identifying bodies .
The rain and cold reduced the stench of decomposition .
Hearses , bakkies and a truck supplied by the Lesotho government waited to take the corpses back to Lesotho .
“ Upon reaching Maseru the corpses will be put in the government mortuary and families will be called to come and fetch their loved ones , ” said Lesotho High Commission representative Sethunya Koqo .
The influx of illegal miners is impossible to control because when they resurface Lesotho miners are envied by youngsters in the villages and are treated like rock stars .
“ These guys go back to Lesotho driving fancy cars and wearing fancy clothes and bearing gifts for their families , ” says police captain Stephen Thakeng .
So far at least 38 bodies of Lesotho nationals have been identified and 24 have been removed and sent home .
The zama way
Zama zamas dig and blast the rocks containing ore using sledgehammers and blasters supplied by mine staff .
After collecting the rocks and sand particles they put them into a sack .
The rocks inside the sack are then crushed with a hammer or against a hard surface to form fine particles .
Once the rocks and fragments are reduced to fine particles , the zama zamas take a small empty gas cylinder and widen the opening .
This kind of cylinder is called lephenduka or mill .
The cylinder is then filled with the crushed rock and sand particles , mercury and cold water , and it is spun around for about an hour .
The contents are then poured into a smaller bucket , which is immediately dipped up and down inside a bigger bucket filled with cold water .
This movement filters out the soil particles , while the mercury holds down the ore at the bottom of the smaller bucket .
The final product is called the amalgam .
A cloth is then wrapped around the amalgam and it is tightly wrung to take out the mercury .
The amalgam is then put into a steel smelting pot and burnt using a cutting torch .
This process of smelting ore takes hours and requires a lot of patience .
After smelting and cooling the zama zamas use a salt - like substance called borax to clean up the silver - looking ore to bring out the golden colour .
The product is then sent to the surface to syndicates which then pay the illegal miners when they resurface .

Remains of U.S. Pilot Missing 18 Years in Iraq Found
Sunday , August 02 , 2009
Remains of the first American lost in the 1991 Persian Gulf War have been found in the Anbar province of Iraq after a nearly 20 - year search , the U.S. Navy said Sunday .
The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology has positively identified the remains of Captain Michael " Scott " Speicher , whose disappearance has bedeviled investigators since his jet was shot down over the Iraq desert on the first night of the 1991 war .
The Navy said the discovery illustrates the military 's commitment to bring its troops home .
" This is a testament to how the Navy never stops looking for one of its own .
No matter how long it takes , " Commander Cappy Surette , a spokesman for the U.S. Navy , told FOX News .
Admiral Gary Roughead , Chief of Naval Operations , added , " we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Captain Speicher and his family for the sacrifice they have made for our nation and the example of strength they have set for all of us . "
The Pentagon initially declared Speicher killed , but uncertainty  and the lack of remains  led officials over the years to change his official status a number of times to " missing in action " and later " missing - captured . "
Family spokeswoman Cindy Laquidara said relatives learned on Saturday that Speicher 's remains had been found .
" The family 's proud of the way the Defense Department continued on with our request " to not abandon the search for the downed pilot , she said .
" We will be bringing him home . "
Laquidara said the family would have another statement after being briefed by the defense officials , but she did n't know when that would be .
" My heart goes out to the family , again , " said Sen . Bill Nelson , the Florida senator who was instrumental several years ago in getting the Navy to renew a search for the missing pilot .
" We all clung to the slim hope that Scott was still alive and would one day come home to his family . "
After years , the 2003 U.S. - led invasion of Iraq finally gave investigators the chance to search inside Iraq .
And it led to a number of leads , including what some believed were the initials " MSS " scratched into the wall of an Iraqi prison .
The search also led investigators to excavate a potential grave site in Baghdad in 2005 , track down Iraqis said to have information about Speicher and make numerous other inquiries in what officials say has been an exhaustive search .
Officials said Sunday that they got new information from an Iraqi citizen in early July , leading Marines stationed in Anbar province to a location in the desert which was believed to be the crash site of Speicher 's jet .
The Iraqi said he knew of two other Iraqis who recalled an American jet crashing and the remains of the pilot being buried in the desert .
" One of these Iraqi citizens stated that they were present when Captain Speicher was found dead at the crash site by Bedouins and his remains buried , " the Pentagon said in a statement .
He was positively identified through a jawbone found at the site and dental records , said Read Adm.
Frank Thorp .
Speicher was shot down over west - central Iraq on Jan. 17 , 1991 .
Hours after his plane went down , the Pentagon publicly declared him killed  then Defense Secretary Dick Cheney went on television and announced the U.S. had suffered its first casualty of the war .
But 10 years later , the Navy changed his status to missing in action , citing an absence of evidence that Speicher had died .
In October 2002 , the Navy switched his status to " missing / captured , " although it has never said what evidence it had that he ever was in captivity .
Another review was done in 2005 with information gleaned after Baghdad fell .
The review board recommended then that the Pentagon work with the State Department , the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the Iraqi government to " increase the level of attention and effort inside Iraq " to resolve the question of Speicher 's fate .
Last year , then Navy Secretary Donald Winter ordered yet another review of the case after receiving a report from the Defense Intelligence Agency , which tracks prisoners of war and service members missing in action .
Many in the military believed for years that Speicher had not survived the crash or for long after ; intelligence had never found evidence he was alive , and some officials felt last year that all leads had been exhausted and Speicher would finally be declared killed .
But after the latest review , Winter said Speicher would remain classified as missing , despite his strong reservations about the pilot 's status and cited " compelling " evidence that he was dead .
Announcing his decision , Winter criticized the board 's recommendation to leave Speicher 's status unchanged , saying the review board based its conclusions on the belief that Speicher was alive after ejecting from his plane .
The board " chose to ignore " the lack of any parachute sighting , emergency beacon signal or radio communication , Winter said .
Speicher 's family  including two college - age children who were toddlers when Speicher disappeared  believed more evidence would surface as Iraq became more stable .

Fox News reports :
A New York Times article on Sunday discussed the debate over whether more and more potent types of cannabis affect the levels of addiction to the drug .
This particular issue has become part of the larger debate over whether marijuana should be legalized or decriminalized .
Antidrug activists say that if the drug is legalized , more people will use it and addiction levels , made worse by the increased potency , will rise too .
Legalization advocates note that pot addiction is not nearly as destructive as , say , abuse of alcohol .
What would be the effect of legalization or decriminalization on marijuana abuse and addiction ?
Roger Roffman is a professor of social work at the University of Washington .
Marijuana dependence occurs in 9 percent of Americans who have ever used the drug , and between 33 percent and 50 percent of those who smoke it daily .
Approximately 3.6 million Americans are daily or near daily users .
In 20 years of marijuana dependence counseling studies at the University of Washington , those who ’ve sought help averaged 10 years of daily or near daily use and had unsuccessfully tried to quit more than six times .
There might be a big difference between legalization and decriminalization when it comes to the dependence issue .
Surveys indicate increasingly positive attitudes in the U.S. for liberalizing marijuana policies .
Two ways of doing this are : ( 1 ) legalization , which would involve lawful cultivation and sale of marijuana , and ( 2 ) decriminalization , which would retain criminal penalties for cultivation and sale while removing them for possession of small amounts .
Will more people use marijuana and become dependent if marijuana is decriminalized ?
Probably not .
A number of U.S. studies tell us decriminalization would not likely have an effect on the rates of marijuana use by adults or adolescents .
What if marijuana is legalized ?
No one can say for certain .
Using one country ’s reform example to estimate what would happen in another is very risky .
How countries differ ( cultural , social , political , economic ) makes a big difference .
However , the Dutch “ coffee shops ” example might give us a little insight .
The de facto legalization policy in the Netherlands did not , in itself , affect rates of marijuana use among adults or young people .
But rates of use among young people increased when the number of coffee shops increased and the age of legal access was 16 .
Then these rates declined when the numbers of coffee shops was reduced and the age of legal access became 18 .
A cautious conclusion , as I see it , is that any consideration of legalization should include careful planning for how those who are most vulnerable to harm from marijuana use , children and adolescents , can be protected .
I support finding alternatives to criminal penalties for marijuana possession .
Those penalties have costs ( being jailed , having a criminal record , barriers to employment , loss of scholarships , to name a few ) and may accomplish little in deterring use .
However , our debates need more honesty .
Those favoring liberalizing marijuana policy ought to stop inferring that marijuana is harmless ; it is not .
Those who believe possession should remain a crime need to acknowledge that most adult occasional users are not harmed , and should be prepared to defend with data the belief that criminalizing possession is the best way to avoid harm .
Mitigating Dependence
Wayne Hall is a professor of public health policy at the School of Population Health at the University of Queensland in Australia .
What effect would marijuana legalization have on dependence ?
Some people remain skeptical about whether marijuana dependence exists but let ’s assume that it does and that it affects around 1 in 10 of those who use marijuana .
The effects that legalization has on marijuana dependence depend critically on what we mean by the term .
Marijuana use increased in the Netherlands in the 1990s , but this was also the case in the rest of Europe .
If we mean replacing imprisonment with a fine as the penalty for using marijuana then legalization would have little effect on dependence .
Evaluations of this policy in 11 U.S. states in the 1970s and 1980s found little or no effect on rates of use among adolescents and adults .
There is more debate about the effects of allowing a de facto legal marijuana market as the Netherlands has done since 1983 in tolerating the sale of small amounts of marijuana in coffee shops .
Marijuana use increased in the Netherlands in the 1990s , but this was also the case in the rest of Europe , and policy analysts disagree about whether rates of use increased faster in the Netherlands than elsewhere .
If by legalization we mean making it legal to use , grow and sell marijuana then our task becomes more speculative because no modern country has adopted this policy .
It seems common sense that legalizing marijuana use and sales would lead to more people using it regularly and this would probably mean more marijuana dependence .
Nonetheless it is difficult to say how much use may increase because there are options for reducing use under a legal market that are not now available .
For example , we could tax marijuana to set the price at a level that discourages casual use , regulate its THC content , restrict sales to minors , include a health warning on packs and advise users on ways to reduce dependence risks ( e.g. by using less than weekly ) .
These possibilities make it difficult to predict the effect that a legal market would have on rates of marijuana dependence .
Marijuana dependence should be taken into account in considering whether we should legalize marijuana in any of these ways .
But this concern also needs to be weighed against the costs of current policy , that is , the creation of perverse incentives to produce more potent marijuana , the widespread disregard of legal prohibition on marijuana use that could contribute to a decline in respect for law and policing ; the unregulated access of minors to marijuana ; and the social and economic costs of a large marijuana black market .
Not Your Grandfather ’s Pot ?
Mark A.R. Kleiman is a professor of public policy at U.C.L.A. , the editor of the Journal of Drug Policy Analysis and the author of “ Against Excess : Drug Policy for Results . ”
His new book , “ When Brute Force Fails : How to Have Less Crime and Less Punishment , ” will be published later this summer .
One of the standard arguments against the legalization of cannabis is that “ this is not your grandfather ’s pot ” : cannabis , say the drug warriors , is much stronger now than it was a generation ago .
It is , therefore , much more dangerous , and must remain prohibited .
Whatever we do about cannabis will leave us with most of the nation ’s drug - related problems .
That argument is a few bricks shy of a full load .
Here are some of those bricks .
1 . The average gram of cannabis sold today contains much more Δ - 9 - trahydrocannabinol ( THC ) than the average gram sold in 1970 , though there has always been some highly potent product available .
2. Emergency - room visits and treatment admissions related to cannabis have increased , though the number of self - reported cannabis users has n’t .
3 . If the only change were in potency as measured by THC content , users could ( and do ) compensate by smoking smaller quantities .
4 . But contemporary cannabis also has a much higher ratio of THC ( which tends to induce anxiety ) to cannabidiol ( CBD , which tends to relieve anxiety ) .
That would be expected to create a higher rate of panic attacks .
5 . Whether high - THC , high - ratio pot is also more habit - forming than other pot remains unknown .
Increased treatment admissions might come from increased enforcement pressure against users .
Or perhaps a cannabis habit is harder to live with than it used to be because the cannabis experience is more disturbing .
6 . If cannabis were made legal , restrictions could be put both on potency and on the THC / CBD ratio .
So rising potency makes no sense as an anti-legalization argument ; if anything , less - potent legal pot would be expected to substitute for the more - potent pot that would remain illegal .
7 . Any sort of flat - out legalization would risk a large increase in the number of very heavy users .
A legal cannabis industry , like the legal alcohol industry , would derive more than half its revenue from people with diagnosable substance abuse disorders .
Telling marketers they can get rich by creating disease is dangerous .
8 . Instead we could choose a “ grow your own ” policy that would allow production for personal use or by small nonprofit cooperatives , but forbid commercial sales .
Cannabis policy is fascinating because so many people smoke the stuff , but whatever we do about cannabis will leave us with most of the nation ’s drug abuse problems , which center on alcohol , and most of the nation ’s drug - market and drug - enforcement problems , which center on cocaine , methamphetamine and heroin .
Lessons From the Dutch
Peter Reuter is a professor at the School of Public Policy and the Department of Criminology at the University of Maryland .
Experimenting with marijuana has long been a normal part of growing up in the U.S. ; about half of the population born since 1960 has tried the drug by age 21 .
Perhaps one out of six has used it for a year or more .
This statement is increasingly true of other Western countries such as Australia and Britain .
Over the last decade most of these countries have seen three trends ; sharp increases in the number of marijuana users seeking treatment , in the potency of the marijuana consumed and in the number of arrests .
For example , in the European Union the number of people entering treatment programs for marijuana dependence tripled between 1999 and 2005 .
In the U.S. , the potency of seized marijuana has steadily increased since the late 1970s , while arrests for simple possession have tripled since 1991 to 750,000 .
Legalization in the U.S. might be a much more commercial matter than in pragmatic Holland .
Are these trends connected ?
Given that marijuana research is almost as scarce as drug - free communities , all that is available is moderately informed speculation .
A recent book that I co-authored , “ Cannabis Policy : Moving Beyond the Stalemate , ” identifies five other factors that may play an influence in this .
There is also no direct evidence that potency makes a difference to how much the drug hurts users ’ health ; most users titrate their dose with higher THC .
What would happen if the drug were legalized ?
The Dutch de facto legalization of sale through coffee shops is the closest available experience .
The most striking observation is that marijuana use in that country is lower than in many other European countries and a lot lower than in the United States ; 6 percent of 15 - to 64 - year - olds in Holland had used marijuana in the past year , compared to 11 percent in the U.S .
Legalization in the U.S. might be a much more commercial matter than in pragmatic Holland , where the government created a legally ambiguous regulatory system with minimal court oversight .
The U.S. might find it hard to prevent producers from using their First Amendment rights to actively promote the drug .
A way of avoiding this would be to remove prohibitions on growing for your own use and for gifts to others .
No doubt there would still be a black market but it would allow access to marijuana without creating a full commercialization .
Probably this would lead to a modest increase in the number of people who use the drug , which needs to be weighed against the elimination of 750,000 arrests for simple possession .
The Tobacco Precedent
Norm Stamper was Seattle ’s police chief from 1994 to 2000 .
He is a member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition and the author of “ Breaking Rank : A Top Cop ’s Exposé of the Dark Side of American Policing . ”
Any law disobeyed by more than 100 million Americans , the number who ’ve tried marijuana at least once , is bad public policy .
As a 34 - year police veteran , I ’ve seen how marijuana prohibition breeds disrespect for the law , and contempt for those who enforce it .
Let ’s examine arguments against legalizing marijuana : use and abuse would skyrocket ; the increased potency of today ’s marijuana would exacerbate social and medical problems ; and legalization would send the wrong message to our children .
Babies and Body Parts , oh my !
Is there anymore delicious than a body part roasted on a Kenmore Gas Grill ?
The NYT advances another theory why loan modifications are n't working .
It 's not because banks do n't have the infrastructure in place ( the banks ' excuse ) or because loan modifications en masse would kill their balance sheets ( what many suspect ) , but rather that there 's too much money to be made in the foreclosure process .
... many mortgage companies are reluctant to give strapped homeowners a break because the companies collect lucrative fees on delinquent loans .
Even when borrowers stop paying , mortgage companies that service the loans collect fees out of the proceeds when homes are ultimately sold in foreclosure .
So the longer borrowers remain delinquent , the greater the opportunities for these mortgage companies to extract revenue — fees for insurance , appraisals , title searches and legal services .
Not surprisingly , large mortgage companies , like Countrywide ( now part of BofA ) dispute the idea that they 'd ever " jeopardize a customer relationship " in favor of collecting a hodgepodge of late fees and title fees and stuff like that .
But the argument sounds compelling enough such that it likely makes some difference in the economics of it all :
“ If they do a loan modification , they get a few shekels from the government , ” said David Dickey , who led a mortgage sales team at Countrywide and Bank of America , leaving in March to start his own mortgage advisory firm , National Home Loan Advocates .
By contrast , he said , the road to foreclosure is lined with fees , especially if it is prolonged .
“ There ’s all sorts of things behind the scenes , ” he said .
When borrowers fall behind , mortgage companies typically collect late fees reaching 6 percent of the monthly payments .

Why was Russia ever in BRIC 's to begin with ?
We understand the long term growth story of China , India , and Brazil .
They have compelling stories based on demographics , proof of an increasingly important private sector , and development - minded governments .
Yet Russia 's growth recently has been of a far different variety than these countries .
Russia was simply riding high energy prices , and that 's it .
70 % of Russian exports beyond the former Soviet Union are energy - related .
Meanwhile , the country 's political system has actually been driving in reverse .
Second quarter GDP numbers are making the dissimilarities of Russia painfully obvious : Russian GDP fell a sharp 10.9 % in the second quarter while in contrast , China was up 8 % , India about 5 % , and Brazil is expected to log nearly 2 % GDP growth .
“ We ca n’t develop like this any longer , ” President Dmitry Medvedevsaid yesterday during a meeting with political party leaders in the Black Sea resort of Sochi .
“ It ’s a dead end .
And the crisis has placed us in a situation where we will have to make decisions on changing the structure of the economy . ”
We hope he passes this message up the chain of command , but it might not be enough .
Besides being far too dependent on energy prices , the country 's shrinking population is a further reason to exclude them from BRIC's .
Lower birth rates and higher death rates reduced Russia 's population at a 0.5 % annual rate , or about 750,000 to 800,000 people per year during the late 1990s and most of the 2000s .
The UN warned in 2005 that Russia 's then population of about 143 million could fall by a third by 2050 if trends did not improve .
Even if energy prices return to previous levels , it still wo n't make Russia comparable to the other BRIC's and could even hinder the restructuring efforts Mr. Medvedev publicly hopes for above .
A return of easy energy income would likely further entrench political complacency .
So please , while it might not roll off the tongue like it used to , let 's drop the R from BRIC's .
Note :
As a glimmer of hope , we should mention that President Dmitry Medvedev has indeed embraced the modern era with a video blog .
But as one would figure , no comments are allowed .
Scientists have created human sperm in the laboratory for the first time .
The extraordinary development , which until a few years ago belonged in the realms of science fiction , raises hopes that infertile men may one day be able to father their own biological children .
The sperm were created in a test tube , from stem cells derived from a five - day - old male embryo .
The advance raises ethical questions over the safety of the procedure and the threat it poses to the future role of men .
It was also challenged by experts who claimed the sperm - like cells produced in the experiment were not genuine sperm .
If the finding is confirmed , a single male embryo could , in theory , yield a stem - cell line which when stored could provide an unlimited supply of sperm .
Once the stem - cell line was established , there would be no further reproductive need for men .
In a briefing on the research , the scientists at Newcastle University and the NorthEast England Stem Cell Institute , led by Professor Karim Nayernia , raise the question of whether their discovery means " the end of men " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
They point out that the stem cells from which the sperm were made could only be derived from a male embryo – one containing a Y ( male ) chromosome – so at least one male would be required .
" However , researchers believe that the issue does need to be debated and legislated for , " they said .
" As work progresses and results improve at Newcastle and elsewhere it may , in theory , be possible to develop sperm from embryonic stem cell lines which have been stored . "
Professor Nayernia said : " In theory it would be possible [ to dispense with men ] , but only if you want to produce a population all the same size and shape [ because they have the same male genetic origin ] .
Personally I can not see human reproduction as purely a biological process .
It has human , emotional , psychological , social and ethical aspects , too .
We are doing this research to help infertile men , not to replace a reproductive procedure . "
The breakthrough was achieved using stem cells derived from a human embryo which were first developed into germ line stem cells – with half the number of chromosomes – and then prompted to produce sperm which were " fully mature and functional " , despite being made in a petri dish rather than the testes of a sexually mature man .
The results are reported in the journal Stem Cells and Development .
In a parallel but incomplete experiment , the same group of researchers are creating stem cells out of skin cells from which they have produced sperm , with the same genetic make - up as the skin cells from which they are derived .
This would allow infertile men to produce their own biological children , using only their skin cells .
Professor Nayernia said the results of this research were " promising " and added : " We hope in a few months to publish that work as well . "
However , efforts to produce sperm from female stem cells failed .
It had been thought the technique might allow lesbian couples to have their own biological children but the researchers say the genes on the Y ( male ) chromosome are essential to sperm maturation .
Three years ago , Professor Nayernia led scientists at the University of Gottingen in Germany who became the first to produce viable sperm from mouse embryonic stem cells which were used to produce seven live offspring .
However , the baby mice died shortly after birth .

The latest discovery is a further step on the way to finding a cure for male infertility .
Under current legislation , researchers are banned from using sperm ( or eggs ) produced in the laboratory – known as in - vitro derived ( IVD ) sperm – to treat patients .
But it is permitted for research purposes .
" Sperm production takes 15 years in a human and there are thousands of factors that could affect it , " said Professor Nayernia .
" We can investigate these factors in the laboratory in a matter of months with this technique . "
Experts yesterday challenged the Newcastle researchers ' claims to have created genuine sperm .
Dr Allan Pacey , senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield , said : " As a sperm biologist of 20 years ' experience , I am unconvinced from the data presented in this paper that the cells produced ... can be accurately called ' Spermatozoa ' . "
Azim Surani , a professor of physiology and reproduction at the University of Cambridge , said : " These sperm - like cells made in a dish from embryonic stem cells are a long way from being authentic sperm cells . "
Professor Robin Lovell Badge , from the National Institute for Medical Research , echoed the academic criticisms , but said : " Despite these drawbacks , it may be that the authors have made some progress in obtaining sperm from human embryonic stem cells in vitro .
" This will be very important for research and ultimately , although definitely not yet , for fertility treatments . "
Professor Nayernia said his research was submitted as " proof of principle " which needed confirmation by further studies .
" Our intention was to open up new avenues of research , " he said .
" It seems unreasonable to criticise our work on the basis that we have not done more . "
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority , which regulates research , has estimated that it will be at least five or 10 years before eggs of sperm could be produced which could potentially be used in treatment .
Before laboratory - produced sperm could be used to make babies for couples who are infertile , the 2008 Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Act would have to be changed .
Sperm :
The facts
* It takes 10 weeks to make a sperm in the testes .
* Once produced they are stored for about a fortnight .
* If they are not ejaculated they are broken down and reabsorbed .
* A healthy male can produce 70 to 150 million sperm a day .
* A teaspoon can hold 200 to 500 million sperm .
Dominick Philip loves to read .
He reads at home , in the car , whenever he gets a free minute .
His bedroom floor is covered with books .
He was so looking forward to the summer reading program at Memorial Library of Nazareth and Vicinity that he marked it on his calendar weeks in advance .
But it turns out , Dominick is a library services thief .
At least that 's how he is portrayed in " The Colbert Report 's " edition of " Nailed ' Em -- Library Crime . "
Stephen Colbert goes behind the scenes to show viewers this sinister 7 - year - old , inclined to steal books rather than borrow from Easton Area Public Library , where he belongs .
Do n't be fooled by his innocent smile and studious demeanor .
This is a hardened criminal , and Memorial Library of Nazareth and Vicinity had no choice but to make him pay .
Library officials realized he was an intruder after he was pictured in a local newspaper , leading a parade around the library .
The cutline gave his hometown -- Tatamy -- which is not part of Nazareth 's library system .
A library employee left a message at his family 's home , informing him they knew about his crime .
Nazareth library officials did soften .
They are allowing Dominick to visit their library until the end of this year .
But then , he will get the boot .
Check out Colbert 's take on the situation :
This is a transcript of Prof.
Joseph Peden 's 50 - minute lecture " Inflation and the Fall of the Roman Empire " given at the Seminar on Money and Government in Houston , Texas on October 27 , 1984 .

I have commissioned this transcript in the hope that you may find it as interesting and educational as I did .
Kudos to Joshua Griffith for bringing this talk to my attention .
Two centuries ago , in 1776 , there were two books published in England , both of which are read avidly today .
One of them was Adam Smith 's The Wealth of Nations and the other was Edward Gibbon 's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire .
Gibbon 's multi-volume work is the tale of a state that survived for twelve centuries in the west and for another thousand years in the east , at Constantinople .
Yet Gibbon in looking at this phenomenon commented that the wonder was not that the Roman Empire had fallen , but rather that it had lasted so long .
And scholars since Gibbon have devoted great deal of energy to examining that problem : how was it that the Roman Empire lasted so long , and did it decline or was it simply transformed into something else ?
That something else being the European civilization , of which we are the heirs .
I 've been asked to speak on the theme of Roman history , particularly the problem of inflation and its impact .
My analysis is based on the premise that monetary policy cannot be studied , or understood , in isolation from the overall policies of the state .
Monetary , fiscal , military , political and economic issues are all very much intertwined .
And the reason they are all so intertwined is , in part , due to the fact that the state , any state , normally seeks to monopolize the supply of money within its own territory .
Monetary policy therefore always serves , even if it serves badly , the perceived needs of the rulers of the state .
If it also happens to enhance the prosperity and progress of the masses of the people , that is a secondary benefit ; but its first aim is to serve the needs of the rulers , not the ruled .
And this point is central , I believe , to an understanding of the course of monetary policy in the late Roman Empire .
We may begin by looking at simply the mentality of the rulers of the Roman Empire , beginning at the end of the 2nd century [ A.D. ] and looking through to the end of the 3rd century .
This period of the 3rd century Roman historians refer to as the Crisis of the Third Century .
And the reason is that the problems of the Roman society in that period were so profound , so enormous , that Roman society emerged from the 3rd century very , very different in almost all ways from what it had been in the first and second centuries , a period the historians speak of as the Augustan Principate .
To look at the mentality of the Roman emperors , we can look just at the advice that the Emperor Septimius Severus gave to his two sons , Caracalla and Geta .
This was supposed to be his final words to his heirs .
He said , " live in harmony ; enrich the troops ; ignore everyone else . "
Now , there is a monetary policy to be marveled at !
Caracalla did not adhere to the first part of that ; in fact , one of his first acts was to murder his brother .
But as for enriching the troops , he took that so seriously to heart that his mother remonstrated with him and urged him to be more moderate and to restrain his increasing military expenditures and his very burdensome new taxes .
He responded by saying there was no longer any revenue , just or unjust , to be found .
But not to worry , " for as long as we have this , " he insisted , pointing to his sword , " we shall not run short of money . "
His sense of priorities was made more explicit when he remarked , " nobody should have any money but I , so that I may bestow it upon the soldiers . "
And he was as good as his word : he raised the pay of the soldiers fifty percent , and to achieve this he doubled the inheritance taxes paid by Roman citizens .
When this was not sufficient to meet his needs , he admitted almost every inhabitant of the empire to Roman citizenship .
What had formerly been a privilege now became simply a means of expanding the tax base .
He then went further by proceeding to debase the coinage .
The basic coinage of the Roman Empire to this time — we 're speaking now about 211 [ A.D. ] — was the silver denarius introduced by Augustus at the end of the 1st century before Christ .
Augustus had issued a silver coin , a denarius , that was about 95 % silver , and that coin continued for the better part of two centuries as the basic medium of exchange in the empire .
By the time of Trajan in 117 , it was only about eighty - five percent silver , down from Augustus ' ninety - five percent .
By the age of Marcus Aurelius , in 180 , it was down to about seventy - five percent silver .
In Septimius ' time it had dropped to sixty percent , and Caracalla evened it off at fifty - fifty .
Caracalla was assassinated in 217 and there then followed an age that historians refer to as the Age of the Barrack Emperors , because throughout the 3rd century all the emperors were soldiers and all of them came to their power by military coups of one sort or another .
There were about 26 legitimate emperors in this century and only one of them died a natural death ; the rest were either assassinated or died in battle , which will give you some idea of the change since this was totally unprecedented in Roman history — with two exceptions : Nero , a suicide , and Caligula , assassinated earlier .
Caracalla had also debased the gold coinage .
Under Augustus this circulated at 45 coins to a pound of gold .
Caracalla made it 50 to a pound of gold .
Within 20 years after him it was circulating at 72 to the pound of gold , reduced to 60 at the end of the century by Diocletian , only to be raised again to 72 by Constantine .
So even the gold coinage was in fact inflated , debased .
But the real crisis came after Caracalla , between 258 and 275 .
In a period of intense civil war and foreign invasions , the emperors simply abandoned , for all practical purposes , a silver coinage .
By 268 there was only five tenths percent silver in the denarius .
And prices in this period rose in most parts of the empire by nearly a thousand percent .
The only people who were getting paid in gold were the barbarian troops hired by the emperors .
The barbarians were so barbarous that they would only accept gold in payment for their services .
The situation did not change until the accession of Diocletian in the year 284 .
Shortly after his accession he raised the weight of the gold coinage , the aureus , to 60 to the pound - this was from a low of 72 .
But ten years later , he finally abandoned the silvered coinage , which by this time was simply a bronze coin dipped in silver rather quickly .
He abandoned that completely and tried to issue a new silver coin which was struck at 96 coins to the pound of silver , called the argenteus .
This argenteus was fixed as equal to fifty of the old denarii , the old coinage .
It was designed to respond to the need for higher - tariffed coins in the marketplace , to reflect the inflation .
He also issued a new bronze coin tariffed at ten denarii , called the nummus .
But less than a decade later , that silver coin had gone from being tariffed at 50 of the old to now equaling 100 of the old , and the bronze coinage from 10 denarii to 20 ; in other words , a hundred percent inflation .
In other words , despite his efforts Diocletian had not been able to stop the inflation .
The next emperor who interfered with the coinage in a meaningful way was to be Constantine , the first Christian emperor of Rome .
Constantine in the year 312 , which is also the year he issued the Edict of Toleration for Christianity , issued a new gold piece which he called by a new name , the solidus — solid gold .
This was struck at 72 to the pound , so it was in fact debased over Diocletian's .
These were very large issues and historians have puzzled over where he got all the gold ; but I think the puzzle is not so much of a real puzzle once you begin to look at the legislation that took place .
First of all , he issued two new taxes : one was taxed on the estates of the senators , and this was rather new because senators generally were free of most taxes on their land .
He also issued a tax on the capital of merchants ; not their earnings , but their capital .
This was to be levied every five years and it was to be paid in gold .
He also required that the rents from the imperial estates , which were rented out to tenants , were to be paid only in gold .
He took on the bullion reserves of his former partner Licinius who had extracted , by force , bullion from the treasuries of the cities of the Eastern Empire .
In other words , any city that had any gold bullion or silver bullion left in its treasury , this was simply requisitioned by Licinius and this passed on now into the hands of Constantine who had gotten rid of Licinius in a civil war .
We 're also told that he stripped the pagan temples of their treasuries .
This he did rather late in his reign , still somewhat afraid apparently in the early days of angering the gods of Rome .
As his Christianity became more fixed , he felt greater ease at robbing the temples .
Now , Constantine 's reform in one sense began the reversal of the process : the gold coinage was sufficiently large that it began to take hold and to circulate more freely .
The silver coinage failed and , what was worse , at no time in this period did the central government try to control the token coinage .
And the result of that was [ that ] token coinage was being minted not only by the imperial mints , but also by the mints of cities .
In other words , if a city could n't pay its costs , pay its salaries to its employees , it simply struck up some token coinage and issued that .
By the late 3rd century we also begin to have massive appearance of what numismatists call counterfeits .
I would say it would be called credit money today .
People need small change , and they simply go and manufacture it — all of which of course means that the amount of token coinage in circulation is uncontrolled and increasingly massive .
Now , one of the things that had happened in the course of this 3rd century inflation was that the government found that when it paid its troops in token coinage , or even in these debased silver coins , prices immediately rose .
Every time the silver value of the denarius dropped , prices naturally rose ; and the result of this was [ that ] the government , in order to try to protect its civil servants and its soldiers from the effects of inflation , began to demand payment of taxes in kind and services rather than in coin .
They wound up , in effect , in repudiating their own issues , not accepting them for tax collection purposes .
With Constantine 's reform , this situation changed somewhat and , slowly but surely , the government began to move away from collecting taxes in kind and from paying salaries in kind , and began to substitute paying salaries in gold and collecting taxes in gold .
Over the long run , this meant that the gold standard was strengthened and gold remained the real money of the Roman Empire .
However , the inflation did not end for the masses of the people .
In other words , gold was a hedge against inflation for those who had it , and these were principally the troops and the civil servants .
The taxpayers had to buy these gold coins in order to pay their taxes and so , if they were wealthy enough , they could afford to buy these gold coins which were increasingly expensive in terms of token money .
If they were poorer they simply could n't pay the taxes and this meant they lost their lands in one form or another or became delinquents ; and we hear constant references to people abandoning their land , disappearing .
As a matter of fact in the 3rd century this was a constant problem in Rome : all sorts of people were trying to escape the increased taxes that the military needed .
The army itself [ had grown ] from the time of Augustus , when they had about a quarter of a million troops , [ to where ] by the the time of Diocletian they had somewhat over 600,000 .
So the army itself had doubled in size in the course of this inflationary spiral , and obviously that contributed greatly to the inflation .
In addition , the administration of the state had grown enormously .
Under Augustus essentially you had the imperial administration at Rome and the governors of different provinces , the secondary level of administration , and then the primary governmental units in the Roman Empire in this time were the cities , the municipalities .
By the time of Diocletian this pattern had been broken apart .
You had not one emperor but you had , under Diocletian , four emperors .
Which meant four imperial courts , four Praetorian Guards , four palaces , four staffs , etc .
Under them were four Praetorian prefectures , regional administrative units with their staffs and their budgets .
Under these four prefectures , they were then divided into 12 dioceses , each diocese having its administrative staff and so on .
Under the diocesan rulers , the vicars of the diocese , we have the provinces .
In Augustus ' time there were approximately 20 provinces .
Three hundred years later , with no substantial increase in territory , there were over a hundred provinces .
They had simply began to divide and subdivide provinces for purposes of maintaining internal military control of these regions .
In other words , the cost of policing the Roman state became increasingly enormous .
All these costs , then , are some of the reasons why the inflation took place ; I 'll get to others in a moment .
To give you some idea of the situation after Constantine 's reform of the gold , let me just briefly give you the figures for what it cost in terms of the silver coinage , or token coinage now , the denarius , for a pound of gold .
In Diocletian 's time , in the year 301 , he fixed the price at 50,000 denarii for one pound of gold .
Ten years later it had risen to 120,000 .
In 324 , in other words 23 years after it was 50,000 , it was now 300,000 ; and in 337 , the year of Constantine 's death , a pound of gold brought 20,000,000 denarii .
And by the way , just as we are all familiar with the German currency of the [ 1920s ] with the bigger stamp on it , the Roman coinage also has stamps and over - stamps on the metal , indicating multiples of value .
At one point one of the Roman emperors had a marvelous idea : instead of issuing a single coin he devised a method to handle the inflation .
He took brass slugs and put them in a leather pouch and called it a follis ; and people began passing these pouches back and forth as value .
I guess it was the Roman equivalent to those baskets of paper we see in the pictures of Germany in the [ 1920s ] .
Interestingly enough , within ten years or so after that began , the word follis — which had meant this bag of coins — had now drifted to mean one of those slugs .
One of those slugs was now the follis ; so they could n't even keep the bags stable , they too were inflated .
Now one interesting thing with all this inflation , I think it should be a great comfort to us : historians of prices in the Roman Empire have come to the conclusion that despite all of this inflation — or perhaps we should say , because of all this inflation — the price of gold , in terms of its purchasing power , remained stable from the first through the fourth century .
In other words , gold remained , in terms of its purchasing power , a stable value whereas all this coinage just became increasingly worthless .
What were the causes of this inflation ?
First of all , war ; the soldiers ' pay rose from 225 denarii during the time of Augustus to 300 denarii in the time of Domitian , about a hundred years later .
A century after Domitian , in the time of Septimius , it had gone from 300 to 500 denarii ; and in the time of Caracalla , about 10 years later , it had gone to 750 denarii .
In other words , the cost of the army was also rising in the terms of the coinage ; so , as the coinage became more worthless , the cost of the army had to be increased .
The advance in the soldier 's pay in the rest of the 3rd century and into the 4th century is not known , we do n't have figures .
And one reason is that the soldiers were increasingly paid in terms of requisitions of supplies and goods in kind .
They were literally given food , clothing , shelter and other commodities in lieu of pay - and this applied also to the civil service .
When one Roman emperor refused to pay a donative on his accession — this was a bonus given to the soldiers on the accession of the emperor — he was simply murdered by his troops .
The Romans had had this kind of problem even in the days of the Republic : if the soldiers do n't get paid they rather resent it .
What we find is that the donatives had been given on the accession of a new emperor from the time of Augustus on ; then they began to be given in the 3rd century every five years .
By the time of Diocletian , donatives were given every year , so that the soldiers ' donatives had in fact become part of their basic salary .
The size of the army , I think I indicated already , had increased .
Doubled from the time of Augustus to Diocletian , and the size of the civil service I indicated also .
Now , all these events strained the fiscal resources of the state beyond its ability to sustain itself , and the debasement and the taxation were both used to keep the ship of state going ; frequently by debasing , then by taxation , and then often simply by accusing people of treason and confiscating their estates .
One of the Christian fathers , Saint Gregory Nazianzus , commented that war is the mother of taxes and I think that 's a wonderful thing to keep in mind : war is the mother of taxes .
And it 's also , of course , the mother of inflation .
Now , what were the consequences of inflation ?
One of the odd things about inflation is , in the Roman Empire , that while the Roman state survived — the Roman state was not destroyed by inflation — what was destroyed by inflation was the freedom of the Roman people , and particularly the first victim was their economic freedom .
Rome had basically a laissez - faire concept of state / economy relations .
Except in emergencies , which were usually related to war , the Roman government generally followed a policy of free trade and minimal restriction on the economic activities of its population .
But now under the pressure of this need to pay the troops and under the pressure of inflation , the liberty of the people began to be seriously eroded - and very rapidly .
We could start with the class known as the decurions .
This was your prosperous , small and middle landowning class who were the dominate elements of the cities of the Roman Empire .
They were the class from which were chosen the municipal counsels , the municipal magistrates and officials .
Traditionally , they had viewed service in the governments of their towns as an honor and they had responded to this by donating , not merely their time , but their wealth to the betterment of the urban environment : building stadiums and bathhouses and repairing the streets and providing for pure water .
These were considered benefactions , it was a kind of philanthropic element and their reward was , of course , public recognition and esteem .
This class , in the mid-3rd century , was assigned a task of collecting the taxes in the municipality that were being assessed by the central government .
The central government could no longer collect its taxes effectively , so they made the decurion class collectively responsible for getting revenues and passing them on to the imperial government .
The decurions , of course , had as much difficulty as anyone else in doing this , and the returns were , again , frequently inadequate so the government solved that problem by simply passing a law that any taxes that decurions could not collect from others , they would have to pay out of their own pocket .
That 's known as the incentive method for the tax collect .
[ laughter ]
As you can well imagine , as the crises became greater and the economy was disrupted by civil conflicts and invasions and the effects of inflation , the decurions , strangely enough , no longer wanted to be decurions ; and they began to abandon their lands , abandon their cities , and escape to wherever they could find refuge in other larger cities or other provinces .
But they were not to be allowed to do that with impunity , and the law was then passed that any decurion discovered somewhere else was to be arrested , bound like a slave and carted back to his hometown where he was restored to his dignity as a decurion .
[ laughter ]
This third century is also the period of the persecution of the church , and we find that at least some of the emperors must have had a sense of humor because when they passed a regulation that if a Christian was arrested and found guilty of capital punishment , namely believing in Christ , he was to not be executed but offered the option of becoming a decurion .
[ laughter ]
Now , the merchants and the artisans were traditionally organized into guilds and chambers of commerce and that sort of thing .
They now , too , came under government pressure because the government could not obtain enough material for the war machine through regular channels — people after all do n't want all that token coinage — and so they were now compelled to make deliveries of goods .
So that if you had a factory making garments , you now had to deliver so many garments to the government requisitions .
If you had ships , you had to carry government goods in your ships .
In other words , what we have here is a kind of nationalization of private enterprises , and this nationalization means that the people who risk their money and their talent are compelled to now serve the state whether they like it or not .
When people tried to get out of this they were then , by law , compelled to remain in the occupation that they were in .
In other words , you could n't change your job or your business .
This was not sufficient because , after all , death is always a relief from taxes ; and so the occupations were now made hereditary .
When you died , your son had to take up your business , your trade , your profession .
If your father was a shoemaker , you had to be a shoemaker .
These started by being restricted to the defense - oriented industries but , of course , gradually it was realized that everything is defense - oriented and the system just developed .
The peasantry , known as the coloni , these were leaseholders on both imperial and private estates .
They , too , formerly a free class were now under the same kinds of pressures that all smallholders were in this situation , and they began to drift away trying to find better opportunities , better leases , better occupations ; and so under Diocletian the coloni were now bound to the soil .
Anyone who had a lease on a particular piece of land could not give that lease up .
More than that , they had to stay on the land and work it .
In effect , this is the beginning of what in the Middle Ages is called serfdom , but it actually has its origins here in the late Roman society .
We know for example from studies of Palestine , particularly in the Rabbinical writings , that in the course of the 3rd and early 4th century the structure of landholding in Palestine changed very dramatically .
Palestine in the 2nd century was largely composed of small peasant landholders with very small acreage , perhaps an average of two and a half acres .
By the 4th century those small holders had virtually disappeared and been replaced by vast estates controlled by a few large landowners .
The peasants working the estates were the same people , but they had in the meantime lost their land to the larger landowners .
In other words , landholding became a massive kind of agribusiness .
In [ the ] course of this the population of Palestine , still principally Jewish , also changed in that the ownership of land passed from Jews to Gentiles ; and the reason for that undoubtedly was that the only people with large amounts of cash who could buy out these smallholders who were in distress were , of course , the government officials .
And we hear of them being called potentates , powerful ones .
In effect there is a shift in the distribution of wealth in Palestine ; and obviously , from other evidence , similar things were happening in other places .
With regard to taxes , they naturally increased across the board , but Diocletian decided that it was a very inefficient system that he had inherited ; every province more or less had its own system of taxation going back to pre-Roman times , actually .
And so he , with his military mind , demanded standardization .
And what he did was to have all wealth , which was of course landed wealth , assessed in units of productivity .
In other words , every person who had land was either singly , if he was a large landowner , fit into a particular unit , a tax unit called iugum , and those who were smaller landowners were collectively put into a iugum .
This meant that the emperor for the first time had the basis of a national budget , something the Romans never had until Diocletian , and therefore he knew at any given time how many taxable units of wealth there were in any province , and he could simply levy an assessment and expect to get a fixed amount of money .
Unfortunately , this took no account of the fact that in agriculture productivity varies considerably from season to season , and that if an army has passed through your district it may take years to recover .
The result is , we hear of massive petitions from whole regions asking the emperor to forgive them their taxes , to remit five years of past dues and so on and so forth ; or to reduce the number of units of productivity to reflect the loss of population or the loss of materials .
As a matter of fact , when people began to say " it used to be I had five people paying this unit of taxation , but two them have fled and it's only half the land in production , " the response of the government was to say , " that does n't matter , you still have to pay for the land that is now out of production . "
So , I mean , there 's no relationship between taxes and actual productivity .
How did people protect themselves from this ?
Well , first of all , mortgages virtually ceased ; long - term mortgages virtually ceased to be given .
Long - term loans of any kind disappeared .
No one will lend unless they are guaranteed payment in gold or silver bullion .
In fact the government itself , under Diocletian and Constantine , refused to accept gold coins in payment of taxes , but insisted instead on gold bullion .
So that the coins that you bought in the marketplace had to then be melted down and presented in the form of bullion ; and the reason was [ that ] the government was never sure how adulterated its own gold coinage really was so they insisted on bullion .
Pledges and securities for crops and for loans were always in either gold , silver or indeed in crops themselves .
In Egypt we have a document in which the banks have been refusing to accept coins with the divine image of the emperor ; in other words , state issues .
The government 's reaction to that , of course , was to force the banks to accept the coinage .
This led to wholesale corruption in Roman society as the black market became a normal part , as people refused to pass , to exchange , coinage at the officially fixed tariffs but instead coinage was passed on a market principle .
There were , obviously , flight from the land , massive evasion of taxes , people left their jobs , they left their homes , they left their social status .
Now , Diocletian 's final contribution to this continuing disaster was to issue his famous Edict on Prices [ of ] 301 , a very famous instance of a massive effort by the government to control inflation by price controls .
You have to realize that there is a little problem : the Roman Empire was a vast region running from Britain in the west to Iraq , Mesopotamia in the east ; from the Rhine and the Danube to the Sahara .
It included areas of very sophisticated and very primitive economies , and the result of that was the cost of living varied considerably from province to province .
Egypt seems to have had the lowest cost of living , Palestine had a cost of living twice that of Egypt , and [ Rome in Italy ] had a cost of living twice that of Palestine .
Diocletian ignored that ; he just issued a single standard price for the entire empire .
The result was that in Egypt the effects of the Edict probably did n't exist because the price , the maximum price fixed in the Edict , was very rarely reached in Egypt .
But it was the people in Rome , of course , [ who ] had the maximum price lower than the market price .
The result of that , of course , was riots in the street , disappearance of goods ; the penalty for violating the law was death , a very common penalty in Rome for almost anything ; and the mentality of Diocletian comes out , and the cause of [ the ] maximum price edict comes out in the preface to the law .
I 'll just quote briefly some of it ; when you hear these first words I 'd like you to pay attention because you may have a different interpretation of them than Diocletian meant .
He says , " if the excesses perpetrated by persons of unlimited and frenzied avarice could be checked , " he does n't mean himself [ laughter ] , " if the general welfare could endure without harm this riotous license , if these uncontrolled madmen , the unscrupulous , the immoderate , the avaricious , could be persuaded to desist from plundering the wealth of all , then all would be well . "
Now who are these people ?
They are the merchants ; they are the avaricious greedy types who cause inflation as we all know .
Then he speaks about himself and his three partners .
" [ We , the protectors of the ] human race , " sounds familiar does n't it [ laughter ] , " we are agreed that decisive legislation is necessary , so that the long - hoped - for solutions , which mankind itself could not provide ... "
You know , it 's the same stuff [ laughter ] , we can't do anything ourselves , we need the legislator .
" By the remedies provided by our foresight [ laughter ] , these things may be remedied for the general betterment of all . "
In fact , as you read through the rest of the thing it becomes clear that the reason the Edict on Prices [ was ] issued was that the soldiers were the principal victims of the inflation , and that Diocletian was afraid he was losing control of his army .
And so the people who are to be protected are the soldiers and the other servants of the state .
Now Diocletian 's monetary reforms were tentative steps in the right direction ; except for the Edict on Prices which , by the way , simply did n't work and was gradually dropped .
But his steps were not radical enough ; his inability to create a sufficient supply of gold and silver coinage , combined with his continued reliance on payments in kind for taxes and salaries , and the continued issuance of fiat bronze coinage in endless amounts , failed to make a significant dent in the problem .
Constantine 's reforms were also partial , but of sufficient vigor and radical character to make a difference .
Through his willingness to extract by compulsion the gold reserves of the taxpayers , forcing them to disgorge their bullion , he placed an ever - increasing supply of gold in the hands of the government officials .
This was increasingly used to pay military bonuses , salaries for bureaucrats , and even payments for certain public works .
Increasingly , then , a two - tier monetary system emerged in which the government , the soldiers and the bureaucrats enjoyed the benefits of a gold standard while the non-governmental portion of the economy continued to struggle with a rapidly - inflating fiat currency .
The new gold solidus — circulated widely by its possessors , the government - salaried employees — sold at various market rates to customers who desperately needed it to pay their taxes .
Thus the state had found a way to protect itself and its servants from the unwholesome effects of its own earlier inflationary cycle , while slowly withdrawing itself from the cumbersome and wasteful system of accepting taxes and paying salaries in kind .
Meanwhile , the masses suffered from [ a ] massive injection of fiat money which they had to accept in payment for government requisitions of such gold or silver or other commodities which the government demanded .
Now , we may wish to find some lessons in this tale of [ the ] monetary policies of the late Roman Empire .
The first lesson , I think , must be that if war is the health of the state , as Randolph Bourne said , it is poison to a stable and sound money .
The Roman monetary crisis therefore was closely connected with the Roman military problem .
Another lesson is that the problems become solvable when a ruler decides that something can be done and must be done .
Diocletian and Constantine clearly were willing to act to protect their own ruling - class interest , the military and the civil service .
Monetary reforms were necessary to win the support of the troops and the bureaucrats that composed the only real constituency of the Roman state , and the two - tier system was designed to this end .
It brought about a stable monetary standard for the ruling group who did not hesitate to secure it at the expense of the mass of the population .
The Roman state survived .
The liberty of the Roman people did not .
When freedom became possible in the west in the 5th century , with the barbarian invasions , people took advantage of the possibility of change .
The tax burden remained burdensome even after the gold standard was re-established .
The peasantry had become totally alienated from the Roman state because it was no longer free .
The business community likewise was no longer free , and the middle class of the urban cities was no longer free .
New GM to Focus on Customers , Cars and Culture
The New General Motors Company Launches Today
Committed to great cars and trucks
Stronger brands and dealers
A pledge to regain trust and confidence
Stronger balance sheet
After a scant six weeks in bankruptcy court , General Motors is on its way out of Chapter 11 .
U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert Gerber approved the sale of GM 's good assets to a new company lead by the U.S. and Canadian governments and the UAW healthcare fund , but gave vested parties four days to file an objection .
After two requests for a stay were denied on Tuesday and an accident victim 's request was denied at the last minute on Thursday , all signs point to an exit from bankruptcy within a few days , and this morning , word from the Detroit News is that the company officially emerged from Chapter 11 at 6:30 am this morning .
CEO Fritz Henderson has called a 9 am press conference this morning , and one can only assume that he will declare the birth of " New GM . " GM has received $ 50 billion from the US government to keep the mega- corporation out of liquidation .
For its troubles , Uncle Sam will receive a 60 % stake in the new company .
Canada , which pitched in $ 9 billion , will be 11.7 % owners , while the UAW will receive 17.6 % .
Old GM will receive 10 % of the new company to help creditors recoup some money .
The " New GM " will be smaller in almost every way , with four fewer brands , a smaller presence in Europe , fewer employees , and a markedly more attractive balance sheet .

Official press verbiage added after the jump , click here to watch GM 's live 9 am press conference . *
GM gets back to the business of building great cars and trucks , serving customer needs *
New company created from GM 's strongest assets *
Four core brands backed by the nation 's largest and strongest dealer network *
Streamlined organization on a global basis for faster decisions , sharper focus on the customer * Commitment to open communicationsDETROIT - The new General Motors Company began operations today with a new corporate structure , a stronger balance sheet , and a renewed commitment to make the customer the center of everything the new GM does .
" Today marks a new beginning for General Motors , one that will allow every employee , including me , to get back to the business of designing , building and selling great cars and trucks and serving the needs of our customers , " said Fritz Henderson , president and CEO .
" We are deeply appreciative for the support we have received during this historic transformation , and we will work hard to repay this trust by building a successful new General Motors .
" Created from the old GM 's strongest operations in an asset sale approved by the bankruptcy court on July 5 , the new GM is built on : * Four core brands in the U.S. and the largest , strongest dealer network in the country , * A fresh lineup of Chevrolet , Cadillac , Buick and GMC cars , trucks and crossovers , each with leading - edge designs and technologies that matter to both consumers and the environment , * A competitive cost structure , a cleaner balance sheet , and a stronger liquidity position that will enable GM to invest in new products , key technologies , and its future , * A winning culture focused on customers and products .
" One thing we have learned from the last 100 days is that GM can move quickly and decisively , " said Henderson .
" Today , we take the intensity , decisiveness and speed of the past several months and transfer it from the triage of the bankruptcy process to the creation and operation of a new General Motors .
" Business as usual is over at GM , " said Henderson .
" Today starts a new era for General Motors and everyone associated with the company .
Going forward , the new General Motors is fully committed to listening to customers , responding to consumer and market trends , and empowering the people closest to the customer to make the decisions .
Our goal is to build more of the cars , trucks , and crossovers that customers want , and to get them to market faster than ever before .
" The new General Motors launches with a clear and simple vision - to design , build and sell the best vehicles in the world .
" A successful auto company needs to focus on both the cost and the revenue sides of the business , " said Henderson .
" Success on the revenue side means building the stylish , high - quality , fuel - efficient vehicles that customers want - and getting them to market fast .
" Despite the recent downturn , GM has maintained its cadence of strong new products .
In the U.S. , for example , the Chevy Camaro has surged past its rivals to lead its segment , while the new Chevy Equinox Cadillac SRX , and Buick LaCrosse are earning strong initial reviews .
Later this year , the Cadillac CTS Sport Wagon and GMC Terrain debut , followed next year by the Chevy Volt Chevy Cruze and Cadillac CTS Coupe .
This emphasis on great new products is also reflected in the Chevy Agile now launching in Latin America , in the Chevy Cruze and Buick Excelle in Asia Pacific , and in the new Opel Astra in Europe .
Just last month , GM announced its intention to build a new small car at a plant in Orion Township , Michigan , which will add to GM 's growing portfolio of fuel - efficient cars and restore approximately 1,400 jobs .
GM also has moved aggressively to develop a full range of energy - saving technologies , including advanced internal combustion engines , biofuels fuel cells , and hybrids .
The company is also a leader in the development of extended - range electric vehicles , with its first model , the Chevy Volt , currently undergoing road testing and scheduled to launch in 2010 .
The new GM is also taking steps to make advanced battery development a core competency , and expects to make additional announcements on this matter late this summer .
"
The success of our recent launches and the exciting new vehicles and technologies we have in the pipeline are evidence of our ongoing commitment to excel at everything we do , " said Henderson .
" Our goal is to make each and every General Motors car , truck and crossover the best - in - class .
" As part of its reinvention , the new GM has also focused its resources on four core brands and a stronger , more effective dealer network .
General Motors ' core brands - Chevrolet , Cadillac , Buick and GMC - will have a total of just 34 U.S. nameplates by 2010 .
This emphasis on fewer , better entries will enable the new GM to put more resources into each nameplate , resulting in better products and stronger marketing .
In May , the company accelerated its dealer consolidation efforts , with the goal of reducing the number of GM dealers in the U.S. from 6,000 this spring to approximately 3,600 by the end of next year .
Even so , GM will still have the largest dealer network in the U.S. and GM dealers have committed to continue to improve the total customer experience for GM customers .
"
We 're also working on new ways to make car buying more convenient for our customers , including an innovative new partnership with eBay in California to revolutionize how people buy vehicles online , " Henderson said .
" Customers will be able to bid on actual vehicles just like they do in an eBay auction , including the option of choosing a predetermined ' buy it now ' price .
We 'll be testing this and other ideas with our dealers over the next few weeks , and hope to expand and build upon them in the coming months .
In all cases , our goal is to make the shopping and buying process as easy as possible for GM customers - on their time and their terms .
Stay tuned .
" General Motors Company is primarily owned by the governments of the United States , Canada and Ontario , and by a trust fund providing medical benefits to UAW retirees .
Specifically , common stock will be owned by :* U.S. Department of the Treasury : 60.8 percent * UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust : 17.5 percent * Canada and Ontario governments : 11.7 percent *
The old GM : 10 percent
" We are very appreciative of the support provided by the stakeholders through the transformation process .
Though General Motors Company will not initially be publicly traded , we will be transparent in our financial and other reporting to further strengthen trust and confidence , " said Henderson .
" We expect to take the company public again as soon as practical , starting next year , and to repay our government loans as soon as possible .
We are required to pay off the loans by 2015 , but our goal is to repay them much sooner .
" General Motors Company launches with a strong balance sheet , a competitive cost structure , and a strong cash position , enabling it to compete more effectively with both its U.S. and foreign - based competitors here in the U.S. , and to continue its strong presence in growing global markets .
The new company acquired old GM 's strongest operations and will have a competitive operating cost structure , partly as a result of recent agreements with the United Auto Workers ( UAW ) and Canadian Auto Workers ( CAW ) .
In the U.S. , the new GM will be a far leaner company .
By the end of 2010 , the company will operate 34 assembly , powertrain , and stamping plants , down from 47 in 2008 , and capacity utilization is expected to reach 100 percent during 2011 .
Overall U.S. employment will decline from about 91,000 at the end of 2008 to about 64,000 at the end of this year , creating a company sized to respond quickly to changes in the market , while still retaining the global scope necessary to develop world - class products and technologies .
The new GM will begin with a much stronger balance sheet , including U.S. debt of approximately $ 11 billion , which excludes preferred stock of $ 9 billion , and could change under fresh - start accounting .
In total , obligations have been reduced by more than $ 40 billion , representing mostly unsecured debt and the VEBA trust fund that provides medical benefits to UAW retirees .
The stronger balance sheet and lower break - even point will allow the new GM to reduce its risk , operate profitably at much lower volume levels , and reinvest in the business in the key areas of advanced technology and product development .
GM 's subsidiaries outside the United States were acquired by the new company and are expected to continue to operate normally without any interruption .
A new way of doing businessWith the launch of the new General Motors , company leaders will work to change the culture of the company , making the speed and decisiveness that GM demonstrated over the past several months the new way of doing business , and adding an intensified focus on the customer .
Edward E. Whitacre , Jr. , who oversaw the creation of the new AT&T , will serve as chairman of a GM board with a number of new directors .
Henderson will continue as president and chief executive officer , working closely with Whitacre .
He also will take responsibility for GM 's operations in North America , eliminating the GM North America president position .
To speed day - to - day decision - making , two senior leadership forums , the Automotive Strategy Board and Automotive Product Board , will be replaced by a single , smaller executive committee , which will meet more frequently and focus on business results , products , brands , and customers .
Bob Lutz has agreed to join the new GM as vice chairman responsible for all creative elements of products and customer relationships .
Lutz and Tom Stephens , vice chairman , product development , will work together as a team , partnering with Ed Welburn , vice president of design , to guide all creative aspects of design .
GM 's brands , marketing , advertising , and communications will report to Lutz for consistent messaging and results .
He will report to Henderson , and be part of the newly formed executive committee .
" I am pleased to announce that we are ' unretiring '
Bob Lutz so he can fill this important position in the new GM , " said Henderson .
" He has a proven track record of unleashing creativity in the design and development of GM cars and trucks .
This new role allows him to take that passion a step further , applying it to other parts of GM that connect directly with customers .
" General Motors will also end its regional operating structure , moving decisions closer to the customer .
This eliminates the regional president positions and the regional strategy boards .
Nick Reilly will be named executive vice president of GM International Operations ( GMIO ) which will be based in Shanghai .
GM is also removing layers of management - reducing the number of U.S. executives by 35 percent and overall U.S. salaried employment by 20 percent by the end of this year - flattening the organization and speeding decision making .
Additional details of the new structure and leadership moves will be communicated later this month , said Henderson .
" These and other actions will simplify our organizational structure and reduce the level of bureaucracy that , in the past , has prevented GM from moving faster .
" More direct communications
Henderson also announced initiatives to open more direct communications between customers and GM employees at every level .
" Beginning next week , we will launch a ' Tell Fritz ' website where customers , or anyone else , can share ideas , concerns , and suggestions directly with senior management .
I will personally review and respond to some of these communications every day .
" Henderson and other General Motors leaders will go on the road regularly to meet with consumers and others with a stake in the new GM .
" In August , we 'll begin regular visits with customers , dealers , suppliers , employees and others - in the U.S. and abroad - who impact our relationships with customers .
We 'll be listening to their ideas , and acting on the ones that will improve our ability to serve our customers better .
And of course , other executives and I will continue to reach out to customers through our ongoing web and Twitter chats .
" Today we launch the new General Motors , and our promise is simple .
We will be profitable , we will repay our loans as soon as possible , and our cars and trucks will be among the best in the world , " said Henderson .
" We recognize that we 've been given a rare second chance at GM , and we are very grateful for that .
And we appreciate the fact that we now have the tools to get the job done .
" To our current customers , we appreciate the confidence that you have placed in us , and going forward , we 'll offer you nothing less than great cars , trucks and crossovers , with unmatched customer service .
To those who have supported us through this challenging time , we are deeply grateful , " said Henderson .
" And to those who have never tried a GM vehicle - or who have tried one and been disappointed - we look forward to the chance to win your business and earn your trust . " # # # About General Motors : General Motors Company , one of the world 's largest automakers , traces its roots back to 1908 .

I mentioned a new book by Charlie Pierce called “ Idiot America : How Ignorance Became a Virtue In The Land of the Free ” in an earlier post .
I still have n’t read it but this quote via Pharyngula makes me itch to open it up :
The rise of Idiot America , though , is essentially a war on expertise .
It ’s not so much antimodernism or the distrust of the intellectual elites that Richard Hofstader teased out of the national DNA , although both of these things are part of it .
The rise of Idiot America today reflects — for profit , mainly , but also and more cynically , for political advantage and in the pursuit of power — the breakdown of the consensus that the pursuit of knowledge is a good .
It also represents the ascendancy of the notion that the people we should trust the least are the people who know the best what they ’re talking about .
In the new media age , everybody is a historian , or a scientist , or a preacher , or a sage .
And if everyone is an expert , then nobody is , and the worst thing you can be in a society where everybody is an expert is , well , an actual expert .
This is how Idiot America engages itself .
It decides , en masse , with a million keystrokes and clicks of the remote control , that because there are two sides to every question , they both must be right , or at least not wrong .
And the words of an obscure biologist carry no more weight on the subject of biology than do the thunderations of some turkeyneck preacher out of Christ ’s Own Parking Structure in DeLand , Florida .
Less weight , in fact , because our scientist is an “ expert ” and therefore , an “ elitist . ”
Nobody buys his books .
Nobody puts him on cable .
He ’s brilliant , surely , but no different from the rest of us , poor fool .
Newly unveiled court documents show that ghostwriters paid by a pharmaceutical company played a major role in producing 26 scientific papers backing the use of hormone replacement therapy in women , suggesting that the level of hidden industry influence on medical literature is broader than previously known .
The articles , published in medical journals between 1998 and 2005 , emphasized the benefits and deemphasized the risks of taking hormones to protect against maladies like aging skin , heart disease , and dementia .
That supposed medical consensus benefited Wyeth , the pharmaceutical company that paid a medical communications firm to draft the papers , as sales of its hormone drugs , called Premarin and Prempro , soared to nearly $ 2 billion in 2001 .
But the seeming consensus fell apart in 2002 when a huge federal study on hormone therapy was stopped after researchers found that menopausal women who took certain hormones had an increased risk of invasive breast cancer , heart disease , and stroke .
A later study found that hormones increased the risk of dementia in older patients .
The ghostwritten papers were typically review articles , in which an author weighs a large body of medical research and offers a bottom - line judgment about how to treat a particular ailment .
The articles appeared in 18 medical journals , including The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology , and The International Journal of Cardiology .
The articles did not disclose Wyeth ’s role in initiating and paying for the work .
Elsevier , the publisher of some of the journals , said it was disturbed by the allegations of ghostwriting and would investigate .
The documents on ghostwriting were uncovered by lawyers suing Wyeth and were made public after a request in court from PLoS Medicine , a medical journal from the Public Library of Science , and The New York Times .
A spokesman for Wyeth said that the articles were scientifically accurate and that pharmaceutical companies routinely hired medical writing companies to assist authors in drafting manuscripts .
The court documents provide a detailed paper trail showing how Wyeth contracted with a medical communications company to outline articles , draft them , and then solicit top physicians to sign their names , even though many of the doctors contributed little or no writing .
The documents suggest the practice went well beyond the case of Wyeth and hormone therapy , involving numerous drugs from other pharmaceutical companies .
“ It ’s almost like steroids and baseball , ’’ said Dr. Joseph S. Ross , an assistant professor of geriatrics at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York , who has conducted research on ghostwriting .
“ You do n’t know who was using and who was n’t ; you do n’t know which articles are tainted and which are n’t . ’’
Because physicians rely on medical literature , the concern about ghostwriting is that doctors might change their prescribing habits after reading certain articles , unaware they were commissioned by a drug company .
Wyeth faces 8,400 lawsuits from women who claim that the company ’s hormone drugs caused them to develop illnesses .

There are articles covering detailed elements of Scientology belief and practice , important people in the religion , important debunkers of the religion , important documents released by the important debunkers , and important cases about the legality of release of the important documents .
Each is a potential battleground between the two camps , often while being viewed only a few dozen times a day .
In essence , they preach to the converted or those who used to be converted .
“ One of the problems we keep bumping into is what I call core belief issues  politics , religion , nationalism , ” Mr. Davies said .
“ Fringe faiths , fringe nationalities . ”
The Scientology decision , which received plenty of news coverage , brought the Arbitration Committee ( or ArbCom ) to public view .
No doubt , most users of Wikipedia had no idea that there was a court of last resort for disputes on the site .
Tens of millions of people around the world use Wikipedia , but few users  even the most frequent editors  can say how or why it works .
The two members of the committee I interviewed agreed that the committee was not vital to Wikipedia ’s continued operation  the Hatfields and McCoys , after all , were largely left to their own devices by the government and people knew to stay away  but they said that having a way to ban people of bad faith made the site more friendly , more efficient and more welcoming to new editors .
Wikipedia users elect the panel members , and Mr. Matetsky reports that he is the only active lawyer among them , though there are a few law students .
He said , “ It is considered ironic ; I ’m the gung - ho litigation attorney but often on the side of second chances and leniency . ”
He says he often is opposed to outright bans  he abstained on some of the sanctions in the Scientology case  because “ to a user who is banned , Wikipedia is ‘ the encyclopedia anyone can edit , ’ except for you . ”
The discovery that Wikipedia is not the anarchic paradise some might imagine can be a shock .
Others see hypocrisy , evidence that there is a class of users who control what appears there , people who benefit from Wikipedia ’s huge public clout with little public scrutiny .
But taking the longer view , it is apparent that in its brief history , Wikipedia is quickly replicating the creation of society , from an Eden ( no rules , no need for rules ) to a modern entity .
“ Bureaucracy is inevitable , ” said Joseph Reagle , whose Ph.D. thesis was about the history of Wikipedia and collaborative culture , crediting the German sociologist Max Weber .
“ Even if you have a supposed anarchy or collective , that does n’t mean the rules are n’t there , just that they are implicit . ”

Speculators busier as crude oil cost spikes OIL PRICES
Traders in the oil options pit work at the New York Mercantile Exchange , September 9 , 2008 .
Crude oil was trading around $ 103 a barrel at mid day after OPEC ministers were to hold a meeting and hurricane Ike was heading towards Gulf of Mexico oil platforms .

Speculators now account for half of all traders in the main U.S. oil market , and their growing presence coincided with this decade 's historic rise in the price of crude , according to a new Rice University study .
Released Thursday , the study does not try to prove that speculators caused the price spike , as many politicians and consumer advocates believe .
But the authors note that prices rose steadily along with the number of speculative investors , and fell with them as well .
Seven years ago , speculators accounted for 20 percent of oil traders on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
That number jumped to 55 percent by the time oil prices reached their all - time peak above $ 145 per barrel last summer .
Now oil costs $ 72 , and speculative investors account for half the traders .
The study is sure to fuel the simmering debate in Washington over tightening regulation of the oil markets .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" It 's a complex issue , but these are inescapable facts that need to be part of the debate , " said Ken Medlock , one of the authors and an energy research fellow at Rice 's James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy .
Medlock and co-author Amy Myers Jaffe link the rise of speculators to a federal law , passed in 2000 , that loosened oil market regulation .
The government limits the number of oil contracts that each speculator can hold .
But under the Commodity Futures Modernization
Act , trades on electronic exchanges or overseas markets do n't count toward those limits .
" You can't blame speculators , because they 're doing exactly what you 'd expect them to do , " Medlock said .
" They 're taking larger and larger positions , because the regulations are flawed .
If you want to blame someone , blame legislators . "
The study uses data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , a federal panel that recently held hearings on increasing oil market regulation .
Speculators are defined as traders who use oil strictly as a financial investment , those who will never take delivery of a tanker - full of crude .
Consumer advocates who have spent years complaining about the 2000 law welcomed the study , hoping it will add to the momentum for changing the rules .
" This confirms what we and others have said for some time , " said Tyson Slocum , director of the energy program at the Public Citizen watchdog group .
" The good thing from the oil price run-up of 2008 is it has forced Congress to realize there 's a problem in these markets , and the answer is re-regulation . "
The financial industry opposes tightening the regulations , saying it would restrict the number of investors in the market and possibly give a handful of players greater control .
" We have just emphasized that those market participants who do n't actually receive physical delivery play an important role in the markets , and limiting people 's access to those markets just ends up pushing market share into a smaller number of hands , " said Andrew DeSouza , spokesman for the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association .
The study also warns that oil may be caught in a vicious cycle with the U.S. dollar .
Many investors fleeing a weakened dollar have put their money into oil .
But that pushes up the price of oil , which increases America 's trade deficit because the country imports so much petroleum .
Rising trade deficits further weaken the dollar .
" There 's been a significant , structural change in the way oil and the dollar are linked , " Medlock said .
" It makes monetary policy much more difficult , frankly . "

What you need to know is that my best friend adopted her .
My friend called me and said , " now , you have to get past her looks ... she REALLY is sweet . "
Sure enough , she was sweet and for the next 10 years of her life lived the life you had hoped she would have .
Her life was filled with swims , playmates , early morning walks , car rides , hikes and lots of love .
She died in her bereaved owner 's arms last Saturday , succumbing to the affects of advanced liver disease .
When she was adopted , it was obvious she had been loved and cared for .. impeccible manners , good basic training and she really wanted to please .
I hope you see this post so that you know that you did the right thing in surrendering her and can stop wondering .
She lived the life she deserved .
( CNN ) -- Each day an estimated 6,000 Americans will try marijuana for the first time .
It 's the most common illicit drug in the United States with nearly 15 million people using it at least once a month .
Melissa Etheridge took medical marijuana to help her through her chemotherapy .
All this week , " Anderson Cooper 360 " is taking a close look at the deeply divisive issue of drug legalization in a series of reports .
It 's a special " 360 " investigation called " America 's High : The case for and against pot . "
The topic of medical marijuana inspires particular controversy .
As of right now , 13 states have laws that permit marijuana , also know as cannabis , to be taken for medical conditions .
There is no prescription for cannabis ; instead doctors issue a recommendation in these states .
But is it safe ?
Is it effective ?
Does it actually work ?
Melissa Etheridge says it worked for her .
The Grammy Award - winning singer - songwriter turned to marijuana after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 .
Watch Etheridge talk about how marijuana affected her »
In an interview , Etheridge talked to CNN's Anderson Cooper on why she did it and how she believes it helped restore her health .
She 's now pushing for its legalization .
The following is an edited version of the interview .
Melissa Etheridge : I 'm actually grateful for my cancer diagnosis .
Anderson Cooper : Grateful because it changed your life ?
Etheridge :
It changed my life ; woke me up totally .
Cooper :
What is the pain [ of chemotherapy ] like ?
Etheridge :
It was just a general pain of your body dying , of all your cells dying .
Your appetite is gone .
And you are nauseous .
And your hair is falling out .
Your skin -- it 's like death .
And the only thing I could do is lay there .
I can't -- it hurt to -- light hurt , sound hurt .
I could n't read anything .
I just laid there .
( Etheridge did n't want to use Vicodin or other prescription pills , she said . )
All of these things have side effects .
So , the steroids and the pain relief that they give you on that first day when you go into chemotherapy causes constipation .
So they will -- here is a pill for the constipation which will give you diarrhea .
And you get huge side effects from all of this .
Cooper :
The first time you did [ marijuana ] , it made a big difference ?
Etheridge : Instantly -- and instantly within a minute relieves the nausea , relieves the pain .
And all of a sudden I was normal .
You do n't take medicinal marijuana to get high .
Cooper :
So you were n't getting high ?
Etheridge :
No you do n't get a high .
No it 's not a high .
It was normal .
And I could -- all of a sudden I could get out of bed .
I could go see my kid .
And it was amazing .
( Etheridge often did n't smoke ; the marijuana was mixed into butter and spread on food , or run through a vaporizer . )
Cooper : Did you ever worry about becoming addicted ?
They were saying this is a gateway drug ?
Etheridge : No .
Not at all .
If you were on that side , you would understand what I mean .
It is almost laughable to think that you could be addicted .
This is not at all .
Cooper :
You mention you still have a prescription .
Do you still use marijuana ?
Etheridge : Yes , I do .
The effects on my gastrointestinal system leave me with a real intolerance for acid of any kind , and so acid reflux is a constant problem .
I do n't want to take the little pills that they give you that have all the side effects to help with that .
And I do use it -- I 'm one of the users that would like in a stressful situation or maybe when I 've eaten that cheese pizza with my kids that I will do that and it settles -- totally completely settles all that .
Cooper : Most people eat the cheese pizza after the marijuana .
Etheridge :
That is true .
Cooper :
You 've got it backwards .
Etheridge : No .
It 's not like that .
I know .
Cooper :
There 's more than , I think , 200,000 people in California who are registered to receive medicinal marijuana .
Do you really believe that all those people though have legitimate reasons to be getting marijuana ?
Etheridge : Yes .
Who are we to say what a legitimate reason is ?
If it helps somebody at the end of the day instead of drinking a couple of glasses of wine , to have a few tokes , who are we to say ?
Why must we in this country be so judgmental about this ?
These people are not hurting anybody .
They are not hurting themselves .
Are the big beer companies testing President Obama ’s tolerance ?
Anheuser - Busch InBev  purveyor of the president ’s preferred brew , Bud Light  and MillerCoors , a joint venture between SABMiller and Molson Coors , are raising prices at the same time , during a recession and while beer demand is slumping .
With 80 percent of the market between them , the move almost begs for an antitrust review .
Both brewing groups typically adjust the price on a six - pack every year to reflect changes in the costs of ingredients like barley or hops .
But their ability to do so now , while their customers are hurting most , highlights the pricing power that has accompanied industry consolidation .
While Anheuser - Busch , acquired last year by InBev of Belgium , has long held a dominant share of the market , the number of big players has decreased .
From 1947 to 1995 , the number of American brewers fell by more than 90 percent .
Though a surge in craft producers followed , few compete directly with mass - market suds like Budweiser or Miller .
That was fine so long as the Big Three  Anheuser , Miller and Coors Brewing  were at one another ’s throats .
And boy , were they .

What world do Republicans live in ?
Apparently one in which Welfare Queens drive Cadillacs and Latinos and illegal immigrants routinely ace God-fearing white Americans out of their rightful jobs .
Where uppity women do n't realize their place is supporting the men in their lives and flounce about , getting abortions willy - nilly ?
Where laws are really only intended for the unwashed masses and the oligarchy they reinforce are above such mundane concerns .
Indeed , if you listen to Sen.
Judd Gregg , it is also a world where 20 million young people make over $ 75,000 a year and choose not to get health insurance , frittering it all away with their fancy cars and electronic cell phone / camera / potato peelers , I 'm sure .
WALLACE : Well , you say that you would like to see the 40 - plus million -- there are arguments about specifically how many there are , but the 40 - plus million uninsured get coverage .
Under your idea , how would they get it ?
How would the government help them get it ?
And how would you pay for it ?
GREGG : Well , first , it ’s not a monolithic group .
About 20 million of those folks earn more than $ 75,000 .
They ’re basically young people who opt to spend their money on something other than health care insurance .
The way we would cover those folks is we would require them to buy health care policies for catastrophic events .
They would have to self - insure under that .
Say it with me now : WTF ????
Good to know that this is the man Obama wanted to head the Commerce Department , is n't it ?
Since he 's used these numbers ( or a variation of them ) before , for a split second , I thought about searching for where Gregg got his " facts " , but honestly , I just do n't want to be that close to Gregg 's nether regions , because that 's the only place such a ludicrous claim could come from .
Here are some real facts that Gregg might want to chew on :
CDC : Percentage of Americans With Private Health Insurance Hits 50 - Year Low
Some experts blamed the faltering economy and corporate decisions to raise health insurance premiums — or do away with employee coverage — as the main drivers of the recent data .
They say coverage statistics for 2009 may look even worse .
However , public coverage of adults is rising in some states , due to programs like Medicaid expanding eligibility .
So not all the adults without private coverage are uninsured , Thorpe said
.
Income Gaps Hit Record Levels In 2006 , New Data Show
Rich - Poor Gap Tripled Between 1979 and 2006
The data reveal starkly uneven income growth over recent decades .
Between 1979 and 2006 , real after - tax incomes rose by 256 percent — or $ 863,000 — for the top 1 percent of households , compared to 21 percent — or $ 9,200 — for households in the middle fifth of households and 11 percent — or $ 1,600 — for households in the bottom fifth . [..]
In 2006 , the average household in the top 1 percent had an income of $ 1.2 million , up $ 63,000 just from the prior year ; this $ 63,000 gain is nearly two times the total income of the average middle - income household . [ 1 ]
In addition , the share of national after - tax income going to the top 1 percent of households more than doubled between 1979 and 2006 , rising from 7.5 percent to 16.3 percent .
Taken together with prior research , the new data suggest greater income concentration at the top than at any time since 1929 . [ 2 ]
But Gregg thinks the answer is to mandate insurance and tax benefits :
GREGG : Well , that ’s going to cost money .
That ’s going to cost money , and the way we pay for it is by limiting the deductibility of high - end health insurance premium plans .
So we do pay for it , and we do cover everyone , and we put in place a replacement of the reimbursement system so we reimburse doctors on the basis of quality and outcomes rather than on the basis of the number of procedures .
Uh huh .
That 'll work .
Hey Judd , how ' bout you do some reading :

Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi announced plans to form a new and inclusive political front on Thursday , while warning his country has become " more militarized " since last month 's disputed election .
Mousavi , who has refused to accept the results that acclaimed hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the victor of the June 12 vote , said on his website that the new political front would have a charter and legal structure .
He added it would not be a substitute for street protests against the election , which have emerged as one of the greatest challenges to the Iranian regime since the founding of the Islamic Republic in 1979 .
Mousavi also implicitly accused the security forces of exceeding their powers under Iran 's constitution , suggesting that the " near - coup d'etat atmosphere " was a danger to the Islamic Republic .
Meanwhile , Mousavi's wife said Thursday her 62 - year - old brother is among the hundreds arrested in Iran 's post-election crackdown .
Police , Revolutionary Guards and the pro-Ahmadinejad volunteer Basij militia arrested more than 2,500 people in their heavy crackdown against protests that erupted in support of Mousavi after the disputed election .
More than 500 remain in prison , including many top politicians from pro-reform political parties , human rights lawyers , journalists and activists .
Arrests have continued in recent weeks , while Tehran has barred most foreign media from working in the country , making it difficult to verify reports of more demonstrations .
Mousavi has demanded another vote and decried the Ahmadinejad government as illegitimate .
Iranian authorities claim the post-election turmoil has been instigated by enemy countries aiming to thwart Ahmadinejad 's re-election , and officials say some of those detained have confessed to fomenting unrest .
The Obama Administration Wants To Block The Release Of Torture Photos
Today , the Obama administration asked the Supreme Court to hear its appeal of a court ruling requiring the release of 21 photographs depicting the abuse of prisoners held in US custody at overseas locations .
In September 2008 , the US Court of Appeal for the 2ND Circuit ordered the release of the photos after the ACLU filled a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act .
The Obama administration originally indicated that it would release the photographs , but then abruptly switched its position before the agreed deadline .
Amrit Singh , an attorney with the ACLU , made the following statement today : “ The appeal court soundly rejected all the government arguments for withholding the photos , and it is unfortunate that the government has chosen to contest that decision .
These photos would provide visual proof that prisoner abuse by US personnel was not aberrational but widespread , reaching far beyond the walls of Abu Ghraib .
As disturbing as the photos may be , it is critical that the American people know the full truth about the abuse that occurred in their name . ”
* New flu virus not connected to H1N1 outbreak
* Hogs may have transmitted virus to workers ( Recasts , adds quotes from health minister 4th paragraph , background )
SASKATOON , Saskatchewan , July 7 ( Reuters ) - Canadian officials said on Tuesday they had identified yet another new flu virus , this one a mixture of human and swine influenzas , in two farm workers in Western Canada .
The new virus did not make the two workers seriously ill and is not related to the current H1N1 pandemic influenza strain , the Public Health Agency of Canada said .
The two workers , both employees at a hog barn operation in the province of Saskatchewan , have fully recovered .
A third case is under investigation .
" Preliminary results indicate the risk to public health is low and that Canadians who have been vaccinated against the regular , seasonal flu should have some immunity to this new flu strain , " Canada 's health minister , Leona Aglukkaq , said in a statement .
The new virus contains genes from a seasonal human H1N1 flu strain and a flu virus common in the swine population called triple reassortant H3N2 , said Dr. Greg Douglas , Saskatchewan 's chief veterinary officer .
The virus is not connected to the new swine flu H1N1 strain that has killed 429 people worldwide .
That strain , labeled a pandemic by the World Health Organization , is also a mixture of swine viruses with some genes from human and avian influenzas .
Since the new H1N1 broke out , officials in Canada , the United States and a few other countries have stepped up testing of both people and swine for flu viruses .
People and pigs can swap flu viruses , although it has been documented only rarely .
In April , a herd in Alberta became infected with the new H1N1 virus and although health officials initially suspected a visiting worker infected the herd , that has since been ruled out and no one knows how the pigs became infected .
" Initial testing of some of the pigs on the farm suggests they were infected with swine influenza A virus , a common flu found in swine herds , " the Public Health Agency of Canada said in a statement .
HUMAN HEALTH ISSUE
But Douglas said the herd did not have an unusually high level of illness .
Flu viruses are common among pigs and cause mild disease , usually .
" This is a human health issue , " Douglas said .
" Saskatchewan pork continues to be safe ...
This is not a food safety issue at all . "
The Saskatchewan farm is not under quarantine , but the owner has agreed not to move the pigs , said Dr. Frank Plummer , chief science adviser for the Public Health Agency of Canada .
The virus would likely not have been detected at all if not for heightened influenza testing as a result of the pandemic , Plummer said .
" Any time there 's a new influenza A strain , we have to be concerned about it , but these events occur and are almost always dead ends , " he said .
All workers on the hog farm are being vaccinated .
Douglas said he expects the hogs will eventually go to slaughter as they normally would .
The workers have been in Saskatchewan for about one year and had not recently traveled , said Dr. Moira McKinnon , Saskatchewan 's chief medical officer .
Plummer said the new virus was likely transmitted from the pigs to the workers .
More than a dozen countries have banned Canadian hogs or pork since the quarantine .
Bob Harding , executive director of the Canadian Swine Health Board , said there is concern that markets could misinterpret the new virus 's connection to swine .
" This is a poorly understood science .
It 's changing as we speak , but it 's not a pig thing , " Harding said .

Not everyone is on board with Mixed Martial Arts yet , but more and more sports fans are getting accustomed to our sport .
With the increased popularity of the sport , it ’s becoming mainstream and it ’s just getting started .
To the uninformed , people who are n’t into MMA ( Mixed Martial Arts ) , the fights seem unconventional compared to more widely accepted arts like boxing , wrestling and karate .
Oddly enough , MMA is a combination of the three with elements of many other arts incorporated .
The sport has evolved many times over to most effectively control , submit or knock out a true resisting opponent .
I compete in the Ultimate Fighting Championship , which most involved with the sport simply call the UFC .
It ’s not the Ultimate Street Fight and it ’s not the Ultimate Dog Fight .
I might be offended by the writer ’s comments if he were more informed or took the time to actually research the facts .
If the writer knew how much safer the UFC was than boxing , he would not have likened it to dog fighting .
As part of an upcoming sport , it ’s my job to not only fight in the ring but also be an ambassador to the sport .
There are over 200 fighters under contract in the UFC , which is the NFL of Mixed Martial Arts promotions .
Many of these fighters come from diverse backgrounds and are graduates from some of the best schools in the country .
Miguel Torres of East Chicago , Indiana paid his way through school by fighting while others were tending bar .
Miguel earned a degree in marketing from Purdue University .
Miguel is the current WEC Bantamweight champion .
Former UFC
Middleweight champion Rich Franklin is a former math teacher from Cincinnati with a master ’s degree in Education , Jim Miller attended Virginia Tech and Brock Lesnar was an NCAA wrestling champion and is the current UFC Heavyweight Champion .
Some have master ’s degrees while others have bachelors .
There are really too many to list .
Frank Mir was raised in a true martial arts family and earned a black belt in Karate at the age of 12 .
Frank won a state wrestling championship in high school at 17 and earned a black belt in Jiu- Jitsu in three and a half short years .
Frank ’s stage eventually became an Octagon surrounded by plastic coated chain link fence .
It ’s within this Octagon that he shows the world his martial arts skills and shares his valuable message of perseverance with the world as he is a former UFC Heavyweight Champion .
You would be hard pressed to find a more articulate man in any professional sport .
Our sport has been likened to dog fighting which anyone will say is cruel .
Dogs have no choice and are bred to fight , injure and maim the other dog .
They are kept in poor conditions and are anything but family pets .
Fighters on the other hand make up their own minds regarding their career path , just like you have done .
I choose to compete in mixed martial arts for the competition of it all .
I love to compete and the UFC has the best fighting conditions , best referees , the best doctors and an outstanding safety record .
Fights are stopped at the first sign of a fighter being unable to defend himself or the first sign that the fighter does not want to continue .
It is my job to not only inform the original writer but also all of those that he has misinformed .
I appreciate that everyone has their own opinion but I get to express mine as well .
I do not believe the writer has been to a dog fight , nor has he been to a UFC fight , or met with a 40 year old boxer with a slur from taking thousands of shots to the head .
I also doubt he has taken a look at a punch count showing a comparison of what a mixed martial arts fighters takes versus that of a boxer .
Boxing averages 11 deaths per year .
In the over 15 year history of Mixed Martial Arts , there has been one death in the United States and it was not in the Ultimate Fighting Championship .
Long before its incarnation that we see today , pankration was the original form of mixed martial arts .
It was truly the first fighting system in human history and was used by Ancient Greeks back in 648 BC .
US Soldiers today practice mixed martial arts to prepare for hand to hand combat .
Myself and many other UFC fighters have gone all around the world ( Kuwait , Afghanistan , Iraq , etc ) to work with and help train our nations troops .
Tighter rules along the way have helped , in addition to strict supervision by a state appointed sanctioning body .
Fighters are required to go through a laundry list of medical testing before every fight .
Before my first fight in the UFC I had to see about 7 different doctors and specialists just to get licensed .
I had to have a physical , blood work for Hepatitis and HIV , an MRI , an ophthalmologic exam and a few EEG’s .
In some cases , I saw specialists both at home and then the commission ’s own specialists .
It turns out , fighter safety is always the number one priority .
It ’s a poor comparison between sports where fighter safety is so important to dog fighting where safety is the last thing on anyone ’s mind .
I ca n’t help but liken the article to the way a lot of lazy college students write papers .
They form their uninformed opinion and then write their paper based on their own preconceived notions .
It ’s pretty easy to run a quick online search for information on the web to support your point of view .
Generally though , even lazy college students are bright enough to use information that is less than 10 years old to back up their claims .
I eagerly await this particular writer ’s future shocking pieces about Bill Clinton ’s extra-marital affairs and how all computers are going to go haywire for Y2 k .
Let ’s get with the times .
Writers , among others , loves to sensationalize things .
This case is no different .
This particular Boston Globe writer is calling our sport “ human dog fighting ” while another LA Times columnist writes about the crowd being hungry for blood .
No doubt , these two writers will be referencing and quoting one another for a long time about the barbarism that is supposedly in our sport .
In the day and age when everyone has an online blog , you can always find someone who shares your opinion .
Regardless of what the ignorant claim , Mixed Martial Arts fights are between two willing competitors that at the professional level have spent considerate amounts of time improving their skills in a number of Olympic sports .
These sports include boxing , wrestling , karate , judo , tae kwon do and jiu - jitsu .
All ages and levels of experience are encouraged to participate in these sports .
The Ultimate Fighting Championship was started by Rorion Gracie to show the world the validity of his family ’s style of jiu - jitsu .
The best representatives of all these other martial arts were pitted against one another and Rorion ’s family were the victors in the end .
The UFC was never about a blood sport even though the original promoters let if flirt with that line .
Back then , the sport was new and there was no regulation .
The times have changed and modern day mixed martial arts has grown and is very safe .
The sport is highly regulated and is one of the safest in the world .

There are plans for more camps at Easter and in the half - term holidays
An atheist summer camp in Somerset is offering children aged seven to 17 a " godless alternative " to religious camps traditionally run by the scouts and church groups .
Some of the 24 children arriving at Camp Quest in Bruton seemed a little young to be tackling the weighty concepts ahead of them .
The summer camp , designed with the children of atheist parents in mind , has a slightly daunting mission statement .
It is " dedicated to improving the human condition through rational inquiry , critical and creative thinking , scientific method and the separation of religion and government " .
Certainly the Murray boys - John , Julius and Leeroy , aged nine , eight and seven respectively - were focusing on the simple pleasures of living under canvas for five days and taking part in traditional activities like climbing , canoeing and rafting .
' Sceptical approach ' John said : " I 'm looking forward to making new friends , meeting new people and doing all the activities set up for us . "
Leeroy noted : " I like activities because it will give you more health , and you will be quite fit for running the 200 metres . "
While Julius added : " I like sleeping in sleeping bags because it 's nice and cosy and it covers the whole body . "
The 24 children were housed in a dozen brown and green tents grouped around a camp - fire on a sloping grassy meadow fringed with trees .
Camp organisers say they tell children " how " not " what " to think
The rafting got off to a noisy start as teams of six took to the waters of the River Brue on crafts they had constructed from blue plastic drums and planks of wood .
Among other early activities was an obstacle course including rubber tyres and netting which the children completed blindfolded .
The camp sets out to teach co-operation , tolerance and empathy .
But it is the approach to life 's bigger questions that sets it apart - especially its treatment of religion .
Its website describes a sceptical approach , stating : " Campers are taught that ethical behaviour is not dependent on religious belief and doctrines , that religious belief and doctrines are sometimes a hindrance to ethical and moral behaviour , and that irreligious persons are also good and fully capable of living a happy and meaningful life . "
The camp 's director , Samantha Stein , insisted it was intended to get the children to think for themselves .
She said : " If the children were to come up with a question about creationism for example , we would discuss the evidence .
We would n't say , ' Creationism is rubbish ' if they weigh the evidence and think there 's a good case for it . "
Most mainstream Christians would not include creationism as part of their faith , and would also encourage the " rational inquiry " suggested by Camp Quest .
At least one of the parents delivering children to the Mill on the Brue activity centre had already taken his daughter to one of the many Christian summer camps , but wanted to give her wider experience .
It 's really a way of trying to get the kids involved in philosophical thinking but in a way they do n't realise they 're doing it
Samantha Stein , camp director
The father of the Murray boys , also called Leeroy , said he would also be happy to take them to a Christian camp .
He said : " The biggest thing here for me is to give them a range of experiences and to encourage them as far as possible in understanding religion and to understand science and to give them the tools for them to make up their own mind which direction they want to go . "
Fellow parent Crispian Jago also endorsed Camp Quest 's aim of getting children to think for themselves .
" Anything that can teach the children ways of thinking critically , ways of examining arguments , and recognising logical fallacies and trying to determine for themselves what they believe is true , then I think that 's a positive thing , " he said .
The camp insists that when it comes to God , it is not telling the children what to think so much as how to think .
Camp Quest was born in the US 13 years ago , as secularists sought an alternative in a summer camp market dominated by religious institutions .
The British version is costing participants £ 275 for the five days , and there are plans for others , at Easter and during half - term holidays .
Invisible unicorns
By evening the uncertain weather had produced a number of sharp downpours and by sunset there was a definite chill in the air .
But the children gathered round the camp - fire with their enthusiasm undimmed , to be set their principal task of the week .
For the " centrepiece " of its scientific approach to religion the camp asks its participants to search for two invisible unicorns .
The unicorns cannot be seen or heard , tasted , smelt or touched , they cannot escape from the camp and they eat nothing .
More about Atheism
The only proof of their existence is contained in an ancient book handed down over " countless generations " .
A prize - a £ 10 note signed by Professor Richard Dawkins - is offered to any child who can disprove the existence of the unicorns .
Outside the camp gates , a single lonely demonstrator criticised both Professor Dawkins and the camp he supports .
Paul Arblaster , the chaplain of a non-denominational church in the small cathedral city of Wells in Somerset , was holding two home - made placards .
He claimed the unicorn story showed that the camp did not limit its teaching about religion to neutral " rational inquiry " .
" Certainly I think there 's a slant on it .
They may deny that the unicorn exercise is anything to do with God , but I think it 's a fairly thinly - veiled representation of that sort of indoctrination , " he said .
But Ms Stein denied the claim , saying : " The object is not to bash religion or to tell the kids that there 's no such thing as God .
The object is to get the kids to think about things like the burden of proof .
" So , who has to prove the unicorns are there ... is it the person who says they are there or is it the person who 's saying , ' No , I do n't think you 're right ' ?
" So it 's really a way of trying to get the kids involved in philosophical thinking but in a way they do n't realise they 're doing it . "

Tweety really let " Americans for Prosperity " President Tim Phillips have it on Hardball last night .
Boy , he 's really got a bug up his butt about health - care reform and he just wo n't let go :
MATTHEWS : " How do we get around the problem that there 's so many people out there , and this is why we 're having this debate , sir ... the question that 's bothered the American people since , what ?
since Teddy Roosevelt 's time , is some people have health insurance and some do n't .
How do we reconcile that with our sense in this country of looking out for each other , to some extent , to some extent . "
" Here 's my problem with you guys .
The conservatives talk reasonably when the Democrats get in power and say ' well , we 've got an alternative that 's more free - market , it 's less onerous , it 's less big - shot , big - government stuff ...' but when you guys are in power , you do n't do anything on health care .
And that 's what happens , and that 's why for , god , almost a century of foot - dragging on this , the Democrats get in power , whether it 's Truman or it 's Bill Clinton , or it 's Hillary Clinton , or it 's Barack Obama , they try something and it fails , because you guys are good at playing negative politics .
You 're really good at destroying Democrats plans , chances for reform ... "

Written by Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com }
I recently finished reading two books by the Anglican bishop John Shelby Spong , Rescuing the Bible From Fundamentalism and Why Christianity Must Change or Die .
Spong is infamous for his near - total rejection of the tenets of Christianity , despite being a member of the clergy , and these books witness to that : he does n’t believe in miracles or an afterlife , denies the Trinity , denies the incarnation and resurrection of Jesus , and in fact , does n’t believe in God as an external supernatural being at all .
In place of all these things he proposes a nontheist form of Christianity , similar to some forms of Quakerism or Buddhism , in which God is understood as the ground of all being or the impulse calling us to love one another , and Jesus as a person who uniquely manifested that attitude of universal love .
There are other aspects of this theology I want to discuss later , but for today I want to focus on just one point :
Spong ’s insistence that Christianity ’s evolution into a nontheistic form is inevitable .
This is necessary , he says , because traditional theistic religion is losing its power to command educated human beings ’ allegiance , and if Christianity does not adapt , it will die out .
In fact , he says , the demise of fundamentalism and literalist religion is coming very soon :
“ Organized religion as we have known it in the Western world is considered by many a friend and foe alike to be sick unto death .
The periodic revivals of fundamentalism are momentary blips on the EKG charts of religious history . ”
— Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism , p.107
On this point , Spong could n’t be more wrong .
He envisions fundamentalism as a dying movement , one that ’s losing its strength and vitality .
In fact , fundamentalism is still a powerful force , and there are signs that it is gaining strength at the expense of more traditional , liberal denominations such as his .
Although Spong alludes to the appeal of fundamentalism , he seems not to grasp its full force .
Fundamentalism ’s great strength is that it offers easy answers , a reassuring sense of certainty in an uncertain world , and a promise of wish - fulfillment for the believer .
Spong writes that these advantages are counterbalanced by the fact that the fundamentalist view of God is “ naive at best and unbelievable at worst ” ( Why Christianity Must Change or Die , p.140 ) .
But what he really seems to mean is that he , himself , can no longer take these stories seriously , and he assumes that his skepticism is widely shared .
In reality , there are hundreds of millions of people worldwide who see no difficulty in believing that creation happened six thousand years ago , that God does miracles on behalf of the faithful , or that Jesus rose into the sky because that ’s where Heaven is .
Some of these people have never been exposed to rational thinking ; others have consciously chosen to reject it in favor of a simpler , older , and more reassuring vision of the world .
For all its virtues , Spong ’s theology is weak and colorless .
His faith of homogenous , universal love is well and good , but the fact remains that there are other , powerful motivating factors in human psychology that he never attempts to tap .
The desire to obey one ’s superiors , and the sense of righteous judgment at those who break the rules ; the sense of privilege and exclusiveness , belonging to a community that is united against the world ; and its opposite , the xenophobic sense of hate and rage directed against the outsider – these are extraordinarily strong psychological impulses which his theology does not speak to or address .
Fundamentalism does , which is why it ’s no surprise that it finds willing converts in the millions who are driven by their baser instincts .
Spong ’s mistake is a common one : he assumes that everyone views the world the same way he does .
( Ironically , religious fundamentalists often do the same thing , which leads them to conclude that every nonbeliever must be a stubborn sinner who willfully denies their own knowledge of the Truth of God . )
Since he personally finds supernaturalism unbelievable , he thinks everyone else believes the same thing , which is why he predicts the imminent demise of theistic religion .
But the truth is that , although the world ’s religions have been forced to adapt in various ways to modernity , they are alive and vital all the same .
Fundamentalism is a highly adaptable creed , able to accommodate itself to almost any era .
The rumors of its demise are greatly exaggerated .
In the long run – and here we ’re talking several hundred years or more – I do believe that religion will die out .
As we become more and more able to understand and control our world through reason , its inadequacy will become more obvious , and the secularization of humankind will accelerate .
But that does n’t say anything about which kind of religion will survive the longest .
I strongly suspect that some form of fundamentalism will be among the diehards .
A watered - down , contentless theology like Spong ’s , on the other hand , offers nothing to compete with a robust philosophy of humanistic atheism , and as the atheist movement grows more influential , such faiths will probably be the first to go .
oh. my .
god.words cant even explain how beautiful this photo is , the moment i saw this my jaw truly dropped and its is such an incredible view and you capture its just right !
it is a truly amazing photo and i was i was there to soak in the beauty of that city !
amazing photo you did such a great job
Filibuster Nation
I do n't know whether Harold Meyerson or his editors thought up the term " filibuster nation . "
But it 's a good 'un .
It 's not just that vocal minorities dominate the workings of the Senate , but they also have a tendency to overwhelm the public debate .
How much time have you spent hearing about " Birthers " in recent weeks ?
Or tea parties ?
Remember PUMAs ?
That 's largely a media - driven phenomenon , though .
The filibuster , by contrast , is embedded in the Senate 's procedures .
It can be changed .
And it should be .
There are two ways to look at the filibuster .
One is that it increases bipartisanship , because it forces the majority to cut deals with the minority .
That 's the traditional view , and it has proved wrong .
The problem is that it 's premised on the assumption that the first - best outcome for the minority party is a bipartisan bill .
That 's not true .
The first - best outcome for the minority -- be it Democratic or Republican -- has proved to be no bill .
That 's how Republicans returned to power in 1994 and how Democrats took back the Congress in 2006 .
This makes intuitive sense when you think about it .
A minority legislator 's first goal is to win reelection .
Their second goal is to reenter the majority so they can write the legislation .
Giving the ruling party a major accomplishment -- either bipartisan or partisan -- makes both goals harder to achieve .
So the minority does not use the filibuster for that purpose .
The goal is not a bipartisan bill .
It 's no bill .
There 's a good argument , in fact , that eliminating the filibuster would make the Senate a more , rather than less , bipartisan institution .
For many legislative efforts , it would remove the " no bill " outcome from the list of possibilities .
That would leave minority legislators with one of two options .
Vote against a bill that will pass , or work to change and improve and add priorities to a bill that will pass .
You might imagine that if " no bill " is the first - best outcome , then a " no vote " would be the second - best outcome .
But that 's not always true : Voters are n't very interested in ineffectual opposition .
They 're interested in what you 've " done . "
That can mean killing a bad bill or improving a successful bill .
Voting no , over and over again , is n't a very impressive record in any but the most partisan districts .

In March of this year , National Public Radio ( NPR ) revealed that by the end of 2008 , 23.6 million people were tuning into its broadcasts each week .
In fact , NPR 's ratings have increased steadily since 2000 , and they 've managed to hold on to much of their 2008 election coverage listenership bump ( with over 26 million people tuning in each week so far in 2009 ) , unlike many of their mainstream media counterparts .
Compared to cable news , where most networks are shedding viewers , and newspapers , where circulation continues to plummet , NPR is starting to look like they have the future of news all figured out .
Or at least , they appear to doing a lot better at it than the rest of the traditional media .
But what is NPR doing differently that 's causing their listener numbers to swell ?
They basically have a three - pronged strategy that is helping them not only grow now , but also prepare for the future media landscape where traditional methods of consumption ( TV , radio , print ) could be greatly marginalized in favor of digital distribution .
A Focus On Local
Though most people think of NPR as a radio station , it 's actually a news gathering and production organization that sources and creates content for member stations ( which are different than affiliates in that they 're completely independent entities ) .
According to new CEO Vivian Schiller , that means that NPR has a culture incredibly devoted to local coverage .
" To me , local is the big play , because local commercial radio has abandoned the local market .
Local newspapers are withering or sometimes dying .
The big national media companies , including excellent ones like The New York Times , cannot afford to be covering every single community .
So that leaves a big , gaping hole to serve Americans ' local coverage , " she told mediabistro.com in April .
Focusing on local information is a very smart approach for two reasons .
One , because as Schiller says , it fills a gap in coverage , and two , because many people feel that delivering and aggregating hyperlocal content will be an important part of the future of media .
In 2007 , Alex Iskold , the CEO of semantic web application company AdaptiveBlue , predicted the rise of hyperlocal information , indicating that extremely targeted local advertising could be the path forward for the ad industry .
" Despite globalization , hyperlocal information is very valuable both to people and advertisers .
In the coming years , we will be seeing the rise of a new way to look at information - geography .
Inspired by utility and the promise of hyperlocal advertising , startups are racing to build businesses that deliver highly relevant , local information to users , " he wrote .
Earlier this week we noted here on Mashable just how much more useful information can be when it is locally relevant .
So for NPR , going local is a way to reach disenfranchised listeners , provide more utility , and potentially offer greater value to advertisers when the ad market rebounds .
A Focus On Social Media
Another aspect of NPR 's winning approach is their adoption of social media .
Social media tools are changing the media landscape by allowing consumers to define what 's worthy of attention .
NPR has n't sat idly by — they 're one of the few mainstream media organizations that is leading the charge in social media channels .
Their Twitter account has over 780,000 followers , making it one of the top 25 on the social network ( and third among news organizations behind only the New York Times and CNN ) .
Their Facebook Page has over 400,000 fans .
But NPR has embraced social media in more ways than just having an active presence on top social media channels .
They 've also put social media to work for them .
In October of 2008 , for example , NPR asked listeners to factcheck the US Vice Presidential debates and communicate findings via a Twitter hashtag .
And in February , NPR 's social media strategist ( @acarvin ) talked about Twitter on air , including hundreds people tweeting back comments in the conversation .
Their conclusion ?
Twitter lets us all share the media consumption experience together , and that 's a very positive thing .
NPR does n't stop at social networking , either — their social media efforts extend to podcasts ( they have over 650 ) , blogs ( they publish almost 20 ) , mobile apps , and even their own social network .
NPR has been recognized for these efforts year after year with multiple Webby Awards .
Social media is helping NPR reach new audiences and connect better with the one they have ( which , of course , helps with audience retention ) .
A Focus On Ubiquitous Access
Perhaps the most important aspect of NPR 's approach to new media , is that they have an organizational level commitment to allowing listeners and readers to access their content on their own terms .
Schiller , who prior to joining NPR at the start of this year was the SVP - GM of The New York Times web site , told mediabisto.com that NPR aims to bring people access to content " online , mobile , whatever people want , podcasts — you name it — so that you have that same sense of the NPR experience wherever you are .
As far as NPR.org — sure , I want the traffic to increase , but to me the ultimate goal is not just bringing people to this walled garden that is NPR.org . "
That 's nothing new for Schiller , who at the Times led the charge to shut down their pay content service , TimesSelect , even though it was pulling in tens of millions of dollars .
" Change is happening so fast in the media and the economy that you have to be able to say , ' Forget about what we did then — let 's look at what makes sense now , ' " she said , which is a very enlightened view for someone who holds a position of power in a mainstream media culture that has for so long been resistant to change .
The same sentiment is echoed by NPR's Senior SVP for News , Ellen Weiss .
" We need to put NPR wherever the audience is , and that has to happen online and has to happen on the radio , " she told PBS in January .
And NPR has delivered .
In July of 2008 , for example , the radio organization released a content API that allows developers to remix and reuse any content created by the network .
That 's led to interesting mash ups like NPRbackstory , which attempts to figure out the news behind trending topics by searching through NPR 's archives .
More recently , NPR released a mix your own podcast tool , which gives listeners the ability to easily create their own programming schedule from the organization 's audio archives .
That , as Schiller and Weiss promised , is NPR at work allowing users to consume media on their own terms .
NPR 's commitment to going to its audience rather than making its audience come to them is a smart strategic move .
Schiller is convinced that walled gardens and pay walls just drive audiences to " lesser quality news content that is free . "
If that 's true , NPR 's blueprint is not only about attracting eyeballs ( or in this case , ears ) , but creating an environment where quality reporting from trained journalists can continue to exist .
Not Everything Is Rosy
Unfortunately for NPR , even while their ratings soar , they have not been immune to the economic woes gripping most industries .
They cut 7 % of their daily news staff in December of 2008 and axed two underperforming shows .
NPR faces a projected budget gap of $ 8 million in 2009 , though that 's better than 2008 's $ 23 million shortfall .
Still , the future looks bright at NPR .
Their 26.4 million weekly listeners are 11 times more than the daily circulation of USA Today , and greater than 9 times more than the prime time viewership of the # 1 cable news channel in the US , Fox News .
They have 860 local stations in their member network and operate 38 news bureaus around the world — 18 in foreign markets , which is greater than any other news gathering organization .
NPR 's amazing growth over the past 10 years prompted FastCompany magazine in March to call NPR the " most successful hybrid of old and new media , " and wonder if NPR could be the savior of the news industry .
And they owe that success to the culture of open access and audience participation that they 've cultivated over the past decade .
So far we ’ve heard quite a bit of comparisons between the webOS platform and OSX ( for the iPhone ) , as well as Android vs. OSX .
But so far , comparisons between both Android and webOS have been nonexistent .
What makes this lack of coverage quite interesting is the fact that both operating systems are built off similar frameworks and use similar languages for programming .
So I think it ’s only fair that both systems get compared side to side and see who wins .
UI
Concerning UI , it ’s pretty clear that both Google and Palm have taken two very different approaches .
In fact Google ’s approach is more in line with Microsoft in allowing OEM ’s to customize the UI to their needs .
Palm however has taken this into their hands and pitched a ball straight at Apple and their ever so flawless OSX user interface .
Unfortunately there is no clear winner or loser here as both offer advantages and disadvantages .
One advantage of Android is that it can take on any shape it wants .
This allows people to pick a UI based on their needs but more so likes .
The disadvantage to this is that since the navigation can change drastically from device to device , it might be a little rough for those who are used to a specific layout and decide to change from let ’s say an HTC Hero to a Sony or Samsung .
On the other hand Palm has decided to use one UI for its entire fleet and since they will be the only ones manufacturing phones to run on webOS ( at least for the time being ) it will stay that way .
This however leaves the problem of monotony , something that is plaguing the iPhone at the moment .
It ’s very interesting that Windows Mobile can take on so many different shapes and forms based on who makes the device running it .
A classic example is the Samsung Omnia , Sony Xperia and HTC Touch Pro .
So I will hand it to Palm for having the sleeker and better of the graphical interface , but Android has the upper hand on customizability and scalability .
Features
Both Palm and Google have done a good job at bringing some well needed features to the smartphone arena .
Both support such basic features as copy paste , Exchange support , emailing , productivity and more .
But for now we ’ll have to judge at what ’s out there in terms of third party programs ( apps ) , and Google is clearly the winner here .
I ’m not saying that Palm is n’t saying anything , but seeing how new webOS is , we ’ll have to give it at least a year before we can really compare its developer community to that of Blackberry , OSX , WinMo and of course Android .
That said , built in features , webOS does have the upper hand as it has a much better browser , music player etc , then that on the Android OS .
But third party apps is its weak point and as I said before we ’ll have to wait a year or so before we see what people have done with the Mojo SDK .
Devices
It ’s ironic that Android has been around for quite some time now and the only company who has a phone running on the OS is HTC .
Yes we know Samsung , Motorola , Sony and a whole host of others are working behind the scenes but come on .
Palm has just put out their Pre and we ’re already hearing plans of the release of the EOS which would be the Centro replacer .
So who would win this round ?
Well clearly we ’re seeing such things as OLED and Flash coming to Android in the near future , and with the stellar lineup of partners it ’s not surprising that Apple is looking at Google as more of an enemy then a friend at the moment .
Concerning Palm , while they have not totally put off the idea about allowing third party manufacturers to run their webOS , they ’re still on their first device so we ca n’t fault them too much in this area .
But if both companies decide to keep on their course we will give this round to Android as more OEM ’s has always spelled better products .
Speaking of Flash , Palm is also on that list of manufacturers who will be getting a taste of Flash mobil this fall .
Hacking
Yes you read right , I ’m going to include this category because both Android and webOS run Linux on the Linux framework and so it ’s only fair we compare what the hacking community has done for the systems to date .
For an OS that is open source , we really have to chide Google on their lack of support in the hacking community .
The Pre has been out for just over a month and already we have Bluetooth tethering hacks , PlayStation emulation hacks , web server hacks and a bunch of others that not only geeks but every day people would be interested in .
So far little to nothing has been done in the Android arena concerning major hacking .
Maybe it has to do with the fact that the G1 ( the first Android device ) carries lower internal specs then that of the Pre .
But whatever it is , Palm clearly has the upper hand .
Things might change in the near future however as the devices which are making their way to Android are getting more powerful .
But for now , Palm owns this scene .
Corporate Support
This is a major factor in smartphones these days .
To date the dominators in this field have clearly been RIM and Microsoft .
So far Apple has been making small strides into gaining corporate acceptance .
That said , both Palm and Google have been courting IT departments to accept their OS as readily as they will accept a Blackberry Curve or HTC Touch Pro .
Right now it ’s too early to say what will happen to both OS as there is a huge lock in this area ( RIM and Microsoft ) and to date , companies have been very cautious about adopting ant other operating system .
As it stands Android and webOS are head to head with no apparent winner in sight .
But depending on customizability and sheer support , Android just might pull out as the winner here although we cannot deny that Palm has been in the cellphone ( and more so the smartphone ) market before Google was born so they just might just have a few tricks up their sleeves .
Potential
Until today I would have given this round to Android , but after Google ’s plans to scrape Android for netbooks , MID ’s and UMPC ’s I think it is a little harder to decide a winner .
Clearly both systems excel at different things , but then again both are competing for the same type of customers , those who are not swayed by Apple ’s iPhone but who want something different then the regular Blackberry Curve or HTC Touch Diamond .
Based on what webOS has to offer they have an advantage in online and location based apps and this is the future .
But in uniqueness and lifestyle applications , Android does carry a little more weight in this area .
However , it is too early to say .
We ’ll have to wait until both mature and of course the second version is released before we can make a final verdict on where we expect to see both of them in the next five or so years .

Cats : Four Legs and a Tail
or ( Neo Feline Enlightenment as a change from Post Canine dogma )
I 've decided that there is no point in just another site with cat pictures , no matter how cool .
One needs an encompasing vision to take one 's mediocre imagery to the level of proper Art .
So this site is no longer a set of images , rather an exploration of discovery into the psyche of some really wired felines ...
Of course , such a prestigious project requires appropriate Titleage .
It is best to purchase titles for such things from experts that think them up all day and understand what that stuff is all about .
One often finds that the same expert can also provide an enhanced retroactive rationalisation of what one has already done .
The relative cost of these services depend on the degree of scrutiny that they must withstand and the plausability that the basic premise could become Art through conventional processes .
I consider my money well spent .
In rolling ones own , one risks ridicule , caught on the barbed wit of any passing Art cognoscenti .
Of course , you can just ignore all that stuff , and just look at the photos , but realise that this is now so much * more * .
These are pictures of more or less random cats which I have seen wandering around .
They all gave their informed consent to be photographed .
In some cases an unsolicited nutritional enticement was provided to improve a subjects attitude .
The stars correspond to photo quality , rather than how cool the cat is .
My " How to take a half decent photo of a Cat " , tutorial - the product of my meagre experience , is here , if you want an educational experience .
Some Cat Links are HERE
Someone asked me if I had any pictures of dogs .
Unfortunately , only a few here .
Cats are totally different animals to dogs .
Cats are sufficiently stupid to be able to mostly ignore people , whereas dogs are totally reliant on people - how many times do you have to go and fetch a stick before you fail to see the point ?
Here is a picture of a dog wishing he was a cat , probably .
These pictures free for non commercial private perusal .

Playing a notorious Austrian serial killer has not been an easy task even for John Malkovich , who is used to unconventional roles .
Sometimes , he says , he has “ had to kind of choke myself to go on . ”
Interesting choice of words for an actor playing a man convicted in 1994 of strangling nine prostitutes .
The production is the baroque opera and theater collaboration “ The Infernal Comedy : Confessions of a Serial Killer , ” about journalist Jack Unterweger , who was championed by Austrian intellectuals .
Stirring up unsettling questions about the Austrian character , the production completed a successful run in Unterweger ’s hometown after a brief tryout , titled “ Seduction and Despair , ” in Santa Monica last year .
It has begun touring venues across Europe .
“ There was plenty of material out there and it ’s easily the stuff of opera , so it made a smooth transition to the stage , ” Malkovich says in an interview between rehearsals at the Ronacher Theater , which is a stone ’s throw from the Gurtel , where most of the city ’s sex workers are concentrated and where Unterweger picked up several of his victims .
Advertisement
Dressed in the cream suit and polka - dot shirt that were part of Unterweger ’s trademark playboy look , Malkovich strokes the throat of soprano Aleksandra Zamojska and intones in a gravelly , Austrian - accented drawl : “ And there is a murdered hooker lying naked , face in the mud , somewhere in the Vienna woods , strangled with her own bra . ”
His monologue is punctuated with arias by , among others , Weber , Haydn and Beethoven , which give voice to the tortured women .
But all in all it is chilling fare , and it was met with a mixed response by Austrian critics and commentators , some of whom have accused the production of glamorizing the man the city ’s coffeehouse intellectuals once took to their bosom .
“ Jack Unterweger was the darling of Viennese society and appears to be so still today , ” critic Thomas Jorda wrote in the newspaper Niederoesterreichische Nachrichten .
“ When he is represented by Mr. Malkovich on stage as he strangles prostitutes with their bras , he can continue to be sure of being able to count on this society ’s applause . ”
Indeed , the Vienna audience “ consisted of a number of Unterweger admirers -- people , mainly women , who still believe in his innocence , ” said the artistic director , Martin Haselboeck , who also heads the Musica Angelica baroque orchestra in Los Angeles .

Unterweger , who was locked up in 1976 for murdering a woman , learned to read and write in jail .
He was crowned “ prison poet ” by intellectuals such as Nobel laureate and Austrian writer Elfriede Jelinek when his book “ Purgatory ” ( a purported autobiography that turned out to be fictional ) was published .
He was granted a presidential pardon in 1990 by Kurt Waldheim ( whose own career was overshadowed by the revelations that he served as an intelligence officer in the Wehrmacht , a German unit that committed atrocities in World War II ) , whereupon he began killing prostitutes in Vienna , Prague and Los Angeles .
At the same time , he worked as a journalist for the Austrian state broadcaster and for print news media , which enabled him to report in detail on his own macabre crimes .
Unterweger , who hanged himself the night of his conviction , was the most notorious criminal in modern Austria -- until he was usurped by Wolfgang Priklopil , the computer technician who kidnapped a 10 - year - old and held her captive for eight years , committing suicide on her escape in 2006 .
Those grisly episodes , together with the nation ’s decades - long suppression of its overwhelming support for Adolf Hitler when Austria was incorporated into the Third Reich , raise the question of whether there is something particularly Austrian in the way the country appears to suppress rather than confront the truth .
“ Suppression is central to our national character , ” says Michael Sturminger , the scriptwriter of “ The Infernal Comedy . ”
“ Think of the Third Reich : Of course people should have known what was happening , but there were people who said they did n’t know and people who did n’t want to know . ”

But Malkovich is cautious about drawing conclusions .
“ This story is in itself so Austrian and Viennese , ” he says .
“ The more you suppress things , the more likely you are to turn into a sociopath .
“ But I believe that Austria would have to do quite a lot to catch up with the Belgians .
And we Americans do n’t do too badly in this regard . ”
What fascinates him more is the ability of serial killers to seduce .

“ I once met a baroness who owned land in what used to be Prussia , where [ Hitler ’s No. 2 Hermann ]
Goering went hunting every season , ” Malkovich says , twisting a sugar sachet between his fingers .
“ I said : ‘ How was he ? ’
She said : ‘ Oh , he was so utterly charming , a lovely man . ’
“ Well of course they are , ” he says .
“ How do you think they get where they get to ? ”

昨年、ある心理学者が、スコットランドの首都エジンバラの街中で、240個の財布を落としてテストしました。すべての財布には、持ち主が割と良い人が多く住んでいそうな地域の住人だと分かるものを入れました。加えて、それぞれの財布には以下のものを入れました。
1）笑っている赤ちゃんの写真 2）可愛い子犬の写真 3）幸せそうな家族写真 4）素敵な老夫婦の写真 5）特に何も無し 6）慈善団体への寄付証明
落とした1〜6の財布の数は同数です。さて、結果はどうなったと思います？
タイトルで大体想像はついていると思いますが、財布のリターン率は以下の通りです。
1位 笑っている赤ちゃんの写真 リターン率 ： 88 ％ 2 位 可愛い子犬の写真 リターン率 ：53 ％ 3 位 幸せそうな家族写真 リターン率 ： 48 ％ 4 位 素敵な老夫婦の写真 リターン率 ： 28 ％ 5 位 慈善団体への寄付証明 リターン率 ： 20 ％ 6 位 特に何も無し リターン率 ：15 ％
赤ちゃんの写真というのは、人情に訴えかける何かがあるんでしょうね。驚異のリターン率です。実験をした心理学者は、｢"
赤ちゃん＝弱い者"を守らなければ、という人間の潜在意識が働いた結果ではないか｣と言っています。
また、落とした財布全体のリターン率は42％で、この数字も過去の実験から予想したリターン率より、かなり高かったそうです。
ここまできちんと立証されているのですから、よく財布を落としたり忘れたりする人は、やらない手は無いですよ。独身・子無しの人だって、適当に検索して、自分好みの可愛い赤ちゃんの写真を入れておけばいいんです。
むしろ、子どもがいる人の方が写真選びに困ったりして。自分の子どもが赤ちゃんじゃなくて大学生とか、自分の子どもだけど親から見ても微妙...という場合は写真選びが悩ましいです。自分の子どもじゃない写真を入れる場合は、財布を落とす事よりも、知ってる人に写真を見られた時のリスクを予想して、慎重に写真を選んでくださいね。

TANK REQUIREMENTS IN LIBYAN FIGHTING
Crews of the American made medium tanks , now designated as " General Grants " are asking for as much 75 mm ammunition as it is possible to carry .
Seeking a total operational capacity of from 80 to 90 rounds , they are prepared to forego 37 mm and Browning ammunition and also to remove the front hull guns and mounting .
A plan has been worked out by the Middle East Engineers which will permit the following ammunition load :
75 mm 81 rounds 37 mm 80 rounds .303 in 5000 rounds .450 in 700 rounds
Military Engineering has been cabled for stowage diagrams and details of the scheme referred to .
The British are considering the development of command tanks .
These would be standard tanks suitably modified to carry two radio sets , the armament being replaced by dummy equipment .
Vehicles of this nature are being considered for use as observation posts , for Royal Horse Artillery ( completely motorized ) and field artillery units in Armoured Divisions .
( G- 2 COMMENT : The Germans have command tanks .
The British feel the need of them , not only as command tanks but also as O.Ps for artillery supporting tank units .
The basic principle for artillery O.Ps is that the O.P. should be in the same type of vehicle used by the supported unit .
Therefore an armored car is more suitable for artillery supporting an Infantry Division .
The American Scout Car has been used with success . )
No decision has yet been taken on the requirements for command tanks .
A description of the " British Crusader " tank modifications is promised in the next technical report and drawings are being sent separately by air mail .
It is stated that the " General Grant " has not yet been investigated in this regard .
Removal of the auxiliary turret on the " Crusader " tank has been approved and this is being accomplished .
The opening in the hull is being blanked off and the space used for stowage .
The frequency of failure of the 8,500 pound springs in the suspension of the American medium tank ( General Grant ) is becoming very high .
Various theories have been put forth to account for this , but none is entirely satisfactory .
The main reason appears to be that the springs are not suited to the demands made upon them .
Three cases of failure of the big end bearing of the master connecting rod have occurred .
No explanation can be found for the fractures .
It is interesting to note , however , that a case of sudden fall in oil pressure occurred in an engine while on the test bed .
Investigation showed an air lock in the oil suction line and it was necessary to prime the line before the pump would deliver any oil .
Users should be warned that the system must be most carefully checked for leaks and that the failure to get oil pressure on starting is probably due to an air lock in the suction line .
A weakness in design which has been brought out as a result of the investigation into fires is the considerable area which present designs of fuel tanks offer to hostile fire .
In future designs consideration should be given to keeping fuel tanks as low and unexposed as possible .
( G- 2 COMMENT : The proper protection of ammunition should also be considered . )
The P.8 compasses have proved to be quite indispensable to tanks , but they are not yet sufficiently accurate to allow them to be used as a sole method of navigation .
Apart from leakage of fluid and breakages of the glass of the grid ring , no defects have occurred in the same compass equipment .
It is suggested that the supply of a metal cover to fit over the compass would save damage .
P.8 compasses are now being issued with a brass cover which meets the point raised .
The engine oil tank on Crusaders is in two parts , interconnected by a small pipe .
It has been reported by units that it takes a driver up to one hour to fill it with oil , and that the flow between the tanks is so slow that an impatient man is apt to assume that both tanks are full when only the one into which the filler passes is really full .
A modification is being introduced by which an additional connecting pipe 2 " diameter will be run between the tops of the tanks .
( G- 2 COMMENT :
The oil system is also a source of much difficulty . )
During the recent fighting there were two cases of British Valentine tank drivers being killed and collapsing over the gear lever .
The remainder of the crew were unable to remove the driver to get at the gear lever on the clutch and were unable to stop the vehicle .
A similar incident occurred in a British Matilda tank during General Wavell 's advance , although in this case it should have been possible to disengage the clutches with the hand wheels provided .
It is considered that all Armoured Force vehicles should be fitted with a means for stopping the engine from the fighting chamber .
A " dead man 's switch " is fitted to most gasoline driven tanks .
The question of providing the British Covenanter and the American tanks with this switch is being considered .

There has been enormous concern about the consequences of human population growth for the environment and for social and economic development .
But this growth is likely to come to an end in the foreseeable future .
Improving on earlier methods of probabilistic forecasting1 , here we show that there is around an 85 per cent chance that the world 's population will stop growing before the end of the century .
There is a 60 per cent probability that the world 's population will not exceed 10 billion people before 2100 , and around a 15 per cent probability that the world 's population at the end of the century will be lower than it is today .
For different regions , the date and size of the peak population will vary considerably .

Fail and You Last week , users of Google App Engine - Google 's application hosting platform - discovered a new feature in the product : downtime .
App Engine was offline for roughly six hours , and for much of that time , even the status page which tells users about downtime was unavailable .
Now that 's a strong way to send a message .
As a reminder : Google App Engine is Google 's response to Amazon Web Services .
Amazon has set up a scheme where customers can have full access to virtual computers and can also pay for scalability - included services like S3 for storage and a messaging system .
It 's a fair balance between automatic scaling and control .
Google , on the other hand , offers developers a Python and Java API to its database back - end and absolutely zero control over the machines on which your application is running .
App Engine developers must go through the effort to contort their program to Google 's data storage mechanism , which in some cases can be a far cry from SQL .
The benefit to this is that you do n't have to worry about scalability , ever .
Allegedly .
It 's sort of like how a heroin addiction means that you do n't have to worry about reality , ever .
As with anything that flies through a cloud , Google App Engine can suffer a double flame - out and crash to the ground , killing hundreds and swearing a large subset of the population off of air travel for quite some time .
Google has paying customers for App Engine , and maybe Wonka does n't quite understand this , but when people pay you for a service , they expect a certain amount of transparency and honesty .
Watching Google 's response to the App Engine downtime reminded me of the cruel 2008 US Vice Presidential debates , where everyone watching just wanted to pull Sarah Palin aside and say " Sweetie , this is a grown - up event .
You need to use your big - girl words now . "
Google 's explanation for six hours of downtime was basically , " Shit got ill . "
The meat of Google 's postmortem on the failure was this , a message posted to the App Engine e-mail group : " There was a serious issue in one of App Engine 's datacenters with GFS , Google 's low level storage system .
GFS underlies Bigtable , which in turn underlies App Engine 's Datastore .
GFS also provides storage for our application serving infrastructure , so GFS unavailability caused problems for Datastore reads and writes , as well as application serving . "
Let 's say that you were tasked with maintaining the computing platform for your company 's web services .
After six hours of service outage , your supervisor asked you for an explanation of what happened , and you follow Google 's lead .
You say , " There was a serious issue with one or more of our computers . "
Ass , meet curb .
Almost a year ago , Amazon 's S3 storage service suffered roughly eight hours of downtime .
Amazon 's postmortem on the failure included details about specific bugs in their message passing system , and how their wonderfully scalable system could also scale errors quite wonderfully .
Amazon identified an oversight in their own code with respect to error checking , so as a customer , you could be sure that somebody is on that shit .
Google , on the other hand , does n't feel like telling anyone exactly why GFS failed .
Was it a bug in the code ?
Was it a traffic issue ?
Did Augustus Gloop fall into the chocolate river ?
As far as preventing future such failures , Google is equally as tight - lipped .
Their postmortem only says this : " The team has been actively working on a solution in the medium - term that would allow us to switchover data centers immediately without consistency problems . "
Um , fantastic .
When will that be deployed ?
Why specifically could you not fail over in this case ?
Do you realize that you 're being paid for this ?
By comparison , Amazon outlined four changes they made to their system , in both code and monitoring , to prevent that type of failure from happening again .
One could argue over the necessity of up - time for the types of apps that appear on App Engine .
After all , the world only needs so many RSS readers and Twitter clones .
But this highlights the greater risk of hosting your applications in the - and oh it pains me to say this , but for the sake of brevity - cloud .
Every time there is downtime like this , be it Google App Engine or Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure , tech pundits all tell us that it 's not ready for prime time .
What the fuck does that even mean ?
My guess : " My editor wanted me to cover this story and I lack the originality to make any meaningful contribution . "
I 'll go out on a limb here .
Hosting production services on platforms like App Engine is never a good idea .
It may be fine for some toy application or a web service that you never plan to make any money from , but when your livelihood depends on it , will you really trust the business to a company whose failure response is the technical version of " whoooa , sorry bro , my bad ? "
Clearly , you can draw a line when it comes to outsourcing .
But for serious business , if you can't put your hands on the metal - or order someone else to put their hands on the metal - then you 're due for an embarrassment .
And it 's nobody 's fault but your own .
Google 's sell really appeals to the engineers , but I hope that the decision makers can see through the bullshit .
Automatic scalability ?
Really ?
Or did you guys drop too much capital expenditure on machines and have to come up with a way to make a return on that investment ?
Maybe it 's less of a tell than I think it is , but the App Engine main product page has a prominent link to the terms of service at the top , and no link or contact information for support .
Google 's introverted population certainly knows that it 's easier and cheaper to legalese your way out of a customer 's problem than it is to hire a person to pick up the phone .
Man , supporting real people is way harder than selling ads . ®

( CNN ) --
When pro quarterback Michael Vick pleaded guilty to bankrolling a dogfighting operation in 2007 , there was a spike in reports of dogfighting in the United States .
One of six dogs recovered from a Sumter County , South Carolina , dogfight waits in a kennel last week .
But when the headlines faded , the blood sport grew stronger and went even more underground , with thugs taking inventive precautions to keep police at bay , animal cruelty experts say .
" They know it 's just not smart to have large crowds anymore , so we 've seen fights where you 've got the two handlers , a referee and Web cams everywhere broadcasting the fight on the Internet , " said Mark Kumpf , an investigator based in Ohio who directs the National Animal Control Association .
Fights are also being staged on the move -- in 18 - wheelers .
" These guys are very sophisticated , " Kumpf said .
" If you 're driving down the road , there could be dogs in that truck driving next to you that are dying . "
Dozens more dogfighting cases have been investigated and prosecuted since the Vick case , said Alison Gianotto , who runs the database PetAbuse.com .
The computer programmer , horrified when a neighbor 's cat was set on fire eight years ago , created the California - based organization to track animal cruelty cases and animal abusers .
The database , which logs media stories , has also become a popular place for law enforcement to send reports .
" There 's not a central body keeping track of what 's happening nationally , which is unfortunate when you consider that a lot of these cases cross state lines , " she said .
Still , detectives , animal welfare professionals and prosecutors agree that the attention the Vick case has brought to dogfighting has been positive because more people are inclined to report their suspicions .
Dogfighting is illegal in all states ; penalties vary but usually include heavy jail time or steep fines .
The National Football League suspended Vick indefinitely in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia .
Vick , 29 , was freed from federal prison in Leavenworth , Kansas , on May 20 and returned to Virginia to serve the last two months of his 23 - month sentence in home confinement .
" At the height of attention on the Vick case , things quieted down across the country with some of these dogfighters getting out of the business , " veteran animal abuse investigator Tim Rickey said .
" But then , the headlines went away , and people thought the attention was off .
It just started right back up , almost stronger than before . "
" Every Saturday night in every county in Missouri , there is a dogfight going on , " Rickey said .
While the Vick case was making its way through the court system , Rickey , who directs the animal cruelty task force at the Humane Society of Missouri , was initiating what would become an 18 - month investigation linking dogfighting rings in eight states .
That probe led to the July 8 arrest of 28 people from eight states .
As many as 400 dogs were confiscated in raids coordinated by federal , state and local law enforcement agencies , Rickey said .
He said it was the largest such case involving dogfighting in the U.S .
While those involved with the national case declined Monday to give details about that investigation , CNN spoke with several detectives across America who have worked other dogfighting cases .
Among the abuses they 've uncovered :
• Dogs with missing ears and patches of skin
• Animals with teeth shaved down to the bone
• " Vets " who have used leg splints that are to tight to " treat " animals in dogfighting rings
• Contraptions , usually fashioned out of wood , much like a treadmill , that force chained dogs to run or be choked .
Detective Keith Coberly of the police vice squad in Dayton , Ohio , described a case he recently investigated that resulted in the convictions of three men .
A neighbor called police when she saw a mangled dog that had apparently escaped from a home where investigators found 60 chained pit bull terriers , many being starved and wallowing in their own waste .
There were thousands of hypodermic needles scattered across the ground .
" They were using steroids on the animals , " he said .
" There was one dog -- in such bad shape , man -- tethered to a logging chain , and another was kept in a two - foot shed without ventilation or food . "
The suffering is incalculable , and the cost of caring for the animals is steep .
Because the national investigation originated in Missouri , the state is harboring about 400 of the rescued dogs , some that have had puppies recently .
" These dogs are bred to attack each other , so just caring for them is a tremendous job .
You have to keep them separate , and you have to protect volunteers who are devoting 12 , 14 hours of their day , " Rickey said .
" And we 're doing all of that in this economy . "
Investigating dogfighting is dangerous -- and hugely popular in Russian mafia circles and with drug traffickers in Mexico , experts say .
Dogfighting is reliant on word of mouth , and on what one undercover officer described as " bad character " references .
" If you can get someone to vouch for you , a match is set up , " Kumpf said .
" They 'll have everyone go to a hotel and come pick you up and drive you around in an unmarked van . "
Driving around town helps shake any police tail , he said .
Those betting on fights are n't likely to get paid on site any more .
Money is often kept at another location , making it more difficult to make arrests .
In late July , NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell conditionally reinstated Vick , who said on " 60 Minutes " on Sunday night that he cried in prison because of the guilt he felt about dogfighting .
Vick 's agent announced Thursday that the former Atlanta Falcon signed a two - year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles , which reportedly could be worth more than $ 6 million .
" I hope people realize [ dogfighting ] is not just about Michael Vick , " Rickey said .
" It 's a lot bigger than him . "

Matt Taibbi’s 12 - page screed on Goldman Sachs has appeared on newsstands ; Zero Hedge has scans , but I ca n’t link to the piece itself because Rolling Stone hates the internet .
Suffice to say that in the second sentence of the piece Taibbi describes Goldman as “ a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity ” ; later on , he calls it “ the planet - eating Death Star of political influence ” .
He ’s also a dab hand at the pen-portrait :
Rubin was the prototypical Goldman banker .
He was probably born in a $ 4,000 suit , he had a face that seemed permanently frozen just short of an apology for being so much smarter than you , and he exuded a Spock - like , emotion - neutral exterior ; the only human feeling you could imagine him experiencing was a nighmare about being forced to fly coach .
Taibbi makes the case that it ’s not just wheat futures which have been overrun by index speculation , but commodities in general and oil in particular .
Indeed , Taibbi puts Goldman , Zelig - like , at the center of no fewer than four speculative bubbles : one in the 1920s in which Goldman - controlled entities ended up losing an astonishing $ 475 billion in today ’s dollars ; the tech bubble ; the housing bubble ; and the oil - price bubble ending in 2008 .
He calls the US “ a gangster state , running on gangster economics ” , and is very explicit about exactly who he thinks the gangsters are .
( Clue : they paid just $ 14 million in tax on $ 2 billion in 2008 profits . )
I do n’t agree with all of Taibbi ’s article , but I ’m surprised at how much of it I do agree with , especially when it comes to the subject of regulatory capture .
Taibbi spends no little time looking at Goldman subsidiary J Aron , and the semi-secret letter it was issued by the CFTC in 1991 , the existence of which was n’t even known to Brooksley Born , who was then the chair .
The letter allowed Goldman to ramp up its activities in Chicago by orders of magnitude .
When Congress asked to see the letter , the CFTC was careful to ask Goldman first if that would be OK .
I can’t , off the top of my head , think of a single government regulation over the past couple of decades which has remotely harmed Goldman Sachs ; by contrast , there are many which have done it a world of good .
The chances that the Fed , or any other systemic risk regulator , will be able to rein in this powerful organization are probably slim .
The best we can hope for , I think , is that Goldman will unilaterally decide to be a force for good in the world , rather than an inflator of bubbles and profiteer in busts .
CHRISTIAN churches are getting ready to launch Australia 's biggest cross-denominational media campaign , featuring the ultimate pin-up boy : Jesus Christ .
Bible Society chief executive Daniel Willis said a seven - week campaign in NSW would be a non-traditional approach for Christian churches , which he said had never used the media well .

'' Research showed us that people were not really happy about the church , '' he said .
'' When we started this research in 2003 , all the problems that were associated with the church were being raised , and there was a lot of bad press .
The church was anathema but Jesus was fine . ''
The $ 1.5 million '' Jesus .
All About Life '' campaign will kick off with a viral internet component next month , before moving on to prime - time TV and billboard advertising running until the end of October .
Although privately funded , it has the support of a range of denominations , including the Catholic Church , NSW Christian Brethren and Hillsong .
International fingerpointing in the recent cyber attacks against U.S. and South Korean websites has widened to include Great Britain , as researchers examining the attacks trace them to a server in the United Kingdom .
But the British company that owns the server says it , in turn , traced the attacks to a VPN connection originating in Miami , Florida .
With hawks in Congress and the press urging President Barack Obama to launch an all - out cyber war in retaliation for the website outages , things are looking bad for the Sunshine State .
Though it should be noted that the Miami connection was likely just another proxy used by the hacker , who could be based in the U.S. or anywhere else .
Researchers at Bkis Security in Hanoi , who reported findings about the British server on their company 's blog , say that the denial - of - service attacks that struck more than three dozen government and commercial sites last week were launched from more than 166,000 computers in 74 countries controlled by a server in the UK .
The IP range for the server is 195.90.118.xxx , which is registered to Global Digital Broadcast , which streams digital TV content from Latin America to consumers .
A company representative was unavailable for comment .
But in a July 14 press release , the company indicated that it had traced the attacks to a VPN connection from Miami controlled by Digital Latin America , a Buenos Aires - based company with a facility in Florida that provides technical services to providers of digital content .
According to the post , the Digital Latin America connection was set up as " an exploit finder , " presumably used by the botnet herder to rustle up vulnerable computers to use in the attack .
A spokeswoman for Digital Latin America confirmed that Global Digital Broadcast contacted the company Tuesday morning about the role its network may have played in the attacks .
Amaya Ariztoy , general counsel for Digital Latin America , said that the server allegedly used for the attack provides streaming services to a third company that provides digital content , which in turn transferred the signal to Global Digital Broadcast in the UK .
" We 're investigating and cooperating with authorities , " Ariztoy said , while noting that the company had not yet been contacted by any authorities investigating the issue .
Bkis , which is a member of Vietnam 's Computer Emergency Response Team , was asked to investigate the attacks by South Korea 's Computer Emergency Response Team .
They found that zombie computers used in the cyber attacks were located around the world , primarily in South Korea , the United States , China and Japan , and were part of eight different botnets .
U.S. researchers had previously estimated that systems used in the attack numbered around 60,000 .
The Bkis researchers found that every three minutes the infected computers randomly contacted one of eight servers to receive instructions .
After gaining control of two of the botnet command and control servers , the researchers examined their logs and discovered that they were in turn contacting the master server in the UK , which was running a Microsoft Windows operating system .

For now , we are still stuck waiting for Sony to officially confirmed it next week during GameCom .
It ’s the moment we ’ve all been waiting for .
The PS3 Slim seems to have become official .
We ’ve been talking about this since before E3 , and it may have finally come to light .
According to an upcoming Best Buy ad flyer , the “ PS3 Slim is in ” .
Not only is the slimmed down console going to be available sooner rather than later .
But it ’s going to have a drastically lower price point of $ 299.99 .
Sony is sure to move a major amount of PS3 ’s at that price point .
Official confirmation from Sony is expected at GameCom in Cologne Germany .

Dave Grohl has seen plenty in his days as a drummer for Nirvana and the frontman of the Foo Fighters .
Warren , Ohio paid tribute to Grohl by renaming Market Street Alley .
The new name is David Grohl Alley .
Grohl was born in Warren in 1969 at Trumbull Memorial Hospital , which was in perfect view from the Trumbull County Courthouse lawn , the setting for Saturday ’s festivities .
My path to meet Grohl was awkward and lucky at the same time .
I was in a small shed - like building interviewing one of the event coordinators , Jennifer Campbell of an organization called Main Street Warren .
Luckily for me it was too loud to capture her answers as bands were playing in a closed - off area .
Campbell led me into the building where we sat and discussed how Main Street Warren could pull off such a fete .
As I neared the end of a ten minute interview , the door opened and in came Grohl with his father , Jim , and his stepmother Renie Grohl .
Jim and Renie are still residents of the area .
Jim seemed unphased by the gathering of people and Renie was more concerned that her friends and family had refreshments .
Before anyone else got in , I was able to snap many good photos and catch a few quotes .
If shaking hands with an icon like Grohl does n’t put chills up your spine , nothing will – you may not have a spine .
Dave was cordial with everyone who approached him .
A group of the organizers children swarmed for autographs and Grohl responded by signing every single item handed to him .
He posed with young and old .
The thing that impressed me most about this guy was how much of a normal person he ended up coming across as .
He talked with the young fans about getting his start playing in clubs and not losing sight of his dreams .
The direct dialogue I had with Grohl was brief .
I shook his hand before I had to exit the building and thanked him for being as cool as it gets .
“ No , thank you for being here to cover something that means so much to me ” , Grohl replied .
“ When I was a kid , I used to love to come here ” , Grohl said about the big park atmosphere , “ This is one of my favorite places in the world . ”
About an hour later , Grohl came out to a nice response and played with a local band Love Turns Hate .
He sat at a second drum kit , and jammed with a band whose song he never heard before .
He then collaborated with the band to cover a Led Zeppelin classic , Rock & Roll .
He can still smack the skins pretty well .
A formal presentation followed with Grohl getting a key to the city and thanking many people .
“ This means a lot to me .
I ’m very , very proud to have this , and you guys ” , Grohl remarked .
Grohl also talked about his roots to the Mahoning Valley and how his grandfather worked at Republic Steel .
Dave Grohl then showed everyone why he desrved something like this ‘ In His Honor ’ .
The acoustic guitar popped out and Grohl played a solo acoustic set comprised of “ Times Like These ” , “ My Hero ” , and “ Everlong ” .
He sounded great and had the crowd eating out of the palm of his hand .
Grohl ’s appearance in Warren was in question up until the eleventh hour .
He gets back every now and then to visit family , but has a ‘ rockstar ’ agenda .
The event would have went off with or without Grohl , although it would not have been nearly as special without him .
The Trumbull Art Gallery artists made the alley sharp .
To see all of the images and paintings everywhere was truly special .
Main Street Warren spokesperson Jennifer Campbell said the artwork in the alley will continue to evolve and update with Grohl ’s career .
It is pretty laid out and a must - see for any Nirvana or Foo Fighter fan .
Special thanks to Jenn for allowing me such private access to an icon in a music industry in need of people like Dave Grohl .

Glenn Beck has been popping up on FNC outside of his own program , including last night ’s O’Reilly Factor to claim that he never mentioned the conspiracy theory of FEMA concentration camps , the problem for Beck is that in March he did
mention that he could n’t debunk the FEMA concentration camps theory .
Here is Beck on The O’Reilly Factor with his denial :
Advertisements
Beck said of the FEMA concentration camps , “ I never said that .
Never said that , you know the reason why I did that concentration camp , or that FEMA story is because I snapped on the air one day .
Somebody called me on the radio , and I said can we stop with the FEMA camps , can we stop with the FEMA camps .
I want one way or another , I want it yes or no , so I went to my staff and I said I want proof that these do n’t exist please .
Maybe about a week later they said well we do n’t really have proof . ”
Beck said they found the so called prison , but it was an abandoned train station .
Here is the debunking video that Beck is referring to :
The problem for Beck is that the month before on Fox and Friends , Beck mentioned that he investigated the FEMA concentration camps , but could n’t find evidence that he did n’t exist :
Fox News is at war with Paul Krugman because of a June 12 column in the New York Times where he mentions Beck and the FEMA camps .
Krugman said , “ Exhibit A for the mainstreaming of right - wing extremism is Fox News ’s new star , Glenn Beck .
Here we have a network where , like it or not , millions of Americans get their news — and it gives daily airtime to a commentator who , among other things , warned viewers that the Federal Emergency Management Agency might be building concentration camps as part of the Obama administration ’s “ totalitarian ” agenda ( although he eventually conceded that nothing of the kind was happening ) . ”
Krugman was correct in his description of Beck ’s position .
If you do n’t believe me , watch the above videos .
Beck put something out there in his Fox and Friends appearance that the conspiracy theorists ran with .
That clip of Beck is on every major far right website .
Beck and O’Reilly conveniently leave out the fact that Krugman acknowledged that Beck no longer held that position .
The problem for Beck is that he did talk about the possibility of FEMA concentration camps in March .
I think Beck should have waited until the April report aired on his show before he made a statement that served as fuel for the conspiracy theorists , but for him to maintain that he never said , just is n’t true .
He said it and Krugman reminded everyone about it .

In one of the few countries where prostitution is legal , and unusually transparent , the industry has responded with an economic stimulus package of its own : modern marketing tools , rebates and gimmicks to boost falling demand .
Some brothels have cut prices or added free promotions while others have introduced all - inclusive flat - rate fees .
Free shuttle buses , discounts for seniors and taxi drivers , as well as “ day passes ” are among marketing strategies designed to keep business going .
“ Times are tough for us too , ” said Karin Ahrens , who manages the “ Yes , Sir ” brothel in Hanover .
She told Reuters revenue had dropped by 30 percent at her establishment while turnover had fallen by as much as 50 percent at other clubs .
“ We ’re definitely feeling the crisis .
Clients are being tight with their money .
They ’re afraid .
You ca n’t charge for the extras any more and there is pressure to cut prices .
Everyone wants a deal .
Special promotions are essential these days . ”
Germany has about 400,000 professional prostitutes .
Official figures do not distinguish between the sexes and the number of male prostitutes is not known , but they account for a small fraction of the total and are treated the same under the law .
In 2002 , new legislation allowed prostitutes to advertise and to enter into formal labor contracts .
It opened the way for them to obtain health insurance , previously refused if they listed their true profession .
Annual revenues are about 14 billion euros ( $ 18 billion ) , according to an estimate by the Verdi services union .
Taxes on prostitution are an important source of income for some cities .
Prostitution is also legal and regulated in the Netherlands , Austria , Switzerland , Hungary , Greece , Turkey and in some parts of Australia , and the U.S. state of Nevada .
In other countries , such as Luxembourg , Latvia , Denmark , Belgium and Finland , it is legal but brothels and pimping are not .
“ CREATIVE SOLUTIONS ”

Berlin ’s “ Pussy Club ” has attracted media attention with its headline - grabbing “ flat rate ” -- a 70 - euro admission charge for unlimited food , drink and sex between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m .
“ You ’ve got to come up with creative solutions these days , ” said club manager Stefan , who requested his surname not be published .
“ We ’re feeling the economic crisis , too , even though business has fortunately been more or less okay for us so far .
“ Our offer might sound like it ’s too good to be true , but it ’s real .
You can eat as much as you want , drink as much as you want and have as much sex as you want . ”
Stefan , who runs other establishments in Heidelberg and Wuppertal besides the Berlin club , said the flat rate had helped keep the 30 women working in each location fully employed .
Other novel ideas used by brothels and prostitutes include loyalty cards , group sex parties and rebates for golf players .
Hamburg ’s “ GeizHaus ” is especially proud of its discount 38.50 euro price .
The city has Germany ’s most famous red- light district , the Reeperbahn , in the notorious St. Pauli district .
Anke Christiansen , manager of the “ GeizHaus , ” said the effects of the economic crisis were clear .
“ The regular customers who used to come by two or three times a week are only coming by once or twice a week now . ”
A “ GeizHaus ” client , who gave his name as Pascal , said : “ Naturally we ’re all feeling the effects of the crisis . ”
He added that he could no longer afford his usual two or three visits a week .
Guenter Krull , manager of the “ FKK Villa ” in Hanover , concurred .
“ The girls are complaining , too , because business is bad and I worry that it ’s all going to get even worse .
CONTINGENCY PLANS
Ecki Krumeich , manager of upmarket Artemis Club in Berlin , said he resisted pressure to cut prices , although senior citizens and taxi drivers get a 50 - percent discount on the 80 - euro admission fee on Sundays and Mondays .
“ Naturally , we ’re keeping an eye on the overall economic situation and making contingency plans , ” said Krumeich , who said his “ wellness club ” is one of the largest in Europe with about 70 prostitutes .
“ Our philosophy is : we provide an important service and even in a recession there are some things people wo n’t do without .
Other downmarket places might cut prices but we decided we wo n’t do that .
In fact , we raised prices by 10 euros in January . ”
Stephanie Klee , a prostitute in Berlin and former leader of the German association of sex workers , said even if a few luxury brothels were weathering the storm because of their wealthy regular clientele , many were struggling .
“ Just about everyone ’s turning to advertising in one form or another , ” she said .
“ If the consumer electronics shop and the optician come out with rebates and special promotions , why should n’t we try the same thing ? ”
While she and her colleagues might have had five or six clients per day a year ago that had fallen to one or even none .
Klee worries , however , that the crisis has led to “ price dumping ” in some cities -- fees have fallen as low as 30 euros in some parts of Berlin and elsewhere , she said .
“ You ’ll find a lot of customers trying to negotiate prices down now , ” said Klee .
“ A 30 - year - old came up to me and said ‘ I lost my job so will you give me a discount ? ’. ”
She and others said they were alarmed that amateur prostitutes -- mostly women with low - paid careers -- were increasingly turning to prostitution to make ends meet .
“ More and more women are moonlighting on the weekends , ” said Ahrens .
“ They ’re not able to get by with their main job and are in pretty dire straights .
For some it works out okay but it ’s tough for some others and they often do n’t stay very long .
A MILITARY museum was astonished to be told its logo was too ‘ offensive ’ or ‘ embarrassing ’ to go on letters because it depicts a British Soldier holding a weapon .
The Royal Signals Museum at Blandford had been told it could n’t use its logo on its franking machine .
But the Royal Mail has now reversed that decision after they were contacted by the Echo .
The image is a silhouette taken from a photograph showing an armed Royal Signals soldier in Iraq protecting a communications satellite , and has been used by the museum for a number of years .
But its request to use it on its franked mail stamps was refused as , according to the museum , it was judged to be either ‘ offensive ’ to Royal Mail employees or ‘ embarrassing ’ for them to deliver .
Royal Mail has now apologised for the “ mix up ” .
Brigadier Cedric Burton , chairman of the Royal Signals Museum , described the original judgement as “ perverse ” .
He added : “ At this time when the sacrifice of British Soldiers is highlighted daily in the press , it seems outrageous for the Royal Mail , another public body , to imply that the museum ’s logo is somehow offensive to the people of this country . ”
A Royal Mail spokesman : “ We have spoken to the Royal Signals Museum to make clear that we are very willing to approve the museum ’s logo on its franked mail , and we are of course apologising for any mix - up as Royal Mail is very proud to support in a wide variety of ways the UK’s Armed Services and the organisations that support them . ”
l The Royal Mail Scheme for Franking Letters and Parcels 2008 states that a franking mark must not contain anything which “ in Royal Mail ’s judgement might offend Royal Mail or post office employees , make it embarrassing or difficult for Royal Mail to convey the letter in the post , which might give rise to complaints from the public , or cause Royal Mail operational or technical difficulties . ”
Democrats wo n’t let Republicans investigate Washington politicians ’ crooked mortgages
Republicans have called the Democrats ’ bluff on the culture of corruption .
They want to subpoena all the VIP mortgage records from Countrywide Financial .
You know , the guys who gave sweetheart deals to Democrat Senators Chris Dodd and Kent Conrad .
The Republicans say they ’re willing to take a chance that GOP lawmakers will also be ensnared in the Countrywide mortgage scandal .
Unfortunately , House Democrats are being somewhat less than cooperative .
They ’ve refused to subpoena records that might reveal if any other members of Congress also got discounted loans and special treatment .
According to congressional rules , only the chairman of a committee can issue a subpoena .
New York Democrat Edolphus Towns , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said he ’s just too darn busy stimulating the economy to find out which members of Congress are corrupt .
California Republican Darrell Issa , the senior Republican on Towns ’ committee , has repeatedly tried to get Towns to subpoena Countrywide ’s records .
Towns has turned down each request .
A Bank of America spokesman said it will gladly submit all the documents as soon as it receives a subpoena .
“ They have it packed and ready to go , ” Issa noted .
Do you think it has anything to do with the fact that every politician who ’s been ensnared in the Countrywide scandal so far has been a Democrat ?
And do you think , perhaps , both parties already know exactly who will be named in those records ?

CSS3 ’s fonts module contains @font - face , an easy - to - use mechanism for using custom fonts on web pages .
It ’s ready to use in all major browsers , except for their differences in font file format support .
Linking directly to OpenType or TrueType fonts in your @font - face rules only works in non-IE browsers .
You have to serve Microsoft ’s proprietary EOT format to IE .
Microsoft provides a tool called WEFT for creating such files .
While WEFT might be sufficient for many users , Windows plays no role in my web development toolchain ( with the exception of VMs for IE testing , of course ) .
And , frankly , I ’ve found WEFT ’s GUI to be confusing and unusable .
I need to be able to create EOT files under sensible operating systems like , say , FreeBSD .
If you have TrueType ( .ttf ) files for your desired font , you can use ttf2eot — a simple command - line tool , whose code was extracted from Google Chrome — to generate EOT files .
Kudos to Truex for alerting me to this tool .
You can install ttf2eot via MacPorts ( thanks , Ryan ) , or a simple make in the ttf2eot directory will generate the ttf2eot executable .
$ ttf2eot < Foo.ttf > Foo.eot
Things are a bit more complicated if you have OpenType ( .otf ) , not TrueType files .
You ’ll first have to convert them to TrueType .
Fortunately , FontForge can do this .
On FreeBSD , this is a simple install from ports :
$ cd /usr / ports / print / fontforge ; sudo make install clean
On Mac OS X , you can install it from MacPorts like so ( or at least you will be able to , when bug # 20085 is fixed ) :
$ sudo port install fontforge
Once you ’ve got FontForge installed , create the following script ( happily borrowed from the FontForge Scripting Tutorial ) .
Call it convert.pe , make it executable , and drop it in your PATH somewhere .
env Open ( $ 1 ) Generate ( $ 1 :r + " .ttf " )
Now , to create Foo.ttf , you should be able to run the following command :
$ convert.pe Foo.otf
You can automate all of the above steps with GNU Make like so :
%.eot : %.ttf ttf2eot < $< > $ @ %.ttf : %.otf convert.pe $<
You ’re now equipped to use any font ( whose license permits embedding with @font - face ) on your website , in an automated fashion , in all major browsers .
Well , that ’s slightly overstating it .
There ’s a catch .
Actually , there are two catches .
As describd in beautiful fonts with @font - face , Internet Explorer only recognizes the font - family and src descriptors within @font - face rules , so each family can only contain a single face .
So you wo n’t be able to simultaneously use the regular , bold , and italic variants of the same face on the same page , like you can with WEFT .
Also , you ca n’t just put a url ( foo.eot ) rule in your existing src setting .
It does n’t understand format ( ) hints and will ignore any @font - face rule containing these hints .
( Emphasis mine . )
You have to use a separate @font - face rule for IE .
At the end of the day , your CSS will look something like this :
After reading NPEREZ 's blog article DarkPAN SchmarkPAN -- STOP THE MEME , it suddenly comes to me :
We need a tool that enable users to profile their codebase to verify if they are using any removed , deprecated or changed features of a new version of the perl interpreter .
This would make the task of identifying troublesome constructs in code much easier for your average perl programmer .
I , for one , do not know when a particular feature of perl was introduced , or when another particaluar construct was deprecated ( or removed ) .
And if I read the perl changelog I 'm not always aware of how to test if any particular code construct is in use in my code or not .
Would n't it be possible to make a tool ( could possibly be named perldelta or perllint ) that scans a piece of code ( but does n't run it ) and gives out information about removed and deprecated constructs .
To me this seems like a mix between warnings and Perl : : Critic , but focused on identifying removed or deprecated constructs in just the perl interpreter instead of advocating general code style ( as Perl : : Critic does ) .
The tool could by default run against the release it is packaged with , but optionally also against older releases ( with a - - version option ) so that you could test which version of perl really would cause problems for your app .
I 'm not sure if all of the features that are deprecated / removed can ( easily ) be tested with this approach , but I 'm fairly certain that it would go a long way towards enabling deprecation cycles in core perl development .
Another useful function this tool could have was to determine the minimum ( or possibly maximum ) useful version of the perl interpreter that your code can use .
Example :
Let 's say that your code uses pseudo - hashes ( I do n't even know how to identify those ) .
They were removed somewhere in the 5.9.x - series .
This means that your code is incompatible with 5.9 or newer .
Let 's also assume that you use some useful UTF - 8 construct that makes you require 5.8.x .
That means that as long as you have that pseudo - hash code in there your limited to running your code on perl 5.8.x .
Let us then assume that a new ( junior ) programmer enters the stage and has heard about this fancy given / when thingy in perl 5.10 and starts using that in the same codebase .
Suddenly you have a codebase that is in fact completely incompatible with any single perl version , but each of the parts are perfectly compatible with some perl version .
With a tool like what I have described it would be easy to determine a specific version requirement for your codebase ( or CPAN module ) , and it would be even easier to pinpoint things that bites you now , or could possibly come and bite you in the near future .
This tool would also benefit distribution packagers in determining incompatibilities when they plan on upgrading to a new version of perl ( which we should hope they would do frequently ) .
What I like about Ubuntu , as Gabor Szabo wrote about , compared to e.g. Debian , is that it has regular releases every 6 months .
It makes me certain that if a certain feature comes along in some popular package , it is never more than 6 months away .
Imagine if we could have this kind of predictability with perl .
It would be almost like Christmas , only twice a year .
I 'm not saying that this tool necessarily needs to be bundled with perl , but it should be trivial to get it to run on your machine so that you could profile your code and give you the necessary advice .
Chromatic says that the pumpkings need more help , and I believe this is a way to help them .
If the tool could also be made to output some kind of structured output ( somewhat similar in concept to Debian popularity - contest ) we could harness statistics from both CPAN and the DarkPAN ( I really dislike that name ) to figure out what features of the language are actually in use without divulging any actual copyrighted / restricted code .
Imagine , for a second , that you run this tool against your code and then you upload a set of structured data that identifies what kind of code constructs you use in that code ( this could happen automatically if you have it set to do that ) .
If any of those constructs become deprecated or removed in the future you would get an email that says so ( based on your opt - in / out settings ) .
If you want to go all out you could even store checksums ( SHA1 ) of the files it is run against and store that value in the structured data , that way you could look up reports against a specific file without actually running it .
Imagine running something like this recursively on a big project and have it generate a report of your entire codebase ( including CPAN deps ) and then with very little effort be able to see the obvious blockers towards upgrading to the next version of perl .
I also see that this could be used to better determine Kwalitee of a CPAN module .
If we actually implement those last parts about uploading structured data to a central repository it is absolutely vital that it contains no trace of either code or the identity of the owner of that piece of code .
Because , if it does , no company would ( probably ) be willing to submit data into the repository .
Identification of a particular report / datadump to a company , individual or named code should be completely optional .
Anonymization is a vital key here .
I 'm not exactly sure how we would be able to handle foreign code ( C , C++ , Java , etc. ) , or how XS ties into the picture , but I have a feeling it should be doable .
Please let me ( and others ) hear what you have to say about this subject in the comments .
Mexico's Gulf of California has been hit by a 6.9 - magnitude earthquake and at least three smaller tremors .
There have been no reports of injuries or damage .
The 6.9 - magnitude tremor struck at 1259 local time ( 1759GMT ) , with its epicentre 76 miles ( 122 km ) north - east of Santa Isabel in Baja California .
There was a risk of a small , localised tsunami in the area , officials and experts warned , but no threat to America 's Pacific coast .
The tremors were all centred under the bed of the Gulf of California , a narrow strip of sea between Baja California peninsula and the Mexican mainland .
Wilfredo Rivera , a manager at the Posada Santa Gemma hotel in Bahia Kino told Associated Press : " The earth was turning around really ugly .
People got really scared . "
The mountains and deserts of the peninsula are sparsely populated , minimising the risk of widespread damage or injuries .

Dear President Obama ,
On November 2 , 1989 , I was burned with cigarettes more than 111 times .
I was raped over and over again -- and this was only the beginning .
During the past few years , I have had ample reason to reflect on the life of an extraordinary man , Jean Amery , an Austrian philosopher who was tortured by the Nazis .
I was first introduced to his writings shortly after my own torture in Guatemala .
Like many who have survived this unspeakable horror , I emerged from that clandestine prison lost and broken - - a body without a soul .
Gone was the God to whom I had committed my life .
Gone was trust , the very idea of justice betrayed .
Gone was all that I had believed in .
Everything that defined me as a human being ceased to exist .
Amery 's words , odd as this may seem , brought some comfort : " Anyone who has been tortured remains tortured . "
" Anyone who has suffered torture never again will be at ease in the world ... faith in humanity , already cracked by the first slap in the face , then demolished by torture , is never acquired again . "
These words seemed written just for me .
Somehow , somewhere on this earth was another person who understood what I had learned at the cruel hands of my torturers .
For a moment at least , it gave me peace of mind .
It was only years later that I would understand the fundamental meaning of Amery 's words : " Anyone who has suffered torture , never again will be at ease in the world . "
And it was years after this understanding that I would learn that Jean Amery had killed himself .
Mr. President , from anonymous graves , voices still cry out .
From clandestine prisons , in the midst of indescribable pain , we , my sisters and brothers , beg you to hear .
Will you listen to what we alone know of this crime against humanity -- what we know from the inside out ?
Please hear us !
Torture does not end with the release from some clandestine prison .
It is not something we " get over . "
Simply , " looking forward " is not an option for us .
Torture is a permanent invasion of our minds and our souls .
Surviving is far worse that the actual physical torture itself .
Those wounds heal in time -- but the memories cling to us .
Psychological torture is time without end .
No one fully recovers from torture .
The damage can never be undone .
What is our claim to speak with authority on this subject ?
We have been beaten , hanged by wrists , arms , or legs , burned by electrical devices or cigarettes , bitten by humans and dogs , cut or stabbed with knives or machetes .
And this is only a sample of what has been done to us .
Each mark , visible or invisible , is a permanent reminder of what was done to us -- a reminder that in so many cases fills us with embarrassment and even shame .
What a cruel irony that it is the tortured one and not the torturer who feels shame .
And what an irony it is that today in the United States , the tortured so often are told that what they experienced was not even cruel and unusual , let alone torture .
What an irony that those who oppose torture , oppose the violation of U.S law by acts of non-violent civil resistance can be sent to prison while those who ordered this brutality walk free , receiving the de facto impunity implied in your call to " look forward " and only forward .
Mr. President , there is ample reason to believe that important members of the previous administration may well have violated the law .
Is it not your responsibility and that of the Attorney General to investigate that possibility ?
And if the law was violated , is it not your responsibility to hold perpetrators accountable , no matter how exalted their previous positions ?
We who have paid the dreadful price of torture beseech you to determine just what happened to law and morality during the past eight years and to make those findings public .
It is only by an independent investigation that we will learn the truth , and , if that investigation warrants , it will be by prosecution that we may hold to account those who violated the law and despoiled our national honor .
Getting things right in the future depends on knowing what went wrong in the past .
You know this when it comes to the economy .
You know this when it comes to a health care system .
How can you not know it when it comes to human rights ?
Mr. President , on behalf of those who know this cruel subject so well , I ask you to act in service to the truth and to the principle that no matter how high the position held nor how much power accrues to it , its incumbent must be held accountable to the law .
As I hope you will agree , sir , to do less is to betray the very idea of justice .
Thank you for reading my letter .

Why Do We Need Government ?
May 2 , 2006
About twenty years ago a very intelligent man , whom Ill call Robert ( hes actually a sort of composite of several men ) , told me he was an anarchist .
He didnt believe in any government , period .
At the time I considered myself a conservative , with libertarian leanings .
Much as I respected Robert , I believed in limited government under the U.S. Constitution  but none at all ?
That was taking a good idea too far , I thought .
Notice the illogic of my reaction .
I was thinking of a philosophy as a matter of personal taste , as if you could draw an arbitrary line and stop there .
 Would you prefer a little bit of government , a moderate amount , or a lot of it ? 
After a while ( years , actually ) it sank in that Robert wasnt just telling me what quantity of government hed prefer .
He was saying that the whole idea of it was wrong in principle  no matter whether it was democratic , Communist , monarchist , Christian , or something else .
He would agree that some are worse than others , but he insisted that all were wrong .
Any government is a monopoly of organized force , inherently unjustifiable ; and once accepted , its bound to get out of control sooner or later .
This notion is hard for Americans to grasp , let alone assent to .
After all , we have what looks like a solid rationale for government in our Declaration of Independence , plus a practical plan for keeping it within due limits in our Constitution and Bill of Rights .
True , American government has become a staggering tangle of laws , powers , regulations , and taxes , with recurrent wars , public debt , debased money , and countless other evils , but couldnt this be cured by returning to the Constitution ?
That s what I used to think .
Besides , what would we replace the government with ?
Who would protect us from violent crime and foreign enemies ?
Who would coin the money ?
Who would pave the streets and fix the potholes ?
Others would ask who would feed the destitute , care for the sick and elderly , protect minorities , and cope with myriad other crises , emergencies , and easily imaginable disasters  most of which , by the way , didnt use to be thought of as responsibilities of government .
Everyone has a horrible fantasy that makes the actual horror seem ( to him ) worth putting up with .
Read the label on a can of soup , and think how many laws and regulations the vendor has to comply with .
The rationale for these is that the public has to be protected  from what ?
Unhealthy ingredients of some sort , I suppose .
But would we really be in any peril if there were no government enforcing these costly restrictions ?
Would it be in the sellers interest to poison his customers , even if there were no legal penalty for doing so ?
How often did that happen before all these laws were imposed ?
Roadside fruit stands are still unregulated .
Are these dangers to the purchaser ?
The other day I was ticketed , and my car briefly impounded , when a policeman noticed that I was driving with a cracked windshield .
My car had passed the required safety inspection and had the required sticker before some vandal had thrown rocks at it , so I thought I was legal .
I wasnt hurting or threatening anyone ; I posed no danger I could see .
The cop was as polite as a man with a pistol can be , but as he ordered the car towed away I asked him quietly ,  Just who are you protecting from me ?
The answer was a vague mumble about  the public . 
Later I joked to friends that Id been carjacked .
An armed man had seized my car , I explained .
Of course he had a badge , a uniform , and some sort of law on his side , so I , not he , was the criminal .
Heaven help me if I d tried to defend my property .
Self - defense would have been an even more serious offense .
By submitting to force , I confined the evil to a mere nuisance .
This time .
Carjacking or impoundment ?
We now have two vocabularies for wrongs , depending on whether private persons or government agents commit them .
This is the difference between mass murderand national defense .
Between extortion and taxation .
Between counterfeiting and inflation .
And so on .
Other examples will occur to the astute reader .
Do you smell a fault ?
No wonder Frédéric Bastiat described government as organized plunder . 
Yet for most of my life , I believed that social order depended on government .
That is , I believed that freedom depended on force , and ultimately that a great good depended on a great evil .
Im afraid most people believe such things , and accept armed men in uniforms as their benefactors .
