Comic book ads have taken a dramatic shift over the past several years .
Gone are the days of ads for TV star posters , bubble gum and various and sundry gimmick products .
Most ads in comic books today are for video games , cartoons , other comic book titles or film adaptations of comics .
If you find yourself pining for the days of offers promising an exciting product in exchange for a couple of dollars or products that were advertised in comics that would cause alarm today , take a stroll with us down memory lane and examine these ten classic products from comic books of the past , in no particular order .
Sea Monkeys
Perhaps one of the more unusual and intriguing products ever sold in comic books , Sea Monkeys , actually a very specific species of brine shrimp , have been around as a commodity since 1950 .
With their friendly Sea Monkey family happily lounging in front of their castle , their ads encouraged us to try our hand at raising an aquatic ecosystem with water , growth food and a bizarre set of " living plasma " .
They 're still sold today , but this smiling , waving oddity has vanished from the pages of comic books .
Ads for Muscle and Body Building Considering the number of ads in comics promising muscle mass and strength , Charles Atlas and company must have thought most comic book readers 98 - pound weaklings .
The innumerable ads , many promising results in a matter of days , were everywhere in comics for years , ran the gamut of techniques .
From Atlas ' " dynamic tension " , to Mike Marvel 's Scientific Isometrics , consumers had their choice of ways in which to achieve maximum pumpage with minimum time commitment .
Grit Newspaper
Poor , literally , non-Grit saleschildren .
Multiple ads for this over 120 year old newspaper turned magazine depicted little souls without cash , unable to partake in the fun their friends were having at the amusement park .
Selling Grit , which practically sold itself according to the ads , would guarantee kids either cash payments or they could receive prizes of all sorts .
While Grit is still sold today , it was once an introduction into free enterprise for young kids looking for a way to treat the gang to a burger .
Hostess Snack Cakes Ah , Hostess Snack Cakes .
Remember the good ole ' days when all it took to stop Lex Luthor from taking over the city was a Twinkie ?
Or how about that time Spider - Man thwarted Doc Ock by simply distracting him with a Ding Dong ?
Hostess Snack Cakes still exist on grocery store shelves , their ads in comics forgotten .
I challenge you though to pick up virtually any mainstream comic book from the late 70's - mid 80's that did n't include an ad for one of these sugary , but oh so delicious , crimebusters !
Dingo Boots
Perhaps the biggest reason that this ad stands out today is due to the fact that its spokesperson , O.J. Simpson , does n't quite have the same appeal to kids today as he did when he endorsed this product during his football heydays .
Dingo Boots are known for their authentic , sturdy leather and Western appeal .
Using O.J.'s appeal in their ads was a genius move , and the promise of the autographed picture of the Juice certainly helped sell some shoes !
Air Rifles
It seemed like a good idea at the time .
Companies Daisy and Crosman were certainly the two biggest companies that published ads in comics , featuring happy children learning to use their pump action bb guns , under the watchful eye of an adult , usually festooned by a cowboy hat .
It would be hard to imagine DC or Marvel running ads with these products today , but for nostalgia 's sake , it 's certainly interesting to revisit .
Toy Soldier Sets
Go to any toy store today and try to see how far $ 1.75 - $ 1.98 will go .
For a good portion of the Bronze Age , that was all the dough you needed to get your own squadron of toy soldiers !
You could have Roman fighters , Army men , Civil War soldiers , all in sets of at least 100 !
A great service these ads provided was in listing specifically what inventory you were getting , everything from tanks to archers !
Aurora Hobby Kits
If you wanted a way to build a Frankenstein monster to play with your model Batmobile , you could find both through Aurora .
The company , known for its model kits of , well , everything , was a stable advertiser in comic books for years .
Superheoes , movie monsters , animals , science - fiction robots and cars were among their more popular offerings , with these kits now a collectible commodity .
A relaunch of some of the kits was rumored , but sadly , nothing has come to fruition at this time .
Mego Action Figures
The world 's greatest superheroes helped make Mego a memorable company in the 1970's .
Their ads for their line of 8 - inch figures were everywhere in the pages of DC and Marvel , and the toys were widely popular .
Ads in comics were used to both tease us with future releases of popular characters and to encourage us to run out to stores to pick up Shazam , Batgirl , Iron Man and the Green Goblin .
Sadly the company folded in the early 80's , but the toys , and the comic books featuring their ads , live on .
X - Ray Glasses , Spy - Pens , Etc .
How could I do this list without including , of course , the classic and ever - present ads for various novelties such as X - Ray glasses and sneezing powder .
Offered at dirt cheap prices , these products would be featured in typically half to full page ads , with type that was often microscopic .
When you think about it though , how much of a sales pitch do you have to have to buy a whoopie cushion for under $ 2.00 .
While some of the gadgets have fallen away , mostly over the years , such as 3 - D glasses , others are still around , however their comic book presence has sadly waned .
In this article we are going to point out some objective strengths of web server log analysis compared to JavaScript based statistics , such is Google Analytics .
Depending on your preferences and type of the website , you might find some or all of these arguments applicable or not .
In any case , everyone should be at least aware of differences in order to make a right decision .
1 . You do n’t need to edit HTML code to include scripts
Depending on how your website is organized , this could be a major tasks , especially if it contains lot of static HTML pages .
Adding script code to all of them will surely take time .
If your website is based on some content management system with centralized design template , you ’ll still need to be careful not to forget adding code to any additional custom pages outside this CMS .
2. Scripts take additional time to load
Regardless of what Google Analytics officials say , actual experiences prove otherwise .
Scripts are scripts and they must take some time to load .
If external file is located on a third - party server ( as it ’s the case with Google Analytics ) , the slowdown is even more noticeable , because visitor ’s browser must resolve another domain .
As a solution they suggest putting inclusion code at the end of the page .
Indeed , in that case it would appear that page is loaded more quickly , but the truth is that there ’s a good chance that visitor will click another link before script is executed .
As a result , you wo n’t see these hits in stats and they are lost forever .
3 . If website exists , log files exist too
With JavaScript analytics , stats are available only for periods when code was included .
If you forget to put code on some pages , the opportunity is forever lost .
Similarly , if you decide to start collecting stats today , you ’ll never be able to see stats from yesterday or before .
Same applies to goals : metrics are available only after you decide to track them .
With some log analyzers , you can freely add more goals anytime and still be able to analyze them based on log files from the past .
4 . Server log files contain hits to all files , not just pages
By using solely JavaScript based analytics , you do n’t have any information about hits to images , XML files , flash ( SWF ) , programs ( EXE ) , archives ( ZIP , GZ ) , etc .
Although you could consider these hits irrelevant , they are not for most webmasters .
Even if you do n’t usually maintain other types of files , you must have some images on your website , which could be linked from external websites without you knowing anything about it .
5 . You can investigate and control bandwidth usage
Although you might not be aware of it , most hosting providers limit bandwidth usage and usually base their pricing on it .
Bandwidth usage costs them and , naturally , it most probably costs you as well .
You would be surprised how much domains ( usually from third - world countries ) poll your whole website on a regular basis , possibly wasting gigabytes of your bandwidth every day .
If you could identify these domains , you could easily block their traffic .
6. Bots ( spiders ) are excluded from JavaScript based analytics
Similar as previous point , some ( bogus ) spiders misbehave and they are wasting your bandwidth , while you do n’t have any benefit from them .
In addition , server logs also contain information about visits from legitimate bots , such are Google or Yahoo .
By using solely JavaScript based analytics you have no idea how often they come and which pages they visit .
7 . Log files record all traffic , even if JavaScript is disabled
Certain percentage of users choose to turn off JavaScript , and some of them use browsers that do n’t support it at all .
These visits ca n’t be identified by JavaScript based analytics .
8 . You can find out about hacker attacks
Hackers could attack your website with various methods , but neither of them would be recorded by JavaScript analytics .
As every access to your web server is contained in log files , you are able to identify them and save yourself from damage ( by blacklisting their domains or closing security holes on your website ) .
9 . Log files contain error information
Without them , in general case , you do n’t have any information about errors and status codes ( such are Page not found , Internal server error , Forbidden , etc. ) .
Without it , you are missing possible technical problems with your website that lower overall visitor ’s perception of its quality .
Moreover , any attempt to access forbidden areas of your website can be easily identified .
10 .
By using log file analyzer , you do n’t give away your business data
And last but not least , your stats are not available to a third - party who can use them at their convenience .
Google has bought all rights for , at that time , popular and quite expensive web statistics product ( Urchin ) , repackaged it , and then allowed to anyone to use it for free .
The question is : why ?
They surely get something in return , as Google Analytics license agreement allows them to use your information for their purposes , and even to share it with others if you choose to participate in sharing program .
What could they possibly use ?
Just to give few obvious ideas : tweaking AdWords minimum bids , deciding how to prioritize ads , improving their services ( and profits ) – all based on traffic data collected from you and others .

The personnel at the 4077 MASH unit deal with the horrors of the Korean War and the stresses faced in surgery by whatever means .
The tone at the MASH is established by recent arrivals , surgeons Captains ' Hawkeye ' Pierce , ' Duke ' Forrest , and ' Trapper ' John McIntyre - the latter who Hawkeye knows he 's met somewhere , but Trapper who wo n't divulge where - whose antics can be best described as non-regulation , and in the negative words of one of their fellow MASH - ers : unmilitary .
The unit 's commanding officer , Colonel Henry Blake , does n't care about this behavior as long as it does n't affect him , and as long as they do their job and do it well , which they do .
Their behavior does extremely bother fellow surgeon , Major Frank Burns , and recently arrived head nurse , Major Margaret Houlihan , who obtains the nickname ' Hot Lips ' based on information they glean about her through underhanded means .
Beyond their battles with Frank and Hot Lips , Hawkeye , Duke and / or Trapper help unit dentist Painless .

LEEDING QUESTION : Leeds residents have strong ideas about the Burkha
And in Leeds yesterday the number of women clad head - to - foot in burkhas provoked anger among growing numbers who believe they should be banned .
Groups of Muslim women dressed in the restrictive robes refused to comment on their personal reasons for wearing the garment which continues to cause controversy .
And even though they were walking along a busy street among shoppers and workers , most refused to be seen engaging with a non-Muslim man in public .
Leeds has a fast - growing Muslim population of at least 40,000 – ­double the number of 10 years ago .
Locals say that since the 7/7 attacks in July 2005 – three of the gang hailed from Leeds – there has also been a increase in the number of Islamic women choosing to wear the burkha , much to the anger of many of the city ’s inhabitants .
German - born au- pair Chantal Manzal , 23 , has been living in Leeds for a year but returns home next month .
She said yesterday : “ I can not believe what I have seen in Britain .
In Germany the burkha is hardly ever seen but here I see women wearing them whenever I go out .
“ I find them really scary .
If you can only see people ’s eyes you have no idea what is going on with them .
They are definitely wrong and should be banned in all public spaces .
“ To me it is slavery of the women and I do n’t know what to say when the eight - year - old girl I look after asks me about what the women are wearing .
She finds them frightening and intimidating .
How do I tell a ­little girl these women are unable to show their faces in public ? ”
Hairdresser Sarah - Jane Martin , 21 , said : “ There is no doubt these terrible things should be banned immediately .
It is a sign of oppression against women and on those grounds alone , in this day and age , they should be outlawed . ”
Retired factory worker David Rolls , 66 , was more accommodating but still believed burkhas should be banned in most public places .
He said : “ I do n’t believe in demanding what people can or cannot wear .
It should be up to them .
However , I do n’t think they should be allowed in places where there is a security risk such as airports , banks or indoor shopping centres . ”
Businesswoman Marcia Booth , 37 , said : “ There is no more prominent sign of female oppression by men than the burkha .
I find it so demeaning and whenever I see these women hiding themselves away my blood reaches boiling point and I just want to scream at them .
As Canada Day 2009 , our 142nd birthday , draws to a close here in Montreal , I suppose it ’s just as well I did n’t plan to attend any fireworks display , because – surprise !
– it ’s starting to rain .
Of course , one need n’t attend fireworks displays , or march in parades or hang huge flags out one ’s window in Canada to prove one ’s patriotism .
Indeed , our lowkey attitudes – even phlegmatism – with regard to outward signs of patriotism distinguish us from our more flamboyant neighbours to the south .
Nevertheless , like so many of my fellow citizens , no Canada Day passes without my spending a good deal of it in reflection on how blessed I and my family are to live in this great , peaceful country , as benign and well - meaning a nation as one is able to find on this troubled globe .
No country is perfect , but what unmolested Canadian could fail to feel blessed in his or her good fortune ?
Well , one springs to mind .
Vancouver - based Omar Shaban is the Vice President for western Canada of the Canadian Arab Federation , and he is definitely not feeling the gratitude vibe .
Quite the opposite .
Shaban has labelled Canada a “ genocidal state ” and described our national holiday on Facebook as “ F*** Canada Day , ” adding , to be sure he had made his point , “ It ’s finally Canada Day … Could n’t be more ashamed to be Canadian . ”
Shaban is no aberration in the CAF .
As staunchly anti-Islamist Tarek Fatah reported here : “ While one VP of the Canadian Arab Federation was throwing insults at Canada , another Vice President of CAF was on cable TV showering praise on the discredited leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
Appearing on a Muslim cable TV show , Ali Mallah endorsed the election of President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad as valid , and echoed the official line of the Tehran regime , claiming Western governments and Western Media were to blame for the current unrest in Iran . “
You will recall that in February of this year Immigration Minister Jason Kenney announced he would slash federal funding to the Canadian Arab Federation ( CAF ) after its president , Khaled Mouammar , called him a “ professional whore ” for supporting Israel .
This was not a one - off .
During the 2006 Liberal leadership campaign , the CAF initiated a smear campaign against Bob Rae solely on the grounds that his Jewish wife was active in her community .
The CAF are also 9/11 conspiracy theorists , and last year sponsored an essay contest on “ The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine , ” in which it urged high school students to channel the group ’s own fervid hatred of Israel for prizes .
As Jonathan Kay noted February 17 here , “ Last year , the National Post editorial board hosted Mouammar and a CAF colleague for an editorial board meeting .
To our collective shock , they laid blame for virtually every problem the world faces on Israel – including the alienation of Arab - Canadian children in Canada ’s public school system .
( One explained that he had sent his daughter for education overseas – because the inclusion of Israel in Canadian textbooks was too traumatic for her to endure . ) ”
Many liberals reflexively rose up to challenge Jason Kenney ’s announcement that the government would no longer fund the CAF .
The wonder to any objective observer of this hateful group is how they ever came to get a red cent from the government in the first place .
Nobody in this country is forced to celebrate Canada Day , but it ’s a bit much , even for us phlegmatic types , to witness the alleged spokesman of a cultural community spewing hatred against a democracy they had no part in making , and whose freedoms and security , so unlike the countries they come from , they apparently take for granted .
To bite the hands of one ’s benefactor on the most symbolic day of the benefactor ’s year is a provocation that must not go unchallenged .
There is tolerance and there is masochism .
We too often confuse them in this naive and well - meaning nation .
It is past time that this intolerant and subversive organization folded its tents and retreated from the public forum .
It is a disgrace to all Arabs , and it is , by the way , past time that we heard the same from a sizable number of Arab - Canadians .
Loud and clear .
Okay , so you know how they teach you , in Computer Science school , that lovely quote : " premature optimization is the root of all evil " ?
( variously attributed to Donald Knuth , or Tony Hoare , or other CS luminaries ) .
Well , in my more recent experience , there 's another programmer habit which is in hot competition for the evil - rooting title .
I do n't think it has as catchy a name , so I 'm going to propose one here : Premature Flexibilization .
And here 's what I mean : the practice of adding complexity to your code to make it more " flexible " , in anticipation of future change .
Why would this be so bad ?
I hear you saying .
I mean , we all know that software requirements change , so is n't it good to make your code future - proof , by making it flexible , able to handle those changes that are inevitably going to come ?
Most of the classic expositions of the glories of Object - Oriented programming are rife with this -- look , we 're using abstract classes , so now the subclasses can vary , thus our code will be flexible and reusable , is n't that great ?
Here 's why this fails so badly in real life : it 's not just that requirements change , it 's that they almost always change in ways which the initial programmers did n't expect .
E.g. you 've got your nice abstract base classes , all set to add more variants , but it turns out you just need the one variant ... but you need to add a whole bunch of features to it .
Or you have to make it thread - safe .
Or connect it via RPC to Javascript code running in a browser .
Or auto - generate it via a script .
But , because you 've made it flexible in one direction ( adding more variants ) , you 've also made it harder to vary in other directions ( features , thread - safety , connecting - to - a - browser - ness , auto - generability ) .
This is a near iron - clad rule : flexibility comes with attendant complexity , and complexity makes things harder to change in unexpected ways .
Or , to put it another way : if you make something as absolutely damn simple as possible , then extending it along any axis is at least doable .
But that 's the only way .
Take a careful look at Design Patterns , that classic text of OO design .
Notice how so many of the patterns are about making your software flexible , about making it adaptable to change .
Then notice that all their lovely real - world examples are for frameworks which no one uses anymore .
They 've been replaced by other " flexible " frameworks ( actually , they 've usually been replaced by several generations of " flexible " frameworks , each of which turned out to be the wrong kind of flexible )
In contrast , consider the C standard library .
It was n't designed to be flexible , it was designed to be as simple as possible .
And , lo , these 35 years later , it 's still being used .
Sure , it 's been wrapped by other layers , improved this way and that , but it 's still a live thing .
Also , note that " simple " is a very subtle idea .
It does n't necessarily mean " crude " .
Sometimes , the simplest way to do something is to , e.g. write a Domain - Specific Language -- which is in no way trivial .
But , and here 's the key distinction , it 's a solution to the problems you have right now .
It 's not a solution to problems you think are coming later .
If you can train yourself into the deep habit of only solving today 's problems , you 'll be far better prepared for tomorrow than if you tried to look ahead .
What do you think ?
Agree ?
Disagree ?
Any examples that loom large in your experience ?
When it 's time to walk away With the Sports Dad hanging it up , the Sports Guy has retirement on the brain
This column appears in the July 27 issue of ESPN The Magazine .
Okay , so I 've been thinking about retirements lately .
Courtesy Bill Simmons
The Sports Dad is a familiar figure for avid readers of the Sports Guy .
( Do n't worry , this is n't a column about Brett Favre , I swear .
I 'd never do something so horrible to you . )
My father is retiring after 33 years as a school administrator in Easton , Mass. , the last 16 as district superintendent .
( And if you do n't know why he 's excited about 33 being his walk - off number , you must not know him at all . )
In Massachusetts , school administrators can retire after 30 years and receive up to 80 % of their salary for life .
Dad became eligible in 2006 .
He decided to continue in his job through this summer .
It practically cost him money to work .
Selfishly , I wanted him to step down three years ago .
Running a school system , as you can imagine , requires making agonizing calls from time to time .
Disciplinary decisions .
Budget decisions .
Personnel decisions .
My father is a good guy with a good heart .
He was n't meant to lay off teachers or field angry rants from parents .
Those kinds of things ate away at him .
I happened to be living in his house right after he assumed command .
Dad would come home , pour himself a ginger ale and sink into the sofa .
He was gone .
You could n't even talk to him .
Maybe his insides were n't built for the job , but because Dad was the one most qualified -- how many people have a law degree , a master 's and a PhD ? -- he had to give it a try .
His sense of humor , political savvy and refusal to play favorites ended up carrying him .
Still , he lived in constant fear of a salacious scandal , an accident , anything unsavory .
Each year that passed without a stumble was a moral victory .
ESPN bought my column during the latter part of his career .
To his eternal chagrin and infinitesimal delight , my father became a running character in it .
His carefully crafted local persona as " the soft - spoken superintendent with long hair and a bushy mustache " started to crumble just a little .
He made funny cameos in my NBA draft and Red Sox columns .
I joked about his prostate and habit of falling asleep during games .
People began to feel as if they knew him .
One reader even used " That suit has no buttons " ( Dad 's take on the Grizzlies ' choice of Drew Gooden in the 2002 draft ) as his high school yearbook quote .
In time , Dad noticed kids staring at him in school hallways .
A few even yelped , " The Sports Dad ! "
For someone who craved anonymity , this was n't exactly ideal .
I did n't care .
I could n't leave him out .
I always throw my friends into my columns , and really , he 's my best friend , so it would have been dishonest .
It was also the right choice .
Sometimes I get e-mails from readers who have lost a father ; they thank me for helping them remember their dads through my relationship with mine .
I am always humbled .
Always .
Just when he could have bolted , in 2006 , his town broke ground on a state - of - the - art high school complex .
Dad practically killed himself to get it funded , and he wanted to cut the ribbon as superintendent when it opened .
That was n't up for debate .
( This was his second big legacy .
The first was the A - Wing , a facility that teaches everyday work skills to special ed students . )
So he kept making the same boring 90 - minute round - trip drive and praying that nothing crazy would happen .
And I kept forwarding him stories about scandals at other schools , hoping to inspire him to flee .
" Hey , Dad , you hear about the Idaho eighth - graders who became cannibals ? "
Nothing worked .
I finally gave up .
When he turned 60 , right after another Wall Street implosion , I worried even more .
You do n't want to be school superintendent of a middle - class town in a bad economy .
The digital revolution brought a second slew of dangers : in - class texting , Internet slam pages , Facebook , digital pictures .
The pressures of his job had changed , and not in a good way .
He would n't even watch Friday Night Lights , explaining simply , " A high school drama is n't exactly a relaxing TV night for me . "
I was worried about him .
Really worried .
Like , calling - five - times - a - week worried .
Could he survive one more year ?
It helped when the school was completed this past fall and blew everyone away .
When I showed up for the first play in the sparkling new auditorium , Dad squired me around as if he were showing off his new house .
He kind of was .
Here 's the weight room .
Here 's the gym .
Here are the classrooms .
I finally understood why he stayed .
He had to see this through .
These past few months , various clubs and groups have honored him -- I jokingly dubbed it the Kareem Abdul - Jabbar Retirement Tour -- which is funny because nobody is more mortified by that kind of stuff than my father .
He did n't even want a retirement dinner .
" Just let me sneak out the backdoor on my last Friday , " he kept begging .
He meant it .
We did n't listen to him .
The dinner took place last month .
There were speeches and gifts , food and drinks , an overwhelming turnout and everything short of a surprise performance from Mr. Holland 's symphony .
They showed a slide show that broke down Dad 's career into three parts : career , family and sports .
Everyone was pretty choked up .
They even named the new school 's lecture hall after him .
( He 'd never admit it , but I know he was thrilled . )
Then he gave a heartfelt speech and everyone drove home .
The end .

Maybe we 'd understand what Favre is going through if we all had to retire at 40 .
When my father steps down in August , he takes roughly 45,300 unused vacation days with him .
Has to be a record .
He plans on taking six months off -- his first extended hiatus from work since college -- then he 'll consult and do some volunteering .
He needs to somehow stuff five rooms ' worth of gifts , plaques and framed pictures ( and this column , hopefully ) into one office of his Boston home .
He wants to attend Celtics games , travel with his wife , see his grandkids .
It 's all good .
He made it out alive and left something behind .
One of the biggest differences between sports and real life is that when athletes retire , they still have half a lifetime ahead of them .
They feel sad because their careers are over , but also because they have no idea what to do next .
This is why they come back -- in Favre 's case , over and over .
When real people retire , ideally , they have accomplished everything they wanted to .
My father was lucky in this respect .
Like Billy Beane , he put up Moneyball numbers in a middle - class town , essentially winning 95 games a year with a small - market club .
He lasted 16 years in a job in which people rarely last five .
Of course , we never read tributes about someone like my father for obvious reasons .
We pay homage to athletes , entertainers and politicians .
Real people do n't get victory laps .
So here 's one for Dr. Bill Simmons .
Congratulations , Pops .
You made it .
To further close the circle : I 'm retiring from this space in ESPN The Magazine after seven happy years .
Like my father and his superintendency , The Magazine was never an ideal match for me -- I hate advance deadlines and word counts -- and yet , I could n't be happier with how it all turned out .
It 's just time for me to try some new things , that 's all .
And you have to know when it 's time .
I learned that from my father .
( There 's hope for you yet , Brett . )

Three judges are currently reviewing the judge that handled the Pirate Bay trial to discover if he was biased or not .
No decision has yet been made but the New York Times and several other publications report inaccuracies and plain wrongs that claim otherwise .
Time to get the facts straight .
Pirate Bay judge Tomas Norström ’s objectivity has been called into doubt by the defense lawyers because of his ties to national and international pro-copyright lobby groups .
To investigate these accusations of bias , the appeal court appointed a judge , Ulrika Ihrfelt .
Her task is to decide whether or not Norström ’s verdict could have been biased since this issue must be resolved before they can move on to the appeal request .
If it ’s determined that Norström was indeed biased , the case will be resubmitted to the district court for retrial , meaning that an appeal is not needed at this stage .
Earlier this week the District Court of Stockholm handed in their statement to the Appeal Court , arguing that they do n’t believe that Norström was biased .
This was not really a surprise since they appointed him and admitting that he is biased would be admitting to having made a mistake before the “ bias case ” is reviewed .
However , many publications mistakenly concluded from this statement that a ruling was made on the bias issue , or even worse .
“ The four men convicted for operating file - sharing site the Pirate Bay suffered a further setback this week when they failed to get the case thrown out because of alleged bias by the sentencing judge , ” the Hollywood reporter wrote .
This was picked up and twisted even further by none other than The New York Times who reported : “ A Swedish court has denied the appeal of four men convicted of violating copyright law for their involvement in the Pirate Bay . ”
Several other large and smaller publications wrote similar articles this week , concluding that the court “ ruled ” that the Pirate Bay judge was not biased or that an appeal was off the table .
The truth is that the Appeal Court still has to decide whether or not the judge is biased .
The only thing that happened this week is that the District Court handed it their statement .
Appeal Court Judge Ulrika Ihrfelt , who was taken off the bias case previously , but will be involved in an eventual appeal told a local newspaper this week :
“ The biggest challenge will probably be the enormous amount of media attention at the trial .
I have n’t been in media ’s spotlights before , so this is a new experience for me . ”
The biggest challenge for the media on the other hand , is to get their facts straight instead of writing up nonsense .
Props to our friend David Kravets at Wired who was one of the few who got it right .
BBC Covers the lax marijuana laws in canada terribly
And then moves on to the big issue .
TERRORISM !
Ahhhhhh !!!!!
This sort of logic is the latest desperate attempt to villainize weed .
They tried with the commercial velow back in the day ( trying to link marijuana use and terrorism ) , and failed as well since everyone knows what a load of bullshit it is .
Fucking morons .
How about , what if these smugglers were paid to smuggle elephant tusks into the states !
You know they would for the right price !
Save the elephants ,
Get tough on pot !
Better yet ,
How about “ Goldfish have left Lincoln Logs in my sock drawer ! ” ; )
And something to clean the palette from all that nonsense 😉
RAPAPORT ...
De Beers Group 's sales for the first half of 2009 fell 54 percent to $ 1.7 billion .
The company reported net earnings of $ 3 million , which was a drop of 99 percent .
De Beers registered underlying losses — i.e. , operating losses — of $ 164 million , compared with underlying earnings of $ 350 million one year ago .
First - half sales for the Diamond Trading Company ( DTC ) were down 57 percent to $ 1.4 billion .
De Beers noted the sales decline was " due to reduced purchases by sightholders as they worked to reduce inventory levels and increase liquidity in the face of the global economic downturn . "
Production fell 73 percent to 6.6 million carats as many mining operations were placed on care and maintenance during the first quarter .
Subsequently , though , all except one mine have resumed operations , according to De Beers .
For the full year , De Beers predicts production will be half that of 2008 .
De Beers reduced costs by more than 50 percent in the first half , realizing $ 612 million in savings and reducing capital expenses by $ 241 million .
Shareholders provided $ 500 million in additional subordinated loan funding , brining total loans to $ 817 million before International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) interest adjustments .
The company stated that it is working with banks to renew a $ 1.5 billion term loan , which expires in March 2010 .
Net debt as of June 2009 was at $ 4.1 billion , up from $ 3.8 billion in December .
" The trading environment in the rough diamond market was extraordinarily difficult in the first quarter but , during the second quarter , De Beers began to see positive trends in demand , sales and price , " according to the company 's statement .
De Beers reported that " consumer desire " for diamonds was strong , and that it was therefore investing in three separate initiatives to turn that sentiment into sales .
De Beers remains at the forefront of several marketing initiatives .
In the Far East , De Beers ’ Forevermark has expanded in Hong Kong , Macau , China and Japan , and is available in 245 retail locations .
Forevermark is being expanded into six new cities in China .
De Beers is currently developing its latest " Big Idea " concept with sightholders and retailers in the U.S. in time for the Christmas season .
De Beers is also a founding member of a new industry marketing initiative , The International Diamond Board ( IDB ) , " which aims to drive demand and protect consumers ’ confidence in diamonds , " according to De Beers .
Looking ahead , De Beers expects more stable conditions .
Inventories of rough in the cutting centers have been reduced by some 30 percent from their peak in 2008 , according to the company , and debt levels across these centers have now been reduced " to more sustainable levels . "
" De Beers will continue to take a cautious approach in terms of production , sales and cost management , while anticipating the continued steady recovery of the industry .
Looking to the medium term , diamonds have historically performed well in periods following recessions , with significant price growth seen in almost every recovery period dating back to before the 1970s .
In the long term , the fundamentals of the diamond industry remain strong .
With no major new diamond discoveries in more than a decade , and with worldwide reserves at an all - time low , diamonds will become more scarce .
As demand grows in emerging markets , it is likely that sales will outpace forecast diamond supply for many years to come , " the company reported .

WASHINGTON / DETROIT ( Reuters ) - For some U.S. Rust Belt cities , the future will be smaller and greener .
The words " No Trepassing " are seen on the front of an abandoned house in a former thriving working - class neighborhood near downtown Flint , Michigan July 8 , 2009 .

As communities from Buffalo to Milwaukee struggle with shuttered factories and vacant neighborhoods , some have turned abandoned properties into parks , gardens and other open space , even going so far as to plow under entire neighborhoods .
A recognition that the glory days of factory - powered prosperity will not return any time soon , this “ shrinking cities ” strategy aims to consolidate what remains into denser neighborhoods and more vibrant downtowns .
In Flint , Michigan , the birthplace of General Motors , a pioneering program that allows local government to capture profits from tax foreclosures has generated funds to demolish over 1,000 abandoned homes in the past five years .
“ There ’s a gravitational pull that we ’re a part of and it ’s toward a smaller city , ” said Dan Kildee , treasurer of Genesee County surrounding Flint .
“ This is not a plan to shrink Flint , it ’s an acknowledgment that we ’ve lost half our population . ”
Flint ’s fortunes -- like those of GM -- have been on the decline for decades .
In the late 1970s , there were more than 80,000 GM workers in Flint centered on a sprawling industrial complex known as Buick City .
GM ’s city - within - a- city covered 235 acres ( 951,000 square meters ) and employed more than 25,000 people .
Foremen had to ride bicycles to cover the distances between production areas .
But GM had cut over 90 percent of its jobs in Flint even before it filed for bankruptcy in June .
All that remains of Buick City is a bulldozed and fenced - in field and almost a third of the surrounding neighborhoods are abandoned .
The solution Kildee is promoting is a county “ land bank ” that sells off more valuable foreclosed properties in the surrounding suburbs to generate cash to pay for demolition and create inner-city gardens and parks .
THE WAY FORWARD
A tour of one of the hardest - hit Flint neighborhoods just north of downtown shows the depth of the problem :
The only occupied house on the block has a spray - painted warning to stay off the yard .
Across the street , patches of grass are waist high and strewn with empty liquor bottles and broken glass .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
“ It ’s really personal to me , ” Kildee said .
“ This is the neighborhood where my grandmother lived for 60 years . ”
Other land bank funds , supported by grants from charities including the Mott Foundation , have underwritten an effort to reclaim and restore buildings in Flint ’s once largely abandoned downtown .
“ It ’s hard for political leaders to acknowledge that maybe we ’re just not going to grow , ” Kildee said .
“ This is a radical experiment in that it ’s accepting that it ’s okay to be smaller -- and to be better . ”
Urban planners say Kildee has shown the way forward for other struggling cities .
“ He ’s really forced folks in Flint to really make some hard decisions and accept some difficult realities , ” said Charles Smith , a planner with the Michigan - based firm Wade Trim .
But this smaller - city approach risks a backlash from voters who may see it as an admission of defeat , planners say .
“ Nobody wants to admit that -- it ’s in part tied up with this American ideology of growth being good , ” said Jess Zimbabwe , director of the Mayors ’ Institute on City Design .
The concept was pioneered in former East German cities like Leipzig that emptied out when the Berlin Wall fell .
Development efforts were concentrated on downtown areas , waterfronts and other pedestrian - friendly sites to foster a sense of vibrancy and density for those who remained , said Bruce Katz , director of the Brookings Institution ’s Metropolitan Policy Program .
In the United States ’ older industrial areas , several cities are starting to take a similar approach :
* Youngstown ,
Ohio , the poorest mid-size city in the United States , plans to knock down 2,000 abandoned buildings by next year as part of a citywide rezoning effort that aims to concentrate redevelopment on viable neighborhoods and commercial districts .
* Cleveland is encouraging neighborhood - level experiments to turn vacant lots into parks , commercial vegetable gardens , orchards and other useful open space .
The city does not plan to raze entire neighborhoods , even those where 80 percent of the housing stock is abandoned .
“ We ’re not at that point yet , ” said Bobbi Reichtel of the nonprofit group Neighborhood Progress , which has been directing federal money to these experiments .
* Highland Park , just north of downtown Detroit , has applied for federal money to demolish several largely abandoned neighborhoods and let them lie fallow until a new use can be found .
Home to Henry Ford ’s first assembly line , the city has experienced a drop in population to a third of its 1940 level .
Unemployment is at 22 percent .
* Philadelphia has cleaned up 11 million square feet ( 1.02 million square meters ) of vacant land since 2003 and plans to convert some lots into parks or community gardens .
AVOIDING THE PROBLEM
Other cities , however , have avoided tackling the problem .
Planners say Detroit could reinvent itself as a network of vibrant neighborhoods connected by parks or agricultural space , but scandal has racked the city ’s leadership and surrounding suburbs have no inclination to help fund the effort .
New Orleans likewise rejected a proposal to raze some neighborhoods that Hurricane Katrina devastated in 2005 .
Now the city struggles to deliver services to sparsely populated “ jack o’ lantern ” neighborhoods , so named because only a few rebuilt houses on some blocks light up at night .
States and the U.S. government can help .
Michigan has passed “ land bank ” legislation that makes it easier for cities like Flint to take control of abandoned property and consolidate it into larger parcels .
Instead of spending federal highway funds to encourage suburban sprawl , states could use that money to knock down underused freeways that carve barriers through cities such as Syracuse , New York , Katz said .
The recession and the foreclosure crisis have forced many cities to take a second look at a policy they may have initially rejected , Katz said .
“ I think we ’re on the verge of something very different in many of these places , ” said Katz , who has urged other Ohio cities to follow Youngstown ’s lead .
“ I see a much greater openness to this than I did even five years ago . ”
HIGHSCHOOL MASSACRE SIMULATOR 'COUNTER -STRIKE ' STRIKES AGAIN !

HIGHSCHOOL MASSACRE SIMULATOR 'COUNTER -STRIKE ' STRIKES AGAIN !
On March 11th 2009 , 17 year old Tim Kretschmer armed himself with more than 200 rounds of ammunition , before setting off on a bloody and murderous rampage at the Albertville school in Wissenden , Germany .
He shot and killed 15 people , 9 of which were students .
A further 7 students were also shot in the rampage , but somehow survived .
But what could have caused such a shocking and disturbing tragedy , which has sent shockwaves across Germany ?
What could have caused a young man with everything to live for , a young man with no previous criminal convictions , to turn into such a homicidal lunatic ?
From the News we ’re told Kretschmer had finished all his studies , and enrolled on a course to train as a salesman .
We ’re also told he regularly worked out at the gym and belonged to a sports club .
So it ’s clear from the start this is n’t your normal Gothic High School Massacre ( Though we have no doubts it was probably inspired by the Goths ) .
Heribert Rech , Interior Minister of the southern state of Baden - Wuerttemberg was quoted as saying , “ He was completely unremarkable , there was nothing in his background to suggest this could have happened . ”
Fellow students also described him as “ quiet ” and “ reserved ”
So , if he was n’t a Goth , then what DID cause him to snap , and perform such an evil and wicked act ?
One word : Counter - Strike .
Yes , the News reports paint a picture of a boy who had been spending increasing amounts of time playing the violent Video game ‘ Counter Strike ’ .
It appears that 17 year old Tim Kretschmer was obsessed with the so - called game ‘ Counter - Strike ’ , to the point where he was unable to differentiate between his real life , and fantasy World he lived in the game .
He probably thought he was still playing the game when he killed all those innocent children .
For those who do not know , ‘ Counter Strike ’ is an ultra-violent video
Game where you go around shooting anyone you like .
In the ‘ alternative reality ’ of Counter Strike , you can even pretend to be a Terrorist member of the Al Qaeda , and go out on a killing spree , murdering Godly American Soldiers .
Shocking !
When these kids could be in Church learning all about God 's love , reading the Bible , or spending their time with Jesus , they are instead playing these violent Anti-Christian games , and being brainwashed into wanting to Kill !
Kill !
Kill !
Kill their parents , Kill their classmates , Kill themselves .
That 's the kind of trash these games brainwash children into thinking .
Counter - Strike is also the ‘ School Massacre Simulator ’ Seung - Hui Cho , the perpetrator of the Virginia Tech Massacre , trained on in High School .
See , it 's like I 've been saying all along - These video games turn good normal healthy kids who get good grades and have normal lives , into psychopathic mass - murdering game - geek psychopaths .
The sooner we get this game banned , the better !
Please sign the Petition to Ban School Massacre Simulator ‘ Counter Strike ’ NOW !
Your children ’s lives may depend on it .
Tim Bunce
You probably know Tim more for his technical achievements , such as DBI , but he 's been instrumental in developing Perl 's early community .
Tim was one of the small core of people who have made Perl and CPAN what it is today .
He was there at the start of the Perl Packrats , which turned into CPAN .
He was involved with the Perl Module List before we had things such as CPAN Search that made it easy to find modules .
He worked as a PAUSE administrator .
Any one of those would warrant a White Camel , even if he does deserve several .
Philippe Bruhat ( BooK )
Most of the past yearly French workshops have happened not because BooK organized them , but by his constant nudging of the de jure organizers .
He 's bootstrapped almost every monger group and Perl monger activity in France in the past decade .
His role as YAPC Europe Foundation ( YEF ) treasurer is relatively new , but he 's been on that board since 2003 and one of the few members that has put in real work to make the foundation work .
Michael Schwern
Schwern has been the force behind the rabid testing culture that 's pervaded Perl .
Aside from taking over maintenance of the basic modules that provide the framework that makes it work ( a technical achievement outside the purview of these awards ) , he 's traveled the globe advocating it , teaching it , and making it better .
He 's always the center of activity at a QA Hack - a - thon , where he 's involved in the consensuses that come out those conflabs .
The foundations he set has made Perl and CPAN the most widely tested codebase in the history of the known universe .
It ’s not what you expect but actually what you ’re kind of hoping for ; the visage of some peroxide blonde dominatrix look alike preening over the handlebars of a deluxe racing bike with the biggest scowl in the world on her face .
You move closer , past the faux but glamorous crowd and wait for the smoke to subside .
The truth is the smoke will never subside , because we have all entered the world of Talia Eisenberg ’s ‘ Motorcycle Mayhem , ’ and what ’s important here is that you laugh at the sartorial elegance and the scowl on the girl ’s face .
By the time we arrive at Heist Gallery ’s reception of ‘ Motorcyle Mayhem , ’ there ’s a bevy of littered bodies on the sidewalk , half intoxicated , most starry eyed and the grand spectacle of primed racing bikes blitzing in slow motion in front of a 60 foot great white shark called “ Izzy Gold ’s Fuck Machine . ”
Of course no one is fucking in the limo , but we do n’t think the idea has escaped half the people wandering in and out of the mobile cabana .
Part sartorial showmanship and part adulation for all that is fast , sexy , behemoth and symbolically glamorous in the world the installed and dynamic works of Tim Hailey and Milton Carter act as vigorous phallic icons stiff and rearing to go .
With four grand size ultra sonic racing bikes and a street closed to the public ( nay to the world ) the onlookers each take turns riding the stationary ‘ hard ons , ’ as much as the ‘ hard ons ’ take turns riding us .
From one direction we have uber photographer Peter Ruprecht glaring at us with his shoot from the hip photography style , from the other end we have our dear Keith Lew and from somewhere inside the great white shark we have Patrick McMullan and co snapping like a coyote at all the beautiful people frothing .
It ’s like coming to a motorcycle finale , and we are all primed to see who will come first , who will shoot the best and who will have the biggest scowl .

Spider - Man and Evil Dead director Sam Raimi has signed up to make a live - action film version of the fantasy - based computer game World of Warcraft , Variety reports .
Raimi , fresh from critical success with his recent return to horror , Drag Me to Hell , will take on the project after completing work on Spider - Man 4 , which is due out next year .
World of Warcraft is the world 's most popular massively multiplayer online role - playing game .
It is set in a medieval - style fantasy world called Azeroth populated by humans and such Lord of the Rings - style races as orcs , trolls and dwarves , but also the undead and blood elves .
Players must choose whether to join the nefarious Horde or the Alliance faction .
The Warcraft universe has developed a global following of more than 11.5 million monthly subscribers since its launch in 1994 .
The most recent expansion pack , Wrath of the Lich King , sold more than 2.8 m copies on its first day of release and more than 4 m in its first month .
" Warcraft is emblematic of the kind of branded , event films for which our studio is best known , " said Jeff Robinov , president of Warner Bros Pictures Group .
Raimi added simply : " At its core , Warcraft is a fantastic , action - packed story . "
Raimi should prove a popular choice for fans of fantasy .
He was executive producer of the long - running TV series Xena : Warrior Princess , and also indulged in swords and sorcery in the third instalment of the Evil Dead series , Army of Darkness .
Adaptations of similar fare have not proved successful in the past , however .
Big - screen versions of role - playing game Dungeons and Dragons and shoot 'em up Doom failed to convince the critics , while Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within was a huge box - office bomb in 2001 , taking just $ 85 m worldwide from a $ 137 m budget .
Inflammation and blistering may remove fingerprints A commonly - used cancer drug can make patients ' fingerprints disappear , potentially causing problems for foreign travel , a doctor warns .
One patient was held by US immigration officials for four hours before they allowed him to enter the country .
The case is highlighted in the journal Annals of Oncology .
The patient 's doctor , Eng - Huat Tan , from Singapore , advised all travellers to the US being treated with the drug capecitabine to carry a doctor 's note .
Dr Tan , based at the National Cancer Centre in Singapore , said several other patients had also reported loss of fingerprints on blog sites , with some also having problems entering the US .
It is possible that there may be a growing number of such patients .
They should prepare adequately before travelling to avert inconvenience
Dr Eng - Huat Tan
National Cancer Centre , Singapore
His patient , a 62 - year - old man , had head and neck cancer that had spread , but which had responded well to chemotherapy .
He was prescribed capecitabine to help prevent the cancer coming back .
Although the drug is commonly used to treat a range of cancers , it can cause chronic inflammation of the palms or soles of the feet , leading to peeling , bleeding or blistering of the skin .
Over time this can lead to the loss of fingerprints .
Dr Tan 's patient developed mild side effects , and because they did not affect his daily life , it was decided that he should keep on taking a low dose of the drug .
In December 2008 , after more than three years of capecitabine he travelled to the US to visit relatives .
Dr Tan said : " He was detained at the airport customs for four hours because the immigration officers could not detect his fingerprints .
" He was allowed to enter after the custom officers were satisfied that he was not a security threat .
" He was advised to travel with a letter from his oncologist stating his condition and the treatment he was receiving to account for his lack of fingerprints to facilitate his entry in future . "
Security measures Foreign visitors have been asked to provide fingerprints at USA airports for several years .
CAPECITABINE
Used to treat a range of cancers , including breast and bowel
One of a group of drugs known as the anti-metabolites
These stop cells making and repairing DNA Cancer cells need to make and repair DNA in order to grow and multiply
The images are matched with millions of visa holders to detect whether the new visa applicant has a visa under a different name .
It is uncertain when a patient will lose their fingerprints , and in this case the patient was not aware that he had .
Dr Tan said : " Patients taking long - term capecitabine may have problems with regards to fingerprint identification when they enter US ports or other countries that require fingerprint identification and should be warned about this .
" It is possible that there may be a growing number of such patients .
They should prepare adequately before travelling to avert inconvenience . "
Martin Ledwick , of the charity Cancer Research UK , said : " In a minority of cases , some chemotherapy drugs can cause hand and foot syndrome , where the skin can begin to peel on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet .
" For most people , this is reasonably mild . "

A total of six break - ins and thefts were reported to MSU Police between June 1 - 12 , amounting to at least $ 7.50 in stolen change , MSU police Sgt. Florene McGlothian - Taylor said .
The incidents have targeted women ’s restrooms in buildings across campus , including the Chemistry Building , Human Ecology Building and the Computer Center .
A heavy flow of break - ins and thefts from feminine - hygiene dispensers across campus led MSU Police to launch an investigation .
Thefts from feminine - hygiene dispensers have been spotty in the past , she said .
“ I ca n’t recall a time ( when ) there have been numerous ones at one time , ” she said .
“ Not those type of machines . ”
Nutritional sciences senior Sheena Patel said a person who would steal from a tampon machine must be desperate or bored .
“ I think that if you ’re going to steal something , you should steal it from someplace better than a tampon machine , ” she said .
“ It ’s got to be bad if someone ’s stealing from a machine in a bathroom . ”
Communication junior Kiersten Anderson said she thought it was ridiculous someone would steal from feminine - hygiene machines .
“ I guess I think when you need something , you need something , ” she said .
“ I think that ’s a pretty pathetic way to get money because I can’t imagine stealing from a feminine - hygiene machine could be very lucrative .
Going out and earning money seems to be more of an honorable and smart way of doing things . ”
Some of the machines appeared to have been entered with an unknown tool , McGlothian - Taylor said .
She did not know if the machines , which cost about $ 400 , would need to be replaced .
Police are unsure whether one person is responsible for all of the break - ins , but the incidents remain under investigation , McGlothian - Taylor said .
No arrests have been made , but police hope to catch the person or people responsible , she said .
This evening , Maryan Street 's Customs and Excise ( Prohibition of Imports Made by Slave Labour ) Amendment Bill went before the House for its first reading .
It was defeated 63 - 58 , with National and ACT voting against .
I am absolutely appalled by this .
Slavery is one of the worst human rights abuses on the planet .
Despite being defined as a crime against humanity in international law and banned in practically every country in the world , between 12 and 27 million people are still slaves .
Their exploitation is a US $ 100 billion a year industry .
This bill would have helped , in a small way , to do something about that - and by providing a positive example , might have encouraged other countries to take action as well .
It would have been in the best tradition of New Zealand human rights policy : acting , and by doing so , setting an example for others to follow .
But National and ACT did n't support it .
Oh , they made it quite clear that they disapprove of slavery .
But they were unwilling to actually do anything about it .
Edmund Burke once said that all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing .
National has helped evil triumph tonight .
Their votes supported the continuing existence of slavery as a blight upon the human conscience .
And that is absolutely unforgivable .
I can remember the appearance of the hills around Ramallah in 1979 , before any Jewish settlement came to be established there .
In the spring of that year I walked north from Ramallah , where I live , to the nearby village of A'yn Qenya and up the pine - forested hill .
A gazelle leapt ahead of me .
When I reached the top I could see hills spread below me like crumpled blue velvet , with the hamlets of Janiya and Deir Ammar huddled between its folds .
On top of the highest hill in the distance stood the village of Ras Karkar with its centuries - old citadel that dominated the area during Ottoman times .
I had been following the worrying developments of extensive settlement - building elsewhere in the West Bank and wondered how long it would be before these hills came under the merciless blades of the Israeli bulldozers .
I did n't have to wait long .
A year later the top of the hill was lopped off and the settlement of Dolev , then a cluster of red- tiled Swiss - style chalets , was established .
Now , more than 25 years later , Dolev has expanded and taken over the hills to its north for vineyards .
Numerous highways for the exclusive use of its Jewish settlers connect it to the many other settlements in the area and to Israel 's coastline .
Those settlers travelling to and from Israeli cities where they work can only see road signs indicating other Jewish settlements .
They encounter no Palestinian traffic on the roads nor do they see any Palestinian villages .
No wonder then that I was once stopped by an armed settler and interrogated as to why I was taking a walk in his hills .
When I asked him what right he had to be there , he answered : " I live here . "
He then pointedly added : " Unlike you , I really live here . "
Not a single year has passed since Israel acquired the territories in 1967 in which Jewish settlements were not built .
Had it pursued peace as assiduously , surely it would have achieved it by now .
Instead , whenever the US pressed for a peace initiative , the " proper Zionist response " was the creation of new a settlement .
The pattern of settling the Ramallah hills illustrates well the workings of this doomed policy .
The Jewish settlement of Talmon was established in 1989 on the lands of the Palestinian village of Janiya , when the government of Yitzhak Shamir was being pressured to agree to start negotiations with the Palestinians .
Talmon B was established , about two miles away , when the US secretary of state , James Baker , arrived in Israel two years later to broker the first ever peace conference between Israel and Arab countries .
At that time , Shamir dismissed the new settlement as " just a new neighbourhood " .
The signing of the Oslo accords under a Rabin government in 1993 led to the building of a road connecting Dolev to Beit Eil , running through private Palestinian land .
This winding road passed through the beautiful wadi linking Ramallah to A'yn Qenya , causing extensive destruction to the ancient rock formations and olive orchards along the way .
One rockface that I particularly miss used to be studded with cyclamens during the late winter months , coming down all the way to the spring – which was also destroyed .
The Israeli policy of speeding up settlement construction in the face of US diplomatic pressure shows no sign of changing .
Following the latest US administration declaration that Israel must impose a complete freeze on settlements , the country 's defence minister , Ehud Barak , declared last week the decision to establish 300 housing units in Givat Habrecha ( Hebrew for hill of the blessing ) , one of the 12 outposts near the settlement of Talmon in the Ramallah hills .
A few days later , on 29 June , he announced a further expansion of the illegal settlement of Adam , where 50 families are to move to a new neighbourhood located on a relatively large parcel of land outside the built–up area of the settlement .
This also violates the Israeli commitment in the road map agreement not to expand the area of existing settlements .
This demand for a freeze on new settlements – which is not accepted by Israel even temporarily , as one Likud minister underlined today– falls short of what should happen if a viable peace is to be achieved : a complete evacuation of all the settlements built illegally in the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 .
Some would say this cannot possibly happen , given that there are around half a million Israeli settlers living in the West Bank .
But who would have thought in 1962 that it would be possible to evict a million French Algerians who had been living in the country for almost a century and who represented roughly 9 % of the population ?
Until this happens , we will have a continuation of the present reality where there is a single apartheid Israeli state encompassing pre-1967 borders and the Palestinian occupied territories .
The sad truth is that when Israeli illegal settlements come to an end , as they must , Palestinians will not be able to undo the damage caused to the landscape by this massive , politically motivated development .
Morgan Stanley 's chief economist Richard Berner is not optimistic about the economy .
Economist declares ' train wreck '
If you thought last week ’s job numbers were bad , take a look at the latest from Morgan Stanley ’s chief economist , Richard Berner .
In a research note that ’s been making the rounds of economics blogs this week , Berner declares that “ America ’s long - awaited fiscal train wreck is now under way . ”

By “ train wreck , ” he means out - of - control federal budget deficits that he ’s sure will finally drag the economy under — as if we were n’t already feeling badly enough about its shaky state .
“ Depending on policy actions taken now and over the next few years , federal deficits will likely average as much as 6 percent of [ the gross domestic product ] through 2019 , contributing to a jump in debt held by the public to as high as 82 percent of GDP by then — a doubling over the next decade , ” Berner writes on Morgan Stanley ’s online Global Economic Forum .
“ Worse , barring aggressive policy actions , deficits and debt will rise even more sharply thereafter as entitlement spending accelerates relative to GDP .
Keeping entitlement promises would require unsustainable borrowing , taxes or both , severely testing the credibility of our policies and hurting our long - term ability to finance investment and sustain growth , ” he adds .
“ And soaring debt will force up real interest rates , reducing capital and productivity and boosting debt service . ”
“ Not only will those factors steadily lower our standard of living , ” Berner concludes , “ but they will imperil economic and financial stability . ”

INDIANAPOLIS 
The United States Swimming National Championships are serving as a stark reminder that while seasons change , fads fade and fresh faces turn tired , there remains one constant : Michael Phelps .
Phelps raced in two events Wednesday night that were part of his 2004 and 2008 Olympic programs  the 200 - meter freestyle and 200 - meter butterfly  and won both .
In the 200 freestyle , Phelps led from the start against a field that included three other Beijing Olympians .
His time of 1 minute 44.23 seconds was well off his world record of 1:42.96 .
An hour later , Phelps held off Tyler Clary in the 200 butterfly , an event in which he has held the world record since 2001 .
He was timed in 1:52.76 , missing his world mark by 73 - hundredths of a second .
In between Phelps ’s swims , Aaron Peirsol regained the 100 - meter backstroke world record he had held from 2004 until last week , when the Spaniard Aschwin Wildeboer claimed it with a clocking of 52.38 .
Peirsol , the two - time defending Olympic champion , took it back with a 51.94 .

There were strange goings on at the farm today when a flock of sheep made their own version of a crop circle .
About 100 of the woolly creatures formed an orderly ring - baffling the farmer and passers - by .
But after hearing the roar of the boss 's tractor the animals scattered like a group of naughty schoolboys .
Scroll down for more ...
Photographer Russell Bird , who captured the amazing scene , said : " I was quite taken aback .
I could n't believe what I was seeing , " he said .
" I did see a dog worrying sheep nearby beforehand and the dog ran off round the hedge in a different field , so I do n't know if they were discussing that . "
Bizarrely , he then spotted another circle three fields away , but was unable to take a picture with both " formations " lasting around 10 minutes before dispersing .
Estate agent Mr Bird added of the scene in Kington , Herefordshire : " They moved around inside and were almost filling the gaps in .
" The only reason this circle came to an end was that the farmer came in with a tractor and some food . "
Since the event he has been searching for an explanation but those experienced in working with sheep say Mr Bird could be disappointed .
Farm manager at Herefordshire College of Technology , Dan Seaborne , said : " I just think they 've been fed with dry feed in that shape - you can get snacker feeders now and you tow behind a quad and it drops pellets on the ground .
" I would imagine that 's what 's happened . "
He added : " I think there was a chap in Yorkshire who spelled out ' will you marry me ' to his girlfriend in sheep by putting feed down . "

The industry is playing catch up with Apple 's successful App Store
The market for mobile applications , or apps , will become " as big as the internet " , peaking at 10 million apps in 2020 , a leading online store says .
However , GetJar say , the developer community will decline drastically as each developer makes less money .
According to the Symbian Foundation , newly in the developer market , apps will become more personal and practical as their numbers grow .
The comments were made at the MobileBeat conference in San Francisco .
" Apps will be as big if not bigger than the internet , " according to Ilja Laurs , chief executive of GetJar , a leading independent application store .
" They will peak at around 100,000 by the end of the year .
That will be a tipping point and after that there will be a gradual fall in the rate of development .
" The full blossom will come in ten years and mobile apps will become as popular as websites are today with consumers , " Mr Laurs told BBC News .
' Economics '
While developers rush headlong to create applications for this burgeoning marketplace , Mr Laurs warned that many are simply doomed to fail .
" The reality is that this space is only so big and only able to support so many people .
Unfortunately the overhype that goes with [ Apple's ]
App Store is what has driven so many to rush to develop for the market .
It is fashionable to do apps and every media outlet tells you apps are cool .
Google believes the days of app stores are numbered " But the economics are a different story .
The ratio of those developers who will fail is about 90 % ; they will simply not make a return on their investment or make a good enough living at this , " said Mr Laurs .
He said that will result in developers taking their talent elsewhere and also slow down the rate of growth in applications .
GetJar acts as an application intermediary , distributing apps and helping its community of 350,000 developers make money from their work .
' Hit - driven environment '
To date , Apple runs the most popular application store with over 65,000 applications .
Last week it notched up another milestone with 1.5 billion downloads .
Its success was a shock both to Apple and the industry .
However , every smartphone company is trying to replicate it , from BlackBerry makers Research in Motion to the world 's biggest mobile phone business , Nokia .
Many at the MobileBeat conference in San Francisco felt that the popularity of Apple 's App store is also its Achilles heel because it caters to the " one hit wonder " model .
It is something social gaming company Playfish is well aware of with its iPhone app , " Who Has the Biggest Brain ? " .
" It has been played on the web by 15 million people and when it launched on the iPhone it went to the top of the iTunes chart .
But it quickly fell away and I think that 's an experience many people are going through , no matter the quality or originality of the content , " Playfish co-founder Sebastien de Halleux told the BBC .
The type of application you will see will help enrich your life ... which is really what mobile applications are all about
Lee Williams
Symbian Foundation
" You are competing for the top slot in a catalogue and you cannot , no matter who you are , hold onto that slot for an indefinite period of time .
Many developers are realising that its hard to reach a sustainable business in a catalogue environment because it's a hit - driven environment . "
Mr de Halleux said heated conversations are going on within the industry to solve this problem .
He also said he believed Apple wanted to find a way to help developers make money making apps that consumers want to use and pay for .
Meanwhile Lee Williams , executive director of the Symbian Foundation , said he was not sure the consumer or the industry needed any more application stores .
" The App Store is flawed - right now [ it ] is just a bucket of apps .
You need to get beyond that bucket and give the consumer the opportunity to wander down a really relevant aisle of content and applications that they can get access to .
" When this problem is solved , the type of application you will see will be about more than an iBeer drinking app or a candle that flickers in different colours .
" The type of application you will see will help enrich your life in some way .
It will let you do your image sharing , your social networking and establish presence with your friends , colleagues and family in completely new ways - which is really what mobile applications are all about , " said Mr Williams .
Fad At MobileBeat , organised by the blog VentureBeat , the issue of application stores seemed to dominate with conversations and panels on marketing techniques , turning apps into a real business and looking beyond apps .
Playfish titles are played by more than 25 million people every month But Google 's engineering vice president Vic Gundotra told the conference that the application store trend is just a fad and that the focus will shift to powerful browsers as the main mechanism for delivering services .
" Many , many applications can be delivered through the browser and what that does for our costs is stunning .
" We believe the web has won and over the next several years , the browser , for economic reasons almost , will become the platform that matters and certainly that 's where Google is investing , " Mr Gundotra told the conference .
But referring to technical problems at the conference , MobileBeat organiser Matt Marshall told BBC
News that scenario could be some time away .
" You saw at this conference that the web went down once or twice and that shows you that even the main web has problems so what about mobile ?
" When you talk about mobile browsers , that is the biggest change in the last year .
You have networks like AT&T , Sprint and Verizon all building out to the fourth generation and that 's going to allow much more power in delivering those web browsers pages on your mobile phone .
But it 's not here yet , " said Mr Marshall .

The Federal Government has now set its sights on gamers , promising to use its internet censorship regime to block websites hosting and selling video games that are not suitable for 15 year olds .
Separately , the Communications Minister , Stephen Conroy , has been nominated by the British ISP industry for its annual " internet villain " award , competing alongside the European Parliament and French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
Fallout 3 was banned from sale in Australia until it was modified to remove objectionable content .
Australia is the only developed country without an R18 + classification for games , meaning any titles that do not meet the MA15 + standard - such as those with excessive violence or sexual content - are simply banned from sale by the Classification Board , unless they are modified to remove the offending content .
So far , this has only applied to local bricks - and - mortar stores selling physical copies of games , but a spokesman for Senator Conroy confirmed that under the filtering plan , it will be extended to downloadable games , flash - based web games and sites which sell physical copies of games that do not meet the MA15 + standard .
Google to compete with Microsoft with new OS
Google is developing an operating system based on its internet browser , Chrome , which will available to consumers in the second half of 2010 .
In a post to its official blog late Tuesday , Google announced a new project called the Chrome OS which will initially be targeted at netbooks .
Promising the new operating system will be open source , lightweight and speedy , the company also pledges that it will “ start up and get you onto the web in a few seconds . ”
Chrome OS will be for people who spend most of their time on the internet and that it will be designed to eventually power full - size desktop systems , Google said .

Ensign used job as " leverage " to woo lover , husband says
The latest charge to emerge from Jon Ralston 's amazing interview with former John Ensign chief of staff Doug Hampton : Ensign pressured husband and wife to placate the senator 's enraged wife — and cover up his affair with campaign aide Cynthia " Cindy " Hampton .
Hampton suggested he might pursue wrongful termination action — and possibly a civil suit claiming the Nevada Republican and his representatives slandered him by accusing him of extortion .
The former aide detailed a world in which Ensign recklessly intermingled his private and public lives with few boundaries — telling Ralston that the senator ask him to quit in April 2008 , while allowing Cindy to temporarily retain her high - paying job as campaign treasurer .
Hampton complied — but only after being given an Ensign - orchestrated consulting contract with November , Inc. , a firm run Ensign 's top aide when he served as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee .
In what may be the most damaging charge of all — Hampton claims that Ensign dangled his wife 's campaign job as bait to pursue his sexual relationship with her .
" John uses that as leverage to contact Cindy ; she 's trying to get away from John , " he said .
" But he 'll leave messages like , ' It is about your job , it is about a work issue we [ need ] to talk about . '
Just being put in that position is a terrible position .
...
It is leverage ... very difficult to navigate ; our lives were enmeshed . "
Ensign claims the affair continued into August 2008 , months after Hampton claims it had broken up .
Ensign , Hampton claims , then paid " more than $ 25,000 " to Cynthia as " severance " out of his own pocket — an amount now known to be $ 96,000 paid by Ensign 's casino - owning parents to four members of the Hampton family .
He also maintains that Ensign personally paid Cynthia 's insurance to compensate for Doug 's loss of government benefits — all while continuing to pursue a sexual affair with Cindy Hampton .
Ensign has disputed Hampton 's account and has accused him of a million - dollar shakedown effort .
Some excerpts :
— " [ Ensign ] orchestrated the creation of November Inc. and me getting [ out ] of the state and getting out of his official office .
He told me , basically , at the same time he said , ' I 'm in love with your wife ' —
' You ca n't work with me anymore . ' "
— " He made you feel incredibly guilty if you were n't part of making this go down the way he wanted it to . "
— " I hope that the [ Senate ] Ethics [ Committee ] does a tremendous investigation .
... I would hope that the government would do some things as an employer . "

As our technological boundaries continue to be conquered and redrawn , there are some on the bleeding edge of innovation that seem to blur the line between technology and magic .
What Cambridge , Massachusetts based Joule Biotechnologies is claiming to have accomplished seems nothing short of magical : putting organisms , sunlight and carbon dioxide into a box and making a viable petroleum substitute appear .
No drilling , no burning off waste .
According to the company , that has been operating in stealth mode for nearly two years time , they are ushering in the new standard of fuel as essentially , liquid solar power .
“ There is no question that viable , renewable fuels are vitally important , both for economic and environmental reasons .
And while many novel approaches have been explored , none has been able to clear the roadblocks caused by high production costs , environmental burden and lack of real scale , ” said Bill Sims , president and CEO .
If correct , their plan can take two of the most abundant things on the planet — photons and carbon dioxide — and circumvent the need to be drilling more wells searching for oil .
Their “ black box ” is dubbed a Solar Converter , which reportedly uses proprietary organisms to induce photosynthesis , creating a hydrocarbon liquid the company calls SolarFuel .
Simms points out that this separates them from a biofuel process , like ethanol , which uses a plant base for its feed stock .
The prospect of sun fed fuel could impressively leap - frog the ethanol industry , replacing it as the renewable fuel of choice given that its carbon footprint could vastly outperform ethanol ’s much debated , corn - based and energy intensive process .
Eventually , such a model could propose to achieve the impossible : bring the use and production of our country ’s fuel to a level of stasis with the net input of carbon equaling the net output of its use .
Joule Biotech says they can create 20,000 gallons of fuel per acre at roughly $ 50 a barrel with current subsidies , certainly a competitive price point out of the box .
Furthermore , the fuel is purportedly going to be compatible with existing engines for diesel and gasoline , wiping out the potential snag of retooling an industry .
With a pilot plant scheduled to come online in 2010 , their next milestone could be a ramp up for commercial scale production in 2012 with additional investing .
Despite not knowing how cleanly the fuel burns in comparison to ethanol or conventional gasoline , the prospects of carbon improvement on the national scale are far - reaching .
So where is the downside ?
I had trouble finding one myself .
Though I have to admit that the claims bring to mind another magical fix that spawned years ago called Thermal Conversion Process ( TCP ) technology developed by a company called Renewable Energy Solutions .
Their process claimed to make synthetic petroleum from super - heating agricultural and industrial waste such as tires , plastics and paper .
The idea seemed attractive when they claimed their only by - products were fuel gas ( butane , methane , propane mix ) , synthetic oil and water .
The prospects seemed to offer a solution to not only our foreign oil dilemma , but a significant portion of our waste issue as well with ( similarly ) a virtually unlimited feedstock .
Unfortunately , it seems no new plants other than the pilot plant in Carthage Missouri have been constructed and for some reason , they have not catalyzed a new standard in fuel production .
Hopefully , we will be hearing much more from Joule Biotech in the near future .
Mercury , the closest planet to the Sun in our solar system , is regarded by many as a dead rock .
Not many people know that the small planet houses a very thin atmosphere , which should n't be there at all , if we are to believe theories .
With surface temperatures of about 450 degrees Celsius ( 800 degrees Fahrenheit ) during the day , and a gravitational pull of only 38 percent that of our planet 's , the tiny celestial body should , by all accounts and purposes , be unable to keep its atmosphere around it .
Unless , that is , something keeps replenishing it daily .
One proposed explanation is the fact that solar wind keeps pounding the surface of the planet .
In 1974 and 1975 , the space probe Mariner 10 discovered the fact that the planet has a magnetic field around it , similar , but weaker than our own .
However , this posed an interesting dilemma , astrophysicists say , because it's a known fact that the thin gas of electrically charged particles , known as plasma , which is emitted by the Sun constantly , in fact “ feel ” the magnetosphere , and are repealed by it .
This natural property of the magnetic field is one of the main reasons why life exists on Earth to this day .
But , in the case of Mercury , the shield would have made it impossible to explain that action of solar wind on the atmosphere , which is invisible to the human eye .
However , the sensitive instruments aboard NASA 's MESSENGER ( MErcury Surface , Space ENvironment , GEochemistry , and Ranging ) space probe can see it , and they 've discovered the only thing that could help bring the magnetic field theory and the solar winds one to common ground , namely the fact that magnetic tornadoes in the shield make it “ leak , ” as in get holes in it .
Through these holes , the solar plasma can easily permeate the magnetic field , and replenish the atmosphere below , despite large temperatures .
The way it does that is by crashing into the planet 's surface with such high speeds that it generates a bounce - back effect of atoms launching into ballistic trajectories above the surface , creating the atmosphere .
“ Mercury 's atmosphere is so thin , it would have vanished long ago unless something was replenishing it /
These ' tornadoes ' form when magnetic fields carried by the solar wind connect to Mercury 's magnetic field .
As the solar wind blows past Mercury 's field , these joined magnetic fields are carried with it and twist up into vortex - like structures .
These twisted magnetic flux tubes , technically known as flux transfer events , form open windows in the planet 's magnetic shield through which the solar wind may enter and directly impact Mercury 's surface , ” explains NASA Goddard Space Flight Center expert Dr. James A. Slavin , who is also a co-investigator on NASA 's MESSENGER mission to Mercury .
“ Mercury 's proximity to the sun only accounts for about a third of the reconnection rate we see .
It will be exciting to see what 's special about Mercury to explain the rest .
We 'll get more clues from MESSENGER 's third flyby on September 29 , 2009 , and when we get into orbit in March 2011 , ” the expert concludes .
Tony Scott is possibly the most modern director working in Hollywood today .
His films move so quickly , look so restless , and take place in a world so contemporary , you know that not only were they made in the last 12 months , they might actually have been made in the last five minutes .
Scott does n't care about posterity , he cares about right now .
But with his remake of The Taking Of Pelham 123 - originally a talky , character - based heist thriller from 1974 - he 's made a schoolboy error .
There are many ways to signify modernity in such a reboot - mention the fate of the Twin Towers , show an iPod , even have a flashmob party - but to have your leading man hunched over his laptop breaks one of the commandments of modern film : thou shalt not Google .
Hollywood hates the internet because it makes Hollywood redundant .
Hollywood is about action and LOUD , INTENSE DIALOGUE !!!
It is about confrontation and conflict , sexual frissons and personal interaction .
It is not about websites , Wi-Fi and Fatso The Keyboard Cat .
But in the new - look Taking Of Pelham 123 , after a promising opening in which John Travolta 's tattooed ex-con commandeers a packed subway train and kills a few commuters just to prove his hijacker credentials , our braying antihero is shown staring at his laptop all the time .
For reasons that will never satisfactorily become clear , he 's playing some sort of game with the stockmarket that will pay much higher dividends than the $ 10 m ransom he is demanding .
Whatever .
But it is a measure of the ubiquity of the internet these days that it 's really quite painful to see anyone actually using it .
Since the terrible 1995 Sandra Bullock conspiracy movie The Net , Hollywood has been surprisingly coy about the World Wide Web , using computer interfaces in reserve simply to move the plot along .
In the days of film noir , the telephone was a staple device , but the mysteries of a one - sided conversation ( " OK ... " Click !
Brrrrrr ... ) just do not translate in this world of SMS , email and Skype .
Indeed , the only true romcom of the WWW age remains
You 've Got Mail , a 1998 remake of a 1940 James Stewart vehicle in which two workmates who hate each other fall in love via pseudonymous emails , just as their predecessors fell in love via anonymous , handwritten letters - a cute formula that was nicely subverted in Miranda July 's Me And You And Everyone We Know ( 2005 ) , in which a sexually jaded gallery owner falls for the smutty chatroom talk of a little boy .
But there 's not a lot in between .
Emails do n't generate much emotion , and this was used to great effect in the 2006 French thriller Tell No One , in which a widower accused of murdering his wife receives a cryptic email , eight years later , showing the woman very much alive .
From here , though , the film reverts to type .
Though it starts in cyberspace , it ends with shootings and car chases , much like any American equivalent .
Because there 's only so much the internet can do , and for the most part these days , the internet is simply used as shorthand for research , replacing the old horror movie / thriller device in which suspicious parties visit the vaults of local newspapers to find out the details of past crimes , or pull out a book to investigate a hunch .
Even The Da Vinci Code , the most soporific " thriller " ever made - in which its star boards a double - decker London bus and says , in all seriousness , " I 've got to get to a library ... fast ! " - did n't bother wasting our time with much internet faffing , preferring instead to rope in some random youth with a WAP phone and a browser .
Indeed , although Ken Loach 's recent film Looking For Eric drew plaudits from largely male critics who were blinded by the sight of football superstar Eric Cantona walking and talking , sometimes even at the same time , not many noticed that the film itself was really quite a gimmicky step back for one of British cinema 's normally most nuanced directors .
Not only did it climax in a vigilante free - for - all which , in Cannes , had Quentin Tarantino punching the air ( a put - it - on - the - poster seal of approval for anyone else ) , but the film was bogged down by a happy - slapping subplot involving gangsters , camcorders and YouTube .
This might be Loach 's bid to stake some kind of claim on modernity , but it 's worth noting that even Hollywood has cottoned on to the fact that such modernity is anathema to drama .
How many films have you seen in which mobile phones are broken , do n't get a signal or run crucially out of juice ?
How many films have you seen in which a simple down / upload takes an excruciating amount of time while morally ambiguous character actors pad closer and closer ?
And how many films have you seen in which a code is refused , re-entered , changed and finally accepted in a font - size so big that even Mr Magoo would see it ?
Let 's face it , the entire Da Vinci Code could easily have been solved using a combination of Wikipedia , 192.com and Yahoo .
Another ghastly modern trope that The Taking Of Pelham 123 uses is the webcam .
In a nod to the growing phenomenon of " citizen journalism " , one of the passengers has conveniently left his laptop open , providing a live feed to his girlfriend , who takes it straight to the news networks .
Something similar worked pretty well for last year 's first - person - POV monster flick Cloverfield , but it 's perhaps no coincidence that the last time a computer webcam provided a major point in a mainstream movie was probably 1999's American Pie , which found a horny teenager trying to broadcast a live sex tape to his mates .
But even with its cyberspace trimmings , that movie degenerated into a plain , old - fashioned Hollywood morality tale , and by the final reel the webcam has all but been forgotten .
There are , however , exceptions .
Modernity can and has been used to great effect , in remakes too , and not just to emphasise the new " newness " .
DJ Caruso's Disturbia ( 2007 ) , despite its horrible title , updated Hitchcock 's 1954 classic Rear Window and largely succeeded , simply by placing its teen hero under house arrest .
Tagged and confined to quarters , this volatile kid becomes defined by what technology will and wo n't let him do : his electronic tag means he can't leave the front and back yards , but the denial of phone and computer shrinks his capacity for defence when faced with a neighbour who may or may not be a killer .
The same goes for Tony Scott 's own Enemy Of The State ( 1998 ) , a loose remake of The Conversation in which Will Smith 's hapless lawyer becomes a victim of a virtual assault that robs him of his identity .
In The Taking Of Pelham 123 , however , the use of wireless technology is crass to the point of embarrassing , taking great lengths to explain how Travolta 's character gets a signal down in the bowels of the New York transport system when , quite frankly , it would be more helpful to see Travolta 's character as anything more that just a two - dimensional psycho with a Vaio .
It 's worrying that , in 2009 , we 're expected to be distracted from the implausible dialogue , hollow special - effects action and lame plotting - all less convincing than they ever were in the ingenious 1974 original - simply because the bad guy 's got a laptop and a dongle .
A very poor show indeed .

Hello .
I am an independent writer developing a book about the grassroots conservative movement online , of which your site , Free Republic , is included as a primary online gathering place for conservatives .
Could you please tell me how the owner of the site feels about posts like this one : http://www.freerepublic.com/... ... in which conservatives who post regularly at the site make several racist statements about the 11 - year - old daughter of President Obama for wearing a t - shirt adorned with a peace symbol ?
Remarks included the following : " We ’re being represented by a family of ghetto trash . "
" Looks like a bunch of ghetto thugs .
A stain on America . "
" Looks like a typical street whore . "
" What we now are sending the ghetto over to represent us .
and if so who the hell is that flea bag who looks to be dragged from the trash dumpster . "
" you could go down any ghetto right now and see exactly the same . "
" could you imagine what world leaders must be thinking seeing this kind of street trash and that we paid for this kind of street ghetto trash to go over there "
" the world must be laughing like mad right now at that we have this kind of street trash in our white house . "
" Wonder when she will have her first abortion . "
" sad is n’t it that we now have ghetto street trash over there representing us in Europe . "
" This disgusting display makes me more and more eager for the revolution .
" They make me sick ....
The whole family ... mammy , pappy , the free loadin ’ mammy - in - law , the misguided chillin’ , and especially ‘ lil cuz ...
This is not the America I want representin’ my peeps . "
In addition , the thread includes a picture of Michelle Obama speaking to her daughter with the caption , " To Entertain Her Daughter , Michelle Obama Likes to Make Monkey Sounds . "
Before you dismiss this as only a minority of posters at the site , out of 100 posts on that thread I found only 1 that criticized such remarks .
This is not the first time I have seen such an exhibition of blatant racism at Free Republic by members who regularly post there .
Here are my questions : Does Free Republic condone this type of exercise in free speech ?
Are these the type of participants Free Republic is happy to have posting at its site ?
What is Free Republic 's policy about posting racially offensive comments ?
What is Free Republic 's policy about making sexual insinuations about minors ( particularly relevant in light of the David Letterman / Sarah Palin brouhaha ) ?
Does Free Republic believe its membership accurately represents the conservative movement ?
Does the owner of Free Republic believe this kind of discourse is helpful to rebuilding the Republican Party and furthering its goals ?
Thank you for your time , and I look forward to your responses .
I went back to the site today and saw that the offending thread has been pulled " pending review . "
http://www.freerepublic.com/...
I do note that Free Republic has a disclaimer on the first page that claims it does not condone this type of post ; however , I am not sure when the disclaimer was added .
Does anyone know ?
From the disclaimer :
Opinions expressed on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Free Republic or its operators .
Please enjoy our forum , but also please remember to use common courtesy when posting and refrain from posting personal attacks , profanity , vulgarity , threats , racial or religious bigotry , or any other materials offensive or otherwise inappropriate for a conservative family audience .
Free Republic is a site dedicated to the concerns of traditional grassroots conservative activists .
We 're here to discuss and advance our conservative causes in a more or less liberal - free environment .
We 're not here to debate liberals .
We do not want our pages filled with their arrogant , obnoxious , repugnant bile .
Liberals , usurpers , and other assorted malcontents are considered unwelcome trolls on FR and their accounts and or posts will be summarily dismissed at the convenience of the site administrators .
Free Republic does not advocate or condone racism , violence , rebellion , secession , or an overthrow of the government .
So , the site will readily delete posts from liberals just because they are liberals and therefore everything they say is automatically considered " arrogant , obnoxious , repugant bile . "
But comments calling an 11 - year - old black girl " ghetto trash " and a " whore " are pulled " pending review . "
What is to review ?
Your site either supports that kind of rhetoric or it does not .
Which is it ?
If the Free Republic 's " conservative family audience " consists of people who say such things as they often do ( like yesterday ) , how conservative are they ?
And how family - oriented are they ?
Where were all the posts from other Free Republic regulars or from the owner of the site decrying this kind of racism directed at a child for no apparent reason than the fact that a peace symbol t- shirt inflamed their hatred to disgusting depths , like a red handkerchief in front of a mad bull ?
Conservatives continually reinforce the fact that the only families they care about are conservative ones ; the only troops they support are ones that do not vote democratic ; the only children whose lives they value are the children of conservatives or unborn .
How many of those aborted fetuses they claim to hold so dear would they trash had they been born and grown into a pre-teen who wore a t - shirt with a peace symbol or supported a liberal president ?
Or was gay ?
The truth is that conservatives do not know the meaning of Jesus ' words despite how much they love to use them when it suits their inner hatred of all those who are different .
Worse , they lack basic human decency , as they demonstrate time and again .
**** UPDATE ***
The review is over , apparently , and they decided it was worth it to keep the article and comments .
Only now , they are making an effort to intersperse a few posts criticizing the remarks against Malia ; interestingly , these " Do n't say those things about a child " chastisements are almost uniformly alike .
Considering there were virtually none yesterday , and they suddenly appear only after the " review " following criticism here , it is pretty clear what the site is doing .
They are trying to create the impression that there really are people at Free Republic who decry that sort of behavior .
Let 's see if the comments have gotten any better :
That ’s a freak kid searching for attention .
We are now represented by the thug ghetto culture , are n't you proud ?
I ’ll probably get thumped for this , but this girl is showing signs of growing up into a beauty .
Wonder what kind of " teen " problems she will cause for the king and queen ?
Yes , because if one of Obama 's daughters is beautiful that must mean she is going to be promiscuous , too .
I never actually wnated to be a pistol before but .....
I have no idea what that means specifically , but it sounds pretty violent .
Or disgusting .
Black nail polish to go along with her nasty radical hair .
Using their children for that kind of shit is horrific .
But they did grow up in Rev.
Wright ’s church so what do we expect ?
Their entire family makes me want to vomit .
DIRTBAGS !
All of them .
Our WH is now a joke to the rest of the world .
We have no respect and this is not going to turn out well , mark my words .
We will be hit , and much worse than last time .
We are now seen as weak and vulnerable .
Ghetto and Chicago thugs have taken over the WH .
And quit picking on little Chacha & Malaria .
___________
LMAO !
Namecalling , that is always the mature route .
*** UPDATE II ***
Apparently Jim Robinson , owner of the Free Republic Website , has decided that ( 1 ) he should use my post as a fundraising opportunity to support the site and ( 2 ) he should make sure his conservative " troops " know they are being criticized so they tone down their true inner feelings .
http://www.freerepublic.com/...
He has reposted my original post , triggering a new round of comments :
From Jim Robinson :
Ca n't help myself .
This kind of crap fills my inbox every morning .
But the writer has a point .
We should steer clear of Obama 's children .
They can't help it if their old man is an American - hating Marxist pig .
And I 'm sure the left really means no harm to Sarah Palin 's children .
Thank God for the love and basic human decency displayed by TRUE Democrats .
Nice !
Does he even know what Marxism really is ?
I really would like to see all the posts he 's talking about where liberals trashed the minor Palin children ( aside from comments about 18 - year - old Bristol after she became a public spokesperson for abstinence ) .
Most of the comments I saw bashed Palin for the way she used her children , not the children themselves .
I do not recall any posts making fun of the way the Palin children wore their hair , for example .
That being said , it would not be a valid defense .
If your neighbor down the street robs a bank , the police will not consider that in your favor and exonerate you should you later rob a bank .
A comment from mnhering , who I guess does not realize the post was restored and more racist comments were added :
That just proves this site does n’t put up with crap comments like that if the post was pulled , while KOS not only keeps crap like that up , they encourage it .
It is n’t what was said , it is how the sites deal with it that shows the difference .
The comment was only " pulled for review " because attention was drawn to it .
This is what you call a " cover your ass " ploy .
That is the same reason Robinson is now addressing it , although the thread was restored .
Finally , if Free Republic wants to question whether I am a hypocrite , personally , I recommend they look at my comments about the offensive Huffington Post column that the author later took down on Palin calling for more " retardation " and my comments on Letterman 's jokes , which I said were in poor taste .
But a few points to make on this -- we are not the side claiming to be the bastion of morality .
There is also a difference between making a personally disparaging remark like the ones made about Malia and a remark about how Palin uses her children as props that does not insult the children themselves .
The one or two times I have seen someone make a remark here that was negative about Trig Palin , I and many others jumped right in and HR'd it out of existence and blasted the poster for it .
And why should n't we ?
I have family members with developmental disabilities or out - of - wedlock pregnancies .
I guess if they had more minorities among them or people with relatives who were minorities or simply people who believed in racial equality , they would have responded more negatively to the comments about Malia .
*** UPDATE III ***
I really cannot keep up with their indecision .
The first time it was pulled pending review by the " Religion " moderator ; now it is pulled pending review by the " Administration " or something like that .
Perhaps they cannot decide what they fear the most -- being called out for having this kind of diatribe or caving in to what they perceive as liberal pressure by removing it .
Either way , it was there , these are their sentiments , and the sad thing is , most of them are now only decrying the thought of picking on a child and not complaining about the overt racism in these comments they have made .
It is a sad place and reaffirms more than ever why I am not a republican .
Memorial Dedicated to The Victims of AA Flight 191
by : Remembering AA Flight 191
recipient : American Airlines , Mayor Richard Daley
May 25 , 2009 is the 30th anniversary of the Crash of American Airlines Flight # 191 .
Flight 191 plummeted to the ground shortly after takeoff from O'Hare when one of the engines flew off , severing the hydraulic system , rendering the plane unable to stop its plunge to the ground .
On that tragic day , 271 passengers and crew on the plane , and two people on the ground were killed in the ensuing explosion .
This crash remains the single worst aviation crash in US history .
Yet to this day , there is no memorial site commemorating the lives of the 273 people who perished that Memorial Day weekend .
We respectfully ask the State of Illinois , the cities of Chicago and Des Plaines , and American Airlines to embrace our efforts to erect a memorial honoring those who died on that horrific day .

We already noticed that the latest round of " Tea Parties " on July 4 in many places became forums for Mad Hatters and March Hares : far - right conspiracists and various extremist belief systems , including the " Birthers " .
Now Not Larry Sabato has a prime example from a Tea Party in Virginia , where a Republican legislative candidate named Catherine Crabill got up and said the following :
Crabill : [ Quoting Patrick Henry ]
" If war is inevitable , then let it come , I repeat sir , let it come . "
We have the chance to fight this battle at the ballot box before we have to resort to the bullet box .
But that 's the beauty of our Second Amendment right .
I am glad for all of us who enjoy the use of firearms for hunting , but make no mistake , it was not the intent of the Founding Fathers .
Our Second Amendment right was to guard against tyranny !
You have to wonder what Crabill will do if she fails at the ballot box .
Get out her bullets ?
This particular threat , voiced with these phrases -- that , failing " the ballot box , " people will turn to " the bullet box " -- has been around for awhile .
It was fairly common in use among militia leaders of the 1990s , and was often used as a kind of threat .
For instance , environmental leaders in western Washington were told : " If we can't get you at the ballot box , we 'll get you with a bullet .
We have a militia of 10,000 . "
More recently , a far - right " Patriot " named Greg Evenson wrote a piece last year , before the election , titled " The Choice is Simple : The Ballot Box , or the Bullet Box " , which warned that a massive roundup of American " patriots " was being planned :
I can find not a single bit of information to recommend to you that Barack O’Bama has the credentials , moral character , history , birth records , experience or constitutional knowledge to hold the office of president .
This nation and what is left of freedom is ABSOLUTELY doomed if this evil man and his minions are place in the Oval Office .
I implore you to consider your alternatives .
Do Not support or vote for this predator who feeds on freedom .
...
What came through was a vast list of standing orders and action units that are being funded and trained by Washington for use in this country for the near term .
The results will be disastrous beyond description if these measures are implemented .
They will turn the American people , who will by then finally be aware of their plight , into vengeful mobs .
All in the name of peace and safety , many police officers will implement the Illuminati ’s great master plan for the taming of America .
There is little that makes me more uneasy than glassy - eyed paranoiacs fingering their triggers nervously .
Right behind are the Republican officials and right - wing pundits who give mainstream legitimacy to their rantings .

Excellent !
But when will it ship ?
Announcements of announcements make gamers grumbly too .

Whether that announcement of new ... something for Left 4
Dead will placate the masses feeling slighted by the impending arrival of Left 4 Dead 2 we do n't know .
But Valve 's Doug Lombardi tells CVG that someday , somehow this whole process of shipping two games within a year 's time will all make sense when viewed from the mount of the grander scheme .
Lombardi also teases more Left 4 Dead 2 related announcements , presumably a doling out of details about new Special Infected types , new weapons and new campaigns .
Oh , and there will be a L4D2 demo , apparently , giving you the opportunity to go hands - on with that frying pan before November .
Left 4 Dead DLC announcement soon [ CVG ]

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -- Guaranty Financial Group Inc , the second - largest publicly traded bank in Texas , said it will probably fail after loan losses and writedowns left it " critically " short of capital .
The bank , whose investors include Carl Icahn and Robert Rowling , is in talks with at least one investor group for a possible recapitalization , said a source familiar with the situation .
The source requested anonymity because the talks are not public .
" The company believes that it is probable that it will not be able to continue as a going concern , " Guaranty ( GFG ) said in a regulatory filing .
The Austin - based lender has about $ 16 billion of assets and more than 150 branches in Texas and California , according to its Web site .
On that basis , if it were to fail , Guaranty would be the largest U.S. bank to collapse in 2009 .
Guaranty is about half the size of IndyMac Bancorp Inc , which failed last July .
So far 64 banks have failed this year , including seven on Friday , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
Friday 's failures include six bank subsidiaries of Security Bank Corp of Macon , Ga .
In a regulatory filing late Thursday , Guaranty said it has been unable to obtain new capital from shareholders , and believes it will be ineligible for help from U.S. regulators .
Its largest investors include companies run by billionaire Carl Icahn and by Rowling , whose investment firm owns the Omni Hotels chain .
Wo n't comply : Guaranty said it does not expect to raise enough capital to comply with an April cease - and - desist order from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) .
It said losses and writedowns have left it " critically undercapitalized , " with negative capital ratios .
Guaranty also said it has agreed to an OTS demand for the appointment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp as a receiver or conservator .
That appointment has not yet happened , but the OTS is exercising " a significant degree of control " over what had been functions of the board of directors , Guaranty said .
The company has not filed official results since the third quarter of 2008 .
It has estimated it lost $ 444 million in all of 2008 and another $ 256 million in the first quarter of 2009 .
Chief Marketing Officer John Wessman said in a statement that Guaranty is still working with regulators , and believes it can avoid disruptions to customers .
Guaranty 's largest investors include Rowling 's investment firm TRT Holdings Inc , which has a 19.9 % stake according to a regulatory filing .
A company run by Icahn has a 17 % stake , Reuters data shows .
Icahn and Rowling did not immediately return calls for comment .
Guaranty began operations in 1988 , according to its Web site .
It was spun off in December 2007 by Temple - Inland Inc. ( TIN ) , a corrugated packaging and building products company .
The largest publicly traded bank based in Texas is Dallas - based Comerica Inc. ( CMA )
Guaranty shares closed down 7 cents , or 32 % , at 15 cents on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday .
Their 52 - week high is $ 6.75 , set last Sept. 18 .
The “ S ” in iPhone 3GS stands for “ speed , ” but it could very well stand for “ slow ” if you look at the dated chip it uses for uploading data .
At Apple ’s Worldwide Developers Conference , the company proudly boasted that the new iPhone 3GS supports 7.2 M bps High - Speed Downlink Packet Access ( HSDPA ) — a faster , next - generation network standard that many carriers plan to adopt .
However , downlink only refers to download speeds ; the company made no mention of uplink speeds , or how fast users will be able to upload data .
That ’s probably because Apple did n’t want anyone to know that the iPhone 3GS contains a 3G chip with a surprisingly low upload speed — a Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systemchip High - Speed Downlink Packet Access ( UMTS HSDPA ) chip , one of the earliest 3G technologies that phones were using years ago , according to Tero Kuittinen , an MKM Partners telecom analyst .
A teardown by iPhone repair company RapidRepair revealed the UMTS HSDPA chip , whose upload speed is capped at 384 Kbps — significantly slower than its 7.2 M bps downlink capability .
A combination of a high download speed and a low upload speed was typical for most mobile chips two years ago , but today , most high - end smartphones offer 2 to 5 Mbps upload speed , Kuittinen explained .
Kuittinen believes
Apple purposely kept the uplink details of the chip secret to help its wireless partners .
“ Carriers are frantic on this issue of how to prevent consumers from overloading the mobile data without creating obvious obstacles , ” Kuittinen said .
“ They have to somehow clamp down on heavy mobile users without telling consumers they ’re being hamstrung . ”
When marketing their broadband services , carriers and internet providers typically advertise their downlink speeds and care little to highlight uplink .
And it ’s clear why :
The average consumer cares more about how quickly he or she can receive rather than give .
However , for iPhone 3GS owners , slow network uploading speeds will likely discourage them from taking advantage of one their phone ’s major new powers : video recording and sharing .
Then again , U.S. consumers typically are n’t keen about uploading video , Kuittinen said .
He noted that 90 percent of Nokia smartphone users do n’t use video - sharing features .
Video - sharing has been most popular among Japanese consumers , who tend to be more multimedia savvy thanks to the complex feature sets in their cellphones , Kuittinen said .
But a large consequence of slow uploading is that it stifles the iPhone 3GS ’ potential to make the rest of the globe more interested in mobile video , Kuittinen said .
“ How many people are going to spend 10 minutes uploading a 30 - second clip ? ” he said .
“ That ’s going to take real commitment … .
People are going to buy the device and only then are they going to figure out is basically undoable . ”
In a previous report , Wired.com examined the implications of Apple and AT&T prohibiting a TV - streaming application called SlingMobile from working on cellular networks .
Apple asked Sling to revise the app so it only works on a Wi -Fi connection rather than 3G networks , and AT&T said this move was necessary to prevent network congestion .
In that story , Ken Biba , founder of wireless consultant firm Novarum , said that after performing a stress test on 3G networks in the United States , it was clear that AT&T ’s network was overloaded .
“ The new iPhone 3GS is going to have a massive upswing of people uploading video , and it ’s going to stress both the downstream and the upstream network , ” Biba said .
“ When you begin to add video you ’re adding even more high congestion . ”
That upswing is already occurring .
Video - sharing site YouTube said in a blog post that uploads to YouTube were increasing 400 percent a day ever since the iPhone 3GS launched .
YouTube officials Dwipal Desai and Mia Quagliarello said video - enabled phones with streamlined video - sharing tools were driving 1,700 percent growth in uploads in the last six months .
In that story , Wired.com pondered what Apple and AT&T were going to do to address upstream traffic for the iPhone 3GS , a particularly popular phone with a very easy - to - use video - uploading feature .
Kuittinen called the slower chip an elegant solution for Apple and AT&T to avoid overloading networks with the iPhone 3GS ’ video - savvy powers .
“ It ’s kind of clever , I have to say , ” Kuittinen said .
“ This is more elegant than doing the capping from the operator .
Now that it ’s a hardware limitation , you ca n’t do anything about it .
You ca n’t call AT&T and say , ‘ Why are you slowing down the upload speeds ? ' ”
Despite his testing confirming that uploads are capped at 384 Kbps on the iPhone 3GS , Biba does not agree with Kuittinen that Apple purposely used this chip to appease to networks such as AT&T .
He said that significantly boosting the uplink capability would hurt the iPhone 3GS ’ battery life , which is probably why Apple opted not to upgrade the phone with faster uploading capability .
( Enough consumers are already complaining about the iPhone 3GS ’ battery life to begin with . )
“ We can talk about the future of doing video , but there are n’t a whole lot of people doing it , ” Biba said .
“ I doubt they did it for AT&T .
I think it ’s more power consumption . ”
Apple did not return phone calls seeking comment on this story .
AT&T declined to comment .
Why do you think Apple used an old chip in the iPhone 3GS ?

JURISPRUDENCE
Fire Proof
The New Haven firefighter is no stranger to employment disputes .
By Dahlia Lithwick
Posted Friday , July 10 , 2009 , at 6:50 PM ET
Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have announced that Frank Ricci , the firefighter who recently prevailed in his " reverse discrimination " lawsuit against the city of New Haven , Conn. , will testify at Sonia Sotomayor 's confirmation hearings .
Ricci has become a sort of folk hero for white men everywhere , having dared to stand up against the evils of affirmative action and race - based employment preferences .
Next week , he will be called on to make the point , as David Paul Kuhn put it , that Sotomayor , for all her talk of empathy and the real - world impact of judicial decisions , " demonstrated no empathy for the ' real - world consequences ' of affirmative action on Ricci . "
Ricci is invariably painted as a reluctant standard - bearer ; a hardworking man driven to litigation only when his dreams of promotion were shattered by a system that persecutes white men .
This is the narrative we will hear next week , but it somewhat oversimplifies Ricci 's actual employment story .
For instance , it 's not precisely true , as this one account would have it , that Frank Ricci " never once [ sought ] special treatment for his dyslexia challenge . "
In point of fact , Ricci sued over it .
According to local newspapers , Ricci filed his first lawsuit against the city of New Haven in 1995 , at the ripe old age of 20 , for failing to hire him as a firefighter .
That January , the Hartford Chronicle reported that Ricci sued , saying " he was not hired because he is dyslexic . "
The complaint in that suit , filed in federal court , alleged that the city 's failure to hire Ricci because of his dyslexia violated the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Frank Ricci was one of 795 candidates interviewed for 40 jobs .
According to his complaint , the reason he was not hired was that he disclosed his dyslexia in an interview .
That case was settled in 1997 with a confidential settlement in which Ricci withdrew his lawsuit in exchange for a job with the fire department and $ 11,143 in attorney 's fees .
In 1998 , Ricci was talking about filing lawsuits again , this time over a dispute with his new employer , Middletown 's South Fire District -- which had hired him in August of 1997 .
According to a Hartford Courant report of Aug. 11 , 1998 , Ricci was dismissed from the Middletown fire department after only eight months .
He promptly appealed his dismissal , claiming that fire officials had retaliated against him for conducting an investigation into the department 's response to a controversial fire .
A story in the Hartford Courant dated Aug. 9 , 1997 , has Ricci vowing " to pursue this to the fullest extent of the law . "
In August of 1998 , a state Department of Labor investigation cleared Chief Wayne S. Bartolotta of any wrongdoing in the firing .
The Aug. 3 , 1998 , letter from the state Department of Labor indicated that the case was closed with a finding of no violation .
" After a thorough investigation , it was determined that the South Fire District did not discriminate against Mr. Ricci . "
Ricci 's response ?
According to the Courant , Ricci contended " Their decision was political , it has nothing to do with who was right and who was wrong . "
He told the paper he would " pursue the matter in civil court . "
Ricci also tried to discredit his former boss , Chief Bartolotta , by disparaging his professional credentials .
His fight over access to Bartolotta 's professional training records was resolved between the two of them a week before the matter was slated to be taken up with the state Freedom of Information Commission , according to a Jan. 13 , 1998 , report in the Hartford Courant .
Eventually , Ricci made his way back to the New Haven Fire Department , where he famously aced his promotions test , then sued , yet again , in 2004 .
Ultimately , there are two ways to frame Frank Ricci 's penchant for filing employment discrimination complaints :
Perhaps he was repeatedly victimized by a cruel cadre of employers , first for his dyslexia , then again for his role as a whistle - blower , and then a third time for just being white .
If that is so , we should all be deeply grateful for the robust civil rights laws that protect Americans from unfair discrimination in the workplace .
I look forward to hearing Republican Sen. John Cornyn 's version of that speech next week .
The other way to look at Frank Ricci is as a serial plaintiff -- one who reacts to professional slights and setbacks by filing suit , threatening to file suit , and more or less complaining his way up the chain of command .
That 's not the typical GOP heartthrob , but I look forward to hearing Sen .
Cornyn 's version of that speech next week as well .
When Frank Ricci testifies against Judge Sotomayor , it will be worth recalling that under any other set of facts he would have looked to his GOP sponsors like the kind of unscrupulous professional litigant Rush Limbaugh lives to savage .
Is America 's conservative movement really ready for an anti-affirmative action hero who has repeatedly relied on the government to intervene on his behalf to win him -- and help him keep -- a government job ?
Was He The Culprit ?
by Paul Bass | June 29 , 2009 2:45 PM
Three of the Supreme Court justices who voted against New Haven in Monday ’s landmark firefighters case ruling zeroed in on one character they saw playing a nefarious role : the Rev. Boise Kimber .
In fact , Kimber ’s role as a New Haven politico , felon , and FOJ ( Friend of John , Mayor DeStefano ) ended up sparking a lively debate between the Supreme Court ’s conservative and liberal wings .
. . .
Justice Samuel Alito singled out Kimber in a concurring opinion to Ricci v. DeStefano , the case in which a 5 - 4 majority ruled that New Haven ca n’t ignore the results of a fire department promotional exam just because no African - Americans scored high enough .
. . .
From the start , the New Haven 20 — the one Hispanic and 19 white firefighters who sued to have the exams ’ results honored — argued that New Haven ’s DeStefano administration scuttled the test because of political pressure .
And they specifically mentioned Kimber in their lawsuit .
Rev. Kimber , a prominent vote - puller for Mayor DeStefano in past elections , sits on the Board of Fire Commissioners .
He played a vocal role at the Civil Service Commission in arguing to have the test results ignored .
Alito , in an opinion also signed by Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia , noted that “ even the District Court ” ( the lower court that ruled on behalf of the city in this case ) “ admitted that ‘ a jury could rationally infer that city officials worked behind the scenes to sabotage the promotional examinations because they knew that , were the exams certified , the Mayor would incur the wrath of [ Rev. Boise ]
Kimber and other influential leaders of New Haven ’s African - American community . ”
The opinion proceeds to present a three - paragraph attack bio of the good reverend , going back decades over terrain familiar to Kimber ’s New Haven critics .
. . .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who sided with the city in the case , takes on Alito ’s Kimber - bashing in a dissenting opinion .
She argues that Alito “ exaggerates ” Kimber ’s influence and his role in “ engineering ” the outcome .
She notes how Alito “ recounts at length the alleged machinations of Rev. Boise Kimber ( a local political activist ) , Mayor John DeStefano , and certain members of the mayor ’s staff . ”
She then points out that neither Kimber nor the mayor ’s staff made the call to disregard the exam results .
The mayorally appointed Civil Service Board , “ an unelected , politically insulated body , ” in Ginsburg ’s telling , made that decision .
She calls it “ striking that Justice Alito ’s concurrence says hardly a word about the CSB itself , perhaps because there is scant evidence that its motivation was anything other than to comply with Title VII ’s disparate impact provision . ”
And , she points out , the firefighters union — another politically influential group — was just as vocal on the opposite side as Kimber .
“ The real issue , then , is not whether the mayor and his staff were politically motivated ; it is whether their attempt to score political points was legitimate ( i.e. , non-discriminatory ) , ” Ginsburg writes .
“ Were they seeking to exclude white firefighters from promotion ( unlikely , as a fair test would undoubtedly result in the addition of white firefighters to the officer ranks ) , or did they realize , at least belatedly , that their tests could be toppled in a disparate - impact suit ? ”
Yale law professor Drew Days ( pictured ) said Monday that Ginsburg “ got it right . ”
Alito et al. made Kimber “ the main culprit in the story , ” said Days , who argued cases before the Supreme Court as President Bill Clinton ’s solicitor general .
But that ’s jumping to a unproved conclusion , Days said : “ Whatever people in New Haven might think about all this , the political process is rough and tumble .
If people do n’t like what the city does or is about to do , they make a lot of noise .
Is the city trying to make sure its constituents are being heard ?
Or are they pandering and doing something that is illegal to get political support ? "

Tomorrow the Senate Judiciary Committee begins hearings on the nomination of one of the country 's most experienced and respected federal Appeals Court judges , Sonia Sotomayor to replace retiring Justice David Souter as an associate justice of the Supreme Court .
How strong the opposition will be remains to be seen , but the ugliest , most reactionary and bigoted pustules within the Republican Party are marshaling whatever strength they have behind SJC Ranking Minority Member Jefferson Sessions , a lifelong confirmed racist
These people are representatives of truly the vilest , most hating , and most hateful people in the country .
If they can get away with the assault of ignorance and savagery they have the power to unleash , it 's unlikely to derail the Sotomayor nomination , but if they show any serious strength , they will not only defame an impeccably credentialed judge but create a poisonous climate for the next person nominated to the High Court .
As I keep pointing out , these are people with no regard for truth .
They are people who appear literally incapable of intellectual or moral honesty or decency , but spend their lives trying to drag the rest of society down to their level of spiritual degradation .
It has been obvious from the start that they do n't give the tiniest damn about Judge Sotomayor 's actual qualifications or even beliefs .
They guessed correctly that she is n't another wizard in the white - corporatist - supremacist tradition of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice " Sammy the Weasel " Alito , who got through their confirmation hearings by lying their heads off under the protection of the the Judiciary Committee 's then - majority Republicans .
The Republicans have done nothing but lie ever since .
They were never interested in evaluating Judge Sotomayor ; they were only interested in a desperate search for " gotchas " in her background .
What they came up with is so pathetic that they 're lucky they 're also incapable of shame .
The attack on her off - the - cuff comment about policy being made at the Court of Appeals level simply displays their total ignorance of the workings of American government ; it has nothing to do with " activist " judging , it 's just a fact .
( It would be helpful to remember that the " activist " judges today are the rampaging ultra-right - wingers on the Supreme Court : Roberts , Alito , and Justices Nino Scalia and Clarence Thomas . )
Her comment about bringing a distinctive perspective to the Court as a Latin woman is again the merest and most obvious statement of fact ; every Supreme Court justice brings his / her particular background to bear , which is why we need a diversity of representation .
Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as well as Justices Thomas and Alito made virtually identical statements .
And then there 's the Ricci case , in which the Supreme Court has only just overturned the Circuit Court panel opinion in which Judge Sotomayor sided with the majority , ruling that the city of New Haven was within its legal rights , based on existing law , to abandon the firefighters ' promotion exam in which no minorities received a passing grade and plan a future retest .
To Rush Limbaugh the Ricci case is proof that Sonia Sotomayor is a racist , but then , Rush Limbaugh lies for a living , and takes no prisoners .
No one of any legal competence has suggested that Judge Sotomayor or the rest of the panel majority were legally wrong .
They did their job reading the existing case law .
Now a bit of digging has turned up an interesting wrinkle on the Ricci case .
It appears that the intrepid Frank Ricci , to white racists everywhere the hero of this drama of vile discrimination against an oppressed white man , has amazingly selective contempt for anti-discrimination laws .
At this point , I 'm going to turn the floor over to Slate.com 's veteran Supreme Court correspondent , Dahlia Lithwick ( for links click through to the onsite post ) :
Our attention has been called to this interesting report by the 's Paul Bass in the wake of the Ricci ruling :

BOSTON - Massachusetts , the first state to legalize gay marriage , sued the U.S. government Wednesday over a federal law that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman .
The federal Defense of Marriage Act interferes with the right of Massachusetts to define and regulate marriage as it sees fit , Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley said .
The 1996 law denies federal recognition of gay marriage and gives states the right to refuse to recognize same - sex marriages performed in other states .
The lawsuit , filed in federal court in Boston , argues the act " constitutes an overreaching and discriminatory federal law . "
The lawsuit challenges the section of the law that creates a federal definition of marriage as limited to a union between one man and one woman .
Before the law was passed , Coakley said , the federal government recognized that defining marital status was the " exclusive prerogative of the states . "
Now , because of the U.S. law 's definition of marriage , same - sex couples are denied access to benefits given to heterosexual married couples , including federal income tax credits , employment benefits , retirement benefits , health insurance coverage and Social Security payments .
" In enacting DOMA , Congress overstepped its authority , undermined states ' efforts to recognize marriages between same - sex couples , and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people , " the lawsuit states .
The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted when it appeared Hawaii would soon legalize same - sex marriages and opponents worried that other states would be forced to recognize them .
It defines marriage as " a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife " and defines " spouse " as " a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife . "
President Obama has pledged to work to repeal the law , although gay rights activists criticized the administration last month after Justice Department lawyers defended it in a court brief .
White House aides said they were doing their jobs to support a law that is on the books .
Besides Massachusetts , five other states - Connecticut , Vermont , New Hampshire , Maine and Iowa - have legalized gay marriage .
This is the second lawsuit filed in Massachusetts challenging the law .
In March , the Boston - based Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders claimed the law discriminates against gay couples and is unconstitutional because it denies them access to federal benefits that other married couples receive , such as health insurance and pensions .
Arline Isaacson , co-chairwoman of the caucus , said the lawsuit is bold and important .
She said Coakley is the first attorney general in the nation to challenge the defense of marriage law .
" It shows a lot of leadership and creative legal thinking on behalf of the state , " Isaacson said .
" Not only is she using a leadership position to support equality for the gay community , she is also protecting the state 's right to treat its citizens equally . "
But Kristian M. Mineau , president of the Massachusetts Family Institute in Woburn , criticized Coakley 's move .
He said the federal marriage act has been upheld in the past by federal courts .
Mineau said Coakley is looking at higher office .
" We believe it 's a frivolous suit , " Mineau said .
" It 's obviously a political move by the attorney general . "
Dan Ring , staff writer for The Republican , contributed to this report .
Federal Communications Minister Stephen Conroy has rejected Opposition claims the development of the National Broadband Network ( NBN ) is in disarray .
The Government yesterday launched a report on its plans for the development of Australia 's digital economy , of which the NBN forms a crucial part .
The Opposition has claimed Government policy on the proposed network has not been properly developed and that the project has shown little progress .
But Mr Conroy says the Coalition is out of touch and has missed the point of having the network .
" After 11 - and - a - half years they had 18 failed broadband plans .
They are living in the past , " he said .
" Malcolm Turnbull said ' Oh , why do we need the national broadband network , I can download movies fast enough now ' .
" This is about a revolution in healthcare , this is about a revolution in education , this is about a revolution in the way that businesses communicate with each other . "
' Villain of the Year '
But there are growing concerns the Federal Government is promoting the internet with one hand while censoring it with the other .
Senator Conroy has just been named the Internet Villain of the Year at the UK's 11th annual Internet Industry Awards .
He beat other nominees including French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the European Parliament .
Judges said Senator Conroy earned the dubious title for supporting one of the world 's most ambitious internet censorship plans , despite significant opposition and evidence that it will hamper internet speeds and could block more than just child pornography sites .
" I 'm just sorry I could n't be there to accept the award in person , " he laughed .
Opposition communications spokesman Senator Nick Minchin says Senator Conroy 's latest award is well - deserved .
" This is the trouble with Labor ; they try to walk both sides of the street , " he said .
" On the one hand , Labor is saying ' Oh well , internet speeds in Australia are too slow and we 've got to spend $ 43 billion to have faster internet ' .
" At the same time , they 're trying to implement a policy to have compulsory censorship of the internet , which almost everybody agrees is almost certain to slow down the internet and result in over - blocking internet content .
" It 's an extraordinary policy that runs counter to everything that Labor says about the importance of embracing the digital economy . "
Members of the industry , such as Google 's head of geo products Raul Vera , are monitoring the Government 's movements nervously .
" We certainly believe in a free and open internet .
We 're waiting to see what the proposal , what the final plan actually looks like , " he said .
Senator Conroy says he expects to receive the results from nine ISPs which are currently trialing the internet filters in the next couple of months .
Meanwhile , despite laughing off his latest award , he is seriously downplaying any reservations about his plans .
" I do n't know why people are afraid of a test , " he said .
" I 've given an iron clad guarantee .
It is only refused classification . "
In a few days time Global Gaming Factory is supposed to have gathered millions of dollars in funding so they can acquire The Pirate Bay .
But according to Wayne Rosso , the former CEO of Grokster who was involved with GGF recently , this is unlikely to happen .
Meanwhile , The Pirate Bay is giving GGF a week before they cancel the deal .
Last month the BitTorrent community was shaken up when GGF publicly announced that it would take over The Pirate Bay and turn it into a legal outfit .
They said they would harvest computing resources from some of its users , money from others and pay off copyright holders and indeed some of the users with money from ISPs .
It was an incredible plan .
GGF painted a bright future for the site and two weeks ago Wayne Rosso , ex-CEO of Grokster joined GGF in their ambitious project , hoping to close some deals with record labels and get investors excited at their plans .
However , Rosso has already quit his position , claiming GGF ’s CEO Mr. Pandeya was not straightforward with him .
“ We decided that we ’re not going risk our reputation further , ” Rosso told Torrent Freak .
According to Rosso he and his partners never received the payments promised to them and Mr. Pandeya made several other promises he could n’t keep either .
“ The more time we spent with Mr. Pandeya , the less confident we were , ” Rosso said , adding that he feels the funding required to close the deal is not going to be raised based on the current lack of workable plans .
Not all was bad though .
The support and enthusiasm of at least one record label was something he had never seen before according to Rosso .
Unfortunately , it now seems that this enthusiastic response was based entirely on false promises .
“ I do n’t think there ’s going to be any money raised with GGF ’s current ( lack of ) plans , ” Rosso told Torrent Freak .
Besides Rosso and his partners , the people who were supposed to finance the acquisition were also misinformed .
When confronted with the news , a Pirate Bay insider said they would give GGF a week to get insurance from the investors , otherwise the deal is off .
Pirate Bay spokesman Peter Sunde told us that he does n’t know what will happen to the Pirate Bay in the future , when the deal is off the table .
Time will tell .
A UK man accused of flashing a female train guard has been cleared of all charges because of the tattoo of a lizard on his penis .
A female train guard accused 28 year old Barry Kenny of flashing his penis to herself and others while intoxicated on the train ride from Newcastle to Hartlepool .
But the woman had not mentioned anything unusual about Kenny ’s member .
Barry Kenny ’s attorney managed to get the charges of indecent exposure dropped after Kenny was allowed to expose himself in court for magistrates to see that clearly , his accuser would have mentioned the tattoo had she really seen him expose himself on the train .
Opinion
Dunbar at helm ?
Yikes
Some of us breathed a sigh of relief when the divisive , creationist ideologue Don McLeroy was ousted by the Texas Senate in May as chair of the State Board of Education .
How naïve we were .
If the chatter from some board members proves correct , and Gov. Rick Perry is indeed considering appointing member Cynthia Dunbar as the board ’s new leader , we may find ourselves reminiscing fondly about the good ol ’ days when Chairman McLeroy simply disregarded experts , sidelined teachers and insisted on inserting his religious beliefs into public policy - making .
Dunbar ’s shortcomings go far beyond ideology and poor leadership skills to beliefs promoting paranoia and bigotry .
This is the same Richmond Republican who penned an online essay shortly before the presidential election warning Barack Obama was plotting with terrorists to attack Americans .
She refused to retract her claim , even under pressure from Republicans .
Dunbar did n’t trust the very public schools she helps oversee with her own children ; she home - schooled .
And , in her recent book , One Nation Under God : How the Left is Trying to Erase What Made Us Great , calls the public education system a tyrannical , unconstitutional “ subtly deceptive tool of perversion . ”
Hornet ’s nest
To say the least , her appointment would go a long way in deepening the divide between the socially conservative faction and everybody else on the 15 - person board .
It would surely intensify the squabbling and solidify the state board ’s status as a national laughing - stock .
It would keep the emphasis of the board responsible for shaping curriculum for nearly 4.7 million public schoolchildren firmly on politics and culture wars instead of good public policy .
And just in time for a social studies curriculum debate , involving subjects like culture and religion , that could be just as explosive as the science debate .
Surely , no governor would willfully awaken such a hornet ’s nest .
Surely , Perry ’s pandering to far - right Republican primary voters in his gubernatorial race against U.S. Sen .
Kay Bailey Hutchison has its limits .
Perry must realize there are fine , Republican alternatives on the board who could turn the focus back to where it should be : providing a quality education for all public school children .
Bob Craig of Lubbock seems to be the best of these .
From everything I know of him , the 58 - year - old attorney who sent his son and twin daughters to public schools and served 14 years as a Lubbock school board trustee , seems to put the kids and teachers first .
And in every heated debate I ’ve listened to , he comes across as a fair - minded , thoughtful sort .
As The Woodlands Republican Rob Eissler , state House public education chairman , puts it : “ I think he does a lot of thinking before he does a lot of talking . ”
Craig , a devout Methodist , found his faith and his politics under attack after voting against efforts to dilute the teaching of evolution by requiring teachers to point out the “ weaknesses ” of Darwin ’s theory .
“ Religion ’s part of my life in every phase , so you do n’t exclude it by any means , ” Craig told me in a phone interview Monday .
“ But I very much feel my Christian beliefs can coexist and be intertwined with other scientific positions . ”
“ Religion ’s part of my life in every phase , so you do n’t exclude it by any means , ” Craig told me in a phone interview Monday .
“ But I very much feel my Christian beliefs can coexist and be intertwined with other scientific positions . ”
Civility lost
In the past legislative session , he supported efforts to transfer management of the multibillion - dollar Permanent School Fund from a bunch of politicians on the education board , whose financial expertise varies widely , to a separate panel of financial experts .
Why ?
“ It ’s the right thing to do , ” Craig said .
After Dunbar ’s essay on Obama , Craig , who had voted for Republican Sen .
John McCain , penned a response to her and other board members explaining calmly why he disagreed : “ He is not a terrorist , ” Craig told me .
“ Nor do I believe he wants to destroy the values of the United States . ”
Craig said a comment from a friend , Texas Tech Chancellor Kent Hance , stuck in his mind as he wrote the letter : something about how we often lose civility in the politics of today .
If chosen by Perry , Craig told me he ’d focus on bringing the board together , and also giving experts and teachers an open line of communication :
Asked how he ’d continue to do the right thing under great political pressure , he said simply : ” I hope that the Republican Party is broad enough and inclusive enough that you can look at different perspectives and different points of view , and not just be narrow - minded . ”
We ’ll see .

In many states , eligibility expansions have passed with solid bipartisan support .
In one of her final acts as governor of Kansas in April , Ms. Sebelius , a Democrat , signed a two - year expansion worth $ 4.4 million that had been approved by her overwhelmingly Republican Legislature .
The broadening of eligibility has made a profound difference for parents like Vicky and Dewayne McIntyre of Yakima , Wash .
When their state lifted the income cutoff for its program to 300 percent of the federal poverty level ( or $ 54,930 for their family of three ) from 250 percent ( or $ 45,775 ) , the McIntyres learned that their 8 - year - old daughter , Sarah , had become eligible for the first time .
Sarah , who endured lung surgery at 3 and heart surgery at 6 and now has asthma , had been uninsured for a year .
“ We were into credit card debt and payday loans , ” said Ms. McIntyre , 41 , who works part time in a store to supplement her husband ’s income as a welder .
“ Her medicine at one point was $ 880 a month , and we had to pay cash , so we were struggling .
It is such a relief now that I can just take her to the doctor if I need to and get her medicine . ”
The federal legislation , which extended the program through 2013 , provided $ 32.8 billion in new financing over that period , paid with an increase in tobacco taxes .
On the day Mr. Obama signed the bill , calling it a “ down payment ” on universal coverage , he also rescinded a Bush administration directive that effectively made it impossible for states to raise their eligibility limits above 250 percent of the poverty level .
The new law allows states to provide coverage to children from families living at up to three times the poverty level .
States can set thresholds higher if they wish , but will be reimbursed by the federal government at a lower rate  the same paid for Medicaid recipients .
A primary incentive for states to expand coverage is that Washington , on average , pays 70 percent of the cost of CHIP , compared with only 57 percent for Medicaid .
Some states , including New York and New Jersey , were already enrolling children above three times the poverty level , but the federal legislation and the rescinding of the Bush directive made it possible for about 40 states to broaden eligibility .
The reauthorization of CHIP concluded a bruising two - year political battle .
President George W. Bush twice vetoed Democratic measures to expand the program in 2007 , depicting the legislation as a stalking horse for government - run health care .
Congressional Democrats sustained it through temporary extensions and took full political advantage of Mr. Bush ’s stance during the 2008 campaign .
Newly minted M.B.A.s graduating into a bleak economy are struggling to find work as recruiters cut back their presence on campuses , trim salaries and sharply reduce the number of job offers they are making , students and program administrators said .
Students who filled out school applications in the final months of a boom and started class in the midst of the financial meltdown last autumn are trying to get their footing in a business world that has changed dramatically since they left it .

Carnegie Mellon Researchers Find Social Security Numbers
Can Be Predicted from Publicly Available Information
PITTSBURGH — Carnegie Mellon University researchers have shown that public information readily gleaned from governmental sources , commercial data bases , or online social networks can be used to routinely predict most — and sometimes all — of an individual 's nine - digit Social Security number .
Project lead Alessandro Acquisti , associate professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon 's H. John Heinz III College , and Ralph Gross , a post - doctoral researcher at the Heinz College , have found that an individual 's date and state of birth are sufficient to guess his or her Social Security number with great accuracy .
The study findings will appear this week in the online Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science , and will be presented on July 29 at the BlackHat 2009 information security conference in Las Vegas .
Additional information about the study and some of the issues it raises is available at http://www.ssnstudy.org.
The predictability of Social Security numbers is an unexpected consequence of seemingly unrelated policies and technological developments that , in combination , make Social Security numbers obsolete for authentication purposes , according to Acquisti and Gross .
Because many businesses use Social Security numbers as passwords or for other forms of authentication — a use not anticipated when Social Security was devised in the 1930s — the predictability of the numbers increases the risk of identity theft .
ID theft cost Americans almost $ 50 billion in 2007 alone .
The Social Security Administration could mitigate this vulnerability by assigning numbers to people based on a randomized scheme , but ultimately an alternative means of authenticating identities must be adopted , the authors conclude .
" In a world of wired consumers , it is possible to combine information from multiple sources to infer data that is more personal and sensitive than any single piece of original information alone , " said Acquisti , a researcher in the Carnegie Mellon CyLab .
Information that once was useful to make public may now be too available .
An example is the Social Security Administration 's Death Master File , a public database with Social Security numbers , dates of birth and death , and states of birth for every deceased beneficiary .
Its purpose is to prevent impostors from assuming the Social Security numbers of deceased people .
But Acquisti and Gross found that analyzing the death file enabled them to detect statistical patterns that would help them predict Social Security numbers of the living .
These statistical patterns can help narrow guesses of an individual 's Social Security number , when combined with that person 's date and state of birth .
Birth information can be obtained from various sources , including commercial databases , public records ( such as voter registration lists ) and the millions of profiles that people publish about themselves on social networks , personal Web sites and blogs .
The statistical patterns and the birth information can be used to predict Social Security numbers because the Social Security Administration 's methods for assigning numbers , based in part on geography , are well - known .
For most individuals born nationwide since 1989 , Social Security numbers are assigned shortly after birth , making those numbers easier to predict .
Acquisti and Gross tested their prediction method using records from the Death Master File of people who died between 1973 and 2003 .
They could identify in a single attempt the first five digits for 44 percent of deceased individuals who were born after 1988 and for 7 percent of those born between 1973 and 1988 .
They were able to identify all nine digits for 8.5 percent of those individuals born after 1988 in fewer than 1,000 attempts .
Their accuracy was considerably higher for smaller states and recent years of birth : for instance , they needed 10 or fewer attempts to predict all nine digits for one out of 20 SSNs issued in Delaware in 1996 .
Sensitive details of the prediction strategy were omitted from the article .
" If you can successfully identify all nine digits of an SSN in fewer than 10 , 100 or even 1,000 attempts , that Social Security number is no more secure than a three - digit PIN , " the authors noted .
When the researchers tested their method using birth dates and hometowns that students had self - reported on popular social networking sites , the results were almost as good despite the inaccuracies typical of social network data .
Enrollment records were used to confirm the accuracy of the predictions , though the researchers did not receive confirmation of any individual Social Security number , but only aggregate measures of accuracy .
" Dramatically reducing the range of values wherein an individual 's Social Security number is likely to fall makes identity theft easier , " Gross said .
A fraudster who knows just the first five digits of an individual 's number might use a phishing email to trick the person into revealing the last four digits .
Or , a fraudster could use networks of compromised computers , or " botnets , " to repeatedly apply for credit cards in a person 's name until hitting the correct nine - digit sequence .
Future Social Security numbers could be made more secure by switching to a randomized assignment scheme , but protecting people who already have been issued numbers is harder , the researchers said .
Given the ease with which Social Security numbers can be predicted - particularly the first five digits and particularly for the millions of Americans born since 1988 - legislative and policy initiatives aimed at removing the numbers from public exposure , or redacting their first five digits , may be well - meaning but misguided , Acquisti added .
" Given the inherent vulnerability of Social Security numbers , it is time to stop using them for verifying identities and redirect our efforts toward implementing secure , privacy - preserving authentication methods , " Acquisti said .
Methods to consider include two - factor authentication , similar to the PIN number / card combinations used for bank accounts , and digital certificates .
Students Ioanis Alexander Biternas , Ihn Aee Choi , Jimin Lee and Dhruv Deepan Mohindra assisted Acquisti and Gross in the study .
The Heinz College ( http://www.heinz.cmu.edu) includes the School of Information Systems and Management and the School of Public Policy and Management and its faculty and students bring expertise to bear on issues of information security and policy and information systems , as well as public policy , arts and health care management .
The National Science Foundation , the U.S. Army Research Office , Carnegie Mellon CyLab , the Berkman Faculty Development Fund and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center provided support for this research .

The two Big Media companies with the worst reputations for both underpaying its employees and pennypinching everyone else are the Walt Disney Co and News Corp .
So it continually outrages me how both these corporations overpay their top two bosses .
Disney CEO Bob Iger ranks # 3 among the 10 highest - paid CEOs for 2008 at Standard & Poor ’s 500 companies , earning $ 51.1 M .
( And let ’s not forget his “ Golden Coffin ” . )
Now News
Corp ’s filings with the SEC show it ’s throwing money at its new Vice Chairman , President and COO Chase Carey just like it did President / COO Peter Chernin .
Carey will receive a salary of $ 8.1 M a year , which nearly quadruples the base pay he received as CEO of DirecTV .
He also received a baseball - like $ 10 M cash signing bonus and use of the corporate or a chartered jet for business and pleasure .
Plus , he ’s eligible for an annual performance - based bonus of as much as $ 25 million .
Oh , and did I mention that News Corp stock has declined 38 % in the past year ?
By contrast , DirecTV paid Carey a base salary of $ 2.3 M last year and his total compensation including stock options was $ 13 M .
Meanwhile PaidContent.org says Slingbox co-founder Blake Krikorian is up for the DirecTV job .
Minnesota 's financially - battered state officials can take comfort , however cold , that they have a lot of company .
A new report by the National Governors Association shows that state budgets nationwide are hemorrhaging red ink , with little , if any , relief anywhere in sight .
The bottom line in the association 's July grim assessment : " The 50 states are facing one of the worst fiscal periods in decades .
Fiscal conditions deteriorated for nearly every state during fiscal year 2009 , and weak fiscal conditions are expected to continue " into as late as 2012 .
And because the states ' financial conditions have historically lagged behind the overall national economy , any recovery from the recession will only belatedly be felt in states ' budgets , the report found .
While federal stimulus money that flowed into state budgets , including Minnesota , earlier this year " helped states avoid draconian levels of cuts , " it amounts to a one - time cash infusion that can't be used to stave off future budget cuts , according to the report .
At the end of the fiscal year on June 30 , taxes on sales and income had plummeted in Minnesota and 45 other states , the report found .
Gov.
Tim Pawlenty 's decision to forego tax increases and unilaterally chop the budget to cope with the state 's $ 2.7 billion deficit puts him in the minority among the states .
Twenty - nine states have enacted tax increases in an attempt to raise nearly $ 24 billion in new revenue .
The report also provides a snapshot that shows just how close to the bone Minnesota 's state budget is operating :
It 's one of 16 states where year - end balances amounted to less than 5 percent of total expenditures .
And the report found that in the current fiscal year , Minnesota 's general fund spending is projected to drop an estimated 11 percent -- more than in all but five other states .
The US government 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has released a report that looks at the effects that global climate change will have on the United States .
Entitled Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States , it draws material from 13 US government science agencies .
The report is meant to be one that can be used by anyone — policymakers , school teachers , and people in industry and business .
Eschewing the scientific terminology that is omnipresent in peer - reviewed science , the report uses everyday language to describe the effects that global climate change will have on various parts of the US and what can be done to minimize those risks .
In general , its authors ' conclusion is that the earlier we start changing , the less severe and shorter - lived the final impact of climate change will be .
This report is not out to rehash old arguments about the issue , as its opening sentences demonstrate : " Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal .
The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human - induced emissions of heat - trapping gases . "
From there on out , the report focuses primarily on what will happen in the United States while highlighting current and potential responses to these changes .
Before the body of the report begins , a series of ten key findings are presented :
Global warming is unequivocal and primarily human - induced
Climate changes are underway in the United States and are
projected to grow
projected to grow Widespread climate - related impacts are occurring now and
are expected to increase

Crop and livestock production will be increasingly
challenged
challenged Coastal areas are at increasing risk from sea - level rise
and storm surge
and storm surge Risks to human health will increase
Climate change will interact with many social and
environmental stresses
environmental stresses
Thresholds will be crossed , leading to large changes in
climate and ecosystems
climate and ecosystems
Future climate change and its impacts depend on choices
made today
Under each bullet point , there 's a short synopsis along with the index of the pages where more details can be found .
What 's happening
The report then turns to a summary of the current scientific understanding of global climate change .
Since the report is written for those who do not necessarily have a scientific background , it is a good , high - level introduction to current knowledge .
They acknowledge the immense amounts of work put into the IPCC reports , along with that carried out by the US Climate Change Science Program , and state that they used these findings , and only provide a brief synthesis to integrate the latest data .
In this overview , they introduce what greenhouse gases are , the difference between human and natural influences , examine the influence of solar output on the climate , and discuss a few emission scenarios .
For anyone who has kept up to date with the science of the field , this is all old hat , but they 're probably not the intended audience .
In an effort to make itself useful to as many people as possible , the report seeks to break down the results into small chunks , so that individuals with different needs can find the relevant sections with ease .
The authors also mention a number of phenomena currently observed in the United States that are a direct result of this global picture .
From increased frequency and intensity of rainfall in the Northeast , to longer ice - free periods on lakes , to the fact that , since 1978 , the average winter temperature in the Midwest and Northern Great Plains has risen 7 �F .
The text highlights seven sectors that will be its primary focuses : water resources , energy supply and use , transportation , agriculture , ecosystems , human health , and society .
Each sector 's section is approximately ten pages long and , for those who can't be bothered to read ten pages , it has a seven or eight bullet point list of the major effects at the start of each section .
Breaking things down further , the report describes differences among nine US geographical regions .
The regions are the Northeast , Southwest , Midwest , Great Plains , Southwest , Northwest , Alaska , the Islands , and the Coasts .
For the Northeast , the report briefly discusses the role that its current climate has played in the character and economy of the region .
The first page of the section graphically displays how increasing temperatures will make summers in New Hampshire feel over the next century by moving the state southward under two different emission scenarios .
In the Southwest , the report graphically highlights the number of days that are to be expected to be over 90�F , comparing the observed values between 1961 and 1979 to the predicted values between 2080 and 2099 .
In a similar fashion , the change in the number of days that reached freezing are displayed for the period between 1976 and 2007 .
What we might do
Within these sections , some of the adaptations to climate change that are already in progress are discussed .
So , for example , the authors describe work being done to cope with flooding and storm surges , such as the increased levee system around New Orleans .
They also highlight the Deer Island sewage treatment plant in Boston as an example of taking future changes in sea level into account for buildings today .
The plant was built high enough to compensate for the sea levels expected in 2050 , when it should reach the end of its usable life span .
Discussion of these adaptation measures , which seek to improve our ability to cope with the changes that do occur , are joined by a consideration of mitigation measures , where we reduce the effects of climate change .
A major theme throughout the report is that early mitigation will result in a decreased need for adaptation in the long run .
The authors consider a number of examples of actions currently being carried out by the private and public sectors , but the paper does not evaluate any specific mitigation technology .
Early on , the authors state that " there is currently insufficient peer - reviewed information to evaluate the practicality , effectiveness , costs , or benefits of these [ mitigation ] measures , highlighting a need for research in this area . "
The report concludes with a set of six recommendations .
First , it suggests that we expand our understanding of climate change impact — more research in a wide variety of field is needed to get a clearer picture of the impacts of climate change on the world and within the US .
It calls for a refined ability to project climate change into the future and predict extreme events at local scales , along with an improved understanding of thresholds that are likely to contribute to abrupt changes in the climate .
On the engineering side , the authors recommend improvement in our understanding of mitigation technologies as well as any unintended consequences of these strategies .
As for the human factor , it argues for a deeper understanding of how well society can adapt to climate change — clearly we can adapt to slow changes , but now - defunct civilizations show that rapid change can wreck entire cultures in short order .
Finally , the authors make a suggestion I strongly agree with : we need to ensure that those who are making decisions and the public at large are aware of the science behind what is happening .
People 's capacity to make decisions should be based on sound research , not sound bites .
Overall , the message is simple .
Climate change is real , and it is causing changes in the United States today .
The earlier we , as a society , implement mitigation processes and strategies , the less we will need to continue paying for adaptation strategies decades and centuries down the road .

Last night on his FNC show The O’Reilly Factor host Bill O’Reilly claimed that Michael Jackson was n’t an African American icon because he bleached his skin and has white children .
O’Reilly asked , “ If he is such a black American icon , why did he have his kids with white men ? ”
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :

Bill O’Reilly said , “ There is an old saying you ca n’t choose your family and it ’s true .
The family of Michael Jackson honored his memory today in Los Angeles , and I do not wish to intrude on that .
They are entitled to grieve any way they want , but Michael Jackson ’s place in America is a legitimate topic of discussion and talking points is just about fed up with all the adulation .
It is basically grandstanding and pathetic in the extreme .
Yes the man was an all star entertainer , but that it , so enough with the phony platitudes ok ? ”
Then O’Reilly really got into his attack , “ The truth is that Jackson ’s interaction with children were unacceptable for any adult .
His incredible selfishness , spending hundreds of millions of dollars on himself while singing we are the world , should make any clear thinking American nauseous , and why are Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton making this a racial deal ?
Jackson bleached his own skin , and then chose white men to provide existence for his in vitro children . ”
O’Reilly later debated Marc Lamont Hill and asked , Okay , then why is he being held up by the African - American community as a pillar of black America when he blanches his skin ?
… But answer me this , if he is such a black American icon , why did he have his kids with white men ?
He then made a made a judgment for all African Americans by saying , “ You do n’t become an African - American icon when you do something like that . ”
While I agree that the Jackson coverage got went way over the top , O’Reilly ’s claim that he is fit to pass judgment about who gets icon status is a bit hypocritical to say the least .
Has Bill forgotten about the sexual harassment suit brought against him by a former staffer that claimed that the host spoke , to her , “ about sexual fantasies , masturbation and vibrators while sometimes seeming to pleasure himself . ”
By the way , O’Reilly settled the case out of court for $ 2 million .
Once again , O’Reilly ’s racism is showing .
How is it relevant that Jackson bleached his skin , or that his kids are white ?
People are free to think whatever they want about Jackson .
I do n’t think that the color of his children ’s skin has anything to do with it one way or the other .
One can question media overkill on this story , but let ’s leave the kids out of this .
I 'm cutting through the dark on a skinny two - lane side road north of Pescadero , Calif. , roof stowed , arms jerking wildly around a tiny , non-assisted steering wheel as turn after blind turn fades into vision .
It 's so quiet , I can hear the tall grass nipping at the carbon fiber fenders as the little two - seater claws out of the curve and dives into the next .
I should be in auto nirvana -- the road 's empty , there 's no posted speed limit .
But I 've got other thoughts , like how badly I want a Baja - style headlight bar bolted atop this $ 122,000 Tesla Roadster .

What about AIDS and pregnancy ?
We have to get a new AIDS test every thirty days .
We cannot work without a certified copy of our test results present at the set where we are working , and they are photocopied at every shoot and kept on file with a copy of 2 forms of ID .
Since we tend to only date and sleep with other people within our industry , we are actually probably one of the safest groups around .
How often do you guys swap AIDS tests before having sex with someone you meet at a bar or club ?
As for pregnancy , most of the girls are on the pill , but others use diaphragms or condoms .
Risk of pregnancy is also lessened by the fact that the guy 's cum shots are always external .

What 's it like on a porno set ?
Very professional .
It 's just a job for us , and everyone 's jaded from seeing every possible sex act shot a million different ways , so it 's no big deal .
There 's no screwing in the closets , no orgys , nothing like that .
The eroticism is lost when they cut because the anal scene was getting messy , the guy 's knees are getting rugburn , the girl just started her period ...
I 'm amazed the male star can keep a hardon with some of the stuff that happens on set !
The days are long ( 14 - 18 hours ) , and shooting several days back to back is extremely exhausting , so everyone grabs a nap whenever they can .
Spending so many hours together day in and day out does let you see what people are really like , and it 's interesting to see who 's still nice at 4 am after five 18 - hour days ...

Why did you get a boob job ?
I held off on getting my boobs done for a long time , because I know a lot of you love natural boobs , but then I started working out and losing weight , which made my boobs get really small and droopy .
Ew !
I still held out , ' cause I was scared about the surgery stuff , but once I could n't stand to look at myself in the mirror anymore , I screwed up my courage and did it .
Now I 'm kicking myself for not doing it ages ago !
I LOVE my boobs !
They are so awesome .
I play with them all day long , just to make sure they 're ok ( hehe ! ) and I walk around topless at home and on set because they like to get fresh air ( hehehe ! ) .
I do n't get paid any more for bigger boobs , and I do n't dance on the road , so the only difference is that now I feel better about me !

What do you like to do when you 're not working ?
Working in adult is the bestest job in the whole world !
I get paid lots of money to do something everyone else does for fun on their own time , and I get lots of free time to do everything I love !
I used to have a lot of hobbies : writing , drawing , playing piano , studying Wall Street and quantum physics ( yes , I 'm serious ) ... then I bought a computer .
This website , which I do ENTIRELY 100 % ON MY OWN , takes up every free minute of my day .
There 's always more e-mails to answer , more updates to add , new pics to scan , new logos to make , more orders to fill , and lots of chatting to do !
So I 've taken my hobbies and combined them into my work schedule : I write my own scripts , do artwork , play piano and write music for my movies , and I even wrote one called " Corporate Affairs " , where I got to talk about Wall Street , and my idol , Warren Buffett .
( I have n't figured out a way to use quantum physics on set - yet ! )
I 'm a workaholic , and I thrive on pressure .
I believe I can do anything if I just work hard enough , and I always push myself to be the best I can at whatever I do .

He 's proud of who I am and what I 've done , but make no mistake about it , he 's also very glad I 'm retired and he can have me all to himself now !
The discovery of a remarkably well - preserved monumental temple in Turkey — thought to be constructed during the time of King Solomon in the 10th / 9th - centuries BCE — sheds light on the so - called Dark Age .
Uncovered by the University of Toronto 's Tayinat Archaeological Project ( TAP ) in the summer of 2008 , the discovery casts doubt upon the traditional view that the transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age was violent , sudden and culturally disruptive .
Ancient sources — such as the Homeric epics and the Hebrew Bible — depict an era of widespread famine , ethnic conflict and population movement , most famously including the migrations of the Sea Peoples ( or biblical Philistines ) and the Israelites .
This is thought to have precipitated a prolonged Dark Age marked by cultural decline and ethnic strife during the early centuries of the Iron Age .
But recent discoveries — including the Tayinat excavations — have revealed that some ruling dynasties survived the collapse of the great Bronze Age powers .
" Our ongoing excavations have not only begun to uncover extensive remains from this Dark Age , but the emerging archaeological picture suggests that during this period Tayinat was the capital of a powerful kingdom , the ‘ Land of Palastin ’ , " says Timothy Harrison , professor of Near Eastern Archaeology at the University of Toronto and the director of the project .
" Intriguingly , the early Iron Age settlement at Tayinat shows evidence of strong cultural connections , if not the direct presence of foreign settlers , from the Aegean world , the traditional homeland of the Sea Peoples . "
Excavations uncovered the temple 's southern approach , which once faced a broad stone - paved courtyard , and consisted of a monumental staircase and porticoed - entrance , supported by a large , ornately carved basalt column base .
In addition , fragments of monumental stelae — stone slabs created for religious or other commemorative purposes — carved in Luwian ( an extinct language once spoken in what is now Turkey ) hieroglyphic script , were found .
They are thought to have once stood on stone platforms in the courtyard .
" The building ’s central room was burned in an intense fire .
It was filled with heavily charred brick and wood , as well as a substantial quantity of bronze metal , including riveted pieces and carved ivory fragments — clearly the remains of furniture or wall fixings .
Fragments of gold and silver foil were also found along with the carved eye inlay from a human figure , " added Harrison .
The temple ’s inner sanctuary — also know as its ' holy of holies ' — will be the focus of the 2009 field season which begins on July 1 .
TAP is an international project , involving researchers from a dozen countries , and more than 20 universities and research institutes .
It also provides research opportunities and training for both graduate and undergraduate students .
The project is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the Institute for Aegean Prehistory ( INSTAP ) , and receives support from the University of Toronto .
A Pergola is an outdoor garden or room that is built with the fusion of rafters and beams , and it has no walls which allow for an intense natural beauty .
The whole essence of a pergola is to add to the visual appeal of your home while taking cognisance of the effect of nature to your daily routine .
The word pergola is derived from a Latin word ‘ pergola ’ which means projection thus it is understandable why pergolas are usually found or projected from the homes .
This projected Hamlet as many call it , has an avalanche of benefits it denotes to your home .
So it is pertinent when indulging in pergola construction to solicit for the services of an experience pergola builder to avoid the aftermaths attributed to Jerry built pergolas .
Umpteen pergolas are mistaken for abhors , pergolas offers privacy , obstruct intruding views with the help of trellises and sculptural vines that gives the artwork an alluring feeling of beauty and exotic touch .
Pergolas are more of leisure , relaxation , and entertainment for homes and embedded in architectural designs while abhors are more of a public design , thus different factors are put into place before constructing both .
Benefits of sourcing for the services of a Pergola Builder
Safety :
It can not be comprised .
The safety of the users of a pergola is paramount as a pergola builder takes into consideration the weather conditions of the stipulated location ; the density of the wind , the hotness of the sun , and the soil texture before recommending best materials in the construction of your pergola to reduce avoidable accidents which might occur if you allow quacks to construct your pergola .
A better control of the beam of light :
Do you know that you can determine the number of shades and natural light interface of your pergola ?
Before the construction of your pergola , a pergola technician observes and records the areas that are more prone to sun rays .
The technician knows where and how to connect your pergola to give you the best possible light and shade effect as you so desire .
Consultant : one of the benefits associated with engaging a pergola technician is that you are offered free consultancy services .
In choosing a pergola , a lot of factors comes into play ; styles , designs , and conformity of the pergola to your main building .
If it is wrongly picked , the whole essence of the pergola to add to the beauty of your home becomes defeated and can function otherwise .
The carport construction expert is charged with the responsibility of designing , constructing , maintaining , and creating a carport with the best possible available carport kits to suit the taste of the customers .
For a carport builder to be regarded as an expert and able to practice in this field , he / she must be certified with Building Code Australia – Find out more this certified Melbourne carport builder .
There are lots of pergola designs , and styles and most have its merits and demerits hence when choosing designs , you must be very careful to know if it will suit your budget if it is visually appealing , and also if the designs will conform to the nature of its usage .
Here are few pergola designs , sail top , cocktail embedded , and steel frame pergolas .
Guidelines to consider when choosing a pergola designs
Always ensure that your pergola conforms to the style of your home or garden , whichever segment of the house you are choosing for it to be mounted .
There have been cases of individuals erecting a pergola structure , and it turns out that the authorities were not aware and such emblem was tagged illegal .
So it is advisable to seek for approvals before embarking on a pergola voyage .
In constructing pergolas , materials must be of high standards so that it will be able to withstand weatherings synonymous with outdoors structures .
Seek for the services of a pergola builder
Ask questions about the pergola technician to ascertain if he is certified or not and also to know if he can be able to deliver to your taste .
Erecting a pergola in your home or gardens can act as a windbreaker , and it reduces the effects of heavy winds on your homes .
It helps to utilise outdoor spaces in your vicinity and converting it into something useful for relaxation and leisure .

Hours before they were to leave office after eight troubled years , George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney had one final and painful piece of business to conclude .
For over a month Cheney had been pleading , cajoling , even pestering Bush to pardon the Vice President ’s former chief of staff , I. Lewis ( Scooter ) Libby .
Libby had been convicted nearly two years earlier of obstructing an investigation into the leak of a covert CIA officer ’s identity by senior White House officials .
The Libby pardon , aides reported , had become something of a crusade for Cheney , who seemed prepared to push his nine - year - old relationship with Bush to the breaking point — and perhaps past it — over the fate of his former aide .
“ We do n’t want to leave anyone on the battlefield , ” Cheney argued .
Bush had already decided the week before that Libby was undeserving and told Cheney so , only to see the question raised again .
A top adviser to Bush says he had never seen the Vice President focused so single - mindedly on anything over two terms .
And so , on his last full day in office , Jan. 19 , 2009 , Bush would give Cheney his final decision .
These last hours represent a climactic chapter in the mysterious and mostly opaque relationship at the center of a tumultuous period in American history .
It reveals how one question — whether to grant a presidential pardon to a top vice - presidential aide — strained the bonds between Bush and his deputy and closest counselor .
It reveals a gap in the two men ’s views of crime and punishment .
And in a broader way , it uncovers a fundamental difference in how the two men regarded the legacy of the Bush years .
As a Cheney confidant puts it , the Vice President believed he and the President could claim the war on terrorism as his greatest legacy only if they defended at all costs the men and women who fought in the trenches .
When it came to Libby , Bush felt he had done enough .
Daylife / Reuters Pictures used by permission
But the fight over the pardon was also a prelude to the difficult questions about justice and national security inherited by the Obama Administration :
How closely should the nation examine the actions of government officials who took steps — legal or possibly illegal — to defend the nation ’s security during the war on terrorism ?
The Libby investigation , which began nearly six years ago , went to the heart of whether the Bush Administration misled the public in making its case to invade Iraq .
But other Bush - era policies are still coming under legal scrutiny .
Who , for example , should be held accountable in one of the darkest corners of the war on terrorism — the interrogators who may have tortured detainees ?
Or the men who conceived and crafted the policies that led to those secret sessions in the first place ?
How far back — and how high up the chain of command — should these inquiries go ?
As Attorney General Eric
Holder weighs whether to name a special prosecutor to probe reports of detainee abuse during the Bush era , Democratic lawmakers are trying to determine why Cheney demanded that Congress be kept in the dark about some covert CIA plans after 9/11 .
There is no guarantee that these and other probes wo n’t at some point require the testimony of the former President and Vice President .
While Bush has retired to Texas to write his memoirs and secure his legacy by other means , Cheney is settling in for a long siege in Washington , where he will soon be installed in a conservative think tank and where , Republicans say , he will pull levers on Capitol Hill to make his voice heard .
Above all , Cheney will continue to insist that the Commander in Chief and his lieutenants had almost limitless power in the war on terrorism and deserved a measure of immunity for taking part in that fight .
That ’s a conviction Cheney made clear to all those involved in the Libby affair — including , in his final hours in power , the President himself .
RTFA .
Please !
There are several more pages of information , thought , analysis and – on your part , hopefully – decision - making .
What sort of government do the American people deserve ?
How did we let our administration get beyond all oversight ?
What did n’t Congress do about it – and why do we keep re-electing the politicians who led us to this pass ?
I am pleased to announce that Apress ' The Definitive Guide to Catalyst is now on general release and being shipped to readers .
I am even more pleased to announce that in spite of my name being on the cover , my brilliant and beloved co-author Kieren Diment managed to write a lot more of it than I did and as such it 's actually pretty bloody good .
We 've done out best to make this book not just an extended tutorial , but to provide a gentle introduction to installing and using Catalyst , an insight into the development ( and testing ) workflow behind scalable , maintainable commercial applications written using Catalyst , and a solid basic understanding of how to use , abuse and extend the common extensions and components that you are likely to interact with in the course of a Catalyst build .
Better still , the chapters on those libraries have largely been written by either the authors or documentation leads for those projects , giving you an expert 's viewpoint on each of them that not even Kieren and I could match .
If you 're planning to buy your copy from Amazon , please consider following one of the following links to buy it from amazon.com , or to buy it from amazon.
co.uk - and if you 're elsewhere then please substitute your appropriate country TLD into one of those links .
That way the affiliate revenue will go to the Enlightened Perl Organisation rather than amazon 's back pocket .
A small matter of principle
In the true Enlightened Perl spirit of putting your money where your mouth is , I will also be donating any and all money I personally receive from sales of the book to the organisation as well , since this book could never have come about without the support of the community - and the effort the members of that community have put in over the years is a huge part of what 's created the market for world wide Catalyst consultancy , training and commercial support that Shadowcat serves .
This , in my opinion , makes it an even more exciting time to join the organisation - our first round of grants has already been announced and once the revenues from the book start hitting the organisation 's accounts I expect we 'll be doing a second pretty soon - so if you want a vote as to what projects and causes the money should be sent on , you should give serious consideration to becoming a paid member .
Remember - everybody willing to put their money where their mouth is gets an equal vote at grant time , so if you care about moving the cause of twenty first century perl forwards then this is how to help decide how to spend other people 's money to do so !
A large matter of gratitude
I 'd also like to take a moment to thank all of the people who 've helped us out along the way - not just chapter headline authors but the irc.perl.org # catalyst crew who answered questions , made suggestions and kindly provided code samples based on their production code for us to base cookbook recipes on - and the various members of the community who were kind enough to proof read , advise and criticise in the name not of fame but simply of an awesome end result .
Finally , I want to specifically call out Jacinta Richardson for praise - while our publically archived interactions might make it seem otherwise , we have a solid professional respect for each other 's work and her technical review on the code I wrote for the book was invaluable .
I did n't honestly expect Apress to be able to find a reviewer who could make a serious job of poking holes in my code , but as it turned out Jacinta did n't so much poke as tear - resulting both in substantial improvements to the end product and a timely reminder to me that I should be careful not to believe my own hype ;)
I fervently hope that this book will not only be of use to people just starting out with Catalyst development , but will continue to be of value right up through to the expert level , reflecting a best attempt by all of the authors involved to make something that appeals not only to those who want a gentle , step by step introduction but to developers like me who believe that the venerable K&R C book still remains the pinnacle of technical writing .
It was an ambitious goal , but with the probable exception of the parts they let me write I think we gave it a pretty good shot .

Namespaces are one of the most significant changes in PHP 5.3 .
They will be familiar to C# and Java developers , and they are likely to change the structure of PHP applications for the better .
Why Do We Need Namespaces ?
As the size of your PHP code library increases , the more likely you will accidentally reuse a function or class name that has been declared before .
The problem is exacerbated if you attempt to add third - party components or plugins ; what if two or more code sets implement a ‘ Database ’ class ?
Until now , the only solution has been long class / function names .
For example , WordPress prefixes every name with ‘ WP _ ’ .
The Zend Framework uses a highly descriptive naming convention that resullts in long - winded class names such as Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_Text_CaseInsensitive .
Name collision problems can be solved with namespaces .
PHP constants , classes , and functions can be grouped into namespaced libraries .
How are Namespaces Defined ?
By default , all constant , class and function names are placed in a global space — like they were before namespaces were supported .
Namespaced code is defined using a single namespace keyword at the top of your PHP file .
It must be the first command ( with the exception of declare ) and no non-PHP code or white - space can precede the command , e.g .
<? php // define this code in the MyProject namespace namespace MyProject ;
The code following this line will belong to the MyProject namespace .
It is not possible to nest namespaces or define two or more namespaces for the same code block ( only the last will be recognized ) .
However , you can define different namespaced code in the same file , e.g .
<? php namespace MyProject1 ; // PHP code for the MyProject1 namespace namespace MyProject2 ; // PHP code for the MyProject2 namespace // Alternative syntax namespace MyProject3 { // PHP code for the MyProject3 namespace } ?>
However , I would strongly advise defining a single namespace per file .
Sub - namespaces
PHP allows you to define a hierarchy of namespace names so libraries can be sub - divided .
Sub -namespaces are separated using a backslash ( \ ) character , e.g .
MyProject \SubName
MyProject \Database\MySQL
CompanyName\MyProject\Common\Widget
Calling Namespaced Code
In a file named lib1. php , we will define a constant , function , and class with the App \ Lib1 namespace :
lib1.php
<? php // application library 1 namespace App\Lib1 ; const MYCONST = ' App\Lib1 \MYCONST ' ; function MyFunction ( ) { return __FUNCTION__ ; } class MyClass { static function WhoAmI ( ) { return __METHOD__ ; } } ?>
To call this code , we can use PHP code such as :
myapp.php
<? php header ( ' Content - type : text / plain ' ) ; require_once ( ' lib1.php ' ) ; echo \ App\Lib1 \MYCONST . "
" ; echo \ App\ Lib1 \MyFunction ( ) . "
" ; echo \ App\Lib1 \MyClass :: WhoAmI ( ) . "
" ; ?>
No namespace is defined for myapp.php so the code exists in the global space .
Any direct reference to MYCONST , MyFunction ( ) or MyClass will fail because they exist in the App \ Lib1 namespace .
We must therefore add a prefix of \ App \ Lib1 to create a fully - qualified name .
The following result is output when we load myapp.php :
App\Lib1\MYCONST App\Lib1 \MyFunction App\Lib1 \MyClass :: WhoAmI
Fully - qualified names can obviously become quite long and there are few benefits over defining a class name of App - Lib1 - MyClass .
However , in the next article , we will discuss aliasing and take a closer look at how PHP resolves namespace names .

Celebrated Belgian bike builder Fred Krugger has taken the wraps off his latest custom .
‘ Overmile ’ is a tribute to Krugger ’s favorite motorcycle , the Harley - Davidson XR - 750 , and it ’s just arrived in Sturgis for the World Championship of Custom Bike Building .
The finish on this machine is gorgeous : like Goldammer ’s 2007 Nortorious , it ’s a modern take on classic style — and shows the way ahead for custom building .
Overmile has a distinctly Franco - American flavor : a 103 ci ( 1687 cc ) S&S V - Twin drives through a 6 - speed Baker PowerBox with overdrive , while other key components are French , including the Beringer brake system and Fournales shocks .
Krugger ’s website has more details , and we profiled his last bike ‘ Half Day ’ here .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The U.S. military wants to establish regional teams of military personnel to assist civilian authorities in the event of a significant outbreak of the H1N1 virus this fall , according to Defense Department officials .
The proposal is awaiting final approval from Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
The officials would not be identified because the proposal from U.S. Northern Command 's Gen. Victor Renuart has not been approved by the secretary .
The plan calls for military task forces to work in conjunction with the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
There is no final decision on how the military effort would be manned , but one source said it would likely include personnel from all branches of the military .
It has yet to be determined how many troops would be needed and whether they would come from the active duty or the National Guard and Reserve forces .
Civilian authorities would lead any relief efforts in the event of a major outbreak , the official said .
The military , as they would for a natural disaster or other significant emergency situation , could provide support and fulfill any tasks that civilian authorities could not , such as air transport or testing of large numbers of viral samples from infected patients .
As a first step , Gates is being asked to sign a so - called " execution order " that would authorize the military to begin to conduct the detailed planning to execute the proposed plan .
Orders to deploy actual forces would be reviewed later , depending on how much of a health threat the flu poses this fall , the officials said .

Six years into the war , many U.S. bases in Iraq are still without incinerators , leaving open pits spewing toxic plumes over soldiers and civilians .
Acetaldehyde , Acrolien , Arsenic , Benzene , Carbon Monoxide , Ethylbenzene , Formaldehyde , Hydrogen Cyanide , Hydrogen Fluoride , Phosgene , Sulfur Dioxide , Sulfuric Acid , Toluene , Trichloroethane , Xylene .
These are just some of the chemicals detected in smoke from the Balad Burn Pit , one of the many vast open pits spewing toxic plumes over Iraq and Afghanistan .
But not to worry ;
In “ Just the Facts , ” an information sheet for troops , the Department of Defense has stated that “ the potential short - and long - term risks ” from Balad “ were estimated to be low . ”
The VA has just announced it will monitor reports of veterans ' pit-related illness .
But the DoD has yet to declassify old air sample reports or issue current findings .
The Pentagon ’s fact sheet appeared after VAWatchdog.com linked to a memo showing that , as early as 2006 , the DoD had known that the pit was “ an acute health hazard . ”
In the memo , titled “ Burn Pit Health Hazards , ” Air Force Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight Commander Darrin Curtis wrote to authorities that he found it “ amazing that the burn pit has been able to operate without restrictions over the past few years without significant engineering controls being put in place . ”
In an accompanying memo , James R. Elliott , Chief of Air Force Aeromedical Services , concurred that the pit ’s fumes contained “ known carcinogens ” and “ respiratory sensitizers ” that posed a “ chronic and acute health hazard to our troops and the local population . ”
" Iraqi Crud " and " Black Goop "
This week , the same memo was boldly posted on Wikileaks , more widely publicizing toxic exposure and governmental neglect .
The evidence is clear .
The Balad Burn pit is a Big Bad Burn
Pit which burns most anything that comes its way including medical waste , styrofoam , and plastic .
Soldiers , contractors , foreign workers , and Iraqis suffer what troops call “ Iraqi crud , ” whose symptoms include a hacking cough and black phlegm that goes by the name “ black goop . ”
According to Army Times reporter Kelley Kennedy , “ Though military officials say there are no known long - term effects from exposure to burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan , more than 100 service members have come forward to Military Times and Disabled American Veterans with strikingly similar symptoms : chronic bronchitis , asthma , sleep apnea , chronic coughs and allergy - like symptoms .
Several also have cited heart problems , lymphoma and leukemia . ”
Kevin Wilkins , an Air Force reservist , died last year after returning home from a tour of Balad and Qatar ; his wife blames the pit .
A year after working at Balad as a nurse , Wilkens was admitted to the hospital for a relentless headache and vomiting , symptoms that began in country .
He was diagnosed with a brain tumor and died a week later .
Sen . Russ Feingold ( D - Wisconsin ) has taken up the cause .
Six years into the war in Iraq , many bases are still without incinerators .
In Afghanistan , U.S. bases have no incinerators .
General David Petraeus claims the Pentagon is employing more incinerators , but that burn pits go with the territory : “ There is and will continue to be a need for burn pits during contingency operations , ” Petraeus wrote to Feingold .
Denial and Obfuscation
Dr. Michael Kilpatrick , a spokesman for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs , claims the DoD carefully samples air at Balad and other bases with burn pits and all is well .
" The bottom line on all of this sampling is that we have not identified anything , where there are troops , where it would have been hazardous to their health , " Kilpatrick said .
Take it from where it comes .
Between 1997 and 2002 , Michael Kilpatrick directed the Office of the Special Assistant for Gulf War Illness , where his main purpose seemed to be to promote stress -- and only stress -- as the link between wartime experience and veterans illness .
In those five years , he spent $ 250 “ without publishing any medical research report or offering a single treatment program for ill GW veterans , ” according to veterans advocate Steve Robinson .
According to the General Accounting Office ( GAO ) , Kilpatrick ’s fixed position discouraged scientists from applying for grants for research on Gulf War illness , leaving pioneering work , such as that by Dr. Robert Haley , to rely on private funding .
Despite compelling finding as early as 1998 , that Gulf War illness was caused by brain damage from neurotoxins , Kilpatrick insisted that veterans ’ headaches , dizziness , fatigue , bone and joint pain , memory loss , poor concentration , muscle weakness , skin rashes and sores , and gastrointestinal problems , and even amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) could be linked only to stress .
Since then , Kilpatrick has gone on to use his medical credential to discount the dangers of depleted uranium , hide the DoD ’s non-compliance with pre- and post - deployment screening , and obfuscate the facts around distribution of anti-nerve gas pre-treatment pills , a major cause of Gulf War illness .
And now he ’s whitewashing Balad ’s black fumes and “ black goop ”
The KBR Connection : Will There Be Accountability ?
One Georgia man is having none Dr. Kilpatrick ’s reassurances .
In November , Joshua Eller , a civilian draftman , initiated what he hopes will be a class action suit against contractor KBR and its former parent company , Halliburton , for exposing people at the Balad base to unsafe water , food and hazardous burn pit fumes .
The suit claims that “ all across Iraq and … not confined to Balad ” KBR provided bathing water that was not disinfected , including according to former KBR employee testimony , water from the Euphrates and Tigris rivers that was polluted with sewage .
Regularly , KBR served soldiers spoiled , expired and rotten food and used dishes that may have been contaminated with shrapnel .
The lawsuit claims that the plaintiff suffers from chronic skin lesions , abdominal distress , and nightmares .
KBR dumped medical waste , including needles , bandages , and body parts in the open pit .
On one occasion , ” the suit states , the plaintiff “ witnessed a wild dog running around base with a human arm in its mouth .

What 's about to make Apple 's iPhone quick and tiny and cheap all over ?
Electronic
Arts , that 's what , with their maverick new micro-studio , cutely dubbed 8 lb Gorilla .
The plan ?
99 - cent iPhone games to appear in pint - sized installments on a semi-monthly basis .
App Store browsers at the ready ?
It 's a simple , almost intrepid plan for a company of EA 's arguably cumbersome magnitude .
Take bunch of developers in their twenties , firewall them from conventional corporate bureaucracy , then encourage them to hit the tarmac sprinting with no -frills , indie - flavored iPhone ideas .
Assuming Apple 's app store submission process does n't impede the process , the goal 's to iterate roughly one new release each month .
TouchArcade has a few notes up about the company 's debut title , a post - apocalyptic monster - masher called Zombies & Me .
It sounds simple enough .
You 're a guy ( named Guy ! ) trying to protect your grandmother from zombies by leading them into giant yellow circles that denote pending missile strikes ( rained down courtesy everyone 's favorite collateral pal , the military ) .
As the game 's " panic level " increases , so too the skittering throngs of clutching , snatching , ghoul - green zombies .
Check out touchArcade 's footage of the game .
Apple just celebrated its App Store 's one - year birthday , but Business Insider 's already dropping gauntlets , calling the iPhone " arguably the hottest gaming platform in the world . "
That 's less hyperbolic than it sounds .
According to BI , games dominate the App Store , tallying some 10,000 titles or a majority 18 % of the biz .
EA 's move into the 99 - cent space therefore makes sound business sense .
Their inclination to make that move contingent on a team of intentionally rogue developers designing indie - style games , on the other hand , verges on audacious .
They 'll need to be .
Everyone 's hopping on the Apple 's 99 - cent bandwagon .
With these games percolating faster than air molecules in a wind tunnel , picking the One You Really Want To Play out of the crowd is going to be like trying to spot a friend in a full - packed concert stadium .

In the aftermath of the Pirate Bay verdict , Sweden has witnessed the demise of many other BitTorrent trackers .
But not quite enough according to music industry lobby group IFPI , who are now threatening the hosting providers of torrent sites .
The host of private BitTorrent tracker TorrentBytes appears to be one of the first targets .
When the defendants in the Pirate Bay trial were sentenced to one year jail plus a hefty fine , a shock wave went though Sweden ’s BitTorrent communities .
Several trackers decided to close voluntarily , while others did so after the local anti-piracy bureau applied some pressure .
Despite the fact that the Pirate Bay verdict is to be appealed , the decision is still being used as ammunition by the various anti-piracy outfits , and they have already taken out several trackers across Sweden .
More recently , IFPI has discovered a new , more convenient and possibly more effective way to ( try to ) shut down the remaining torrent sites .
Instead of targeting the tracker owners , IFPI is going directly to the hosting providers with a request to take the sites offline .
One of the providers that has received a letter from IFPI is DCP Networks , who rent servers to TorrentBytes – one of the larger BitTorrent trackers .
IFPI goes after TorrentBytes ’ Hosting Provider .
In their letter IFPI argues that the tracker they host is making “ a large number of ” copyright works available to the public , and that the users of the site are infringing the copyright of IFPI members .
IFPI ends the letter by asking DCP Networks to take necessary actions to make sure that this activity stops , or else “ IFPI intends to take necessary measures . ”
IFPI lawyer Magnus Mårtensson told DN.se that the letter received by DCP Networks is not something strange or unusual .
IFPI has contacted several other hosting providers and site owners Mårtensson said .
What they aim to do here is extend the ( yet to be appealed ) verdict of “ assisting copyright infringement ” and apply it to hosting providers as well .
At the moment TorrentBytes seems to be ( back ) online , indicating that the hosting provider may have not yet given in to IFPI ’s demands .
Although the Pirate Bay verdict does n’t apply to anyone but the convicted and their unique circumstances , it is likely that some hosting providers will agree to IFPI ’s request , fearful of a costly legal procedure .

Da norske Andreas Heim åpnet pakken med koteletter han kjøpte på Superbrugsen i Hals søndag 9 . juli fikk han seg en god latter .
Den ene av de danske lammekotelettene lignet nemlig en av verdens mest berømte skurker - selveste Darth Vader fra filmklassikerene « Star Wars » - på en prikk .
- Jeg kjøpte to pakker koteletter for hundre danske kroner .
Jeg oppdaget ikke likheten før jeg åpnet pakkene , sier Heim på telefon fra Danmark der han ferierer med familien .
Han forteller at flere av kotelettene lignet Darth Vader , men at koteletten på bildet var den som utvilsomt lignet mest .
Har du bilder av mat som ligner på noe annet ?
Tips oss !

- Absurd
- Det er nesten skummelt , ler Heim - som selvfølgelig publiserte bildet av den uvanlige koteletten på nettsamfunnet twitter .
SER DU LIKHETEN ?

Før kotelettene havnet på grillen sørget Heim for å marinere dem grundig i økologisk olivenolje , sitron , en halv chili og en neve med sitrontimian , avslører grilleren , som til daglig jobber som systemutvikler .
På sine hjemmesider skriver Superbrugsen at de tilbyr matinspirasjon , opplevelser og tilbud døgnet rundt .
- Akkurat nå står jeg ute i regnet og griller Darth Vader - koteletter mens familien sitter inne og venter på middag .
Det er egentlig ganske absurd , sier Andreas Heim .

Inspired by Dan Piponi ’s latest post , I have been looking into partial evaluation .
In particular , I thought that a language which emphasizes currying really ought be good at partial evaluation .
In this post I describe some ideas regarding partial evaluation in functional languages , and later sketch a partial evaluation machine I devised .
Supercombinator reduction machines , like GHC , do a limited form of partial evaluation .
I.e. when you compile a program to supercombinators , you are optimizing it for specialization from left to right .
So if f is defined in pointful form , “ let a = f x in ( a z , a z ) ” might be a better program than “ ( f x z , f x z ) ” .
This is a nice property of combinator reduction .
Unfortunately , it does n’t generalize : “ let a = flip f x in ( a y , a y ) ” will never be better than “ ( f y x , f y x ) ” , because functions only specialize from left to right .
I conjecture that this missing feature is more important than we realize .
Mogensen gives a very elegant partial evaluator in pure lambda calculus , which optimize as expected with the Futamura projections ( see Dan ’s post ) .
This partial evaluator works on higher order abstract syntax , taking and returning descriptions of terms rather than the terms themselves .
Essentially all it is is ( very simple ) machinery describing how to evaluate under a lambda .
The system in that paper takes many precautions to avoid unfolding dynamic arguments , because otherwise the partial evaluator might not terminate .
Apparently he is not well - versed in our Haskell School of the Infinite , because the evaluator is compositional .
So what he means by “ not terminate ” is “ return an infinite program ” .
But an infinite program is fine if you interpret / compile it lazily !
In fact , I believe ( I am intuiting — I have done no formal checking ) that the simplest - minded of lazy partial evaluators is perfect : it maximally unfolds its static arguments , there is no need for the type inference machinery in that paper , and it will have the same termination properties as the program .
I attribute the ease of this task with the built - in metacircularity of lambda calculus .
Cool as a self - embedded partial evaluator is , to do efficient partial evaluation you need to keep quotations of your programs everywhere , then compile them before you actually use them .
Lambda calculus is hinting at something more : that simply by applying one of several arguments to a curried function , you are specializing it .
Would n’t it be great if every time you did that , the program were maximally specialized automatically ?
A partial evaluation reduction strategy
It turns out that such an ambitious wish is nothing more than an evaluation order for the lambda calculus .
Admittedly , it ’s not a very common one .
You try to reduce the leftmost application , even under lambdas .
We would also like to combine this with call - by - need , so when an argument is duplicated it is only reduced once .
Here ’s an example program I ’ve been working with , with the standard definitions of the combinators Ix = x and Kxy = x .
flip ( \x y. y I x ) K K
It ’s not much , but it gets the point across .
Let ’s look at it in call - by - name :
[ 1 ] ( \f a b. f b a ) ( \x y. y I x ) K K [ 2 ] ( \a b. ( \x y. y I x ) b a ) K K [ 3 ] ( \b. ( \x y. y I x ) b K ) K [ 4 ] ( \x y. y I x ) K K [ 5 ] ( \y. y I K ) K [ 6 ] K I K [ 6 ' ] ( \m n. m ) I K [ 7 ] (
. I ) K [ 8 ]
I
Notice by the step [ 4 ] that we have lost the structure of flip ( \x y. y I x ) K , so any work we do from then on we will have to redo on subsequent applications of that function .
Contrast this with the partial evaluation strategy :
[ 1 ] ( \f a b. f b a ) ( \x y. y I x ) K K [ 2 ] ( \a b. ( \x y. y I x ) b a ) K K [ 3 ] ( \a b. ( \y. y I b ) a ) K K [ 4 ] ( \a b. a I b ) K K [ 5 ] ( \b. K I b ) K [ 5 ' ] ( \b. ( \m n. m ) I b ) K [ 6 ] ( \b. (
. I ) b ) K [ 7 ] ( \b. I ) K [ 8 ]
I
We got the function all the way down to a constant function before it was finally applied .
One thing that ’s interesting to notice about this strategy is that it seems stricter than call - by - name .
That is , if you have a nonterminating term N , then reducing the application ( \x y. Ny ) z will loop , whereas it wo n’t in CBN .
However , recall that in the domain theory , ( \x. ⊥ ) = ⊥ .
The only thing you can do to a function to observe it is apply it , and whenever you apply this function you will loop .
So you are bound to loop anyway if you are evaluating this application .
The lazy partial evaluation machine ( sketch )
Here is a sketch of an efficient low - level machine for this evaluation strategy .
It is simple stack machine code ( “ which I pull out of my bum for now , but I do n’t think an algorithm to generate it will be any trouble ” ) .
The only tricky bit about it is that pieces are sometimes removed from the middle of the stack , so it ca n’t necessarily be represented linearly in memory .
A singly linked representation should work ( I realize this costs performance ) .
The values in this language look like [ v1 , v2 , … ] { instr1 ; instr2 ; … } .
They are closures , where the vn are pushed on to the stack in that order before the instructions are executed .
Values can also be “ indirections ” , which point to an absolute position in the stack .
Indirections represent a logical reordering of the stack , and are used to model bound variables .
When indirections are executed , they remove themselves and execute ( and remove ) the thing they point to .
The instructions are as follows .
pop n -- delete the entry at position n dup n -- push the entry at position n on the top of the stack ( other standard stack ops here ) abs n -- push an indirection pointing to position n -- ( skipping other indirections ) on top of the stack exec n -- pop and execute the closure at position n closure [ n1, n2 , ...] { instr1 ; instr2 } -- remove positions n1, n2 , ... and add them -- to the closure with the given code , and push it
dup is the only instruction which duplicates a value ; this is where laziness will be encoded .
Let ’s look at the code for each piece of our example program :
I : [ ] { exec 0 } K : [ ] { pop 1 ; exec 0 }
These are pretty straightforward .
They both receive their arguments on the stack ( the first argument in position 0 , and downwards from there ) , reduce and continue execution .
Recall the code is what happens when a value is forced , so every value ends with an exec to continue the execution .
( \x y. y I x ) : [ ] { push I ; exec 2 }
This one might be a little tricker .
The stack comes in like this ( position 0 on the left ) : x y , After push I , it looks like “ I x y ” , so y’s incoming stack will be “ I x ” just as it wants .
Finally , the interesting one :
( \f a b. f b a ) : [ ] { abs 2 ; exec 2 }
abs 2 pushes an indirection to the argument b onto the stack before calling f .
This is how evaluation is pulled under binders ; when an indirection is forced , it reduces the application at the appropriate level , and all below it .
I am still not totally sure when to introduce an abs ; my guess is you do it whenever a function would otherwise reorder its arguments .
An example may demonstrate what I mean ( but perhaps not ; I have n’t totally wrapped my head around it myself ) .
Here ’s an execution trace for the example above , with the stack growing to the left .
I start with the instruction pointer on the first function and the three arguments on the stack .
The stack shown is the state before the instruction on each row .
An identifier followed by a colon marks a position in the stack for indirections :
1 abs 1 ( \x y. y I x ) K K 2 abs 3 a ( \x y. y I x ) a: K K 3 exec 2 b a ( \x y. y I x ) a : K b: K 4 closure I b a a : K b: K 5 exec 2 I b a a : K b: K 6 pop 1 I b b: K 7 exec 0 I
When an indirection is executed , as in step 5 , that is evaluation under a lambda .
This machine still does n’t support laziness ( though it did n’t matter in this example ) .
We can achieve laziness by allocating a thunk when we dup .
To evaluate the thunk , we put a mark on the stack .
Whenever an instruction tries to reach beyond the mark , we capture the current stack and instruction pointer and jam it in a closure , then write that closure to the thunk .
Indirections get replaced by their offsets ; i.e. the “ abs ” commands that would create them .
After we have done that , remove the mark ( point it to where it was previously ) and continue where we left off .
There you have it : my nifty partial evaluation machine .
I ’m reasonably confident that it ’s correct , but I ’m still not totally happy with the implementation of indirections — mostly the fact that you have to skip other indirections when you are pushing them .
I wonder if there is a better way to get the same effect .

Henry Allingham was the last surviving founding member of the RAF Henry Allingham , the world 's oldest man and one of the last surviving World War I servicemen , has died at the age of 113 , his care home has said .
Mr Allingham served with the Royal Naval Air Service in WWI , later transferring to the Royal Air Force at the time of its creation .
Last month , Mr Allingham , born in 1896 , became the world 's oldest man .
The Queen said he was " one of the generation who sacrificed so much for us all " .
A spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace said the Queen 's " thoughts are with his family during this time " .
Bosses at his Brighton care home said everybody was " saddened by Henry 's loss and our sympathy goes to his family " .
His funeral will take place later this month at St Nicholas ' Church in Brighton .
Mr Allingham , whose life has spanned three centuries and six monarchs , has five grandchildren , 12 great - grandchildren , 14 great - great grandchildren and one great - great - great grandchild .
His wife Dorothy , who he was married to for more than half a century , died in 1970 .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid tribute to the war hero , calling him a " tremendous character " .
" I had the privilege of meeting Henry many times .
He was a tremendous character , one of the last representatives of a generation of tremendous characters , " he said .
He added : " My thoughts are with his family as they mourn his passing but celebrate his life . "
And Prince Charles described Mr Allingham as " belonging to that incredible generation who did so much for their country " .
A Clarence House spokesman said : " The Prince of Wales was sad to hear of the death of Henry Allingham this morning .
" We owe him a huge debt of gratitude for all he has done . "
A minute 's silence was held at Lord 's to mark his passing before play got under way on the third day of the second Ashes test .
' War memories ' Mr Allingham joined the Royal Navy Air Service in September 1915 and served in Ypres before transferring to the RAF in April 1918 .
In November last year , he took part in ceremonies to mark the 90th anniversary of the end of WWI .

Advertisement Speaking before events began , Mr Allingham said he could n't forget the war even if he wanted to .
" I saw too many things I would like to forget but I never will forget them , I never can forget them , " he said .
For decades , he buried his war memories , avoiding reunions and refusing to discuss the events with his family .
But , in 2005 , he was persuaded to unveil an RAF memorial in France and decided it would have been disrespectful to his former comrades to refuse .
This was followed by numerous honours and accolades .

Henry Allingham 's life in pictures
He was given a doctorate in engineering from Southampton Solent University and was made an honorary freeman of Brighton and Hove .
He was also made an honorary member of the Royal Naval Association , received a Legion d'Honneur and published his life story .
Last month , the Royal Navy hosted a 113th birthday party on HMS President in London for his family , close friends and members of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force .
That was the last time his nephew Ronald Cator saw him .
Mr Cator said his uncle looked " very , very frail .
He went downhill in the last few months . "
" He used to sleep a lot at the end .
He wanted to pass away , poor old boy . "
Tributes Dennis Goodwin , founder of the First World War Veterans ' Association , led the tributes to Mr Allingham , the last survivor of the Battle of Jutland and his old friend .
" Henry was truly a gentleman - his strength of character , his purpose .
He left quite a legacy to the nation of memories of what it was like to have been in WWI , " he said .
Veterans minister Kevan Jones said he was " greatly saddened " to hear of Mr Allingham 's death .
" For one of his age , his vigour for life was extraordinary , " he said .
" I was humbled to meet somebody who had led such an amazing life and we owe such a huge debt of gratitude to him and his generation . "
Graham Mottram at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovilton said Mr Allingham was the " highest example " of a military man , who will be remembered for his " total even - handedness " in treating his colleagues in the forces , irrespective of age and rank .
Robert Leader , chief executive of St Dunstan 's care home in Ovingdean , near Brighton , said : " He was very active right up to his final days , having recently celebrated his 113th birthday on HMS President , surrounded by family .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" As well as possessing a great spirit of fun , he represented the last of a generation who gave a very great deal for us .
" Henry made many friends among the residents and staff at St Dunstan's .
He was a great character and will be missed . "
Mr Allingham is survived by Harry Patch , who turned 111 last month and is now one of the last two British survivors of WWI .
Speaking from Fletcher House care home in Wells , Somerset , Mr Patch said he was " very sad at losing a friend " .
The other British survivor is Claude Choules , aged 108 , who served with the Royal Navy .
Born in Worcestershire , he stayed in Australia after he was seconded there in the 1920s as an instructor to the Royal Australian Navy .

July 10 , 2009 Online JournalJuly 10 , 2009
WMR has learned that the National Security ‘ Q’ Group , responsible for security , has grown to an immense security and counter - intelligence force , with an estimated one thousand government employees , contractors , and paid informants .
NSA ’s Security force is reportedly primarily tasked with plugging any leaks of classified or other information that points to U.S. government ’s involvement with the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 .
The US government has allegedly set up a special security wing with the sole task of distancing Washington from any involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
NSA Security has doggedly pursued a number of NSA employees , some in ‘ sting ’ operations , others in frequent polygraphs and repeated security interviews where threats are made by thuggish NSA security agents with and without the presence of FBI agents , and others in constant surveillance operations at their homes , churches , and other locations away from the Fort Meade , Maryland , headquarters of the agency .
The most egregious NSA Security operation against an NSA employee was the 2004 arrest of NSA analyst Ken Ford , Jr. Ford became a target of opportunity for NSA Security and the FBI after Vice President Dick Cheney noted his name on an NSA signals intelligence report on Saddam Hussein ’s government that stated that there was no proof from interceptions of Iraqi communications that Saddam Hussein possessed ‘ weapons of mass destruction . ’
Cheney and other neocons in the Bush White House arranged for a ‘ sting ’ operation to be mounted as retribution against Ford .
Ford was charged with taking classified papers home from NSA headquarters , something that is quite impossible considering the stringent security in place at one of the most - secured complexes in the world .
Ford was convicted by a tainted jury and sentenced to seven years in federal prison .
Ford , who is African - American , originally had an African - American federal trial judge .
However , the judge was replaced by a pro-Iraq war Jewish U.S. judge , Peter Messitte , who set out to ensure a guilty conviction of Ford in cahoots with Jewish U.S. Attorney for Maryland Rod Rosenstein , and Jewish Assistant U.S. Attorney for Southern Maryland David Salem , both Bush appointees .
Nothing was done by the judge or prosecutors to dismiss from the jury a contractor whose company had major contracts with NSA .
The trio of Messitte , Rosenstein , and Salem have also ‘ rocket - docketed ’ a number of cases , resulting in slam - dunk convictions , against Arab - and Iranian - Americans in the southern district of Maryland .
NSA ’s Security chief is Kemp Ensor III .
Ensor has built up what amounts to a massive law enforcement and intelligence agency in Maryland that operates as a virtual independent operation that answers to no one .
Maryland ’s congressional delegation has shown little interest in oversight over the security operation .
In fact , WMR has learned that many NSA employees , aware of the political and other misuse of their agency by the Bush - Cheney administration , avidly backed Barack Obama for president hoping that the past era when NSA complied with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) and the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution would be restored .
However , many NSA employees are bitterly disappointed that Obama has done nothing to curtail not only the widespread surveillance of the communications of law - abiding Americans but the constant ‘ Stasi - like ’ harassment and surveillance conducted by Ensor ’s team of agents and confidential informants .
WMR has also learned that NSA Security has been authorized to work directly with Washington area local police department intelligence divisions to carry out its surveillance of not only NSA employees and contractors , but journalists who report on the activities of NSA .
Two police departments mentioned in this respect are the Alexandria , Virginia , and Anne Arundel County , Maryland , sheriff departments .
One senior level NSA official recently found himself sitting in front of NSA Security questioners asking why he gave his NSA business cards to some students at a university .
It turns out the official was trying to recruit students for NSA employment .
When the official asked why there was a problem in his handing out his business cards , the answer by NSA Security was that some of them , all American citizens , had ‘ Russian last names . ’
[ efoods ]
Even former NSA employees and contractors are being subjected to continual NSA Security surveillance and harassment at their work places and other locations , according to WMR ’s sources .
Some have lost their jobs as a result of pressure from NSA Security .
WMR has in the past reported on NSA surveillance of journalists .
On December 28 , 2005 , we reported : ‘ WMR has learned that the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , on the orders of the Bush administration , eavesdropped on the private conversations and e-mail of its own employees , employees of other U.S. intelligence agencies — including the CIA and DIA — and their contacts in the media , Congress , and oversight agencies and offices .
The journalist surveillance program , code named ‘ FIRSTFRUITS , ’ was part of a Director of Central Intelligence ( DCI ) program that was maintained at least until October 2004 and was authorized by then - DCI Porter Goss .
FIRSTFRUITS was authorized as part of a DCI ‘ Countering Denial and Deception ’ program responsible to an entity known as the Foreign Denial and Deception Committee ( FDDC ) .
Since the intelligence community ’s reorganization , the DCI has been replaced by the Director of National Intelligence headed by John Negroponte and his deputy , former NSA director Gen. Michael Hayden . ’
Since the revelation of the NSA journalist monitoring database , which later added communications intercepts of journalists ’ phone calls , emails , and faxes to its database , NSA Security has , according to information received by WMR , conducted physical surveillance of journalists it deems to be threats to the operations of the agency .
The top targeted journalists , who make up a virtual ‘ rogues ’ gallery ’ at NSA Security , complete with photographs and other personal information , are : former Baltimore Sun and current Wall Street Journal reporter Siobhan Gorman , Washington Times reporter Bill Gertz , former Baltimore Sun and current New York Times reporter Scott Shane , Baltimore Sun reporter Phil McGowan , author James Bamford , New York Times reporters James Risen and Eric Lichtblau , and this editor , Wayne Madsen .
In addition to the aforementioned , FIRSTFRUITS also contained the names of former Washington Post reporter Vernon Loeb , New Yorker journalist Seymour Hersh , and UPI ’s John C. K. Daly .
Ironically , NSA Security allegedly has its own connections in the news media .
A Washington Times source revealed that the paper ’s writer of the ‘ Inside the Beltway ’ column , John McCaslin , has a relative inside NSA Security — Robert McCaslin , the chief of NSA Security counter - intelligence and the chief ‘ sting ’ agent against Ford .
Robert McCaslin , according to the Times source , is the brother of the paper ’s columnist .
NSA Security is also able to utilize the agency ’s most sophisticated electronic surveillance systems to monitor the activities of journalists .
The cell phones of journalists are routinely used as listening devices , even when turned off .
And what was considered a sure - fire method of avoiding having a cell phone used as a transmitter , removing the batteries in what has become known as ‘ batteries out ’ conversations , is no longer safe .
Even when the batteries are removed , the global positioning system ( GPS ) chip in cell phones continues to have enough residual power that two to three pings from satellites can give away a person ’s location and what other uniquely identifiable cell phones are at the same location .
The bottom line is that a number of NSA personnel who were on duty in the months leading up to 9/11 , the day of the attacks , and subsequent weeks and months , are aware of undeniable facts that point to a massive cover - up by the Bush - Cheney administration of the circumstances surrounding 9/11 , including what actually befell United Airlines flight 93 and who was issuing direct military orders from the White House .
The Obama administration , rather than lessen the pressure on the NSA personnel , has turned up the heat and is resorting to even more draconian methods to ensure silence .
The word from inside NSA is that a state of fear exists and the mission of the agency , to conduct surveillance of foreign communications to provide threat indications and warnings to U.S. troops and policy makers and protect sensitive U.S. government communications from unauthorized eavesdropping is suffering as a result .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
A former engineer for Rockwell International and Boeing was convicted Thursday of economic espionage and acting as an agent of China , authorities said .
A Delta IV rocket launches on March 10 , 2003 at Cape Canaveral , Florida .
Dongfan " Greg " Chung , 73 , was accused of stealing restricted technology and Boeing trade secrets , including information related to the space shuttle program and the Delta IV rocket .
U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney convicted him on charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage ; six counts of economic espionage to benefit a foreign country ; one count of acting as an agent of the People 's Republic of China ; and one count of making false statements to the FBI , according to a statement from federal prosecutors .
Carney presided over Chung 's three - week bench trial last month .
In a bench trial , there is no jury and the judge decides whether to convict a defendant after hearing testimony .
Chung was free on bond after his arrest by FBI agents and NASA investigators in February 2008 .
He was taken into custody after Carney 's ruling was read .
Chung , a native of China who is a naturalized United States citizen , was employed by Rockwell International from 1973 until Boeing acquired its defense and space unit in 1996 , and by Boeing thereafter .
He retired from Boeing in 2002 , but returned as a contractor , a position he held until September 2006 , prosecutors said .
Chung held a " secret " security clearance , authorities said .
" For years , Mr. Chung stole critical trade secrets from Boeing relating to the space shuttle and the Delta IV rocket -- all for the benefit of the government of China , " said David Kris , assistant attorney general for national security , in the prosecutors ' statement .
" Today 's verdict should serve as a warning to others willing to compromise America 's economic and national security to assist foreign governments . "
The case against Chung resulted from an investigation into another engineer who obtained information for China .
That engineer , Chi Mak , and several of his relatives were convicted of providing defense articles to the PRC , authorities said .
Mak was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison last year .
According to evidence presented at trial , individuals in the Chinese aviation industry began sending tasks to Chung via letter as early as 1979 , federal prosecutors said .
Over the years , the letters directed Chung to collect data related to the space shuttle and various military and civilian aircraft .
In his letters back to China , Chung referenced materials he had already sent , including 24 manuals relating to the B - 1 bomber , which Rockwell had forbidden for distribution outside the company and federal agencies .
In addition , between 1985 and 2003 , Chung traveled to China several times and met with government officials .
His contacts in China discussed these trips in letters and recommended methods of passing information , authorities said .
In a 2006 search of Chung 's home , FBI and NASA agents found more than 250,000 pages of documents from Boeing , Rockwell and other defense contractors in the house and in its crawl space , prosecutors said .
They included " scores of binders containing decades ' worth of stress analysis reports , test results and design information for the space shuttle . "
Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine , authorities said .
The charge of acting as an agent for a foreign government carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine .
The charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage and making false statements to federal investigators each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine .
Chung is set for sentencing November 9 .

However , the Internet is a terrifically democratizing force , and while most of us can't stand the haters who try to hijack this medium for their own sad agendas , any effort to criminalize speech in this medium is really unacceptable .
Unfortunately , such an effort is underway , headed by Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - CA ) .
As Wired magazine notes , her bill , HR 1966 , is called the " Cyberbullying Prevention Act " and includes this section :
Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication , with the intent to coerce , intimidate , harass or cause substantial emotional distress to a person , using electronic means to support severe , repeated and hostile behavior , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both .
Look , I 'm all for putting people in jail for violating the law , whether they violated it on the Internet or somewhere else .
However , this bill is so broadly written as to be an affront to the First Amendment .
Really , who is going to determine what " intent to coerce , intimidate or harass " ?
At times , I 've felt intimidated and harassed by quasi - stalker - ish commenters and hate mailers .
And I 've certainly been the target of attempts to " coerce " - as has anyone who has read a blog post pushing a certain position .
Should folks go to jail for that ?
I do n't think so .

A $ 150 Camera vs. a $ 5,000 Camera

December 2006
INTRODUCTION
July 2007 : Also see A Comparison Between a $ 5 Film Camera and a $ 3,200 Digital Camera .
Skip to : How I Did This Performance Enlargements Recommendations
Here 's an example of how a $ 150 camera can make the same photo as any other exotic camera .
Roll your mouse over the image to swap between the two images .
Which do you think is which ?
Which has better color ?
Which has better sharpness ?
Which has better highlight detail ?
Which has better noise performance ?
Roll your mouse over to compare a photo made with a $ 150 camera to a $ 5,000 camera .
Sorry about the change in tilt ; I used a tripod for the $ 5,000 camera and hand - held the $ 150 one .
I think the better shot actually came from the cheap camera , which is the first image .
Yes , if you are a geek with a microscope there are differences , but that 's for geeks who look for these details as a hobby unto itself .
For normal people who actually enjoy photos there is n't any difference for 80 % of what you might want to shoot .
Many people who read my site buy and own too many cameras .
They enjoy dissecting photos for engineering details ( as I often do on this site ) more than they enjoy making photos .
They 're often the same guys who buy too many other toys .
Those are the people who keep insisting you buy a more expensive camera , since it justifies their perverted hobby .
It does n't make any better photos .
The $ 150 camera made the first shot .
The $ 5,000 camera made the shot seen with your mouse over the image .
I prefer the $ 150 camera in this example .
Better cameras may make it easier or more pleasant to make photos , much as a better car makes it more pleasant to get someplace .
A rusty Ford Pinto or a Prius gets you there just the same as a V - 12 Mercedes .
HOW I DID THIS back to top
Introduction How I Did This Performance Enlargements Recommendations
One shot was made with the $ 150 Canon A530 .
Actually it usually sells in December 2006 for about $ 139.95 , complete with batteries , strap , cables , memory card and software .
I do n't use a tripod with it .
I set it to its Vivid mode ( explained on my A530 page ) .
The other camera is my Canon 5D , ( $ 3,299.99 MSRP ) and a Canon 16 - 35 mm f/2.8 L lens ( 1,499.99 MSRP ) .
I had to buy my own memory card ( $ 209 ) , and I chose to use my own Tamrac strap ( $ 25 ) , B+W 77 mm UV filter ( $ 54 ) , Gitzo G1227 carbon fibre tripod ( $ 560 ) and Bogen Manfrotto 3275 410 Geared Head ( $ 194 ) , for a total of $ 5,842 .
I set my 5D to normal contrast and +2 color saturation .
The more expensive camera costs over forty times as much as the inexpensive one .
That 's forty , not four .
I could buy three of the inexpensive camera systems just for the sales tax on the more expensive one !
The 16 - 35 mm L lens was set to 35 mm , its sharpest setting , and the A530 was at its widest setting .
The two cameras make slightly differently shaped images .
The A530's images are a little taller ( 4:3 ) and the 5D 's images are a little wider ( 3:2 ) .
To get them to fit on top of each other I had to trim a little from the top and bottom of the A530's image , and trimmed the same amount from the sides of the 5D 's image .
I reduced both images to the same size to fit on your screen .
PERFORMANCE back to top
Introduction How I Did This Performance Enlargements Recommendations
Look for yourself .
They look equally as sharp to me .
That 's my point : at normal sizes , resolution does n't matter .
The $ 150 A530 is 5MP and the $ 5,000 5D is 12.7 MP .
The A530 obviously has the best pixels - per - dollar value .
Either makes great 12 x 18 " prints if you shoot well .
The color looks much better on the first image .
The image you get with your mouse over the image is overexposed , so the colors are washed out .
I prefer the warmer shadows on the first image .
Which is which ?
The first one ( better color ; my favorite ) is the $ 150 Canon A530 !
The second image ( worse color and exposure ) is the $ 5,000 Canon 5D !!
This shows the importance of knowing how to use your camera over buying a fancier one .
Cameras are just like cars : even if you have a Mercedes with automatic - tailgating , radar - controlled cruise control ( Distronic ) and navigation , you still need to keep it in lane with the steering wheel .
A camera 's steering wheel is the Exposure ( light - dark ) compensation control and the White Balance ( color ) control .
Just like cars , regardless of how automated they are , they all need your help now and then .
Why is this ?
Simple : I set the exposure compensation to - 1.0 on the A530 to get the correct exposure .
I guessed wrong on the 5D and left it at my usual - 2/3 setting .
The large amount of shadows in this scene caused each camera to give too much exposure to the bright parts , which washed out the color .
The LCD on the $ 150 A530 is color accurate .
The LCD on my $ 5,000 5D is dim , has little contrast and is too green , so I did n't see this while I was out shooting .
I have no idea why the LCDs on Canon 's point - and - shoots are so much better than on their SLRs ; they just are .
If I had left the 5D set as it came out of the box the results would have been much , much worse .
The exposure would have been much lighter , and the saturation would have been much lower ( 0 instead of +2 ) .
Here 's how the default saturation setting looks :
Canon 5D , 0 ( normal ) saturation and contrast .
- 2/3 exposure compensation .
And here 's how it looks at the default exposure setting :
Canon 5D , 0 ( normal ) saturation , contrast and exposure compensation .
Art is in the eye of the beholder , and this beholder thinks the image made at the factory settings looks crappy .
The $ 150 camera , with just two fast pushbutton settings , looks much , much better to me than a $ 5,000 camera left the way it came out of the box .
Sadly most people who buy these do n't even know where to find these adjustments , which is why I share my users guides with you .
I owe you one for the 5D ; for now , my Canon 30D User 's Guide covers all these adjustments already .
If I had been attentive enough to set the 5D more carefully I would have gotten results that matched more closely , but for the purposes of this demonstration , it was instructive that the 5D was n't adjusted as well as the A530 was .
I made hundreds of shots on different cameras and lenses this day in preparation for my upcoming Nikon - Canon Film - Digital death match .
HUGE ENLARGEMENTS back to top
Introduction How I Did This Performance Enlargements Recommendations
How often do you print more than 12 x 18 ? " I do about once every two years .
If I print many feet wide , it 's nice to have a few more pixels .
Let 's compare the two at two feet wide :
Section from a Two - Foot - Wide Print ( 60 cm ) .
This is a crop from the $ 150 camera at 100 % .
Roll your mouse over it for the crop from the $ 5,000 camera reduced to same pixel dimensions ( a 63 % crop ) .
The two look pretty similar to me , and yes , at two feet wide , the 5D is sharper .
To the 5D 's advantage , this is a shadow section which looks better with the lighter exposure as the 5D was set .
So why spend more than $ 5,000 more for a camera ?
Let 's see what happens with a four - foot wide print :
Section from a Four - Foot - Wide Print ( 1.2 m ) .
OK , it 's sharper , but will you really look at a four - foot - wide print from as close as you view your computer screen ?
Probably not , but if wall - sized prints are your thing , by all means , get the excellent 5D and the fantastic L series lenses .
If you 're happy with spectacular 8x10 " ( 20 x 25 cm ) prints , you wo n't be missing anything with an A530 .
You can take the image from the $ 150 camera and put it on a billboard , since people see those from hundreds of feet away .
What 's important ?
Lightness ( tone ) and color .
Talk to any painter or artist and they 'll concur : details are just details , they 're not critical to the success of a color image .
Note that the sharper image from the 5D , even blown up this far , still has obviously suckier color .
I prefer the image from the $ 150 camera because it 's exposed better .
The 5D can get the same results , I just goofed on the exposure .
This was n't intentional , and emphasizes why the photographer is far more important than the camera
Note :
These print dimensions presume your computer screen is at 100DPI , as most are .
RECOMMENDATIONS back to top
Introduction How I Did This Performance Enlargements Recommendations
Ever notice how the only people who want you to think that expensive cameras make better pictures are the same people who want to sell you one , or friends who happen to own them ?
The B / W shots here were made on a 50 year old camera for which I paid three dollars !
It is an Agfa box camera , with fixed focus and exposure and thumbscrew film wind .
You have to look through a red window to know when to stop winding each frame .
Ask your favorite musician if he's as good as he is because of the brand of instrument he plays , or ask your favorite author if he writes as well as he does because of the typewriter he uses .
Good tools just make it easier for people who do it all the time .
My grandma was Henry Steinway 's ( pianos ) personal assistant for decades .
If you 're an immortal virtuoso you play well enough to play around any faults of the instrument and possibly let people hear miniscule differences between instruments .
Most likely you 're the only one hearing the differences between instruments and your fans are hearing your style , not the instrument .
If you 're not among the immortals , lessons and practice are the way to get better .
Most musicians own the axes they do because it makes it easier for them to get their signature sound , not because the instruments sound better on their own .
Remember the scene in The Blues Brothers where Elwood and Jake are giving Ray Charles ( proprietor of Ray's Music World ) a hard time about the action being a little stiff on a keyboard they wanted to buy ?
Brother Ray says " let me see , " sits down , proceeds to play and gets the entire city up and dancing .
Of course brother Ray wanted to show that the crappy keyboard he was trying to sell Elwood and Jake was n't defective , but it also goes to show that even a crappy instrument is no match for a master .
I once saw a master player solo , unaccompanied , " Carnival of the Animals " and " Flight of the Bumblebee " on a crappy borrowed fiberglass Sousaphone ( a marching band substitute for a tuba ) with sticky valves .
It was crazy - crazy good .
Photographs come from a photographer 's skill and inspiration .
The camera just takes a picture after the photographer does all the work .
Sorry to burst any bubbles , but I do n't have any cameras to sell you .
I use fancy cameras because they work under more conditions , see things from different angles , or make my work faster or easier for me .
The results for 99 % of my applications are the same .
I 'm lazy , and prefer nice tools if I have to use them all day , every day .
Nice tools are nice , but just nice .
They are n't necessary .
Oh yes - Camera phones also can be just as good as any other camera .
See here for more examples .
It 's all in the photographer , not the camera .

Useful TRUTH
The Awful Truth From the World of Tourism
Added by viorel on Jun 17 , 2009 | Visited by 5072 | Voted by 45 persons
Doug Lansky is an American traveler , who though it was enough being quiet about his terrible trips to different countries .
He decided to set up a site in which travelers from around the globe would share the awful truth about their journeys .
On his site , called TitanicAwards , the author welcomes people to take part in a wide range of surveys , share images and clips and state about the worst things from the world of tourism .
You can find about the worst beer in the world , the beaches that are considered to be the dirtiest , the world \'s worst cruise ship and the food that makes you sick .
For instance , a traveler shared his experience with a cocktail of Kathmandu .
After consuming the drink he had been sick for three days and lost 8 kg .
The category of the worst dishes includes fried tarantulas ( served somewhere in Asia ) , stir - fried grasshoppers ( you can try in Indonesia ) and boiled fermented cow\'s nose - a food you can try in Bali .
Today , whenever you see a travel story , it sounds more like and ad , persuading people to visit an unknown , unexplored region .
Being fed - up with the stories that read like an advertisement , Lanksy , who works as a syndicated columnist in the United States , stated that today people simply do not get enough information about the other side of international tourism .
If there are critical reviews of books and movies , why there \'s no criticism in the travel industry ?
It \'s hard to find a website that tells about the awful things people face during their trips and there \'s very little information regarding the disadvantages of a fancy new resort .
The reason for this is rather simple - tourism represents one of the biggest businesses in the world .
Most often , travelers who look forward to convey a somewhat less pleasing information regarding their trips , discover that website editors are simply not interested in such kind of information or there are just too many words describing the awfulness of the journeys and editors are unable to skillfully edit the whole issue so it would not look like too much whining - a whiny article is something that does n\'t fit into selected space on the website .
However , Lanksy says that there are some features of travel that one may find interesting and even entertaining .
Some of the most famous columnists decided to share their information about trips to other regions .
One of them is Tony Wheeler , who founded Lonely Planet publications .
He says that the worst drivers in the world are in Saudi Arabia .
He also says that in India he saw the longest visa line .
However , he was really frustrated with the most ridiculous , Kafkaesque \ " mind bogglingly stupid bureaucracy \ " he witnessed in Russia .
According to the author of the books The World\ 's Most Dangerous Places and Come Back Alive , Robert Young Pelton , who apparently enjoys paying a visit once in a while to dangerous places , the least polite militants he has ever met were in Liberia .
He says that there was a small unit of young soldiers that were led by a 15 - year - old boy who was the \ " lucky \ " boyfriend of three or four girls and who often used to smoke a huge cannabis cigarette .
\ " These guys ( mostly 10 - 12 year olds ) like to cut the enemy to pieces after they were dead .
Not very sporting chaps , \ " he mentions in his book .
Air Travel
Another contributor to the list of the worst the world of travel can offer is Pauline Frommer from the United States .
She is the author of guidebooks that bear her name .
According to Frommer , the worst airline in the world is Air Pakistan \ " with duct tape holding together seats , cockroaches in the aisles\ " .
Johnny Jet , a travel writer , says about his less enjoyable trip to Fiji .
He has taken Sun Air which turned out to be the worst airline he has ever taken .
\ " Everything was smooth on my puddle jump ride to Savusavu until we went over the mountain range , \ " he says .
Jet says that when they hit turbulence , the plane\'s alarm went off and the aircraft suddenly dropped .
\ " I had to pound my heart a couple of times to start that sucker back up once we flattened out , \ " he said .
In addition , throughout his trips to different countries , he picked Tijuana as the worst place he has ever been , describing it as a place that is dirty , depressing and full of people that just wait for the moment to rip you off .
The Smelly Side
Tourists also accuse toilets , which are very likely to spoil the whole vacation .
For example , Larry Habegger , a traveler who visited a lot of countries , believes that the filthiest toilet he saw was in Jogjakarta , Java .
For the popular American travel photographer Catherine Watson the dirtiest and most unpleasant was \ " The dank , filthy , unlighted ruin of a public ladies room in central Bucharest , before Ceaucescu\ 's horrid government fell . \ "
She says there was no toilet paper , no soap , no sign of feminine hygiene products not only in Bucharest but in the whole Romania .
Well , at least now things somewhat changed to a better side .
Profitable Business
The data provided by the World Tourism Organization in 2008 , the figure representing international tourist arrivals registered a two percent increase and reach the point of 924 million , a 16 percent increase from the previous year .
In 2007 international tourism brought $ 856 billion , which is about a third of the exports of services provided around the globe .
The World Tourism Organization predicts that by 2020 international tourism will register 1.6 billion travelers a year .
The frequent claims by Gaza 's 1.5 million residents that they live in a " big prison " have become a cliché .
But they have been given fresh force by new Israeli procedures that make it virtually impossible for Palestinians to leave Gaza even to reunite with their spouses and children in the West Bank .
The Israeli government has recently eased movement within the West Bank for Palestinians .
But a new and classified Israeli government document reveals that already heavy restrictions on Palestinian movement from Gaza to the West Bank have been tightened further .
The document came to light after a Supreme Court challenge by the Israeli human rights organisation HaMoked .
It says the Deputy Defence Minister Matan Vilnai " established that in every case involving the settlement of Gaza residents in the Judaea and Samaria area [ West Bank ] one should adopt the most restrictive policy ... [ and he ] clarified that a family relationship in and of itself does not qualify as a humanitarian reason that would justify settlement by Gaza residents [ in the West Bank ] " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
HaMoked and another human rights organisation , Gisha , are convinced that security has nothing to do with a policy which they say undermines a two - state solution by " deepening and formalising " the separation between the two territories .
While the military say the Gazans are among thousands living " illegally " in the West Bank , Gisha and HaMoked say the policy directly violates provisions in the 16 - year - old Oslo accords to treat the West Bank and Gaza as a " single territorial unit " and ignores the " basic " rights of Palestinian civilians to live in either .
The criteria impose an – unspecified – quota on Gazans allowed to leave and mean that even a child with one dead parent cannot join the other in the West Bank if he has another relative in Gaza to look after him .
Joel Greenberg , spokesman for HaMoked , calls it " a one - way ticket to an area Israel is well rid of , unlike the West Bank , where it has territorial claims " .
A request for comment to Mr Vilnai 's spokeswoman was eventually passed on to the Office for Co-ordination of Government Activities in the Territories .
While declining to comment on the policy , it said that Samir Abu Yusef along with Kawkab and Nisrin Jilo [ see right ] had been barred from leaving Gaza for " security reasons " .
But Gisha said that no security allegations had ever been made against the three in their dealings with the military on their behalf .
Sari Bashi , Gisha 's director , added : " Where there are security allegations , that is the first , second , and only thing they mention . "
Jamal Bardawil : ' I 've never seen my son '
Jamal Bardawil supports his wife Hadil and their two children , Sami , almost two , and Isra , almost three , by working as an electrician from his sister 's house in the West Bank .
But he has never seen Sami , who , his mother says , calls the telephone " Baba " – daddy .
Mr Bardawil has signed a document undertaking not to return to the West Bank , so he can go back to Gaza .
But yesterday he said he had reconsidered and is seeking instead a permit to allow him to visit his family and return to his job in the West Bank .
The Israeli human rights group HaMoked is looking into petitioning the Supreme Court for a ruling that he can do so , having failed to secure one to relocate his family .
Unlike those who have been deported to Gaza , Mr Bardawil can at least stay in his mother 's house , where his wife is living .
But it is small consolation .
" There is no opportunity to work in Gaza , " he says .
" It 's like a prison .
I 'll have nothing to do there .
I 'll get coupons and support from the UN [ refugee agency ] until they open the crossings . "
He claims the Israeli stance is that " we will pressure him until we defeat him psychologically and he will decide to go to Gaza . "

Samir abu Yusef : ' If I became an informer , I 'd be allowed to go back '
Until his world fell apart two years ago , Samir abu Yusef was doing well .
Having left Gaza in 1994 amid the optimism generated by the Oslo accords to spend three years at an industrial training centre in Jericho , he had settled in Qalqilya , was married to a local woman , Kawther , and had four children , his own carpentry business and a house of his own .
It was coming home on 10 February 2007 , after slipping into Israel on a job , that it all ended .
Passing through the Jajuliya checkpoint on his way back to the city , he was told by border police to produce his ID card .
A few hours later he was in the back of a military jeep speeding to the Erez crossing into Gaza .
He has not seen his family – or had a day 's work – since .
Arrested , Mr Abu Yusef begged to be allowed to go home .
He says an intelligence agent told him that if he collaborated with Israeli security forces he could rejoin his family .
" He said : ' I do n't want big things , just little ones like who 's thieving and so on . '.
But I knew this would only be the beginning .
I refused . "
Even after he returned to his brothers ' crowded home in Nusseirat refugee camp , Shin Bet kept calling him , inviting him to be an informer .
" If I said yes I would be able to go back , " he says .
His brother Qassem , 40 , a member of the Fatah - dominated PA security forces who are still being paid from Ramallah , is – humiliatingly – his sole source of support .
He says of Samir , his younger brother : " Sometimes we hear him crying at night . "
Describing how he took a call from his nine - year old son Bassem 's school after the Gaza war started in January , Samir Abu Yusef says : " The head said the students should pray for the martyrs in Gaza .
Bassem started crying and saying that his father was a martyr . "
The school asked Mr Abu Yusef to reassure him by telephone that he was still alive .
Meanwhile , his wife Kawther , 32 , with two elderly parents to look after , depends on donations from neighbours and is facing unpaid bills and a debt of more than £ 1,500 at the couple 's Qaliqilya home .
Pointing out that he was fully supporting his family when he was still in the West Bank , Mr Abu Yusef says : " I want to appeal personally to [ Middle East Quartet envoy ]
Tony Blair to help me get back home .
I am not trying to live in Tel Aviv or Haifa .
I just want to go back to Qalqilya . "
Kawther Abu Yusef adds : " The Israelis do n't want people in the West Bank ; they want them in Gaza .
They are using Gaza as a dumping place .!
Nisrin Jilo : ' They only know my voice '
Recently Nisrin Jilo dreamt that " I was playing with my children and they were sitting on my lap .
I woke up but I wanted to get back to sleep so I could go back to the dream . "
In reality Nisrin , 27 , has n't seen her children Wadi'ya , now four , and Rouand , 12 , since she was summarily deported two years to Gaza after being stopped at an Israeli checkpoint outside the West Bank city of Qalqilya two years ago .
Her offence : carrying a Palestinian ID showing her as a Gaza resident .
Very poor , and having moved from house to house to lodge with various relatives in Gaza over the past two years , she can only afford to telephone the children twice a week .
" They only know me from the phone , " says Nisrin .
" They do n't know my face , only my voice . "
Nisrin has no idea if or when she will ever see her children again .
Although her family is originally from Gaza , her parents moved to the West Bank 14 years ago .
Separated from her husband but happy amidst her extended family , Nisrin , along with her mother , Kawkab , and a young sister Fide , 15 , travelled back that fateful day by taxi from a visit to a sick married sister in the East Jerusalem suburb of Aram .
On the return journey they arrived at the Jajuliya checkpoint .
They were told they were going back to Gaza .
" I said : ' We live in Qalqilya .
My family own a house there .
My mother and I pay our bills to the municipality . '
I was crying because they were deporting me from my children .
But they said they had orders from high .
They put us in a jeep and took us to [ the ] Erez [ crossing into Gaza ] . "
For Kawkab Jilo , 45 , the deportation was equally traumatic .
For while she is a grandmother , her three youngest children are all under 16 .
Mrs Jilo wept as she described a recent conversation with her youngest daughter , Sabrin , 11 , who after good progress in school , has now failed her year - end exams .
" She told me ' do n't be angry I failed .
I always think of you .
When you get back I will pass ' . "
Back in Qalqilya , Sabrin 's sister Suha , 15 , explains that even when her mother phones from Gaza , " If we have a problem at a school I will not tell my mother because she is in Gaza and she will just worry .
We do n't have a person who tells what is right and what is wrong . "
Could Nisrin bring the family , including her sick father , to a poverty - stricken and war - ravaged Gaza ?
She is incredulous .
" We are 25 in Qalqilya and just three women here .
Shall we bring the whole family because of three ?
We have nothing here . "

My godfather Barry has taught / demonstrated / told horror stories for years about the wrong way to handle peppers , but I did n’t take it seriously .
Use rubber gloves to remove the seeds and throw those suckers down the drain .
Keep all surfaces clean : knife , cutting board , you name it .
Don ’ t run the disposal or you will be walking around inhaling stinging air for an hour ; this stuff does not mess around .
And stay clear of your eyes– have someone else remove the gloves for you .
I spent 30 minutes blind and naked in a freezing shower pouring milk on my face and had a rash develop on my forearms the next day .
I ’m not kidding !!!
** Do n’t use a dishtowel you love .
I had one stained orange from the juices of the red peppers .
Targeting the Taliban 's heartland US forces launching a major offensive in the Afghan province of Helmand say that they have encountered fierce Taliban resistance .
Brig Larry Nicholson told the AFP news agency on Friday that his soldiers were in a " hell of a fight " and were facing " difficult challenges " .
Elsewhere in Helmand US commanders say they have met little resistance .
US Marines say Operation Khanjar , or Strike of the Sword , is intended to seize the lower Helmand River valley .
More than 700 UK troops have also launched a major offensive against insurgent strongholds in southern Afghanistan .
The province of Helmand is considered to be the heartland of the Taliban insurgency .
Map : Helmand river valley region
It is also a major poppy - producing area for the production of opium , which helps fund their activities .
Correspondents say that it is no surprise that much of the initial phase of the operation by some 4,000 Marines has met with little resistance , because that is a common tactic by insurgents .
The hard part will be winning support in a region where there are few foreigners , correspondents say .
Marine Capt Bill Pelletier told the AP news agency that the lack of resistance in the mission 's first phase could change in coming days .
He said that that the primary objective of the offensive was not to kill the Taliban but to win the hearts and minds of the local population , who remain suspicious of outsiders .
" We are not worried about the Taliban , we are not focused on them .
We are focused on the people , " Capt Pelletier said .
" It is important to engage with the key leaders , hear what they need most and what are their priorities . "
The US forces were ferried in by relays of helicopters on Thursday to the southern Helmand districts of Garmsir and Nawa .
They also helped Afghan forces take Khanishin , near the border with Pakistan , officers said .
" Today Marines are continuing to move towards those objectives that are still out there and they are going to work to stabilise security in these areas , " Lt Kurt Stahl told AFP .
The Marines are at the forefront of President Barack Obama 's new plan to fight the insurgency in Afghanistan , with an emphasis on protecting the population ahead of presidential elections on 20 August .
" When Marines go out into towns , they are always looking for opportunities to talk to village elders and explain why they are here , " Lt Stahl said .
" The intention is to understand each other , elders can express their concerns and an open flow of communication is secured . "
The BBC 's defence correspondent says that US commanders hope the offensive will help turn the tide in the current stalemate against the Taliban .
The aim is to " clear , hold and build " in areas under Taliban influence ahead of the presidential elections .
OPERATION 'KHANJAR '
About 4,000 US and 650 Afghan troops deployed to Helmand river valley
Initial operations focused on villages of Nawa and Garmsir near the provincial capital Lashkar Gah
British operation recently recaptured the village of Babaji from the Taliban to the north of the region

Warm and revealing book about the great distortion of climate science
You might think that there are already many books about climate change on the market .
But Ralph Alexander 's book is special and unusually appropriate for both beginners and experts in the field because of its balanced attitude to the problem .
That does n't mean that Dr Alexander ends up with a " mixed " answer to the basic question .
Just like a majority of books on the subject , Dr Alexander makes the readers understand that the global warming alarm is almost completely an artifact of manipulation with the human psychology and with the data .
But unlike the case of many other books , you will see that Dr Alexander is actually a mainstream scientist ( and an applied scientist in the environmental sector ) who cares about the good name and functioning of science .
Years ago , he was inclined to believe the " general wisdom " about the problem .
His diametrically opposite conclusions are a result of his long research of the problem .
And his pride of a scientist has been hurt .
Climatology has become an ugly example of a scientific discipline that has largely ceased to be scientific .
Dr Alexander determines that the " ring " and the international character of the IPCC , the climate panel of the United Nations , are the main drivers of the hysteria so the IPCC , its process , and its reports are the main players investigated by this text .
He analyzes the history and structure of the IPCC and finds out that this panel is just a particular and heavily funded group of loud partisans and activists that is meant to defend a predetermined conclusion and that does n't reflect the scientific opinion of the world 's scientific community , at least its financially and otherwise unbiased part , and certainly not the available body of data .
Lots of numbers about the percentages of the scientist who agree and disagree with various statements are included .
The following chapters are dedicated to the standard topics in this debate : an introduction to the enhanced greenhouse effect and why it cannot account for most of the climate variability ; computer models as the main basis underlying the alarm and their flaws ; the CO2 and temperature records and reconstructions , their comparisons , and their flaws ( including the urban heat effect ) ; cherry - picking in various " concerned " studies ; the interactions with politics ( in both directions ) ; corruption of the conventional peer review process ; the biased IPCC evaluation of the climate sensitivity ( warming from CO2 doubling ) ; the lag in the correlation showing that the temperature is a driver , not an effect , of trace gas concentrations ; solar , oceanic , cosmic , and other natural drivers that have to be crucial ( even though the author honestly says that science does n't yet understand their precise and separate effects ) ; the high possibility of a cooling in the 21st century .
A significant portion of the text is also concerned with the economic consequences of the alarm ; the failures of the cap - and - trade systems in the past , the differences between various countries ; and the false hopes in green , luxurious sources of energy .
The book contains many wise stories and analogies from the history , useful data from the present , some jokes , and black - and - white pages that summarize the IPCC claims and their flaws in various sections .
Two appendices discuss the feedbacks and the effect of Pacific Decadal Oscillation .
And indeed , Dr Alexander had to include some equations , too .
The book has a short glossary , 30 pages of technical endnotes ( including many references that do n't disturb you in the main text ) , and an index .
At any rate , it is quite an amazing piece of work that is fun to read - because of its detailed data , its convincing case , and warm style - and I wholeheartedly recommend you to buy it and read it .
Back in high school , I had too much free time , so I decided to play a joke on my computer teacher .
I created an exact clone of the school 's DOS system using QBasic .
It would pretend to execute three commands : DIR , DEL *.* , and FORMAT .
The simulation was so realistic that during development , I was kicked out of the lab .
Usually students would be playing Secret Agent or Jill of the Jungle .
The day arrived when my project was ready to be unleashed upon the world .
I waited until the teacher was hovering nearby and then I started my application , running the FORMAT command on the network drive .
Some classmates were watching the screen and she hurried over to see what all the fuss was about .
The reaction was immediate .
She stared at the screen , eyes wide open , and mouth agape , as the terrible seconds ticked by .
At that moment I regretted my deception and tried to abort the demo .
But QBasic did n't understand CTRL-C during the SLEEP command .
Pressing CTRL -C just interrupted the current SLEEP , so it caused the percentage to advance faster .
I had to hold down the abort keys and wait until it advanced to 100 % before I could prove that everything was really okay .
But then it said :
Unable to read from drive X :
Abort , Retry , Fail ? _
That was the closest I 've ever come to being murdered .
SACRAMENTO — Sacramento police have arrested a 19 - year - old man in connection with the death of a cat killed with explosives .
David Yang was arrested Wednesday .
Police say Yang tied up a cat with tape Tuesday night , trapped it with a construction cone on a street and then dropped an explosive device or firecracker into the cone .
The cat died in the blast .
Police spokesman Sgt. Norm Leong said police initially thought a few other teenagers were involved in the crime , but after an investigation determined that Yang was primarily responsible .
Yang is being held on a charge of malicious maiming of an animal .
Bail is set at $ 40,000 and he is scheduled to appear in court Friday .

Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson is facing new controversy after making more offensive comments about the prime minister , Gordon Brown , two weeks running in front of the hit BBC2 show 's studio audience , MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal .
Clarkson , who previously had to apologise to the prime minister in February after calling him " a one - eyed Scottish idiot " , is understood to have described Brown as a " cunt " in not - for - broadcast comments to the studio audience during the recording of this week 's Top Gear programme on Wednesday night .
At the filming of the previous week 's Top Gear , on Wednesday 15 July , Clarkson also called Brown a " cunt " as part of a joke he made in front of the studio audience , one person present told MediaGuardian.co.uk .
This remark was not included in the transmitted version of the show on Sunday , 19 July .
The BBC2 controller , Janice Hadlow , was present at the second recording this Wednesday and is said to have confronted Clarkson about the remark .
A BBC spokeswoman confirmed that the pair had a " conversation " , but said the issue was now over .
" There was a discussion about the programme , " she said .
" It is certainly not an ongoing issue . "
It is understood that Hadlow did not ask Clarkson to apologise for the incident .
In a further statement , the BBC said : " Janice went to watch a recording of Top Gear as it is BBC2's top-rated programme , and as controller of BBC2 , she holds both the programme and Jeremy in high regard .
After the recording , she and Jeremy had a discussion about the programme as controllers and presenters often do . "
Downing Street declined to comment .
Clarkson is currently in Belfast , where he is filming for Top Gear in the city 's new sewer system .
His manager had not returned calls before publication .
This week 's episode of Top Gear , which airs on BBC2 on Sunday at 8 pm , features AC / DC singer Brian Johnson as the star in a reasonably priced car .
Clarkson and his co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May will also be attempting to buy a pre-1982 car at auction with a budget of £ 3,000 each and taking part in a classic car rally in Majorca .
During a press conference in February in Australia , Clarkson compared Brown to Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd , after Rudd had just addressed the country on the global financial crisis .
" It 's the first time I 've ever seen a world leader [ Rudd ] admit we really are in deep shit , " Clarkson was reported as saying in the Australian newspaper .
" He genuinely looked terrified .
Poor man , he 's actually seen the books .
We have this one - eyed Scottish idiot who keeps telling us everything 's fine and he 's saved the world , and we know he 's lying but he 's smooth at telling us . "
Clarkson , whose Sunday Times columns are syndicated in the Weekend Australian , was referring to Brown , who lost his sight in one eye in an accident playing rugby as a teenager .
Clarkson was forced to apologise after a barrage of criticism from politicians and disability groups .
In a statement , he said : " In the heat of the moment I made a remark about the prime minister 's personal appearance for which , upon reflection , I apologise . "
Clarkson is no stranger to controversy .
In November last year he opened the latest series of Top Gear by suggesting that truck drivers only cared about fuel prices and murdering prostitutes , drawing hundreds of complaints .
The presenter and his Top Gear co-hosts were also condemned by the BBC Trust in July for " glamourising the misuse of alcohol " by drinking at the wheel during a Polar special .
The BBC Trust 's editorial complaints unit said a special edition of the motoring show , aired in July 2007 , in which Clarkson and May attempted to drive a pickup truck to the magnetic north pole , broke its guidelines .
In the programme , Clarkson and May were shown drinking gin and tonics as they raced Hammond , who was using a sled pulled by a team of dogs , to reach the pole .

IOU One More Piece of Paper Money
California has so degraded itself into a laughably Leftist socialist / commie -
think nightmare that they have , as all socialist / commie - think countries always
do , finally bankrupted itself .
As Margaret
Thatcher , erstwhile prime minister of
England , once said , “ The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out
of other people ’s money . ” Hahaha !
Exactly !
And now California has run out of money !
Exactly !
Now , to demonstrate their complete worthlessness as thinking , rational beings ,
California has decided that it will not cut expenses overmuch , but will pay
for things not with money , but with IOUs !
Hahaha !
IOUs !
Hahahaha !
There is Something Beyond Surreal ( SMS ) about all this , and it ’s that very
farcical stupidity that explains why hyperventilating conspiracy theorists like
me come up with the weird conspiracy theories that we do ; it is just too
damned weird to be real !
I mean , the fiat currency of the USA has been so abused by over - issuance that
it has lost about 96 % of its purchasing power since the loathsome Federal
Reserve took over in 1913 , and is now about to be reprised by California
issuing another paper money !
Hahaha !
Paper money everywhere !
The state
with two fiat currencies !
Hahaha !
This may have something to do with how California has seen a precipitous
drop in tax revenues , which in turn may have something to do with the Labor
Department releasing its Metropolitan Area Employment report which shows
that “ In May , 112 metropolitan areas reported jobless rates of at least 10.0
percent , ” which I admit does not have much to do with California until we get
to the part where El Centro , Calif. , “ recorded the highest unemployment rate ,
26.8 percent , ” and “ Among the 15 areas with job - less rates of at least 15.0
percent , 7 were located in California . ”
This is , as Margaret Thatcher said , because Californians have run out of money
to support everyone who ever walked up with their hand out looking for a free
lunch , and the wealthy people in California are leaving the state to keep from
having everything they have taxed away .
Bummer !
Actually , California is a beautiful place unfortunately populated by Leftist
idiots , and as such is but a pale microcosm of the Whole Freaking Country
( WFC ) , and as a result , as Bill Bonner here at The Daily Reckoning said ,
“ America ’s position relative to the rest of the world is weak and in decline .
She is not a creditor ; she is a debtor .
She is not a low - cost competitor ; she is a
high - cost competitor .
She no longer has a free and flexible economy ; she has
one freighted with central planners , regulators and busybodies . ”
And California is not the only one hurting , as Byron King of Outstanding
Investments writes that everybody has taken a whack to the wallet , as “ There ’s
no disputing the extraordinary shock to household wealth in the US .
From mid-
2007 to March 2009 , according to the Federal Reserve , household net worth
plunged $ 14 trillion , or 21.5 % . ”
A fifth !
A fifth of everything we thought we had is gone !
In fact , most of the losses were recent , as “ Just during the second half of 2008 ,
household net worth plummeted nearly $ 8 trillion – with an eye - popping $ 4.9
trillion dip in the fourth quarter . ”
Wow !
No wonder people are being laid off !
No wonder spending is down !
No
wonder we are screwed !
Until next time ,
The Mogambo Guru

08:05 am - Dream : The Annoying Dead
We were looking at houses .
This one seemed just about right - good size , nice yard , nearby shopping - and we were starting to talk price when C looked out the window .
" Is that ... a zombie ? "
She pointed : a shambling form had emerged onto the street from a yard on the other side , draped in torn clothes , twitching and grunting in an all - too - familiar way .
The realtor made a horrified face .
" Oh ... no !
Certainly not .
This is a nice neighborhood .
There 's no ... " but just then , one of the neighbors came down the street in their car , striking the lurching form in the side and scattering it into pieces all over the place .
The realtor put her face in her hands .
" The city will have that cleaned up in no time , I promise , " she tried hopefully .
C shook her head and I nodded in agreement .
" We 're going to keep looking . "
Call us livists if you want to , but you know it 's true : once a neighborhood starts getting one or two of the Dead , it 's just a matter of time before the whole place is overrun .
Humanity - living humanity , I mean - had been forced into a perpetual , irritated nomadic existence , always having to sell at a loss and buying somewhere else every time the Dead ruined another nice place .
The last place we 'd lived , it had gotten so that you could n't even go out to your car to leave for work without mussing up your clothes and stumbling down your own driveway , groaning and spitting , pretending to be one of them so that they would n't rise from where they were all lying around - on your porch , in your flowerbed , draped over the hood of the car , in the gutter - and make a sudden lunge for your throat .
Sure , you could shoot them in the head .
But their putrescent remains were like a beacon for more of their kind .
And there were sometimes unfortunate social side - effects of that solution .
Once , at a Mardi Gras street party , two hideous , reeking figures had shambled out of the dark at me .
" Are you alive ? " I asked , repeatedly , but all they could do was mumble and shake .
When one reached for me , I drew and put a pair of .45s into each of their heads .
All the fresh red blood had been a tremendous shock and the crowd began to scream .
They were n't Dead , they were just too drunk to make any sense .
Manslaughter .
That had been a pretty bad time , but at least there was a valuable lesson demonstrated : do n't get so incapacitated in public that people can't distinguish you from a walking corpse .
Anyway , as C and I got back in our car , I looked around and saw , yeah , the Dead were already here : in the dark shade of that tree , underneath that SUV , tucked in among those bushes .
They were craftier , here , hiding themselves more effectively .
You might not see them until you were right next to them and then they'd be right on top of you .
Were we losing this war ?
Were they going to keep getting better and better at blending in until we could no longer spot them ?
I tried not to think about .
We 'd keep looking .
We 'd keep looking until we 'd found a place where the Dead could never go .
That 's all we wanted .
Really , I think , that 's all anyone wants anymore .

A local architect thinks it is a good idea to add a roof to the Gardiner Expressway that could be turned into a park with trees , bike paths and concession stands – while cars would zip along underneath .
The plan comes from Les Klein , founding principal at Quadrangle Architects and was unveiled this morning at Moses Znaimer 's ideaCity , the annual conference of thinkers .
Klein 's firm is best known for taking old buildings and giving them new life .
Examples include the BMW showroom near the Don Valley Parkway and 299 Queen St. W. , the CHUM - Citytv building .
" I 've been appalled at the folly of taking down the Gardiner , " Klein told the Star in advance of his speech .
" It 's about thinking innovatively , keeping it , adding on to it , renovating it , and renewing it .
That 's the fundamental part of the organic growth of cities . "
His idea , dubbed the Green Ribbon , calls for the addition of a new level about 8 metres above the highway 's elevated section from Dufferin St. to the Don Valley Parkway .
Columns would be added to the side to anchor a new level , which would become a linear park stretching for 7 kilometres .
The estimated costs range from $ 500 million to $ 600 million .
" I happen to love old structures .
I 'm not in love with every old structure .
They have to have good bones , but the Gardiner has great bones , " Klein said , noting it is also a critical traffic artery that hundreds of commuters depend on daily .
Over the years , various ideas have been floated for the expressway , which first opened in 1965 and was named for former Metro Toronto chair Fred Gardiner .
While some have advocated for its teardown , calling it an eyesore and a barrier to the waterfront , others have touted solutions such as creating a park underneath or tunnelling the expressway .
None of those proposals have gathered steam , though Toronto Mayor David Miller and Waterfront Toronto officials support a plan to tear down a section just east of Jarvis St. , saying it is fundamental for the waterfront 's redevelopment .
An environmental assessment is underway on that proposal , with a final decision not expected before 2011 .
The price tag is projected at $ 300 million .
Given that the city has just recently endorsed a policy of mandatory green roofs on buildings of a certain size and height , Klein thinks that 's exactly what the Gardiner needs .
It would also include solar panels and wind turbines to power new lighting along Lake Shore Blvd. , which would also be beautified and made pedestrian - friendly .
" The bottom line is , instead of tearing down the Gardiner and sending hundreds of tonnes of material to landfill , and losing this critical connection to tie our city together , let 's put a roof on it , " he said , adding he has discussed his idea with some city councillors , though not with Waterfront Toronto officials .
The benefits include reduced maintenance costs and improved public safety for the highway because it would be covered - eliminating the need for snow plowing and salting .
The lack of penetrating rain and salt would reduce corrosion and deterioration of the roadway , a large expense in itself .
Other cities have used the same principle .
There 's a thriving market below the Queensboro Bridge in New York , and Manhattan 's west side now boasts High Line Park , built on an abandoned elevated rail track .

The Gardiner was a symbol of progress when it opened more than 40 years ago , and Klein believes it would be a shame to remove it .
" If you tear it down now , it is gone , " he said .
" I just think it would be horrible waste , because it 's a great piece of civic architecture .
It serves a vital function . "

『新常用漢 字(仮称) 試案の字体における問題点』の読者から、文化審議会国語分科会漢字小委員会が使っているMS明朝は、ver5.00でもver2.50でもver2.31でもなく、幻のver3.00なのではないか、という指摘があった。
MS明朝ver3.00は2005年にリコーが開発したフォントで、PAGE2006でその一部が公開されたが、結局VistaではMS明朝ver5.00までバージョンが上がってしまった、という幻のフォントだ。確かにそう言われてみると、たとえば2008年7月15日の漢字小委員会の資料2は、全体としてはMS明朝っぽいのだが、「茨」の字体がかなり微妙だ。ver2.xとは4画目が違うし、ver5.00とは5画目が違う。幻のver3.00の字形にすこぶる近い。
だとすると、新常用漢字表( 仮称 ) 試案の「 鬭」も、MS明朝ver2.31ではなく、あるいはMS明朝ver3.00かもしれない。というのも「鬭」は、ver3.00ではver2.31と同じ字形( JIS X 0212の74-18例示字形に由来)だったが、ver5.00で字形が変更(JIS X 0213の1-94-31例示字形に由来)されたからだ。でも、それにしても漢字小委員会は、MS明朝ver3.00なんて幻のフォント、どこで手にいれたんだろう？
Five days ago , the Appfrica tech blog reported an Internet blackout in Benin , a West African country roughly the size of Ohio .
The outage , which also affected neighboring Togo , Niger and Nigeria , was caused by damage to the SAT - 3 submarine communications cable , which links Portugal and Spain to South Africa via the West African coastline .
The Internet blackout left Benin , Togo and Niger without an optical fiber link to the outside world , meaning Internet users in these countries have been forced to rely on rare , expensive satellite connections to get online .
Appfrica managing editor Theresa Carpenter Sondjo , who is based in Benin , writes :
The line to use the computers runs out the door .
Every computer is taken , and most have two or three people hovering over its operator .
I am the only woman .
In Nigeria , the damage to the SAT - 3 cable has affected approximately 70 percent of the country 's bandwidth , " crippling " bank services and Internet access .
Access issues in the country are further complicated by the failure of Nigerian telecommunications operator Nitel to pay its dues to the SAT - 3 Consortium , which has disconnected the Nigerian end of the cable .
Speaking yesterday to Nigeria 's Business Day , Lanre Ajayi , the president of the Nigeria Internet Group , described the cable as " a critical national resource because of its importance to the economy and to security . "
Ajayi has called on the government to declare the SAT - 3 cable a " critical national infrastructure . "
When damage to the FLAG and SEA - ME - WE 4 undersea cable systems disrupted service in the Middle East and South Asia , knocking out a substantial percentage of Internet activity in Egypt , India and several other countries , operators were able to reroute service and continue to provide access .
In West Africa , rerouting is more difficult : SAT - 3 is the only cable connecting the region to the rest of the world , and telecoms operators must negotiate deals with neighboring countries to direct Internet traffic overland until it reaches another country 's landing cable .
Benin 's landing cable services all four countries affected by the damage .
Benin has managed to work out an alternate path that routes traffic through the landing cable in Côte d'Ivoire , but Togo and Niger are unable to afford the necessary deals .
They will likely have to rely on satellite access until a repair ship , on its way from South Africa , reaches Benin and fixes the cable .
The blackout is expected to last at least 10 days in total .
Strangely , news of the blackout has yet to reach the international media .
Though Internet penetration rates in the affected countries are low — Nigeria is the highest , at 7.3 percent ; with Togo ( 5.4 percent ) , Benin ( 1.9 percent ) and Niger ( 0.5 percent ) following — a blackout of this scale seems to deserve more attention than it 's gotten thus far .
The lack of press coverage begs the question : if the Internet disappears in four countries , but the countries are in Africa , is it still a story ?

The UN food agency says it is facing critical funding shortages that have forced it to cut aid deliveries to millions of people facing starvation .
The World Food Programme ( WFP ) said it could have to close parts of its airway , used to fly aid workers to humanitarian trouble - spots .
Deliveries have already been suspended to north Uganda , Ivory Coast and Niger .
The organisation has issued similar warnings in the past when facing funding shortages .
The UN Humanitarian Air Service ( UNHAS ) , operated by WFP , has a budget for 2009 of $ 160 m ( £ 96 m ) but has received less than $ 90 m in fees and contributions this year .
WFP spokesman Greg Barrow said UNHAS was " a vital component of humanitarian operations across the world " .
" But because of a funding shortfall there is now a grave risk that the air service ... could literally be grounded in the next few weeks due to a lack of funds , " he said .
Closures
WFP said funding for the airline 's Chad service will run out on 15 August and needs $ 6.7 m ( £ 4 m ) to continue flying to the end of the year .
Spokeswoman Emilia Casella said the single - plane service flies an average of 4,000 humanitarian passengers to and from Chad each month .
She said the cancellation would not stop food deliveries taking place , but would mean that aid workers would not be able to reach communities that need them most .
The service supplying Liberia , Sierra Leone and Guinea needs $ 3.3 m ( £ 1.9 m ) to continue flying to the end of the year .
Pierre Carrasse , Chief of WFP's Aviation Branch , asked how workers could reach the often remote areas affected by conflict without the airline .
" How will WFP reach the hungry ?
How will doctors reach their patients ?
How will people have clean water if the engineers who help to build wells can't get there , " he asked .
Shortages have already led to UNHAS closing its service in Ivory Coast in February .
The Niger service , also suspended that month , is expected to resume in August after a recent donation from the UN Common Emergency Relief Fund .
The UN says 102 million people in 78 countries received food aid last year .
Recent estimates of the high cost of reforming the health care system leave out one critical detail :
If the reform included a strong public health care option , it could actually save trillions of dollars over time , while also providing universal coverage .
The Congressional Budget Office , which has attached a massive price tag to health care reform , based its findings on incomplete proposals from the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pension ( HELP ) and Finance Committees , leading many to argue that reform efforts must be abandoned or scaled back .
Neither of those proposals includes the creation of a public plan .
While a public plan would indeed likely raise the level of federal government health spending , it is just as likely to reduce total national health spending .
Independent research evaluating proposals produced by EPI and other sources has consistently found that a public plan would save money and result in better health outcomes by providing all Americans regular access to health care .
Trying to minimize the government ’s investment in health reform does nothing but erode the opportunity for true cost - savings in the American health care sector .
This is almost the very definition of penny - wise , pound - foolish .
EPI ’s 2007 briefing paper Health Care for America outlines a proposal for guaranteed , affordable health care in which all Americans who lacked access to workplace coverage would have the option to buy into a public health care plan .
As part of the proposal , employers who did not provide coverage to their workers would be required to make a payroll - based contribution to help finance coverage for their workers , who would have the option of enrolling in a public health care plan .
An independent analysis of that proposal by The Lewin Group , a health care policy research and management consulting firm , found it could save $ 1 trillion over 10 years , while providing essentially universal coverage .
Some of the other reasons a strong public plan option is essential include :
- Competition American health care today has limited or no competition .
A public plan would force private insurers to compete on the basis of efficiency as well as quality , rather than how they often compete today , which is on their ability to select the healthiest individuals and companies or pass costs to employers and workers .
If the cost or the coverage of a private plan became unsatisfactory , there would be a large - scale shift to the public plan , and vice versa .
- Reduced costs
Since a public health insurance plan would have much lower administrative expenses and could take advantage of its size for negotiating more efficient prices and building economies of scale , it would have significantly lower operating costs , resulting in windfall savings .
- Quality A public insurance plan would be able to introduce quality enhancements and innovations that profit - seeking private plans currently do not have the incentive to adopt , given the short - term commitments to their enrollees .
- Access
While the majority of Americans have employer - sponsored health insurance , this coverage has eroded in recent years and it still leaves tens of millions with no insurance , underscoring the need for a system that can provide more comprehensive coverage .
Even among full - time workers , 17 % do not have insurance .
Many more lose coverage each year , at least temporarily , when they leave their jobs – a problem that becomes more widespread in times of high unemployment .
- Good health Besides being the ultimate objective of a health care system , keeping people healthy is far more cost - effective than treating them once they become ill .
However , people with spotty insurance coverage or no coverage at all are more likely to forego needed medical attention and preventive care , resulting in poorer health outcomes , which also drive up health care costs .

We 're in suspense !
At Ensemble Press , you decide what happens next .
I recently produced a film , called " Money - Driven Medicine , " based on the book of the same name by Maggie Mahar , which looks at the way that our business model for medicine has badly damaged the patient doctor relationship .
" What 's that ? " you may say .
I thought that it was those damn government bureaucrats that were trying to get in between me and my doctor .
Well , the director of this film , Andy Fredericks , followed doctors all over the country who are deeply frustrated that the current system , whose goals favor profits over good , efficient and humane health care .
In one scene , for example , a hospital refuses to share a possibly life - saving protocol with another hospital for fear it would lose its " competitive advantage . "
In many other sequences , doctors complain that , in the current system , they are forced to embrace wasteful and expensive ( and extremely profitable ) procedures while patients wonder why it is that they can quickly get expensive tests - like MRIs - but have to wait weeks to see primary care physicians ( who are the most in demand ) because so few doctors can afford to become general practitioners .
" Money - Driven Medicine " explores how a profit - driven health care system squanders billions of health care dollars , while exposing millions of patients to unnecessary or redundant tests , unproven , sometimes unwanted procedures , and over - priced drugs and devices that , too often are no better than the less expensive products that they have replaced .
one out of three roughly one - third of our health care dollars - or nearly $ 600 900 billion of the $ 1.7 $ 2.6 trillion that we spend annually - is wasted on products and procedures that provide no benefit to the patient .
More than two decades of research done by the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice reveals thatroughly one - third of our health care dollars - or nearly $ 900 billion of the $ 2.6 trillion that we spend annually - is wasted on products and procedures that providebenefit to the patient .
" But this is n't just a waste of money .
This is hazardous waste - waste that is hazardous to our health , " says Mahar , a healthcare fellow at the Century Foundation where she writes the
" When a patient is subjected to an ineffective treatment he is , by definition exposed to risk without benefit .
We need to squeeze this waste out of the system .
If we do , we have enough money to provide high quality , affordable and sustainable care for everyone . "
" But this is n't just a waste of money .
This is hazardous waste - waste that is hazardous to our health , " says Mahar , a healthcare fellow at the Century Foundation where she writes the healthbeat blog " When a patient is subjected to an ineffective treatment he is , by definition exposed to risk without benefit .
We need to squeeze this waste out of the system .
If we do , we have enough money to provide high quality , affordable and sustainable care for everyone . "
Here 's a clip from the film , in which Dr. Don Berwick , warns about the dangers of an unregulated competitive " war , " in which , too often , the patient is " collateral damage . "
In the days ahead , as insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms try to prevent any " government interference " in health care , it will be important to remember , that the goal of our health care system is not to reward providers ; it is to deliver the best and most cost - effective health care to patients .
Assuming that profit - oriented corporations always have patients ' best interests at heart could be a fatal mistake .
Sarah Palin 's farewell speech to Alaska / her senses on Friday seemed poorly thought - out and confusing .
After three days and an exhaustive treatment by our crack team of elitist , unreal American textual analysts , it 's — still poorly thought - out and confusing .

Here 's the best we can make of it :
Hi Alaska [ 1 ] , I appreciate speaking directly TO you , the people I serve , as your Governor [ 2 ] .
People who know me know that besides faith and family , nothing 's more important to me than our beloved Alaska .
Serving her people is the greatest honor I could imagine .
I want Alaskans to grasp what can be in store for our state .
We were purchased as a territory because a member of President Abe Lincoln 's cabinet , William Seward , providentially saw in this great land , vast riches , beauty , strategic placement on the globe , and opportunity [ 3 ] .
He boldly looked " North to the Future " .
But he endured such ridicule and mocking for his vision for Alaska , remember the adversaries scoffed , calling this " Seward 's Folly " .
Seward withstood such disdain [ 4 ] as he chose the uncomfortable , unconventional , but RIGHT path to secure Alaska , so Alaska could help secure the United States .
Alaska 's mission – to contribute to America [ 5 ] .
We 're strategic IN the world as the air crossroads OF the world , as a gatekeeper of the continent .
Bold visionaries knew this - Alaska would be part of America 's great destiny .
Our destiny to be reached by responsibly developing our natural resources .
This land , blessed with clean air , water , wildlife , minerals , AND oil and gas .
It 's energy !
God gave us energy [ 6 ] .
So to serve the state is a humbling responsibility , because I know in my soul that Alaska is of such import , for America 's security , in our very volatile world .
And you know me by now , I promised even four years ago to show MY independence … no more conventional " politics as usual " [ 7 ] .
And we are doing well !
My administration 's accomplishments speak for themselves .
We work tirelessly for Alaskans .
We aggressively and responsibly develop our resources because they were created to be used to better our world ... to HELP people ... and we protect the environment and Alaskans ( the resource owners ) foremost with our policies .

1 . The informal greeting signifies both that Palin is a red - blooded , down - to - earth American ( unlike certain hello - saying , term - finishing , snooty liberals ) and that the listeners are not just her constituents , subject to her confusing gubernatorial whims , but also her pals .
2 . Since the speech is currently available on the web , Palin 's team might consider password - protecting it , so that it could be accessed only by patriotic Alaskans , and not by Palin 's critics .
Possible passwords include : barracuda , tinafeysux , death2 moose .
3 . Seward is reported to have said , " This fine northerly territory will afford picturesque and instructive views of Russia . "
Settlers soon found that the ability to " see Russia from their homes " did not improve their understanding of Russo - U.S. relations or global foreign policy in general — hence , the Alaska purchase came to be known as " Seward 's Folly . "
4. Palin's praise for Stewart 's ability to " withstand disdain " is at odds with her own strategy for dealing with detractors , which can best be described as " quitting . "
5. Palin favors the sentence fragment .
As Kitty Burns Florey illustrates in her helpful diagrams of Palin 's sentences , this rhetorical style combines a " folksy " tone with a fundamental disregard for and misunderstanding of the basic conventions of the English language ( cf. George W. Bush ) .
6 . For a better understanding of Palin 's approach to theology , consult the children 's show Veggie Tales .
7 . Here Palin appears to be opting for a broad definition of " politics as usual , " one that includes such outdated conventions as finishing out one 's elected term and completing the job one has promised to do .
Here 's some of the things we 've done : [... ] [ 8 ]
We are doing well !
I wish you 'd hear MORE from the media of your state 's progress and how we tackle Outside interests - daily - SPECIAL interests that would stymie our state .
Even those debt - ridden stimulus dollars that would force the heavy hand of federal government into our communities with an " all - knowing attitude " [ 9 ] – I have taken the slings and arrows with that unpopular move to veto because I know being right is better than being popular [ 10 ] .
Some of those dollars would harm Alaska and harm America – I resisted those dollars because of the obscene national debt we 're forcing our children to pay , because of today 's Big Government spending ; it 's immoral and does n't even make economic sense !
Another accomplishment – our Law Department protected states ' rights – TWO huge U.S. Supreme Court reversals came down against that liberal Ninth Circuit , deciding in OUR state 's favor over the last two weeks .
We 're protectors of our Constitution – federalists protect states ' rights as mandated in 10th amendment .
But you do n't hear much of the good stuff in the press anymore , do you ?
Some say things changed for me on August 29th last year – the day John McCain tapped me to be his running - mate – I say others changed .
Let me speak to that for a minute .
Political operatives descended on Alaska last August , digging for dirt .
The ethics law I championed became their weapon of choice [ 11 ] .
Over the past nine months I 've been accused of all sorts of frivolous ethics violations – such as holding a fish in a photograph , wearing a jacket with a logo on it , and answering reporters ' questions .
Every one – all 15 of the ethics complaints have been dismissed .
We 've won !
But it has n't been cheap - the State has wasted THOUSANDS of hours of YOUR time and shelled out some two million of YOUR dollars to respond to " opposition research " – that 's money NOT going to fund teachers or troopers – or safer roads .
And this political absurdity , the " politics of personal destruction " [ 12 ] …
Todd and I are looking at more than half a million dollars in legal bills in order to set the record straight .
And what about the people who offer up these silly accusations ?
It does n't cost them a dime so they 're not going to stop draining public resources – spending other peoples ' money in their game .
It 's pretty insane – my staff and I spend most of our day dealing with THIS instead of progressing our state now .
I know I promised no more " politics as usual , " but THIS is n't what anyone had in mind for ALASKA .
8 . At this point in the text we have engaged in a common analytical practice known as " cutting out the boring stuff . "
9 . The image of a " hand " with an " all - knowing attitude " is an unusual one , with little precedent in the literature .
Perhaps Palin is envisioning something like this .
10 . Here Palin references Hamlet 's famous soliloquy .
Though Hamlet speaks of " the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , " Palin's " slings and arrows with that unpopular move to veto " is no less poetic .
The Hamlet allusion may also be a coded statement of Palin 's plan to feign madness in order to achieve her political aims .
11 . Again , Palin employs a combination of metaphors that may be confusing to the untrained eye — she seems to be implying that " political operatives " are using weapons made of dirt .
However , such interpretations — or any attempt to impose traditional standards of rhetorical consistency on Palin — can be considered " politics as usual . "
12 . Palin makes an implicit distinction between the " politics of personal destruction " and her approach , which has never been personal or destructive .
If I have learned one thing : LIFE is about choices ! [ 13 ]
And one chooses how to react to circumstances .
You can choose to engage in things that tear down , or build up .
I choose to work very hard on a path for fruitfulness and productivity .
I choose NOT to tear down and waste precious time ; but to build UP this state and our country , and her industrious , generous , patriotic , free people !
Life is too short to compromise time and resources ... it may be tempting and more comfortable to just keep your head down , plod along , and appease those who demand : " Sit down and shut up " , but that 's the worthless , easy path ; that 's a quitter 's way out [ 14 ] .
And a problem in our country today is apathy .
It would be apathetic to just hunker down and " go with the flow " .
Nah , only dead fish " go with the flow " [ 15 ] .
No .
Productive , fulfilled people determine where to put their efforts , choosing to wisely utilize precious time ... to BUILD UP . [...]
I 've never believed that I , nor anyone else , needs a title to do this - to make a difference ... to HELP people [ 16 ] .
So I choose , for my State and my family , more " freedom " to progress , all the way around ... so that Alaska may progress ...
I will not seek re-election as Governor .
And so as I thought about this announcement that I would n't run for re-election and what it means for Alaska , I thought about how much fun some governors have as lame ducks … travel around the state , to the Lower 48 ( maybe ) , overseas on international trade – as so many politicians do .
And then I thought – that 's what 's wrong – many just accept that lame duck status , hit the road , draw the paycheck , and " milk it " [ 17 ] .
I 'm not putting Alaska through that – I promised efficiencies and effectiveness !?
That 's not how I am wired .
I am not wired to operate under the same old " politics as usual . "
I promised that four years ago – and I meant it .
It 's not what is best for Alaska .
I am determined to take the right path for Alaska even though it is unconventional and not so comfortable .

13 .
The growing resemblance between Palin 's style and that of an Onion columnist is presumably unintentional .
14 . Though Palin 's quitting might be seen by laymen as " a quitter 's way out , " trained Palinologists will realize that , by the I 'm - rubber - you 're - glue theorem , calling Palin a quitter is actually a quitter 's way out .
15 .
Ever the innovator , Palin adds the term " dead fish " to the political lexicon , meaning " someone who perseveres in his / her job despite criticism , difficulty , and / or the chance to pursue more television appearances elsewhere . "
16 . Palin's commitment to " helping people " without a " title " will no doubt hold strong throughout her upcoming campaign for President .
17 . Here Palin advances her bold thesis : that serving out the full term for which your constituents elected you is in fact an exploitation of those constituents .
No doubt her time after resignation will consist entirely of delivering barrels of crude oil to impoverished Alaskan families and reuniting baby grizzlies with their mothers , and not of " hitting the road " making public appearances in other , more influential states .
[...]
Let me go back to a comfortable analogy for me - sports ... basketball .
I use it because you 're naïve if you do n't see the national full - court press picking away right now : A good point guard drives through a full court press , protecting the ball , keeping her eye on the basket ... and she knows exactly when to pass the ball so that the team can WIN [ 18 ] .
And I 'm doing that – keeping our eye on the ball that represents sound priorities – smaller government , energy independence , national security , freedom !
And I know when it 's time to pass the ball – for victory .
I have given my reasons candidly and truthfully ... and my last day wo n't be for another few weeks so the transition will be very smooth .
In fact , we will look to swear Sean in - in Fairbanks at the conclusion of our Governor 's picnics .
I do not want to disappoint anyone with my decision ; all I can ask is that you TRUST me with this decision - but it's no more " politics as usual " .
Some Alaskans do n't mind wasting public dollars and state time .
I do .
I cannot stand here as your Governor and allow millions upon millions of our dollars go to waste just so I can hold the title of Governor .
And my children wo n't allow it either .
?
Some will question the timing . ?
Let 's just say , this decision has been in the works for awhile ...
In fact , this decision comes after much consideration , and finally polling the most important people in my life - my children ( where the count was unanimous ... well , in response to asking : " Want me to make a positive difference and fight for ALL our children 's future from OUTSIDE the Governor 's office ? " [ 19 ]
It was four " yes 's " and one " hell yeah ! "
The " hell yeah " sealed it - and someday I 'll talk about the details of that ...
I think much of it had to do with the kids seeing their baby brother Trig mocked by some pretty mean - spirited adults recently [ 20 ] . )
Um , by the way , sure wish folks could ever , ever understand that we ALL could learn so much from someone like Trig - I know he needs me , but I need him even more ... what a child can offer to set priorities RIGHT - that time is precious ... the world needs more " Trigs " , not fewer .
My decision was also fortified during this most recent trip to Kosovo and Landstuhl , to visit our wounded soldiers overseas , those who sacrifice themselves in war for OUR freedom and security ... we can ALL learn from our selfless Troops ... they 're bold , they do n't give up [ 21 ] , they take a stand and know that LIFE is short so they choose to NOT waste time .
They choose to be productive and to serve something greater than SELF ... and to build up their families , their states , our country .
These Troops and their important missions - those are truly the worthy causes in this world and should be the public priority with time and resources and NOT this local / superficial wasteful political bloodsport .
May we ALL learn from them !
18 . A more appropriate analogy for Palin 's actions might be stopping in the middle of the game , tossing the basketball over one 's shoulder , and then leaving the court to play an entirely different game , perhaps table tennis or curling .
19 .
Here Palin displays a skill that will no doubt serve her well in national politics : talking to people as though they are children .
20 .
By implying that she is leaving office to protect her baby from ridicule , Palin reinforces the idea that her critics are Completely Horrible People .
21 . The heroism of America 's troops and their perseverance in the face of obstacles might be seen as a rebuke to Palin 's decision to leave office when things got tough .
However , such linear thinking is yet another example of " politics as usual " ( see footnote 11 ) .
* (( Gotta put First Things First ) ) * [ 22 ]
First things first : as Governor , I love my job and I love Alaska .
It hurts to make this choice but I am doing what 's best for Alaska .
I 've explained why ... though I think of the saying on my parents ' refrigerator that says " Do n't explain : your friends do n't need it and your enemies wo n't believe you anyway . " [ 23 ]
But I have given my reasons ... no more " politics as usual " and I am taking my fight for what 's right - for Alaska - in a new direction .
Now , despite this , I do n't want any Alaskan dissuaded from entering politics after seeing this REAL " climate change " that began in August ... no , we NEED hardworking , average Americans fighting for what 's right !
And I will support you because we need YOU and YOU can effect change , and I can too on the outside [ 24 ] . [...]
In the words of General MacArthur said , " We are not retreating .
We are advancing in another direction . " [ 25 ]

22 . The punctuation here suggests that Palin's web communications team is in on the " feigning madness " plan .
23 .
The other note on the family refrigerator said , " But if you do explain , do so at great length and utilizing many mixed metaphors . "
24 .
Here again Palin employs a rhetorical technique she has likely honed on her children , that of " do as I say , not as I do . "
25 . Interestingly , all of MacArthur 's efforts to " effect change " on World War II " from the outside " were met with failure .
He only achieved his famous victories when he commanded actual troops , with actual weapons , in actual battles .

Diagramming Sarah [ Slate ]
At Spot Cool Stuff , almost all our reviews cover products and places we love .
Sometimes , though , a product can be so mind boggling terrible that , well , there ’s something good about the horribleness of it .
With that attempted explanation we take a break from our usual routine of writing about genuinely cool things and present you with a collection of travel gear you would almost certainly never bring on your next trip — unless you lost a bet .
Brief Safe
Common travel problem :
When traveling , you are under constant threat of being robbed by thieves who wo n’t hesitate to strip you down to find your valuables but who are put off by unsightly and smelly underwear .
The obvious solution : Brief Safe underwear literally has a crotch pocket where you can hide your bills , large or small ( for size does n’t matter ) .
To keep would - be thieves at a disgusted distance from your hidden stash each Brief Safe comes with a painted - on skid mark .
For added realism sprinkle on some “ Doo Drops , ” which will give your underwear stain a realistic Eau de Toilette scent .
( Really , we are n’t making this up ) .
Currently , the Brief Safe is only available in a male version and is presumed to be marketed towards single men who travel alone and who have given up hope of finding a girlfriend .

“ How To Avoid Large Ships ”
Common travel problem : Your Lonely Planet guidebook contains great background information about local sights and culture but does n’t give any advice on the single most important aspect of travel safety : how to avoid being run over by an oil tanker .
The obvious solution : Throughout the 112 pages of How To Avoid Large Ships author John Trimmer tells you everything you need to know about staying clear of easy - to - see , slow moving boats .
As for how to avoid watercraft that are difficult - to - see and fast moving , well , that ’s obvious is n’t it ?

Shower Shock and Caffeine Tights
Common travel problem :
It is important to stay awake and alert when you travel , but caffeinated beverages such as coffee , tea and colas are very difficult to find in most parts of the world and , anyway , who wants to spend their vacation time on the laborious and complicated process of drinking something ?
The obvious solutions : Start your day by washing with Shower Shock soap .
Build up a good lather , make sure not too rinse off too quickly , and this soap will inject caffeine into your bloodstream through your skin .
Then , after your shower , put on a pair of Caffeine Tights .
Women travelers ( and cross - dressing men ) will not only get a buzz through their legs throughout the day but these tights will supposedly help you burn fat and improve your “ skin elasticity . ”
If those two items still are n’t enough to keep you awake on your travels , check out Think Geek ’s collection of caffeinated items including lip balm , cookies , mints , sunflower seeds and breath spray .

The Beer Belly
Common travel problem :
It is important to stay hydrated and / or drunk while traveling but water bottles are extraordinarily difficult to use and easy to loose .
The obvious solution : Keep 80 ounces ( or 5 pints ) of liquid refreshment under your shirt with the Beer Belly .
Not only does this sling and bladder contraption allow you too carry around your drink without using your hands but it also has the advantage of making you look unattractively overweight .

Disposable Panties & Briefs
Common travel problem :
You are trying to pack light for your trip but your luggage is so full of underwear that you do n’t have enough room for your passport , camera and other clothes .
The obvious solution : Disposable women ’s panties and men ’s briefs will free up much needed space in your luggage — at least on the return trip .
In fairness , Spot Cool Stuff has not personally tested these out , partly because we were too embarrassed to ask for ( much less use ) a review sample and partly because we figured the company would n’t oblige us once we told them the title of this post .
The photos make it look like these temporary undergarments are made of a material that would produce a slight crinkling sound as you walk .
If that ’s true , then the idea behind these pairs of disposable underwear was executed as well as it was conceived .

ChildMinder Infant Safety Seat Monitoring System
Common travel problem :
You are taking a family road trip with your toddlers who are so quiet — and unimportant to you — that you keep leaving them in the car while you go off sightseeing .
The obvious solution : The ChildMinder will sound an alarm on your keychain when you walk more than 15 feet ( 4.5 meters ) from your vehicle while your little ones are still in their car seats , thus avoiding you reenacting some combination of Home Alone and a National Lampoon - worthy Vacation .
Of course , for the alarm to be effective , you ’ll have to remember to bring your keys with you as you leave your car .
But you would n’t forget something as important as your keys , would you ?

WASHINGTON --
The Obama administration said Tuesday it could continue to imprison non-U.S. citizens indefinitely even if they have been acquitted of terrorism charges by a U.S. military commission .
Jeh Johnson , the Defense Department 's chief lawyer , told the Senate Armed Services Committee that releasing a detainee who has been tried and found not guilty was a policy decision that officials would make based on their estimate of whether the prisoner posed a future threat .

It 's hard to walk down the aisle of a liquor store without running across a bottle bearing someone 's name .
We put them in our cocktails , but how well do we know them ?
Here 's some biographical detail on the men behind your favorite tipples .
1. Captain Morgan
The Captain was n't always just the choice of sorority girls looking to blend spiced rum with Diet Coke ; in the 17th century he was a feared privateer .
Not only did the Welsh pirate marry his own cousin , he ran risky missions for the governor of Jamaica , including capturing some Spanish prisoners in Cuba and sacking Port - au - Prince in Haiti .
He then plundered the Cuban coast before holding for ransom the entire city of Portobelo , Panama .
He later looted and burned Panama City , but his pillaging career came to an end when Spain and England signed a peace treaty in 1671 .
Instead of getting in trouble for his high - seas antics , Morgan received knighthood and became the lieutenant governor of Jamaica .
2. Johnnie Walker
Walker , the name behind the world 's most popular brand of Scotch whisky , was born in 1805 in Ayrshire , Scotland .
When his father died in 1819 , Johnnie inherited a trust of a little over 400 pounds , which the trustees invested in a grocery store .
Walker grew to become a very successful grocer in the town of Kilmarnock and even sold a whisky , Walker 's Kilmarnock
Whisky .
Johnnie 's son Alexander was the one who actually turned the family into famous whisky men , though .
Alexander had spent time in Glasgow learning how to blend teas , but he eventually returned to Kilmarnock to take over the grocery from his father .
Alexander turned his blending expertise to whisky , and came up with " Old Highland Whisky , "  which later became Johnnie Walker Black Label .
3. Jack Daniel
Jasper Newton " Jack "  Daniel of Tennessee whiskey fame was the descendant of Welsh settlers who came to the United States in the early 19th century .
He was born in 1846 or 1850 and was one of 13 children .
By 1866 he was distilling whiskey in Lynchburg , Tennessee .
Unfortunately for the distiller , he had a bit of a temper .
One morning in 1911 Daniel showed up for work early and could n't get his safe open .
He flew off the handle and kicked the offending strongbox .
The kick was so ferocious that Daniel injured his toe , which then became infected .
The infection soon became the blood poisoning that killed the whiskey mogul .
Curious about why your bottle of J.D. also has Lem Motlow listed as the distillery 's proprietor ?
Daniel 's own busy life of distilling and safe - kicking kept him from ever finding a wife and siring an heir , so in 1907 he gave the distillery to his beloved nephew Lem Motlow , who had come to work for him as a bookkeeper .
4. Jose Cuervo
In 1758 , Jose Antonio de Cuervo received a land grant from the King of Spain to start an agave farm in the Jalisco region of Mexico .
Jose used his agave plants to make mescal , a popular Mexican liquor .
In 1795 , King Carlos IV gave the land grant to Cuervo 's descendant Jose Maria Guadalupe de Cuervo .
Carlos IV also granted the Cuervo family the first license to commercially make tequila , so they built a larger factory on the existing land .
The family started packaging their wares in individual bottles in 1880 , and in 1900 the booze started going by the brand name Jose Cuervo .
The brand is still under the leadership of the original Jose Cuervo 's family ; current boss Juan - Domingo Beckmann is the sixth generation of Cuervo ancestors to run the company .
5. Jim Beam
Jim Beam , the namesake of the world 's best - selling bourbon whiskey , did n't actually start the distillery that now bears his name .
His great - grandfather Jacob Beam opened the distillery in 1788 and started selling his first barrels of whiskey in 1795 .
In those days , the whiskey went by the less - catchy moniker of " Old Tub . " 
Jacob Beam handed down the distillery to his son David Beam , who in turn passed it along to his son David M. Beam , who eventually handed the operation off to his son , Colonel James Beauregard Beam , in 1894 .
Although he was only 30 years old when he took over the family business , Jim Beam ran the distillery until Prohibition shut him down .
Following repeal in 1933 , Jim quickly built a distillery and began resurrecting the Old Tub brand , but he also added something new to the company 's portfolio : a bourbon simply called Jim Beam .
6. Tanqueray
When he was a young boy , Charles Tanqueray 's path through life seemed pretty clear .
He was the product of three straight generations of Bedfordshire clergymen , so it must have seemed natural to assume that he would take up the cloth himself .
Wrong .
Instead , he started distilling gin in 1830 in a little plant in London 's Bloomsbury district .
By 1847 , he was shipping his gin to colonies around the British Empire , where many plantation owners and troops had developed a taste for Tanqueray and tonic .
7. Campari
Gaspare Campari found his calling quickly .
By the time he was 14 , he had risen to become a master drink mixer in Turin , and in this capacity he started dabbling with a recipe for an aperitif .
When he eventually settled on the perfect mixture , his concoction had over 60 ingredients .
In 1860 , he founded Gruppo Campari to make his trademark bitters in Milan .
Like Colonel Sanders ' spice blend , the recipe for Campari is a closely guarded secret supposedly known by only the acting Gruppo Campari chairman , who works with a tiny group of employees to make the concentrate with which alcohol and water are infused to get Campari .
The drink is still made from Gaspare Campari 's recipe , though , which includes quinine , orange peel , rhubarb , and countless other flavorings .

The Democratic proposal would run through Sept. 30 , 2010 , and tap funds from an Energy Department loan guarantee program included in the economic stimulus package enacted in February .
An initial $ 1 billion in funding approved this summer to boost stagnant industry sales has already been exhausted , officials said .
Consumers stormed dealers over the past month to take advantage of federally backed rebates of up to $ 4,500 on trade ins of gas guzzlers for more fuel efficient vehicles .
Unofficial government and industry estimates show that close to 250,000 vehicles were sold under the program .
How to Use the Program
The Senate is expected to act on the House bill .
Already a key senator , Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman , said he opposes using Energy Department funds for the auto program .
Another senator , auto industry ally Debbie Stabenow , said pushing the measure out of Congress would potentially take a lot of work compared to the extraordinarily swift action in the House .
The White House supports new funding for the program on grounds the initiative so far has provided a viable , national economic stimulus amid recession .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the additional money would come from funds Congress approved earlier in the year as part of a $ 787 billion economic stimulus bill .
Hoyer , D - Md. , said that at the request of House Republicans — whose approval was required for swift passage — the bill would include provisions for government auditors to make sure the money was being spent as intended .
House Minority Leader John Boehner said it was unclear how many Republicans would support on the plan .

The shocking moment 40 prison guards kick and punch juvenile inmates ... already handcuffed
In shocking CCTV footage of a prison riot , guards kicked and punched young inmates who were already in handcuffs .
Chaotic scenes were captured by surveillance video at the Juvenile Detention Centre in Jacksonville , Florida .
Mayhem broke out when an inmate broke the sprinkler system , causing a dorm to flood .
Riot :
The prison guards , wearing riot gear , storm the dorm and begin punching and kicking inmates at the Juvenile Detention Centre in Jacksonville , Florida
Minutes later , about 40 guards - some wearing riot gear - stormed the room .
Most inmates can be seen putting their hands in the air and dropping to the floor , lying face down .
But as the footage shows , one juvenile , who sits on a bed alone without resisting , is slammed onto the floor by a warden .
One inmate is kicked as he lies on the ground and another is punched in the head after being handcuffed .
Two more inmates are kneed as they 're walked out , despite already having been restrained .
' Cheap shots ' :
The young prisoners are thrown to the floor and kneed in the back , despite showing no resistance to the guards
The footage was released by Jacksonville Sheriff 's Office which was called in to investigate the September 2008 incident .
Four correction officers have since been sacked amid claims they used unnecessary force .
The Sheriff described the actions of the prison guards as ' cheap shots ' that were taken at the juveniles ' expense .
' Inmates who were being escorted offered no resistance , ' Sheriff John Rutherford said .
' It was completely unnecessary . '
' We had four officers who in their zeal over - reacted and used unnecessary force against some inmates who were handcuffed .
' I 'm not going to tolerate that . '
Overpowered : Four prison guards were fired after the Sheriff found that they had used ' unnecessary force '
After the chaos subsided , the inmates were seen lying motionless on the floor of another room .
Each is handcuffed and some have their trousers around their knees .
Despite this , one officer is seen kicking an inmate , while another appears to step on his groin area .
' You see the tape .
It 's pretty clear , ' Sheriff Rutherford said .
' Thankfully none of them were injured , but that does n't remove the fact they were struck by officers .
' I'm glad the public sees these headlines because they understand that the men and women of the Jacksonville Sheriff 's Office are going to be professional , they 're going to handle themselves accordingly . '
It is now 20 years since democracy protestors occupied Tiananmen Square .
China 's non-violent movement wanted " more democracy and less corruption " from the Communist Party that had begun the process of economic modernization but still resisted political reform .
While the Europe " whole and free " to which U.S. President George H.W. Bush aspired in May 1989 votes freely this week in elections for the European Parliament , the hopes of a democratic China remain unfulfilled .
The European Union can , and must , do more .
Since Tiananmen ...
This is n’t a tip .
It ’s a screenshot Kyle just sent me from one of the cooler projects we ’ve been involved in so far this year .
Kyle and Jordan prepared an entire network of computer images that a client took to China on a laptop drive .
Kyle had to help them configure the network sufficiently over the phone so he could get in remotely and finish the office setup .
This is , from front to back , an RDC connection to a windows machine running in VMWare on another mac , which is running on a mac , when is screen shared from another mac , which is connected to via iChat Screen Sharing feature , and is in China .

This screenshot represents the remarkable degree of network acrobatics Kyle had to perform in order to get everything up and running in time .
Once he remotely reprogramed a network router to fix a VPN issue ( via the Chinese interface ) , the support became much less interesting .
Mission
Oh my a mission statement !

Mark and David Geier are a father and son team that have been pushing the claim that autism results from mercury poisoning from vaccines .
They have produced a string of junk science , denounced by mainstream scientists for terrible methodology , reasoning , and statistics .
They portray themselves as mavericks , but in my opinion they are just terrible and dangerous scientists .
Their latest atrocity raises their medical mischief to new levels .
For several years now they have been pushing their testosterone hypothesis of autism .
They claim , in short , that autism is caused by mercury poisoning , primarily from vaccines .
Children with autism , especially boys , have high testosterone , which is partly the cause of their symptoms .
But also the testosterone binds to mercury , preventing it from being removed from the body by chelating agents .
They have therefore conducted a study with the drug Lupron in addition to chelation .
Lupron is a powerful drug that lowers testosterone levels .
It is used for rare disorders associated with premature or high testosterone , or to treat prostate cancer in some men .
It is also used as a form of chemical castration for sex offenders .
Each component of the Geiers claims are not only not proven , the scientific evidence is against them .
It is pretty clear now from multiple studies that there is no association between mercury or vaccines and autism .
Autism is not a form of mercury or heavy metal poisoning .
Chelation therapy , which itself is risky , is of not benefit in autism .
And high testosterone levels do no cause autism .
The scientific community has soundly rejected the Geier ’s claims and renounced their practice .
Pediatric endocrinologists , autism experts , and neurologists are nothing short of horrified at the abject and dangerous pseudoscience they are inflicting upon their patients .
Now the Geiers are setting up clinics across the country as little franchises to treat as many children as they can with their Lupron and chelation .
They also have at least one patent application for their treatment .
Their clinics have all the hallmarks of dangerous quack clinics – their claims are miraculous , they are against mainstream scientific opinion , they dismiss legitimate scientific criticism with conspiracy theories and talk of persecution , and they target a vulnerable population .
Of course , some parents of autistic children are desperate for a treatment that will improve the lives of their children .
The Geiers and their accomplices are offering a “ miracle cure ” , and dismiss criticism with the usual fallacies , claiming they are being picked on because they blew the whistle on vaccines .
It is also not surprising that many parent believe their children are being helped by the Lupron therapy .
There are two reasons for this that have nothing to do with the treatment being effective against autism .
The first is placebo effect .
Children with autism are still undergoing development and they do often improve just as a natural consequence of maturation .
Any improvement will be credited to whatever treatment parents are currently giving .
But there is also a huge psychological incentive to perceive an improvement even where one does not exist .
The more radical , risky , and expensive a treatment is , the more parents feel the need to justify their decision by perceiving a benefit .
Plus parents want their children to improve .
I have seen this result in parents ( and also patients themselves ) reporting a clear improvement when objective measures showed no improvement at all .
The second source of apparent improvement in children treated with Lupron is that Lupron , given at the doses the Geiers are using , which is 10 times the dose used for childhood conditions of excess testosterone , do amount to chemical castration .
Testosterone is a masculine hormone that increases energy , aggression , and sexuality .
Castrated males become more docile , calm , and less sexual .
It is therefore no surprise at all that the children treated with Lupron show these exact responses – decreased aggression and sexual behavior , like masturbation .
Therefore all the Geiers have demonstrated is that if you chemically castrate young boys they will exhibit the predictable behavior changes of that hormonal change – they will become less aggressive and sexual .
This says absolutely nothing about the role of testosterone in autism , nor is it evidence for an effect of Lupron on autism itself .
To claim otherwise is rank pseudoscience .
It is also worth pointing out that the anti-vaccine community has exhibited gross hypocrisy when it comes to the Geiers .
They decry every trivial connection between researchers , regulators , and industry as a fatal conflict of interest .
Yet the Geiers have performed research overseen only by them and their hand - picked colleagues ( not true independent oversight ) , they are setting up franchises to push their treatment before it is vetted scientifically , and they have a patent application for their treatment – all clear and profound conflicts of interest .
Yet the anti-vaxxers just love the Geiers , who they see as maverick heroes .
The entire affair is extremely disturbing .
In my opinion , the Geiers are pushing an unscientific and unethical treatment on helpless children .
Lupron has serious side effects , and can interfere with normal development .
There is no independent evidence to show that the treatment is safe and effective , let alone that it has a favorable risk / benefit profile .
Unfortunately , in the current climate and with the health - freedom laws spreading throughout the states , there is little that can be done to stop even grossly substandard care .
Apparently , one only needs to make astounding promises and claim to be the victim of persecution in order to be shielded from the standard of care .

Two sources of fresh water seem to have escaped everyone 's notice in the film : solar distillation of sea water and rain water .
It 's hard to imagine that , with all the technology and gadgetry displayed in the various crafts in the film , the idea of solar distillation has escaped everyone .
Also , no one seems to be trying to collect rain water .
There 's abundant sunlight and clouds are seen , so it must rain at some time , even if the action of the film takes place in an area with little rain , which is possible .

Kiwis may have to start paying for local phone calls if the Government gets its way , Labour says .
A Cabinet paper prepared by Finance Minister Bill English proposed scrapping the Kiwi Share and the Telecommunications Service Obligation ( TSO ) which limits phone line rental increases to the rate of inflation and guarantees free local calls , Labour communications spokeswoman Clare Curran said .
The Kiwi Share clauses in Telecom 's constitution prevent any shareholders from acquiring more than 10 per cent of the company , without first getting the approval of the finance minister .
Overseas shareholders that did get permission to acquire more than 10 per cent of Telecom would need separate approval to take a majority stake .
The Kiwi Share also requires that at least half of Telecom 's directors are New Zealand citizens .
Treasury is to lead a review looking at the Kiwi Share and TSO , Curran said .
The Cabinet paper called for the " beginning of a regulatory review programme " which was part of the Government 's first 100 day commitments .
However , Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce said Curran 's suggestions of were scaremongering .
" Free local calls will not be axed under this government .
The idea is not even on the table , " Joyce said .
" Likewise , there are no plans to further loosen the rules around foreign ownership of Telecom . "
The review 's aim is to improve the quality of regulation which would " deliver big gains for the economy " .
It will include a provision for the immediate removal of inefficient and superfluous regulation and will also create a system for future review .
In relation to the Telecommunications
Act it is tasked with considering :
* Changing or abandoning elements of the TSO ;
* Whether to retain the Kiwi Share requirements ;
* The application of " network operator " to provide access to land for placement of telecommunications facilities ;
* Changing the regulated services framework for recognising the applications of the way prices are set
The review will cover not only telecommunications but also the Resource Management Act , climate change , building , industrial relations , overseas investment , financial markets and local government regulation .
It appeared National was intent on " creeping dilution of our regulatory framework , " Ms Curran said .
" We need to be putting rules in place that will strengthen the marketplace , look after consumers and enable businesses to run efficiently well , " Ms Curran said today .
The telecommunications industry was under threat of becoming a " wild west " , she said .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York City real estate prices are looking increasingly shaky as instability in two of the city ’s sexier submarkets -- second homes in the Hamptons , and new condos in Manhattan -- register the latest signs of a housing downturn .
The sun illuminates 42nd Street at sunset during the biannual occurrence named " Manhattanhenge " in New York May 31 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Gary Hershorn
Property prices in the Hamptons , a fabled playground of the rich on nearby Long Island , rose steadily for almost two decades , but the prices on almost 1 - in - 3 of current listings have been cut an average 11 percent from the initial asking , said Sofia Kim of real estate website StreetEasy.com .
Back in town , the number of sales in new developments dropped a whopping 71 percent in April from a year earlier as condo developers enmeshed in complicated financing arrangements have been slow to slash prices even as the market corrected all around them , Kim said .
But if prices on these new condo towers do not fall to match the rest of the market and stay empty as a result , then it could eventually trigger foreclosures of entire properties , forcing much bigger price cuts as lenders seek to reduce their liability .
“ If you have a property not priced at market , is it going to sell ?
Something has to give , ” said Jonathan Miller , author of real estate broker Prudential Douglas Elliman ’s market reports .
The intensifying of the malaise afflicting New York City comes as housing in parts of the country that got hit hardest by the bust are showing signs of life .
Home sales in California , Arizona and Nevada -- states known for risky lending and speculation during the boom years -- have risen as foreclosures and short sales lure buyers into the market .
In New York , it ’s the opposite .
When the rest of the country was watching new neighborhoods begin to disintegrate into foreclosure ghost towns in 2007 - 2008 , Manhattan landlords would still publicize new buildings by hosting parties featuring pop stars , sushi and girls twirling hula hoops in a bid to convert still - airborne Wall Street bonuses into down payments .
Today , that bonus pool has dried up amid job and compensation cuts in the financial services sector that drives the city ’s economy .
“ Things are much more subdued , ” Kim said .
“ There ’s no money for parties . ”
The elite in the real estate industry had once hoped Manhattan could escape relatively unhurt as other housing markets suffered .
But the collapses of financial powerhouses such as Lehman and Bear Stearns destroyed such thinking .
“ What ended up killing us was the foreclosure crisis because that ’s what killed Wall Street , ” said Rick Hoffman , a regional senior vice president in the Hamptons for the Corcoran Group , a high - end brokerage .
“ It bit us in the end . ”
A BACHELOR ’S KITCHENETTE
Glass towers designed to appeal to finance industry hotshots had been shooting up across Manhattan as Wall Street ’s bonus boom powered a surge of new development , said Barry Hersh , a former developer and a professor of real estate at New York University ’s Schack Institute of Real Estate .
Now many developers are struggling to secure lender approval to cut unit prices , he said .
Without that , they could face foreclosure and bankruptcy , he said .
Some lenders , wary of an announced foreclosure ’s negative effect on sales , might opt for a more subtle scenario in which they quietly take control of a property .
“ You walk in there as a potential buyer and there ’s still a developer and a broker and a marketing person but in reality the developer has been eliminated from the equation and the bank is deciding whether or not to accept your offer , ” Hersh said .
Of course , some condo developers are doing what must be done and lowering prices either in consultation with lenders or behind the scenes with buyers .
The developers of the Georgica at 305 East 85th Street , for example , in Manhattan went so far as to address its disappointing sales by relaunching the building in mid-May with a revised marketing and pricing plan , said Beth Fisher , a director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group .
Her group advised the developers not to move forward until they had negotiated the necessary price adjustments with its backers , who agreed to a range of cuts , some as much as 20 percent .
“ You ’re not going to outsmart the market , ” she said .
“ You have to give buyers what they want . ”
Others maintain appearances but lower the real price -- often about 5 percent -- by using concessions such as extra storage or the payment of transfer fees as bargaining chips , said Brown Harris Stevens broker Elaine Clayman .
“ They just do n’t want to look like the prices are going down , ” Clayman said .
BLUE BLOOD ON THE BEACH
Hamptons owners cannot hide that .
The blood out there may be blue , but Wall Street ’s bite is still spilling it .
The average sales price in the Hamptons and in the nearby North Fork market plunged 36 percent from a year ago and 25 percent from the fourth quarter to $ 1.1 million in the first quarter , and the number of sales were down by half year - over - year , according to Prudential Douglas Elliman .
“ We track bonuses pretty closely in the Hamptons , ” Hoffman said .
Fat bonuses whip up the market ; skimpy ones flatten it .
Take one Southampton property :
It offers 13,500 square feet on five beachfront acres , a pond out back , nine bedrooms , a “ wine cellar / grotto ” and a $ 20 million discount to $ 60 million from a previous price of $ 80 million , according to StreetEasy.com .
As of late May , another house was on the market for $ 2.6 million , which was down 40 percent from $ 4.4 million .
And the price of a third was reduced 34 percent to just under $ 2 million .
Hamptons owners holding out for higher bids can rent their trophy homes instead of selling them .
But because so many people are opting to do that , the rental market is weak too , Prudential Douglas Elliman ’s Miller said .
Sellers loath to lower the price are putting more property on the rental market .
Tenants smelling blood are demanding lower rents .
“ It ’s a double hit , ” Miller said .

Under any disciplined meditation practice , it is never too long before one begins to become aware of new sensations , attitudes , perspectives – and even new insights into the self and reality .
Often , especially with something as foreign as meditation , we tend to overestimate these achievements ; we may even find ourselves seeking to re-visit these particular experiences the next time we sit on the cushion .
But this clinging , like all clinging , can only hinder one ’s spiritual progress .
The first time we get a new feeling we may think to ourselves , “ Aha , this is what meditation is !
I ’ve done it .
I ’ve meditated ! ”
But this is not completely so .
Because successful meditation cannot result from sensual desire – which is one of the Five Hindrances in the Buddhist tradition – so , by clinging to even our meditative experiences we are doing ourselves a tremendous disservice to our own physical and mental well - being .
Meditation cannot be learned as if it is a particular experience , sensation , or even a particular state of concentration or trance .
Rather , it can only be approached as a way of experiencing stimuli – with mindfulness , concentration and equanimity .
The experiences that result from meditation come in all different flavors and intensities , and it would be wrong to deprive one ’s self of exploring these potentials .
This is why I find it most intriguing when others say that meditation is boring or dull ; with proper mindfulness , concentration and equanimity , even the most seemingly mundane sensations can transform into rich and enlightening experiences .
What do I mean by this ?
You will have to explore that “ mundane ” world of sense and thought for your self – no one can possibly share these qualitative aspects of experience and do them any justice .
But this article is about letting go of success .
In other words , letting go of the identity between the “ I ” and “ success . ”
And success , in this context , cannot be seen as anything more than another means of feeding the ego , the self , the “ I . ” A no -no when meditating or on any kind of spiritual path .
• “ I succeeded in meditating . ”
• “ I have achieved this experience . ”
But no , none of this is true .
Instead , take the “ I ” out of the thought .
And instead , believe : there was success in meditation , or , there was an experience .
By taking the “ I ” out of thought , one acknowledges that they were powerless in creating the experience .
The observer did n’t make something happen , they allowed an experience to happen – by being mindful of their sensations , by perceiving those sensations with clarity and concentration , and by being non-reactive and passive to the emotional content of the experience .
The observer let go of desire and force .
They allowed the experience to unfold like a good book or movie , unaware of what the ending might bring .
This may be a helpful attitude for approaching any experience , not just ones that are a result of meditation , but also the ones in everyday life .
Let go .
Let go of the things we try so hard to overpower and control .
Let the universe just play itself out – for one moment , and be as clear and focused on all the facets in which that one moment may reveal .
We may find this gentle way of acceptance actually reaps more benefits then the moments we try so hard to push and pull to our liking .
Stop .
Just be ,
Bewildered , curious , and naïve .
Look around ,
Do n’t seek those things you ’ve grown so tired of seeking .
They are here .
And have been ,
For eternity .
Just look .
Do you see them ?
They hide in the places you least suspect ,
And reveal themselves only in the stillness of mind .
Like that of a newborn ,
Let there be no sense of self ,
With pure consciousness ,
Let the only question be :
What is there to learn ?
From " Jimmy Carter : Man From Plains " ( 2007 )
The Man From Plains makes a startling announcement :
Women and girls have been discriminated against for too long in a twisted interpretation of the word of God .
I HAVE been a practising Christian all my life and a deacon and Bible teacher for many years .
My faith is a source of strength and comfort to me , as religious beliefs are to hundreds of millions of people around the world .
So my decision to sever my ties with the Southern Baptist Convention , after six decades , was painful and difficult .
It was , however , an unavoidable decision when the convention 's leaders , quoting a few carefully selected Bible verses and claiming that Eve was created second to Adam and was responsible for original sin , ordained that women must be " subservient " to their husbands and prohibited from serving as deacons , pastors or chaplains in the military service .
This view that women are somehow inferior to men is not restricted to one religion or belief .
Women are prevented from playing a full and equal role in many faiths .
Nor , tragically , does its influence stop at the walls of the church , mosque , synagogue or temple .
This discrimination , unjustifiably attributed to a Higher Authority , has provided a reason or excuse for the deprivation of women 's equal rights across the world for centuries .
At its most repugnant , the belief that women must be subjugated to the wishes of men excuses slavery , violence , forced prostitution , genital mutilation and national laws that omit rape as a crime .
But it also costs many millions of girls and women control over their own bodies and lives , and continues to deny them fair access to education , health , employment and influence within their own communities .
( Note : This is a major story .
Although I 've done no original " in the field " research , I 've stitched together published material in a way that reveals the true authorship of this crime .
You wo n't learn about the complicity of the Israeli government anywhere else . )
Where do the kidneys come from ?
that
The probe also uncovered Levy Izhak Rosenbaum of Brooklyn , who is accused of conspiring to broker the sale of a human kidney for a transplant .
According to the complaint , Rosenbaum said he had been brokering sale of kidneys for 10 years .
" His business was to entice vulnerable people to give up a kidney for $ 10,000 which he would turn around and sell for $ 160,000 , " said Marra .
he kidneys were " donated " at gunpoint by unwilling victims .
The Israeli government directed Rosenbaum 's grisly scheme .
Major American hospitals wittingly participated in the plot .
Whose
" I am what you call a matchmaker , " the complaint quotes Rosenbaum as telling the undercover agent .
Had the transaction been real , federal authorities said , it would have been the most recent chapter in Rosenbaum 's 10 - year career as an illicit middleman .
In each case , he would take a blood sample from a prospective recipient and give it to an associate at an insurance company who could analyze it at a lab without arousing suspicion .
The sample would then be shipped to Israel , and the necessary people paid off to find a match .
" He prayed on vulnerable people , " said assistant US district attorney Mark McCarron .
Rosenbaum would then arrange the donor 's flight to New York , including obtaining a visa , authorities said .
Once the donor arrived in the US , Rosenbaum would help fabricate a relationship between donor and recipient -- a story both would repeat during interviews with medical professionals .
The two might pretend to business associates , for instance , or close friends from a religious congregation .
" The hospitals seemed to be in the dark , " McCarron said .
The UC asked defendant ROSENBAUM how defendant ROSENBAUM could obtain a kidney on behalf of UC ’s uncle , and defendant ROSENBAUM explained that defendant ROSENBAUM could send a blood sample from the UC ’s uncle to Israel to find a matching prospective donor .
Defendant ROSENBAUM added that " if you want to arrange it faster , then I , I bring the donor over here ...
The hospital is the authority who decide it 's a match or not .
Not me , not you , not him , not nobody . "
Defendant ROSENBAUM
then explained that it would be necessary to fabricate some sort of relationship between the donor and the recipient .
Defendant ROSENBAUM stated that " we put together something – - the relationship .
The hospital is asking what 's the relationship between ” the donor and the recipient .
Defendant ROSENBAUM continued , “ So we put in a relationship , friends , or neighbor , or business relations , any relation . ”
Defendant ROSENBAUM
explained that he was not a surgeon and that once he had brought a willing donor to this country , " it 's beyond my control . "
He did add that " I take care of [ the donor ] after , after the surgery also . ”
When pressed on this last point , defendant ROSENBAUM explained that " I place him somewhere , ” to look after the donor .
Defendant ROSENBAUM further stated : “ You have to babysit him like a baby because he may have a language problem , maybe not . "
Defendant ROSENBAUM
explained the process of finding a donor in Israel and stated that " [t ] here are people over there hurting . . .
One of the reasons it 's so expensive is because you have to shmear ( meaning pay various individuals for their assistance ) all the time . "
11 . Defendant ROSENBAUM indicated that among those who would need to be paid were the donor and the doctors in Israel who would examine the donor , and further added that there would be expenses incurred for preparing the Visa work and paying the donor 's expenses while in the United States .
he
Nancy Scheper -Hughes of the University of California , Berkeley , was and is very clear as to Rosenbaum 's role in the ring .
" He is the main U.S. broker for an international trafficking network , " she said .
Her sources include a man who started working with Rosenbaum imagining he was helping people in desperate need .
The man then began to see the donors , or to be more accurate , sellers , who were flown in from impoverished countries such as Moldova .
" He said it was awful .
These people would be brought in and they did n't even know what they were supposed to be doing and they would want to go home and they would cry , " Scheper - Hughes said .
The man called Rosenbaum " a thug " who would pull out a pistol he was apparently licensed to carry and tell the sellers , " You 're here .
A deal is a deal .
Now , you 'll give us a kidney or you 'll never go home . '
Scheper - Hughes had better luck in Brazil and in South Africa , where law enforcement corroborated her findings and acted decisively .
But the ring kept operating elsewhere .
Scheper - Hughes visited villages in Moldova where , " 20 % of the men were siphoned off to be kidney sellers in this same scheme . "
attended services
I had begun to unravel a huge network -- a criminal network that really looks like , smells like , kind of a mafia .
The head office of the pyramid scheme originated in Israel , with brokers placed in Turkey ; in New York City ; in Philadelphia ; in Durban ; in Johannesburg ; in Recife , Brazil ; Moldova -- all over the place .
And I used my ethnographic investigative skills to just go country - hopping and try to connect the dots .
Eventually , it brought me to Isaac Rosenbaum being the head broker for Ilan Peri in Israel , who is the don , basically , of the operation , and who is a slippery guy .
The Israelis tried to nail him and arrest him .
They tried to get him on tax evasion and he escaped to Germany .
I think he 's back in Israel .
the Israeli government
Gady told the court that an Israeli government official , identified only as Ilan , put him in touch with an intermediary in Brazil ...
Israeli government
agent
Scheper - Hughes :
They told me the names of the hospitals , and they were our best hospitals !
Brian Lehrer :
And did they know , professor , that they were performing kidney surgery on people who were unwilling participants and were being exploited and threatened ?
Scheper - Hughes :
My sense is , how could some of them not have known ?
The people that arrived , some of them did n't speak the same languages , they were poor , they were disoriented ...
We have rules .
We have transplant coordinating committees .
We have ethical guidelines .
And you do n't just let people walk in off the streets .
60 Minutes

West Bank , 8th of February 1988
Nineteen years old Khader Elias Tarazi , a Christian Palestinian , went shopping for groceries in the Gaza .
Upon returning with two bags on his bicycle he crossed a road near a demonstration where stone throwers were fleeing Israeli Army soldiers .
The soldiers grabbed Khader and beat his head and body with truncheons .
Shopkeepers shouted that Khader was n’t involved but soldiers broke one of Khader 's arms and a leg .
They continued the beating then threw him onto the bonnet of their jeep handcuffing the now unconscious Khader to the front crash bar .
They drove off continually braking hard whereupon he sustained further injuries including a broken back , skull injuries and his face kept banging against the bonnet .
The Israeli doctor at the Military Prison in Gaza refused to attend Khader because of his serious injuries and inadequate paperwork .
He was taken to Ansar Two prison and thrown into a prisoner tent holding thirty to forty prisoners .
The other Palestinian prisoners screamed that he must be taken to hospital and the guards responded by forcing them to strip naked and stand outside in the winter cold .
Khader died in the tent and later was taken to Soroka Hospital in Beer Sheva and pronounced dead .
Khader ’s mother was outside the prison where Israeli officials denied they had a prisoner by his name inside .
Later , they admitted he was inside but said he must have been very sick when he went out shopping because he was now dead .
Israeli officials refused to hand over the body and it was transferred to Abu Kabeer hospital , officially for a post - mortem .
Mrs Tarazi told David Yallop that during this time many of his organs were illegally removed from his body .
No inquiry was made into the death and the Tarazi family were told if they continued to ask for an inquiry they would be looking for trouble .
Five months later soldiers and secret police visited the Tarazi house at midnight , beat up Khader ’s brother and father and threw the former into Ansar Three prison .
West Bank , 30th of October , 1988
When Roman Catholic Palestinians were leaving mass they were confronted by the Israeli Army and began throwing stones .
Nineteen - year old Iyad Bishara Abu Saada was killed by a plastic bullet that cut an abdominal artery .
The same grim chase for the body entailed .
The mourners eluded the Israelis and Iyad was buried a few hours later .
Somewhat predictably the Israelis fired teargas canisters into the family home four days later .
Mrs Saada told David Yallop the practice of removing organs was common and named Arab and Israeli hospitals where she said organs were removed .
She said doctors , accompanied by soldiers , offered large amounts of money to parents of the killed .
Dr. Abu Ghazalch attributes the widespread anxiety over organ thefts which has gripped Gaza and the West Bank since the intifada began in December of 1987 to several factors .
" There are indications that for one reason or another , organs .
especially eyes and kidneys , were removed from the bodies during the first year or year and a half ' .
There were just too many reports by credible people for there to he nothing happening .
If someone is shot in the head and comes home in a plastic bag without internal organs , what will people assume ' ?
Ha'aretz
The Romanian Embassy in Israel has asked for , and received from the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry , a list of all children born in Romania who have been brought to Israel for adoption in recent years .
The Romanian officials are trying to ascertain if all such children arrived in Israel with all organs in their bodies .
willing
( I hope my readers will help draw attention to this story .
Normally I do not ask others to link to one of my articles , but in this case I must . )
I 'm talking about the kidneys offered by an " organist " named Izzy Rosenbaum .
The FBI scooped him up in a corruption probe that focused on pay - offs to New Jersey pols ( nothing surprising about ) and money laundering by prominent rabbis : Marra is a US attorney involved with the case .
News accounts like the one quoted above have led the public to believe that the " donors " were both willing and compensated , and that this operation was purely private .
But good evidence indicates that the matter is far , far more troubling .
Before we get to that evidence , let us confront two simple questions : kidneys , exactly , were taken ?
And what kind of doctor would extract a kidney from a healthy patient ?
As we shall see , we should take that last statement with a grain of salt roughly the size of Lot 's wife .
A close reading of the actual indictment of Rosenbaum ( pdf ) is troubling .
Rosenbaum spilled his guts ( so to speak ) to an undercover informant posing as a prospective organ purchaser .
During these interviews , an FBI agent posed as the purchaser 's secretary .
Let 's look at some excerpts from the indictment .
" UC " refers to the informant , whose real name is Solomon Dwek
The only evidence that the donor would be willing came from Rosenbaum , who had the following motives for lying : 1 . He needed to ease the conscience of the prospective recipient .
2 .
He needed to justify the large amount of cash involved .
3 .
He needed to protect the hospitals and doctors involved with his operation .
Rosenbaum understood that he was engaged in a risky business , and that even ifgot caught , he would still need to provide cover for any hospital or surgeon connected to this wretched business .
Do we have evidence of that the donors were coerced ?
Yes .
In fact , we have the testimony of an " insider " witness ( Moldava , incidentally , is a small country bordering the Ukraine . )
Scheper - Hughes , who is writing a book on this topic , went to the FBI in 2002 .
They dismissed her evidence .
The State Department issued a 2004 report which labeled organ trafficking an " urban legend . "
By contrast , authorities in other countries acted on her leads and made arrests .
We must now pause to re-think Rosenbaum 's statements to the FBI informant .
How could any rational person working for a hospital buy the story that the recipients -- American Jews -- with Brazilians and Africans ?
You can see a lecture by the heroic Nancy Scheper - Hughes here .
The video also gives her resume , which is extremely impressive .
Her testimony to a House subcommittee is here NPR's Brian Lehrer interviewed Scheper - Hughes yesterday morning .
An excerpt : A cynic might posit that Mr. Peri has what Mossad calls " a horse " pulling for him .
( A " horse " is an Israeli slang term for a big shot offering covert aid . )
Although he has left a very scant public trail , Mr. Peri and his operation are mentioned in this 2004 story
This fascinating article from Agence - France Presse offers blockbuster information .
A retired Israeli army officer named Geldaya Tauber Gady was arrested in Brazil for his participation in this international organ trafficking ring .
( I suspect that the information from Scheper - Hughes -- which was taken seriously in Brazil -- led to Gady 's arrest . )
He told the court thatfinanced the operation .
Not only that : Gady 's courtroom testimony puts the Rosenbaum case in an entirely new light .
The American media 's coverage has led the public to believe that Rosenbaum 's kidney trafficking was purely a matter of private enrichment .
But a former Israeli officer has said under oath that theruns this ring , and that the master of the ring -- " Ilan " is obviously Ilan Peri -- functions as anof that government .
( Now I 'm wondering : Was the Israeli government involved with the money laundering conducted through New Jersey synagogues ? )
Frankly , I suspect that Scheper - Hughes knows all about Gady 's testimony and its implications for the Rosenbaum case .
She probably has chosen to keep mum about it in order not to lose credibility with the American media .
The Lehrer interview with Scheper - Hughes goes on to deliver more details about her findings in Moldova .
In villages there , many young men reported that they had been told that they expect to find work in other countries ( including the United States ) as house painters .
Once in the new country , they were forced to give up their kidneys .
According to Scheper - Hughes ' informant within Rosenbaum 's organization , confused and disoriented Russians would be flown into New York City by Israeli brokers who forced them at gunpoint to " donate " kidneys .
She goes on to name Mount Sinai hospital , against whom she has videotaped evidence .
She brought the videotape to the attention of , which did not broadcast it .
Later in the interview , she refers to operations done at Albert Einstein Medical Center .
Mount Sinai says that its kidney donors " undergo an extensive evaluation to provide for their safety and well - being .
" Over the years , many have accused Israel of trafficking in the organs of Palestinians .
The Palestinians themselves have no doubt that the practice is common .
Unfortunately , many of the websites trumpeting charges of Israeli organ theft often display an undeniable anti-Semitic bent .
Some of the allegations I 've looked into do indeed appear to be spurious .
( I would , for example , dismiss any claim that traces back to so notorious a source as . )
But before you categorizesuch accusations as fantasies , consider :
As recently as 2004 , the State Department officially denounced as mythical the claim that organ trafficking occurs in the United States .
As we now know , that " myth " had a basis in reality .
Knee - jerk accusations of anti-Semitism should not deter us from conducting candid and unbiased research into Israel 's record .
I would note that those who discuss organ trafficking in India and China are not accused of racial animosity toward the Indians or the Chinese .
This online book is written to a high standard and cites responsible sources , including Scheper - Hughes .
The endnotes attribute the following story to the respected author David Yallop : Yallop is also the source for the following : Mary Barrett , identified as a Boston - based photo - journalist ( I know nothing else about her ) wrote this piece in 1990 .
The doctor went on to state that there were " fewer incidents which point in that direction " as of 1990 .
Incidentally , the story mentions Dr. Yehuda Hiss , more recently accused of harvesting organs from fallen Israeli soldiers without permission .
According to a story which was published in ( a source not open to charges of anti-Semitism ) , Romanian authorities have accused an Israeli adoption agency of being part of a global organ theft conspiracy .
Let 's close with a tale about aPalestinian organ donation .
In 2005 , in the town of Jenin , the Israeli Defense Forces shot and killed a Palestinian child named Ahmed Khatib .
His grieving father allowed the child 's various organs to be used to save the lives of other children , both Jewish and Arab .
A generous and humane offer .
Nevertheless , the father of a Jewish girl whose life was saved said that he would never allow his daughter to befriend an Arab -- for fear of " bad influence . "

Welcome back to the Perl 6 Tricks and Treats Sorry for the random scheduling of these posts .
Sometimes I am too busy at clients , other times I am busy with Padre , my main open source project .
If you do n't know about it yet Padre is and IDE for Perl .
It was originally started as an IDE for Perl 5 but soon it turned out to be a good platform to become an IDE for Perl 6 as well .
It is interesting though understandable that most of the beginner - friendly features of Padre are driven by the Perl 6 plugin development .
After all the Padre developers know Perl 5 quite well but we are still only at the beginning of our Perl 6 learning curve .
Ahmad M. Zawawi ( azawawi ) invested a lot of energy and created a very useful Perl 6 plugin for Padre and a few nice blog entries as well :
So if you are not yet convinced that you should give Padre and its Perl 6 plugin a try , take a look at his posts : Perl 6 support and Ecliptic Perl 6 Quick Fixes in Action
What 's new with Padre Perl 6 ?
Perl 6 files
In the previous posting I wrote about arrays .
There is a lot more one could do with array in Perl 6 but lets look at the file operations now as without reading and writing files coding might not be that useful .
Open a file
As in other high level languages one has to open a file in order to read from it or to write to it .
In Perl6 it is done by the open ( ) function imported from the IO class .
It can receive several parameter but the two are very important :
The name of the file and the mode .
In order to open a file for reading the mode need to be :r .
The function either returns a file handle that should be placed in a scalar variable or returns undef in case of failure .
$ fh = open $ filename , :r Once we have an open file handle we can use the get method ( $ fh.get ) to read one line from the given file .
One could read many lines using consecutive calls to the get method but there are better ways to do that .
Currently I think Rakudo throws an exception if the file cannot be opened but I think the spec says that it should just return undef .
The specifications of all the IO of Perl 6 can be found in S32 - setting - library / IO. pod use v6 ; my $ filename = " data.txt " ; if ( my $fh = open $ filename , :r ) { my $ line = $ fh.get ; say $ line ; } else { say " Could not open ' $ filename ' " ; } Process a file line by line The lines ( ) method of the file handle can return either all the lines , some of the lines .
As it does it lazily in the code below we get an iterator behavior so the file is read line - by - line into the $ line variable by the for loop .
use v6 ; my $ filename = " path/to/data.txt " ; if ( my $fh = open $ filename , :r ) { for $ fh.lines -> $ line { say $ line ; } } else { say " Could not open ' $ filename ' " ; } Writing to a file
In order to write to a file first we need to open the file for writing with the :w mode .
If this is successful we get back a filehandle on which we can use the regular output methods such as print ( ) , say ( ) or printf ( ) .
use v6 ; my $ filename = " temp.txt " ; if ( my $fh = open $ filename , :w ) { $ fh.say ( " hello world " ) ; } Other modes for opening files
So far I mentioned the read ( :r ) and the ( : w ) write mode of opening files but actually this is a bit of a speculation as at the time of the writing this has not been included in the specifications yet .
They are both working in Rakudo along with the append ( : a ) mode but were not specified yet .
slurp Perl 6 has a built in function to slurp in files , that is to read the contents of a whole file into a scalar variable .
use v6 ; my $ filename = ' data.txt ' ; my $ data = slurp $ filename ; say $ data . bytes ; # print size of file in bytes lines of file Unlike the Perl 5 implementation of the slurp ( ) function in Perl 6 it is not aware of its environment so the following code might be a bit surprisings for Perl 5 developers as it reads the entire file in the first element of the array : my @content = slurp $ filename ; say @content.elems ; # 1
If one wants to read all the lines in the elements of the array the lines ( ) functions is needed : use v6 ; my $ filename = ' data.
txt ' ; # reads all the content of the file in the first element of the array !
my @content = slurp $ filename ; say @content.elems ; my @rows = lines $ filename ; say @rows.elems ; Conclusion
That 's it for now .
I plan to write a few more entries in the coming 2 weeks .
Stay tuned .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Barack Obama scoffed at the idea that he should apologize to Iran ’s leaders for criticizing their violent crackdown on demonstrators and said President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has operated outside of “ international norms ” and now must answer to his people .
Standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Obama said the United States and Germany share “ one voice ” in condemning the Iranian effort to crush dissent .
He said Iran ’s leaders cannot hide the “ outrageous ” behavior of clamping down violently on their people .
“ We see it and we condemn it , ” Obama said .
Obama spoke in a joint White House appearance with Merkel after they conferred privately .
The two leaders have met three times since Obama took office , allies linked by such international troubles as the war in Afghanistan and a worldwide recession .
Keeping pressure on Iran , Obama hailed the Iranian people .
“ Their bravery in the face of brutality is a testament to their enduring pursuit of justice , ” Obama said .
“ The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous .
In spite of the government ’s efforts to keep the world from bearing witness to that violence , we see it and we condemn it . ”
Merkel backed Obama ’s stand .
And she said Iran must be kept from getting a nuclear weapon .
Iran ’s violent postelection chaos has captured the world ’s attention and elicited increasingly sharp condemnations from Obama .
Iran ’s ruling clergy have widened the clampdown on the opposition since a bitterly disputed June 12 presidential election , and scattered protests have replaced the initial mass rallies .
At least 17 people have been killed in a state - led crackdown on protesters .
Incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was proclaimed the landslide winner over opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi .
Obama ’s comments on Friday got more direct about the two leaders .
He said Mousavi had captured the spirit and imagination of the Iranian people who want a more free society .
And he dismissed statements by Ahmadinejad , who on Thursday compared Obama to former President George W. Bush .
Obama said he is not meddling in Iran ’s affairs but rather calling for principles to be upheld that reflect “ universal norms , international norms . ”
The Iranian leader has told Obama to “ show your repentance . ”
Obama said he does n’t take such statements seriously .
“ He might want to consider looking at the families of those beaten or shot or detained , ” Obama said .
“ That ’s where Mr. Ahmadinejad and others need to answer their questions . ”
Obama said it is too soon to tell how potential , direct contact between the United States and Iran over a nuclear dispute will be affected by recent events .

Is there , or is there not an overpopulation problem ?
I have seen several debates pop up in several places ( casual conversation , internet forum sites , etc. ) with people arguing whether the world is overpopulated .
Some say that it is a myth , and that some people just are taking up the resources .
Others say that it is a reality , and steps must be done to prevent this from becoming a terrible problem .
First off , we need to define the word “ overpopulation . ”
If you define it as it is in the Merriams - Websters Eleventh Edition Collegiate Dictionary , it would be “ the condition of having a population so dense as to cause environmental deterioration , an impaired quality of life , or a population crash . ”
In other words , overpopulation is when it is so crowded that it affects the environment in a negative way , the quality of life ( food , housing , etc. ) is compromised , and the population eventually gets so large it peaks and collapses on itself .
So do we have an overpopulation problem ?
Some people argue that we do not because there are still many places on Earth which are sparsely populated .
But the problem behind this is that many of those places are extremely hard to live in .
The people living there would have to endure a lower living quality of life .
I believe that there are not enough resources on Earth to sustain such a large growing population .
( We ’ve already surpassed the Earth ’s carrying capacity . )
Eventually , there may be a mass die - down in population because of famine , plague , etc .
Now the problem with the die - down is that a lot of the technology that we ’ve developed and the knowledge we ’ve found may die off with it .
Ah yes , technology .
Consider this : health care improves , and therefore less people die of diseases .
That also means the population grows .
But then there would n’t be enough to feed those people and that would conclude in a major set - back in population numbers .
Overpopulation is definitely going to be a problem in the future , however .
That ’s something to keep in mind .

Sorry PSP owners , but it looks like Uncharted will not be taking a dive into the portable world .
Evan Wells confirmed to That VideoGame Blog that Naughty Dog had no plans to bring Uncharted to the PlayStation Portable .
What ’s interesting though is that he did n’t say there were no plans for an Uncharted PSP .
It was just said that Naughty Dog had no plans , so it ’s possible that we may see another developer working on it ( as High Impact Games is working on Jak & Daxter : The Lost Frontier ) .
Stay tuned on PlayStation LifeStyle , for we ’ll have all your info on an Uncharted PSP if , and when it hits .
And remember to check out our PlayStation LifeStyle Adventure Pack giveaway , where we will be giving away the original Uncharted , Tomb Raider : Underworld , and an Uncharted 2 beta code .

In this post , InfoQ interviews Bruce Eckel to get his thoughts on the RIA landscape and to find out what he has been up to , as Bruce recently released a book he coauthored titled First Steps in Flex .
InfoQ started by asking Bruce what he has been up to lately :
Well , for the last 9 weeks I 've been recovering from breaking a leg skiing .
I 've never broken anything before , so this was a new experience and it's included surgery , general anesthesia and various kinds of recovery therapies -- lots of new experiences .
General anesthesia , in particular , I realized in hindsight takes a long time to get out of your system ; weeks , really .
So you sit around staring with your mind running at half speed , and when you finally resurface from all that you have this kind of new - found appreciation for consciousness .
And after all that sitting around , you really want to go out and do things .
I was already asking myself " OK , what do I really want to do now , " and breaking a leg has emphasized that .
Just going along doing more of what worked before really is n't enough anymore -- I want to do things that are especially fun and interesting .
The main reason that I started writing a Python book was that I realized the consulting work that I 've enjoyed the most has been with companies who have already decided they wanted to use Python ( I suspect the same is true with other dynamic languages , but my experience has been with Python ) .
One job was very challenging ; every day it felt like I was in the old Soviet Union -- they did n't quite strip search us , but almost , and someone had to accompany me when I went to the bathroom .
But the tech lead had insisted they use Python , so despite everything else I still had fun ( however , I now know the difference between a company committing to Python and one strong and determined individual being able to push it through ) .
My general experience is that a corporate culture that supports the use of Python is highly likely to be fun and satisfying to work with .
One that insists on using a language _because_ of the " directing " features ( which people who are less politic call " bondage and discipline " features ) is more likely to be driven to reduce risks than to explore and experiment .
Risk reduction is certainly appropriate in many situations , but I 've discovered that it 's not what makes me happy .
Rapid experimentation and exploring boundaries is what makes me happy , and in my experience companies that have chosen Python seem to be more prone to that , so those are the companies I want to work with now .
That said , I 'm falling back on " what 's worked for me in the past " in order to connect with those companies .
Writing a book , and speaking at conferences .
Definitely not original , but I have n't figured out any other ways to market myself so far .
Of course I continue to try to create Open Spaces events , and variants of those .
These have also been extremely satisfying .
After giving a seminar where I am speaking all week and frog - marching people through exercises ( trying to make everyone learn at the same speed , which is silly , when you think about it ) I 'm exhausted and do n't want to do it again for awhile .
But when I do an Open Spaces event , I 'm always disappointed when it's over and I realize I 'm not doing another one the next week .
I want to figure out how to make a lot more of those happen , because they make me happy .
This is one reason James Ward and I wrote " First Steps in Flex , " to help create a market for our " Flex Jams . "
In the past few years I 've been acting in the local theater .
Crested Butte is filled with unusually talented people and we have an active theater group , and it's been a great challenge to be in these productions -- I 've been in 5 or 6 so far .
The last one was " Into the Woods , " and I had never been in a musical before but ended up being cast as " Rapunzel 's Prince . "
Together with " Cinderella 's Prince " we had what was probably the sweetest duet in the play , which was n't really fair since many of the other actors had to work much harder than we did .
And my fellow prince had just finished acting school and grew up with voice lessons -- his mother was a diva in the London theater -- so I had quite a challenge to keep up with him .
But the best part of the whole experience was working with people who were so serious and professional about participating in this amateur production .
It gave me a little more insight about teams and how satisfying it is to be part of a well - running team .
In fact , I 'm reading a number of books right now on software teams and ways that seem to help form good teams .
Not that I 'm thinking that I 'm going to be a team manager anytime soon , but understanding teams is an important skill for a consultant to have , and one that I 've been trying to get better at for many years .
One of the things that the theater does is put on 10 - minute plays written by local authors , and I 've done this several times .
I 've started writing a full - length play , and participate in a local writing group .
I 've taken various fiction - writing workshops over the years , and I 've discovered that fiction writing is a much greater challenge than non-fiction writing ( which is probably why there are only about 5,000 fiction novels published every year , and about 50,000 nonfiction books ) .
I have also started painting , although I 've taken painting workshops for a number of years ( I suppose taking good workshops is kind of a hobby as well ; I learn from the workshops themselves but I also hope to improve my own events from these experiences ) .
In the last workshop I took , the teacher emphasized that " it 's not about using brushes on canvas , it 's about putting marks on surfaces . "
I think this lowered the boundary enough for me to start just getting paint on stuff , without worrying about whether it was " right " or not .
Just experimenting .
And the one thing I 've discovered is that it 's a lot more satisfying to play around with putting paint on things than it is to be trapped , afraid that the moment you do anything it will be too imperfect to continue .
I have n't mastered the zen of painting , by any means .
My biggest problem is getting attached when something starts to look good , and being afraid to continue because I might mess it up .
One thing that recently happened is that I created the design for the Pycon 2009 conference T - shirt , which was a painting I did ( an abstraction of the I - Ching hexagram 22 , which represents " elegance / beauty " ) .
Unfortunately I was n't able to be at the conference this year , because of my leg , but people told me that seeing my painting on 1000 people was surreal .
I think these experiences are very helpful in the software world .
Learning to be more experimental and to explore -- rather than sitting around pondering whether something will work or not -- helps move a project forward .
Bruce offered an overview of his recently released Flex book :
" First Steps in Flex " was coauthored with James Ward , who is an Adobe Flex evangelist .
We wanted to write something that would make it easy for a programmer to learn Flex , so we made it small , with very short chapters .
This keeps it from being intimidating ; you look at it and think " oh , that chapter is so short .
I could read that , " and you think that about the next one , and the next one .
The whole book is un-intimidatingly thin , and to do this we had to trim out anything the reader did n't absolutely need to know , and stick to the essentials .
This way , people walk away feeling they can do something , but they 're not buried in too much information .
It took a lot of effort to distill Flex down to the essentials , but I 'm quite happy with the result .
Then , InfoQ asked Bruce for his general impressions of the current RIA landscape :
I think the most important thing is that RIA is a real thing , not just a term that Adobe made up .
People have accepted or are in the act of accepting that HTML / CSS and a little Javascript is n't going to cut it for a lot of web applications ( although it is certainly the appropriate approach for many ) .
Consumers are expecting richer and more responsive web applications , and sites cannot produce those experience AND fight with the vagaries of the web at the same time .
You need to program on a platform that is a known quantity .
I 'm more and more convinced that the browser " standards " that we have stumbled into will NEVER become complete or reliable , or even usable .
Look at CSS .
Great in concept , but obscure as all get - out to program and inconsistent on browsers .
HTML itself -- what a cock - up .
There 's no standard way to include headers and footers ( yes , SSI but that always relies on a particular server configuration which you can't rely on ) , so people go to PHP , and then end up with something you can call " better than Perl " but only because it does n't get you in trouble quite as fast ( I use PHP , but very conservatively ) .
Bottom line : we need the intermediate layer between the browser and the RIA ; the browser technologies will never get it right .
Even generators like GWT just reduce the platform dependency issues , they do n't eliminate them .
Same with Ajax -- you 'll still have to hand - tune the code so that it works on multiple browsers .
Less work , but not work that I want to do at all .
Why spend company resources on these problems when you can just put in an intermediate layer and completely eliminate the issue ?
I 'm still a fan of Flex , because the Flash player is supported on all platforms .
Silverlight allows support on Linux , but I have no idea how far along that support is .
And Microsoft has had a tumultuous history about non-Windows support .
The latest version of Office for the Mac wo n't take macros from Windows , which was important to me and has caused problems for me and many others .
Microsoft has all kinds of excuses for this , but who cares ?
You get screwed .
If they decide that Silverlight support on the Mac should go away , they 'll have reasons for that , too .
Or if Linux is too big of a threat , they 'll have reasons that you can no longer have Silverlight on Linux .
Who cares ?
If you depend on it , you 're out of luck .
I notice Netflix went with Silverlight for their video - on - demand .
So far I have n't been able to get it to work on Firefox on my Mac -- it will probably start working , but if it does n't Netflix could start losing customers , and they 've probably already lost the Linux customers .
Adobe 's a big company too , and they can also act capriciously , but they have a track record of supporting all the platforms , and Microsoft has an OS to push .
Silverlight is well - designed and they 've learned lots of things from Flex .
I think the competition is great , and has stimulated Adobe to work harder .
But if you come to me and ask whether you 're better off with Flex or Silverlight , I 'm going to say " why take the risk that Microsoft does another one of its marketing spasms and cuts you off ? "
Next , Bruce was asked if he thought the industry 's move to client side runtimes for user interfaces is a good thing :
Absolutely ; I pretty much made the case above .
But I forgot about JavaFX .
At the JavaPosse Roundup 09 , we did a little coding dojo , where Dick Wall created his " Flubber " application in both Flex ( with the help of James Ward ) and with JavaFX ( with the help of Tor Norbye , who is on the JavaFX team ) .
Conveniently this happened at my house , but I 'm still in the early stages of recovery from surgery so I can't give all the details .
What was impressive , however , was that he was able to achieve pretty much the same results in both languages .
I think it was still a little easier in Flex , but I was quite impressed at the results in JavaFX .
Also , the JavaFX looks a lot like ActionScript , but they 've also added some clever language improvements , which I think will light a little competetive fire under the ActionScript designers , and that 's a good thing .
Then , he was asked if Flex needs Java to be successful :
I think the Flex - to - Java bridges are important , and it's too bad Sun did n't support the development of one of these .
For that matter , too bad Adobe does n't either .
There are open - source versions in the works and I think that in general we need more structure for commercial companies supporting open - source projects .
Just a way for money to get to them , even if they do n't hire someone or fully support it .
I think we might see a lot more support for these projects if at least one person on a project could start making some kind of living from it .
Anything that makes that process easier would benefit everyone .
Beyond Java , Bruce was asked what other languages he likes to pair with Flex :
Most of the projects I 've built have used Python as a back - end to Flex .
There are several approaches to doing this , but the Twisted library has direct support for communicating with Flex , and both are asynchronous so it 's kind of a perfect fit .
Ruby also has support for communicating with Flex .
I see dynamic languages as great backends because then you get the best of all worlds -- rapid development of really nice - looking UIs combined with rapid development of the business logic on the back end .
Finally , InfoQ asked if Bruce was doing anything with Java these days :
Occasionally consulting on design , that kind of thing .
I feel like the fourth edition of " Thinking in Java " really completed the book -- I 've basically rewritten it four times now , and on the last time I think I got it right .
So I do n't plan to do another edition , but rather support the fourth edition with a supplement that will fill in important details and language features that have appeared since the fourth edition .
But I hope to make this book a community effort , to be published electronically under the creative commons .
Whether I can harness the community this way is another question -- it's what I 'm trying to do with the Python book , so maybe I 'll have a better idea of how to manage it by then .
You can read more of Bruce 's thoughts on his blog .
A family in Saudi Arabia has filed suit in a religious court against an unnamed genie , or jinn , who sounds most unpleasant :
It steals cellphones , whispers threats and occasionally flings stones .
“ We began to hear strange sounds , ” a family member who requested anonymity told the Saudi daily Al Watan .
“ At first we did not take it seriously , but then stranger things started to happen , and the children got particularly scared when the genie started throwing stones . ”
The genie -- or genies -- had demands : “ A woman spoke to me first , and then a man .
They said we should get out of the house , ” said the family member , adding that his clan fled their home near the city of Medina .
Jinns and genies are spirits born out of fire that have supernatural powers .
They appear in the Koran and Arab mythology , creatures living between humanity and the elements .
One of their most famous incarnations lived in Aladdin ’s lamp .
( CNN ) -- A South Florida teenager accused of killing and mutilating 19 cats excitedly described to police how he dissected cats in class , and where to find cats for experimentation , according to police .
Tyler Weinman laughed when police told him they had information he was the cat killer , an arrest document said .
When Miami - Dade police told Tyler Hayes Weinman someone was killing cats in the neighborhood , the 18 - year - old reacted by laughing , according to a newly released arrest affidavit made public Monday .
Most of the cats were found in their owners ' yards .
" One appeared to be posed with a slit down the middle of its stomach , " the affidavit states .
On Monday , Weinman pleaded not guilty to more than 40 criminal counts , including multiple charges of felony animal cruelty and burglary .
He is out of jail on $ 249,500 bond and under house arrest wearing an electronic monitor , but is being held for 48 hours for a psychiatric evaluation .
The teen 's attorney David Macey said there was a " lynch mob " after his innocent client and accused Judge Mindy Glazer of " prejudging " Weinman .
" He did not kill the cats , " Macey told reporters outside the courtroom .
" The individual who committed this crime is still running around out there . "
The arrest affidavit , which a judge gave prosecutors until Monday to make public , reads like a grisly horror movie and indicates Weinman was knowledgeable of and fascinated with dissection of cats .
During questioning , according to the affidavit , a detective told the teenager that police were informed he was involved in the cat slayings .
Weinman replied he heard about the cats and that he told his mother .
He told police that a school he had been expelled from was the only school in Miami - Dade that taught how to dissect using cats , according to the affidavit .
The teenager went on to offer several other bizarre and unsubstantiated trivia , including saying that Mexico is the only source for cats used for dissection and describing their size .
Weinman " became excited and animated " as he told the detective about cat dissection research he had discovered on the Internet , the affidavit states .
" Weinman was asked to expound on what he meant and he repeated , with noted excitement , ' It just makes a certain sound , a tearing sound , " says the affidavit .
The detective asked Weinman what tools might be used to commit animal cruelty , and teenager replied , " I do n't know , but I 'm sure they are very well hidden . "
How did he think the cats were being captured ?
The teen answered , " They have to be either tranquilized or poisoned . "
Weinman came to the attention of authorities in late April , the affidavit states , as cats began to go missing in a suburban Dade County neighborhood called Whispering Pines just outside Miami , Florida .
Police had a few times seen Weinman walking and skateboarding in the middle of the night in the area , at least once wearing black clothing and carrying a dark backpack .
Detectives stopped the teenager and told him about the dead cats .
Weinman responded by laughing , according to the arrest affidavit .
He was not held at that time .
In May , the teenager was pulled over for a traffic violation and police found a " cutting instrument " on the ground beside his car .
According to the affidavit , as an officer questioned the teen , he noticed what appeared to be a cat scratch on his arm .
" I got them from a stray cat that I feed at my mom's house , " Weinman said .
The teen " was eager to show " the scratches and took off his shirt so that photographs could be taken , according to the questioning detective 's account , which is detailed in the affidavit .
The teenager 's divorced parents lived in separate neighborhoods , according to police .
His mother resides in Cutler Bay .
His father lives in Palmetto Bay , further north of Miami .
According to the arrest affidavit , shortly after the teenager talked to police about dissecting cats , he went to live with his father who restricted his son's access to a car .
The killings shifted north as eight dead cats turned up in Palmetto Bay , police said .
At that point , police provided the teen 's profile to the Miami - Dade Police Department 's Psychological Services Section .
Staff doctors met and discussed the case .
They determined that the cat killer was likely male and suffered from some kind of conduct disorder .
If the killer was an adult , they concluded , that person would be classified as a sociopath .
In late May , police then got a court order to place a tracking device on the Honda Civic driven by Weinman .
The affidavit states the car was tracked to the latest feline victim which had been skinned along the abdomen from the pelvic area to the hind legs .
The pelt and genitalia were missing .
The cat killings became headline news across the country .
Around that time , Weinman joined a Facebook page called " Catch - The - Cat - Killer . "
The teenager is charged with 19 counts of felony animal cruelty , 19 counts of improperly disposing of an animal body and four counts of burglary .
He 's pleaded not guilty to all of the charges .

The $ SHLVL variable tells you how many shells deep you are .
If you are confused by this , it is worth starting at the beginning .
What Is a Shell ?
A shell takes commands and gives these commands to the underlying operating system to perform .
On most Linux systems , the shell program is called BASH ( The Bourne Again Shell ) , but there are others , including the C Shell ( tcsh ) and the KORN shell ( ksh ) .
How to Access the Linux Shell
Generally , as a user , you interact with the shell program through a terminal emulation program such as XTerm , konsole , or gnome - terminal .
If you run a windows manager such as Openbox or a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE , you 'll find a terminal emulator either from a menu or a dash .
On many systems , the shortcut CTRL +ALT+T opens a terminal window .
Alternatively , you can switch to another TTY ( teletypewriter ) , which provides direct access to a command - line shell .
You can do this by pressing CTRL +ALT +F1 or CTRL+ALT +F2 .
What Is a Shell Level ?
When you run a command in a shell , it runs at the shell level .
Within a shell , you can open another shell , which makes it a subshell of the shell that opened it .
Therefore , the parent shell is considered the level 1 shell , and the child shell is a level 2 shell .
How to Display the Shell Level
The way to tell which shell level you are running in is to use the $ SHLVL variable .
To see the shell level that you are currently running in , type the following :
When you run the above command in a terminal window , the result returned is 2 .
If , however , you run the same command using the tty , then the result is 1 .
The tty does n't run a desktop environment and is a level 1 shell .
Why is this the case ?
The desktop environment you are running is run on top of a shell .
That shell is level 1 .
Any terminal window you open from that desktop environment is a child of the shell that opened the desktop environment .
Therefore , the shell level cannot start at any number other than 2 .
How to Create Subshells
The easiest way to test the concept of shells and subshells is as follows .
Open a terminal window , then type the following :
When you run this command from a terminal window , the minimum shell level is 2 .
Type the following in the terminal window :
The sh command runs an interactive shell .
This means you are using a shell within a shell or a subshell .
If you type this again :
You see that the shell level is set to 3 .
Running the sh command from the subshell opens a subshell of the subshell , and so the shell level is at level 4 .
Why Is Shell Level Important ?
The shell level is important when thinking about the scope of variables within your scripts .
For a simple example :
dog=mais
If you run the above command in a shell , the word maisie displays to the terminal window .
To open a new shell , type the following :
When you run this command , you 'll see that nothing is returned :
That 's because the $ dog variable is only available at shell level 2 .
If you type exit to exit the subshell and run echo $ dog again , the word maisie displays again .
It is also worth thinking about the behavior of global variables within a shell .
Open a new terminal window , then type the following :
export dog=mais
As expected , the word maisie displays .
Next , open a subshell and type echo $ dog again .
This time , the word maisie displays even though you are in a subshell .
The reason for this is that the export command made the $ dog variable global .
Changing the $ dog variable in the subshell , even if you use the export command , does n't affect its parent shells .
Knowing the shell level you 're working in has significance when writing scripts .
The examples in this article are simple , but it 's common for one shell script to call another shell script which in turn calls another shell script .
All of these run at different levels .
Knowing the shell level is important .
Active contours are a method of image segmentation .
They are well - loved for their accuracy , ease of implementation , and nice mathematical underpinnings .
However , a full level - set implementation can be quite slow , especially when dealing with large data !
Here are some tips to speed things up .
By combining these ideas and solid programming techniques I ’ve been able to get active contour trackers running at hundreds of frames per second !
Use Fast Level - Sets
Start by using a fast level - sets implementation that minimizes the number of required computations [ code ] .
This will already save a huge number of computations per iteration and speed things up quite a bit !
Create better initializations .
The farther the initial contour is from its final position , the more computations must be done for the contour to converge .
Hence , if you can start the contour in almost the right place , you ’ll drastically reduce the time needed for segmentation .
You can use prior knowledge , user input , or other segmentation techniques to create a rough guess that is close to the right answer .
Another initialization that can leads to quick initialization is ‘ bubbles ’ on an evenly - spaced grid .
Use a multi-scale approach .
This is a way to quickly get good initializations using active contours .
Say your data is MxN .
Instead of segmenting the full data set , downsample the data so that you are dealing with an ( M / 8 ) x ( N/8 ) volume .
The segmentation should run much quicker on the smaller volume .
Next , upsample the result back to MxN and use this as an initialization for the full data .
The idea is that the time saved on the full segmentation by having a good estimate based on downsampled data will make up for the time needed to downsample , segment on the small data , and upsample .
Use approximate active contours .
Using an approximate solution for all or part of your segmentation can be helpful .
As in 2 and 3 , you can use an approximate active contour technique to quickly get close to the right answer .
Then you can use an accurate level sets implementation to get the right answer quickly .
Alternatively , the discrete methods can work quite well alone !
James Malcolm proposed a nice method in “ Fast Approximate Surface Evolution in Arbitrary Dimension ” [ code ] .
Use another technique entirely .
Active contours are “ variational , ” so they give nice , principled solutions with analytic geometry , etc .
However , if you just want fast segmentations , other techniques such as thresholding / morphology , graph cuts , region growing , etc. can all be viable solutions .
Any other tips or links to good implementations ?
Leave them in the comments .
Much was made on Tuesday that the Case - Shiller Index showed a positive increase for the first time in many years .
This of course was for nationwide data and did not take into account seasonal adjustments .
However , there is noticeable change going on .
Yet the Los Angeles and Orange County data point was still trending lower .
Not exactly good news as we look into the exotic mortgage zoo with our Alt - A and option ARM waste .
On Monday , the big jump in home sales was led by the median price dropping by $ 13,000 but the media was spinning this as some kind of sign that housing bubble version 2.0 is around the corner .
I ’m surprised how quickly some people are capitulating and thinking that somehow the market has suddenly turned around .
Did n’t our Governor just sign a budget to patch up the biggest deficit in the history of California ?
The disconnect is amazing .
One simple question people fail to answer is what jobs are going to replace the 6,500,000 jobs lost since the start of the recession ?
Keep in mind many of the lost jobs were good paying jobs .
Here in California , you had many people especially in the mid to upper priced areas buying overpriced homes with over sized incomes because of the bubble .
You had mortgage brokers , agents , bankers , and others connected to the housing industry that believed in the housing bubble and paid top dollar for a bubble home .
Unfortunately , they are facing a double - whammy with home prices plummeting and incomes drying up .
So if you want a simple question as a litmus test it should center on what industry is going to compensate for the lost housing industry ?
I have yet to see a good argument about job growth .
Before I move on to the article investigating an interesting story of three homes on three blocks in Compton , I want to say thank you for helping this site reach the 5,000,000 hit mark .
Many of you have been reading this blog for years and I sincerely appreciate the long time loyalty .
Many of you may recall when we were a small minority in the middle of California bubble mania .
As we go forward , I will do my best to continue giving you an honest take on what is going on .
If I have learned anything in these last few years , it would be that you as a smart consumer of information should verify data and arrive at your own conclusion no matter who is saying what or where the large crowd is going .
I am appreciative of all the e-mails and from all the other dedicated bloggers who have been working so hard to create an alternative outlet for information .
With that said , let us now continue to the article .
Tip # 1 – Please Refrain from Using M.S. Paint for Real Estate Ads
We ’ve discussed the need for agents to use better photography in advertising real estate .
One common theme in Southern California is garbage can photography where agents simply leave the garbage can in the photo of a home that is selling for large amounts of money .
Aside from the psychological association between garbage and a home , there are many aesthetic reasons for not doing this .
Beside , how much work does it take to get out of the car and move the bin ?
Well this home in Washington State highlights a new kind of real estate ad .
It would appear that the grass is edited using Microsoft Paint or a similar photo editing software .
Now , I do n’t have anything against MS Paint but I ’m not sure that I would use it in editing the lawn on a $ 350,000 home in this current market .
This is like you having the ability to own only one family photo and you electing to go to your local strip mall and taking a picture on a bear rug with a waterfall background .
Either way , I was surprised to see this .
I did a double take but zooming in it becomes rather obvious :
I guess nothing surprises me anymore .
I spent some time looking at a small area in Compton .
In this three - block region , I found three homes for sale that all tell the story of the housing bubble but also of easy finance .
Before we decide that loan modifications are the way to go , how about we pause and examine what really happened ?
Here is the map of the area with the three homes :
Today we salute you Compton with our Real Homes of Genius Award .
Compton Home A
It did n’t take much time to get our first home using garbage can photography .
This 711 ( not the store ) square foot home is selling for $ 53,000 and is n’t listed as a foreclosure or short - sale .
A $ 50,000 home in Los Angeles County .
Now before we get too excited that prices are making sense , let us look at the sales history :
Sales History
02/18/2009 : $ 306,135 *
11/01/2007 : $ 357,000
01/24/2003 : $ 112,500 *
11/15/2000 : $ 60,000
* Transaction data unclear
Some of the transaction data is unclear resulting from refinancing , transfers , or other recordings but the November 2007 price was a sale .
This home sold for $ 357,000 less than two years ago .
Who made this loan ?
Have you noticed some silence regarding the public - private investment program ?
It was initially slated to start in July but we have heard very little on this front because the entire program is a sham and would result in many toxic loans jumping into the pool that will be backstopped by the taxpayer .
If you did n’t do the math , the price drop on this place amounts to 85 percent in less than two years .
Compton Home B
Another case of garbage can photography .
This home is larger at 1,280 square feet and has 3 bedrooms and 2 baths .
The home was recently listed at $ 131,700 .
This is a bank owned home .
Let us look at some sale history to see why the bank now owns this place :
Sale History
01/22/2009 : $ 147,435 *
12/13/2004 : $ 288,000 *
04/25/2001 : $ 131,000 *
11/07/2000 : $ 139,526 *
07/09/1999 : $ 134,000
08/04/1997 : $ 25,000
* Transaction data unclear
We have a tremendous amount of action here .
On this place , we are seeing a lost decade in home prices .
We are below the 1999 sale price .
Who really knows the story on the remaining transactions but these are the kind of homes that are all over Southern California .
Compton Home – C
Now here we have fence lens photography .
You would think that you would have a better picture for a home selling for $ 180,000 but this is it .
This is a 940 square foot home but once again , we see lots of activity on the home :
Sale History
04/13/2009 : $ 88,000 *
02/17/2009 : $ 115,758 *
06/12/2006 : $ 370,000 *
05/10/2004 : $ 226,000 *
01/30/2003 : $ 44,000 *
* Transaction data unclear
What is fascinating is that from 1990 to 2000 sale and record activity is largely not present or very tiny .
Yet all of a sudden in this decade , you have multiple transactions occurring .
If we look at this place , the last action was in April for $ 88,000 yet the asking price is $ 100,000 above that .
This home is only a few blocks away from the slightly smaller 711 square foot home selling for $ 53,000 and the much larger $ 131,700 home B .
What should become apparent to you is this ; the homes that will move are lower priced .
Some times the lower price is much lower than many would have imagined .
This data will be factored in future comps thus depressing the area home prices .
Many of these areas are dominated by foreclosures ( still ) .
Now imagine what a few foreclosures in a mid to upper priced area will do for comps ?
The Alt - A and option ARM wave will do the same thing as the subprime loans did in the lower priced areas which is push comps much lower .
It will lower prices and if agents use garbage can technology here , they are going to be in for a tough market .
Today we salute Compton with our Real Homes of Genius Award .

“ Boxing the Republicans into a South - dominated party is very good strategy , because the more you reduce the Republican Party , the more conservative and reactionary it will become , and thus less attractive to moderates , ” said Tom Schaller , a University of Maryland - Baltimore County professor and the author of Whistling Past Dixie : How Democrats Can Win Without the South .
“ The Midwest and the Northeast are the places where there are still remnants of old - line Rockefeller Republicans .
And these are the places where the Democrats will build durable majorities . ”
Aubertine , of Watertown , won a 2008 special election for a Senate district based an hour or so from Ottawa , Canada , that covers all of two counties in McHugh ’s district and part of a third .
But even an Aubertine victory could be a net loss for national Democrats .
New York is set to lose at least one seat in the reapportionment of congressional districts after next year ’s census , and his influence in the state Senate may be more valuable to the party than an extra vote in the U.S.
House that could disappear after the 2012 election .
For that reason , several Democrats said they thought it was unlikely that Aubertine would run .
“ It ’s too early to comment right now , ” said Aubertine ’s spokesman , Drew Mangione .
“ The senator is committed to his work in the New York state Senate . ”
A slew of Republican names also surfaced Tuesday : Assembly members Will Barclay , who lost to Aubertine for the Senate seat , Janet L. Duprey and Dede Scozzafava ; Terry Gach , vice president of institutional advancement at the Trudeau Institute ; Michael F. Joyce , the head of Hargrave Custom Yachts ; former state Sen.
Jim Wright ; and Franklin County District Attorney Derek Champagne .
Avid crier , John Boehner , was at it again : sobbing when the statue -- or , in his case , idol -- of Ronald Reagan was unveiled in Statuary Hall this morning .
Or maybe his mind was just wandering towards what today ' stermed the stealth war to keep moving the GOP along the road to oblivion as a serious national party .
It 's not so much that the wing - nuts will miss John McHugh ( R - NY ) or even the likelihood of being embarrassed again when they lose a seat -- after a costly battle they can't afford -- with a tremendous GOP registration advantage ( 120,887 Democrats to 167,272 Republicans ) .
Obama won the district 52 - 47 % last November .
The NRCC , sounding a little paranoid , blames the whole thing in Rahm Emanuel .
And here I thought I was the only one that blamed everything on him !
Last nightput out an analysis of the likely contenders to replace McHugh .
State Sen. Darrel Aubertine is being mentioned most but if he abandoned his just - won Senate seat , it could through NY Democrats into turmoil because of the closeness of the numbers in Albany .
Syracuse - based attorney Daniel French , a former aide to Daniel Patrick Moynihan is another possible candidate , as are 2008 nominee Michael P. Oot , state party Chairwoman June O’Neill and John Rhodes , who considered a 2008 run .
With a bunch like that in the wings , it 's no wonder Boehner was weeping -- especially with the best of the lot , Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava thinking about running as a Democrat !
Someone should get him and Glenn Beck together .

CAIRO , July 2 , 2009 ( MENASSAT ) —
With dozens of workers gripping the iron rod gate marking the entrance to the Tanta Flax and Oil Company , plainclothes state security grabbed , shoved and punched this American reporter .
The workers began chanting as the reporter attempted to record footage of what was happening inside the factory .
“ No , you are not allowed to see them .
It is forbidden , ” said the unnamed state security official who forced the journalist to return to Tanta ’s train station .
Unsurprisingly , Egypt has no desire to have foreign journalists cover the workers ' strike as it enters its second month , even if stopping them requires violence .
Nassar Osman , who identifies himself as a spokesman for the workers , said he wants everyone to see what is going on here .
“ The people have not been paid in months , they are n’t getting their promised raises and now they are getting harassed by police because of the strike that is going on here , ” he said .
Osman was working with the state security officials in order to allow the journalist to enter the factory , but to no avail .
According to state security at the factory premises , a foreign journalist , irregardless of proper accreditation , must secure a “ permission ” consisting of a paper from the information ministry to enter the factory .
However , the foreign press office in Cairo said that “ there is no such paper .
If the state security says no , then you ca n’t go in .
” The incident highlights Egypt ’s growing concern over the coverage of workers ’ strikes and demonstrations in the country .
Last year , in the Delta town of Mahalla al Kobra , tens of thousands of Egyptians went to the streets in support of the local textile factory workers who went on strike in demand of better wages to combat the rising costs of foodstuffs .
The government responded swiftly , moving troops into the town to quell the dissent .
At least one person was killed in the crossfire and scores of people were arrested , including an American photographer who was briefly detained .
“ The way they are treating us here is horrible and they do n't even allow foreign journalists to do their job , ” said one worker , who was to give an interview after the journalist was forcibly put on a “ microbus ” and driven to the city center .
He added that “ because the government has a stake in the company , they do n’t want the outside world to see what is going on here .
” But , what is really going on in Tanta ?
According to reports and workers ' statements , a Saudi company purchased the factory this year from the Egyptian government .
They promised an annual 7 percent salary increase , but since May , the workers have been conducting daily protests and an almost ongoing sit-in on the factory premises after their salaries did not come .
“ We want our money , ” said the worker , who asked not to be named due to security risks .
He argued that all the workers are demanding are better means to survive and live their lives without worrying about making ends meet .
“ We are not paid well and with the rising costs of things and food in Egypt , it is becoming extremely difficult for us to support our families , so we have taken to this action in an effort to show that we are prepared to fight for our rights , ” he said .
Shortly after the interview began , however , the man received a phone call from a fellow worker who told him that the police were searching for the journalist .
Scared , the worker immediately ended the interview and rushed out of the café .
According to him , the “ microbus ” driver that the police had forced into taking the journalist to the train station had been arrested .
He did not want to risk arrest .
“ I ca n’t be arrested .
My family is too important for me to go to jail , ” he said as he paid the bill and rushed off .
This is what the state has done to Egyptian society , says Gamal Eid , the Executive Director of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( ANHRI ) .
He says that the state of fear instilled in Egyptian life has limited the amount of discussion toward certain areas .
“ Just like workers movements , these people believe that the government can and does come in and arrest people and beat them up for simply expressing their ideas .
This is wrong , but the fear is very strong and this is difficult to break , ” he argues .
In Tanta , with the workers holding strong , coverage of the strike has been limited to phone conversations with those inside the factory .
With no end in sight for the workers ' sit-in , it is difficult to gauge whether they will be successful or not .
“ Look at what we achieved in building our own union , ” says Mervat Hilal , a deputy of the tax collectors union , the country ’s first private workers union .
“ We were able to create our own union and get our demands heard , so hopefully , others will follow suit , ” she continues , pointing to the union established earlier this year and that has been praised as the first step toward guaranteeing workers rights .
The tax collectors held a similar sit-in at the Egyptian Parliament last year , demanding that their monthly salary be increased .
With the government unwilling to budge , they formed a private union .
It has been largely successful .
Their monthly wages have increased from an average of 300 Egyptian pounds ( $ 50 ) to over 1,200 Egyptian pounds monthly ( $ 200 ) .
Osman says that their example is a major force in keeping spirits high at the Tanta factory .
“ We see others have succeeded .
I want all to see what is going on here so we can get there , like other people have already done in this country , ” he says .
Whether they will succeed is yet to be seen , but with the chanting uninterrupted every day at the factory , the workers ’ pressure is growing , as is their international stature .
No foreign journalists are being allowed in , but word is getting out .
The attack on Ian Tomlinson was the Metropolitan Police 's " Rodney King moment " .
King , you may recall , is a black American who , in March 1991 , was savagely beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers after being stopped for a speeding offence .
A resident videotaped the proceedings from his apartment .
The Los Angeles District Attorney charged four officers with use of excessive force .
A jury acquitted three of them and failed to agree about a verdict on the fourth .
Six days of rioting followed , in which more than 50 people died and $ 1bn of property was destroyed .
The assault on Tomlinson will not spark off a riot , but nobody should underestimate the outrage it has generated .
And from the instant the video footage - shot by an American bystander using his digital still camera - appeared on the Guardian website , it was clear that we had reached a pivotal moment .
Consumer technology had given citizens a serious tool for recording how policemen behave .
It also brought to mind the case of Blair Peach , the young New Zealand teacher who , on a demonstration 30 years ago , was clubbed by a police officer and died the day after of his injuries .
Nobody was ever tried for the assault and the coroner recorded a verdict of " death by misadventure " .
There was no " citizen journalism " at the time of the Peach case .
Nobody had a cameraphone or a digital camcorder , because they had n't been invented .
And the incident was n't recorded by any press photographer or film crew .
So the cop who attacked the young teacher escaped scot - free .
In a normal democracy we would expect that the technology which revealed what really happened to Tomlinson would stimulate a reassessment by the police about how they conduct themselves .
Accidents will happen , terrible things are sometimes done in the heat of the moment , and political demonstrations attract their share of violent and disturbed people , but from now on the police will have to reckon with the possibility that anything they do will be recorded and globally published .
At one time , they - and the authorities they serve - were the only ones with CCTV and face - recognition technology , the ones with the sole prerogative to videotape and photograph demonstrators .
Now this technology is in the hands of consumers .
The police have two choices .
Accept that digital technology will make them accountable for their actions or try to control the technology .
In any normal society there would be no decision to be made .
But since 9/11 the threat of global terrorism has given the state - and its security apparatus - carte blanche to take whatever measures it deems necessary .
And it has imbued in every uniformed operative , from " Community Support " officers and the bobby on the beat to the bored guy in the airport checking your toothpaste , the kind of arrogance we once associated only with authoritarian regimes .
You think I jest ?
Talk to any keen amateur photographer .
As a group , photographers have been subjected to increasingly outrageous harassment by police and security operatives .
( For a partial list of incidents see bit.ly / 22VFRX ) .
Try photographing a bridge , public building or a police car parked on a double - yellow line and you will have a goon demanding your camera , image card or film .
Better still , ask John Randall , a Tory MP who recently told the Commons how one of his Uxbridge constituents , a Mr Wusche , photographed properties he thought were in bad repair to pass on to the council .
In front of one building was a police car containing police community support officers who had parked on a double yellow line as they popped into a sandwich bar .
Randall told MPs that " one of the PCSOs went over to Mr Wusche " - who fled fascist Italy in his youth - " and told him that he must immediately delete the photographs .
When Mr Wusche asked why , he was handed a notice and pretty much cautioned .
That upset him a great deal " .
It upsets me too .
And I expect that when the fuss over Ian Tomlinson 's tragic death has died down , we will find that the Nokia N82 and the Canon Digital Ixus have joined flick - knives , knuckledusters and coshes on the list of " offensive weapons " .
Welcome to New Labour 's National Surveillance State .
ANIMALS are to be both cherished and terminated in large numbers under the Federal Government 's latest round of funding for environment projects .
The fates of a veritable Noah's Ark of beasts , including feral camels , cane toads , island - based rodents and the ubiquitous rabbit , were sealed yesterday when the Environment Minister , Peter Garrett , announced $ 403 million in spending under its Caring for our Country program .
Native species can expect to benefit from an intensified war on invasive animals , along with grazing animals , which would theoretically mean less competition for fodder .
Feral camels are top of the " to - shoot " list , in what Mr Garrett claimed would be the " most significant " effort to control their numbers since the animals were introduced in the 19th century .
The Herald was pushing for camel importation to ease outback transport problems in 1837 , and the first dromedary , named Harry , arrived from the Canary Islands in 1840 .
Within a few decades stray camels were going feral , and the Government estimates there are now a million of them roving an area of 3.3 million square kilometres in central and northern Australia .
As you probably are aware , this Saturday is July 4th , IndependenceDay .
As you may also know , on the afternoon of this July 4th , I 'llbe one of four speakers at Independence Mall , in downtown Philadelphia , at the " Tea Party " event there .
My topic will be " You 're Not the Boss of Me ! " and this article is a sort ofintroduction to that rant .
The Declaration of Independence basically amounted to a bunch ofguys telling their king , " You 're not the boss of us anymore . "
The Declaration was an act of treason , written by a bunch of tax cheatsand lawbreakers .
It was n't merely some people whining orpetitioning the government to do something different .
In fact , the Declaration describes how they had already tried that , and ithad n't worked .
So they resorted to open disobedience .
And it was n' tjust one protest or demonstration , to make a point or try toconvince their masters to change ; it was a declaration that theywere completely and permanently denying the right of the standingregime to rule them at all , ever again .
And that 's a pretty darnradical thing to do .
For all the parades , fireworks , picnics , and other events whichwill happen on July 4th to celebrate " Independence Day , " how manyAmericans today do you think are capable of even contemplating thepossibility of engaging in " illegal " resistance against " authority " ?
Not many .
What would the equivalent of the Declaration of Independence looklike today ?
Well , we would have a lot MORE to complain about thanthe colonists did , with far higher taxes , far more intrusiveregulation , and a much higher level of oppression all around .
Butwhat would the conclusion be ?
It would n't be , " So you better changethose laws ! "
It would be more like this : " Dear Federal Government , you 're fired !
We 're not paying your taxesanymore , not obeying your laws ever again , and from now on we willresist your thugs when you try to enforce your will on us .
" How many Americans would dare to even THINK such a thing , much lesssay it out loud , or write it down and send it to the feds ?
Veryfew , indeed .
The truth is , the spirit of resistance is all but deadin this country .
Even among those in the pro-freedom movement , thevast majority of efforts revolve around begging the masters to benice , petitioning for or against this or that legislation , arguingover WHICH politician should run our lives and take our money .
" Write your congressman and tell him to oppose ...
" " Promise to vote against any candidate who does n't support ...
" " Sign this petition , to push legislation which will ... " I have a better idea .
How about if a few million of us send onemessage -- and only one message -- to those pretending to be our " representatives , " those who claim to have the right to rule us .
That message should be this : " Legislate whatever you want ; I will not obey .
And when you send your thugs to punish me , I willresist . "
THAT is the message of the Declaration of Independence .
But on this July 4th , how many Americans do you think would evendare to THINK such a thing -- even quietly and to themselves ?
What this country needs is not a change in legislation , or a changeof parties or candidates .
It does n't need another election , oranother protest or demonstration , or another group lobbying thegovernment for this or that .
What it needs is a people with afundamentally different mindset .
What it needs is a populationcapable of saying , " You 're not the boss of us ! "
But NOTHING thepeople ever hear from the mainstream media , or from those ingovernment , or from the talking heads and political pundits , willever endorse such an attitude .
On the contrary , the only messageyou 'll ever hear in the papers , on the radio or on the TV , fromacademia or from the government , will boil down to this : " You canwhine and complain about what the government is doing to you , and you can beg your masters to change , but you must never disobey !
" As long as obedience to authority is taught as the highestprinciple -- and it absolutely is almost everywhere in the country -- this will be a nation of pathetic slaves perpetually yetfruitlessly whining at their sadistic , power - happy masters .
Maybethis country should be something better than that .
If you 're one of the few who would like to hear a drasticallydifferent message -- one that is NOT premised on the assumption thatwe all have an obligation to bow to those who claim to be ourmasters -- then be at Fifth and Market in downtown Philadelphia onthe afternoon of July 4th .
( The talks start at 3:00 , and my rantmight be first , so make sure you 're there before that . )
And whileyou 're at it , bring along some obedient , unthinking flag - wavers , tosee if they can handle some REAL advocacy of freedom .
Let 's see howthey respond when their indoctrination as obedient subjectscollides with the concept of true liberty .
Or , if you can't make it to Philly on the Fourth ( or even if youcan ) , order a few copies of " The Iron Web , " and start " corrupting " the people you know by exposing them to the radical idea that theyown themselves , and that they do n't NEED the permission of tyrantsin order to be free .
Yes , understanding freedom requires a dramaticshift in mindset from the statist conformism that now plagues thiscountry .
On the other hand , it 's getting downright embarrassingwatching all the robbed , regulated and restricted American slaveswildly cheering about how free they are .
Larken Rose ( P.S.
The event in Philly will be videotaped , and I 'm sure it willbe posted online fairly quickly .
I 'll at least be posting my ranton my YouTube channel very soon after . )
CARACAS , Venezuela 
A plan to increase the American military presence on at least three military bases in Colombia , Washington ’s top ally in Latin America , is accentuating Colombia ’s already tense relations with some of its neighbors .
Venezuela , Ecuador and Nicaragua , which are members of a leftist political alliance that is led by President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela and backed by his nation ’s oil revenues , have all criticized the plan , saying it would broaden the military reach of the United States in the Andes and the Caribbean at a time when they are still wary of American influence in the region .
Despite a slight improvement in Venezuela ’s relations with the United States in recent months , Mr. Chávez has been especially vocal in lashing out at the plan .
Speaking on state television here on Monday night , he put Venezuela ’s diplomatic ties with Colombia under review , calling the plan a platform for “ new aggression against us . ”
Colombia ’s foreign minister , Jaime Bermúdez , on Tuesday defended the negotiations , which are expected to produce an agreement in August , asking neighboring countries not to interfere in Colombia ’s affairs .
“ We never expressed our opinion in what our neighbors do , ” he said , pointing to Mr. Chávez ’s attempts to strengthen ties with non-Western nations .
“ Not even when the Russian presence became known in Venezuelan waters , or with relations with China , ” he added .
Turbinado has been making solid progress .
See the GitHub repo .
Added a couple of big new features :
HAML and XHTML Templates
While Turbinado used XHTML for templates before , the HSX library ( an amazing piece of work ) was a real pain to use and threw very strange errors .
HSX ( and its associated libraries ) has been torn out of Turbinado and has been replaced by a custom preprocessor called ‘ trturbinado ’ .
The preprocessor is run by the webserver over any templates ( or views ) before they ’re compiled and loaded .
The preprocessor handles XHTML and a limited version of HAML ( to be enhanced ) .
See the example below .
After preprocessing , the ‘ someHtml ’ and ‘ someHAML ’ functions will yield the exact sasme code as the ‘ someTextXHTML ’ function .
Note : I ’m not great at writing parsers , so I would n’t doubt that there are bugs in the preprocessor !
markup :: VHtml markup= < div > <% someTextXHtml %> <% someHtml %> <% someHAML %> </div> -- |
These are the raw Turbinado .
View .
Html style tags someTextXHtml :: VHtml someTextXHtml = do s <- getViewDataValue_u " sample_value " :: View String ( ( tag " div " ) ( ( ( tag " i " ) ( stringToVHtml s ) ) +++ ( ( tag " b " ) ( stringToVHtml " some text in Turbinado .
View .
Html style " ) ) ) ) someHtml :: VHtml someHtml = do s <- getViewDataValue_u " sample_value " :: View String < div > < i><%= s %></i> < b> some text in XHtml style </b> </div > someHAML :: VHtml someHAML = do s <- getViewDataValue_u " sample_value " :: View String % div %i= s %b some text in HAML style
FastCGI Support
FastCGI has been an often requested feature , so I rewrote the CGI handling and added FastCGI support , too .
Much as with CGI , using FastCGI is very simple .
Just tell Apache to use ‘ dispatch.fcgi ’ to handle requests .
< VirtualHost *> DocumentRoot /home / alson / projects/turbinado/static < Directory " /home/alson/projects/turbinado/static " >
Options + FollowSymLinks + ExecCGI + Includes AddHandler cgi-script cgi AddHandler fastcgi-script fcgi AllowOverride None Order allow , deny Allow from all </ Directory > RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -f RewriteRule (.*) $ 1 [ L ] # Use FCGI RewriteRule ^(.*) $ %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/dispatch.fcgi [ QSA , L ] # Use CGI # RewriteRule ^(.*) $ %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/dispatch.fcgi [ QSA , L ] </VirtualHost >
Performance of Turbinado ’s FastCGI interface is pretty good , but is well short of Turbinado ’s HTTP interface , so , if you can live without the benefits of FastCGI , HTTP , which is simpler and faster , is the way to go .
Mozilla has launched a new project called Electrolysis that aims to bring multiprocess browsing to Firefox .
According to Mozilla , splitting up the page rendering workload into multiple processes will improve the browser 's performance , security , and stability .
The developers have already assembled a prototype that renders a page in a separate process from the interface shell in which it is displayed .
Mozilla has explored the possibility of adopting a multiprocessing approach for Firefox in the past , but the idea did n't gain serious traction in the Firefox developer community until it was implemented by Google and Microsoft in their respective web browsers .
Google 's Chrome browser uses a separate process for each page , an architectural approach that facilitates much more effective security sandboxing and prevents page - specific rendering glitches from crashing the entire browser .
Chrome even includes a process manager tool that can be used to see the status and resource consumption of each page .
Adapting Firefox to make it support multiprocess browsing will not be an easy task .
Many fundamental components of the browser 's underlying infrastructure will have to be modified in order to accommodate the transition .
This will partly involve using interprocess communication ( IPC ) to expose shared pieces of the browser to the individual tab processes .
This is somewhat complicated , but you can get a clearer picture of how it will work by looking at some of Mozilla 's design documents .
A particularly illuminating example is the overview of how Firefox 's image loading and caching mechanisms will be made to work with multiprocess browsing .
The browser currently has a single image loading component that is shared between tabs .
To make it work for multiprocess browsing , one approach would be to simply instantiate a separate image loader in each tab process .
In order to avoid redundancy , Mozilla 's documentation explains , an alternate solution that might potentially be more effective would be to have a central image caching and loading service that makes image content accessible to the tab processes via IPC .
It could be further optimized by using shared memory to to make the decoded image data accessible to the tabs , thus avoiding the IPC bottleneck for the heaviest aspect of the operation .
Last month , developer Chris Jones published a screencast which demonstrates a simple prototype that renders page content in a separate process outside of the main browser process .
He shows that the page rendering process can be terminated independently of the browser , meaning that a page - specific crash would take down only the page and not the entire browser .
" Notice that only the ' content ' disappears when the page crashes ; the user interface itself keeps running as if nothing happened .
This is a big step forward , " he wrote in a blog entry about the demo .
" With Firefox protected from buggy pages and plugins , more fun is possible .
This video shows me pressing a ' Recover ' button that relaunches the page that just crashed .
There are many more possibilities for recovering from these errors , and I 'm excited to see what our user interface folks cook up . "
Jones says that his prototype represents the work that the Electrolysis developers have done to meet the requirements specified by " phase I " of Mozilla 's multiprocess roadmap .
To bootstrap the development of the IPC system , Mozilla is using some code from Chromium , the open source development version of Google 's browser .
The developers are contemplating the possibility of replacing existing Firefox components , such as the browser 's network stack , with additional code from Chromium .
The experimental development work that is being done by various contributors on the Electrolysis project was recently consolidated into a single version control repository .
The developers hope to have nightly builds ready for developer testing soon , but they caution that it will not yet work on Mac OS X .
They are looking for volunteer Mac developers to participate in the project .
Electrolysis is going to be a truly enormous project .
It 's not clear yet if it will be ready in time for the next release of Firefox , which is codenamed Namaroka .
The work on Electrolysis will be done parallel to Namaroka development , so it will not impede other plans to improve the browser .
The early Electrolysis prototype and other parts that have been implemented so far are highly impressive .
The project is off to a very promising start and has the potential to bring a lot of value to the Firefox browser and its users .

CHICAGO  The Sears Tower , that bronze - black monument that forms the 110 - story peak of the skyline here and stands as the tallest office building in the Western Hemisphere , will soon have another unique feature : wind turbines sprouting from its recessed rooftops high in the sky .
The building ’s owners , leasing agents and architects said Wednesday that they are literally taking environmental sustainability to new heights with a $ 350 million retrofit of the 1970s - era modernist building  and the turbines are only the tip of the transformation .
The plan , to begin immediately , aims to reduce electricity use in the tower by 80 percent over five years through upgrades in the glass exterior , internal lighting , heating , cooling and elevator systems  and its own green power generation .
In such a huge tower , with 4.5 million square feet of office and retail space , 16,000 windows and 104 elevators , the project is bound to be one of the most substantial green renovations ever tried on one site , planners said .
The Sears Tower is significantly larger than the 102 - story , 2.6 - million - square - foot Empire State Building , for instance , which is also undergoing renovation to reduce energy consumption .
“ If we can take care of one building that size , it has a huge impact on society , ” said Adrian Smith , an architect whose firm designed the Sears Tower renovation .
“ It is a village in and of itself . ”
Six months ago , I received an odd phone call from a man named Jake DeSantis at A.I.G. Financial Products — the infamous unit of the doomed insurance company , staffed by expensively educated , highly paid traders , whose financial ineptitude is widely suspected of costing the U.S. taxpayer $ 182.5 billion and counting .
At the time A.I.G. F.P. ’s losses were reported , it became known that a handful of traders in this curious unit had sold trillions of dollars of credit - default swaps ( essentially unregulated insurance policies ) on piles of U.S. subprime mortgages , but its employees had n’t yet become the leading examples of Wall Street greed .
And so this was before Jake DeSantis and his colleagues found themselves suburban - Connecticut outcasts , before their first death threats , before the House of Representatives passed a bill because of them ( taxing 90 percent of their large bonuses ) , before New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo announced he was going after their paychecks , and before Iowa senator Charles Grassley said that A.I.G. ’s leaders should follow the Japanese example and “ either do one of two things , resign or go commit suicide . ”
DeSantis turned out to be a friend of a friend .
He ’d called because he did n’t know anyone else “ in the media . ”
As a type he was instantly recognizable : a “ quant , ” a numbers guy who was allowed to take financial risks because of his superior math skills , but who had no taste for company politics or public exposure .
He ’d grown up in the Midwest , the son of schoolteachers , and discovered Wall Street as a scholarship student at M.I.T .
The previous seven years he ’d spent running A.I.G. F.P. ’s profitable stock - market - related trades .
He was n’t looking for me to write about him or about A.I.G. F.P .
He just wanted to know why the public perception of what had happened inside his unit , and the larger company , was so different from the private perception of the people inside it , who actually knew what had happened .
The idea that the employees of A.I.G. F.P. had conspired to maximize their short - term gains at the company ’s longer - term expense , for instance .
He and the other traders had been required to defer about half of their pay for years , and intertwine their long - term interests with their firm’s .
The people who lost the most when A.I.G. F.P. went down were the employees of A.I.G. F.P. : DeSantis himself had just watched more than half of what he ’d made over the previous nine years vanish .
The incentive system at A.I.G. F.P. , created in the mid-1990s , was n’t the short - term - oriented racket that helped doom the Wall Street investment bank as we knew it .
It was the very system that U.S. Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner , among others , had proposed as a solution to the problem of Wall Street pay .

As many ( or very few in the real life haha ) people know , today is the Pi Approximation Day !
So it ’s time to make a contribution to celebrate this funny day =)
My contribution is to use Python and Pyevolve to approximate Pi number using Genetic Programming approach .
I ’ve created the functions gp_add (+ ) , gp_sub ( - ) , gp_div ( / ) , gp_mul (* ) and gp_sqrt ( square root ) to use as non-terminals of the GP .
The fitness function is very simple too , it simple returns the absolute difference between the Python math. pi and the evaluated individual .
I ’ve used also a population size of 1 k individuals with max tree depth of 8 and the random ephemeral constants as random integers .
The best approximation I ’ve got while running the GP for about 8 minutes ( 40 generations ) was 3.1416185511 , best for 3 digits , you can improve it and let it run for more time to get better approximations .
Here is the formulae I ’ve got with the GP ( click to enlarge ) :
And here is the output of the script :

Some Background History
Some Pi Approximations
By Jason Palmer
Science and technology reporter , BBC News
The first planet to be seen outside the Milky Way may lie in Andromeda
Astronomers believe they have seen hints of the first planet to be spotted outside of our galaxy .
Situated in the Andromeda galaxy , the planet appears to be about six times the mass of Jupiter .
The method hinges on gravitational lensing , whereby a nearer object can bend the light of a distant star when the two align with an observer .
The results will be published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society ( MNRAS ) .
The team , made up of researchers from the National Institute of Nuclear Physics ( INFN ) in Italy and collaborators in Switzerland , Spain , and Russia , exploited a type of gravitational lensing called microlensing .
The effect of large , massive objects between an observer and a distant planet or star can cause distortion or multiple images as the intermediary object 's gravity bends the passing light .
Microlensing , by contrast , occurs when a less massive object lies in the middle .
The technology is in place to truly see planets of Jupiter 's mass and even less in other galaxies
Francesco De Paolis
INFN
There is a noticeable increase in the observed intensity of light coming from the aligned pair as the intermediate object focuses the distant one 's light .
Because the effect depends on smaller objects that will be moving quickly relative to one another , microlensing events are fleeting , happening over the course of minutes or hours .
Moreover , the mutual alignment of two small , far - flung objects with an observer on the Earth is exceptionally rare .
For that reason , dense collections of millions of stars , such as the Andromeda galaxy , are surveyed in order to detect them .
' Exceptional ' Francesco
De Paolis of the INFN and his colleagues developed a computer model to determine the likelihood of detecting an exoplanet via a microlensing event in the Andromeda galaxy .
They modelled the " light curve " , the variation in light that a microlensed star would exhibit if it were being orbited by a companion - another star or a planet .
Having determined the clues that a planet in Andromeda would show , they returned to a survey completed in 2004 by the Point - Agape collaboration of astronomers that showed an unusual light curve .
That event , the group says , matches up to its theory and can be attributed to a companion of a mass about six times that of Jupiter .
That suggests either a planet , or a small companion star such as a brown dwarf .
Stronger gravitational lensing results in multiple images
Unfortunately , given that microlensing events from a given pair of objects happen just once , astronomers cannot return to the planet candidate to confirm the idea .
But Dr De Paolis is encouraged by the possibility of detecting planets at such phenomenal distances .
" The interesting thing is that the technology is in place to truly see planets of Jupiter 's mass and even less in other galaxies , " he told BBC News .
" It 's an exceptional thing . "
Armed with the new theory , the authors of the work are looking to secure time on a larger telescope to continue with their observations in the hope of finding more candidates .
With about 350 extra - solar planets already found in our galactic neighbourhood , Dr De Paolis said , it was likely that such candidates were abundant .
The difficulty is in catching sight of one through a gravitational lens .
" It 's not easy , obviously , " he said .
" The problem is that we do n't know when a gravitational microlensing event is going to happen . "

AMAZON ISLAND ( Tulao'otupu )
What if all the world 's amazons or amazon - like women got their funds together , bought a deserted ( or rundown ) Pacific island , registered it as a nation with the United Nations , and set up their own constitution , flag , culture , army , everything ?
It would be , of course , strictly matriarchal .
Nudity allowed in all places , no more nanny state , cars banned making it a cyclist 's and hiker 's haven , traditional Polynesian culture adopted , never more than a mile from a sparkling white sand beach !
That 's Tulao ' otupu , amazon haven in the Pacific .
They even raise their own army , a peoples ' militia , therefore making them truly amazons , one definition of which , after all , means " fighting women . "
Pictures Above :
From left to right :
An amazon from Japan performs a Kiribati ( pronounced Kiribas ) island dance .
Center picture : Tulao ' otupu's President Nguyen Hue Bich ( right ) hikes with a huge Tongan amazon from Tonga ( left ) , a " nearby " Pacific island .
( Well , several hundred miles away , that 's nearby in Pacific terms ! )
What a president !
Finally , on the right - most picture , a trainer eyes how her student does with a shoulder - mount rocket launcher .

September 25 , 2009 — amlearningarabic
I have n’t been posting here in a while .
Too busy with other stuff .
In fact I had been going through Pimsleur Eastern Arabic I and managed to get up to lesson 14 .
But , it just seemed that I was n’t making much progress .
Something was missing : I just seem to be able to learn better with visual material and Pimsleur relies almost exclusively on audio .
A few days ago I got the “ Magic Key To The Arabic Alphabet ” – it ’s a course that teaches the Arabic writing system with a twist .
Instead of needing to copy the letters out by hand repeatedly , the system uses “ memory aids ” in the form of pictures .
For example the letter ba’ look like a boat and the letter fa’ looks like a phone .
I was really surprised how quickly I picked up the letters with this system .
You just have to visualize the pictures and then it ’s easy to recall the shapes of the letters later .
The course also contains a chapter on remembering the order of the letters in form of a story and a chapter on calligraphy ( which I have n’t looked into yet ) .
It comes as a PDF document with 70 pages and lots of pictures .
Now I can go on to other courses that use written Arabic .
Hopefully that ’ll help me learn Arabic faster .
Now , the best part of the course is that it comes with a copy of FSI Modern Written Arabic .
The FSI course looks really good and has more than 400MB in MP3s .
I had been searching for other places to get the FSI course , but the cheapest I could find before was for 40 bucks .
If you are looking for an easy way to learn the Arabic alphabet , then I can really recommend this course .
It costs $ 27 and you can get it at www.arabicgenie.com.
I ’d give it 4 out of 5 stars .
I ’ll post again once I made some headway with the FSI course .

Skype is the sort of software that is very cool , but I do n't seem to get that much use out of it .
And , though I do n't know many people who use it regularly , the Skype team continues to pile on useful communication technologies for those who do use it all the time .
The latest version for Mac — 2.8 — is out now , and adds screen sharing and Skype Access among other improvements .
The first major new addition , screen sharing , lets users share all or part of their screen to any other Skype user that 's running a video - capable version .
If the other user is running version 2.8 for Mac or version 4.1 for Windows , though , both users can even collaborate across platforms .
This feature works a lot like iChat 's screen sharing features , and like iChat , you can continue to chat while the feature is active .
The other new major addition , a Mac - only feature for now , is Skype Access .
This feature lets you log into for - pay WiFi access points and use your Skype credit to pay for it .
Unlike most pay systems , which charge hourly or daily rates , you 'll pay just 19 ?
a minute — so you just pay for only the time you use .
As long as the service provider is compatible with Skype Access , you wo n't need to register for any other service —
Skype 2.8 will recognize compatible hotspots , sign you in , and the credit is deducted automatically from your Skype account .
This is what a typical Ars writer — in this case science writer Chris Lee — has going on at any giving moment ... dozens of windows , apps , browser tabs — and on occasion , Skype .
Along with these changes are some other minor , but useful , new features .
If you 're a heavy Skype user , and have lots of active chats going at once , you can re-sort chats in the chat drawer .
You can also assign four different priority levels ( none , low , medium , high ) to each chat , " so you can deal with the most important messages first , " according to Skype 's Peter Parkes .
And , if you want to add multiple people to a chat , its much easier to do so with " Quick Add " — simply click the Add button , start typing a contact 's name , and click the name from the list of possible matches .
In addition to the chat management comes a few other tweaks for working with contacts .
Skype 2.8 supports profile pictures ( aka buddy icons ) up to 256 x 256 px ; new to the Mac version is a profile picture picker ; profile pictures can be hidden by default in contact requests ( in case someone has a racy or otherwise unpleasant icon ) ; and you can add your own notes about each contact in the profile window — especially handy for business contacts .
Also , Skype has added a " mood message " pseudo - chat — Parkes said , " it 's a bit like Twitter , but do n’t tell them we said that " — that posts a message every time one of your contacts changes their " mood message " ( aka status ) .
If you type a message here , it will change your mood message .
It is a bit like Twitter , except it does n't work with Twitter — only your Skype contacts .
If it had Twitter integration , it would make it more of a killer feature in our opinion .
Skype for Mac 2.8 also includes over 120 bug fixes ; adds more than a dozen improvements to existing features ; adds Estonian , Polish , and Brazilian Portuguese to the already impressive list of localizations ; and implements the recent additions to the Skype API .
The 2.8 betas had been solid performers , and in our admittedly limited testing , the final 2.8 release is just as solid .
If you 're a regular Skype user , or just thinking of trying the software out , you can download Skype for Mac 2.8 now for the low , low cost of absolutely free .
Even if you regularly use another chat client — here in Orbiting HQ , Adium is quite popular — Skype 's recent feature additions and ability to make VoIP calls could make it another useful tool in your communications arsenal .
We 've just seen a higher resolution image of the photo that appears to be David Carradine 's body hanging in his hotel room -- and it shows what seems consistent with an auto - erotica scenario ... at least from outward appearances .
The photo -- published by a Thai tabloid -- shows a body suspended from a bar in a closet , with his hands bound together above his head .
Carradine 's genitals were also tied .
But the new sharper image also reveals what appears to be fishnet stockings covering the body .
You can also see red women 's lingerie on the bed .
And , it appears , Carradine may have been wearing a dark wig .

Right now alternative fuels and sources of energy are gaining a lot of traction .
If conventional fuel prices spike again ( which I expect to happen ) , we ’re going to see even more demand for alternative sources of energy .
One type of energy you do n’t read a lot about is geothermal energy .
But I think you ’re going to be hearing more about it soon .
For those who do n’t know , geothermal is energy from heat inside the earth ’s core .
It is typically extracted by drilling wells at various depths to harness the earth ’s energy .
It is done through various means .
The advantages of geothermal energy are :
1 ) Its better for the environment than fossil fuels .
A lot better .
With new environmental legislation coming soon restricting emissions , companies are going to start looking harder at this type of energy .
2 ) Its cheaper than other alternative energies .
The big cost for geothermal is upfront .
This is why private capital is necessary .
The recession has hindered the amount of private capital looking for these types of projects , but that will likely come back .
This quote summarizes the differences in price :
Geothermal energy is expected to cost about 7.3 cents per kilowatt hour by 2030 compared to 8.1 cents per kilowatt for wind , 12.5 cents per kilowatt hour for concentrating solar thermal and about 22.9 cents per kilowatt hour for solar photovoltaic , according to the Energy Department .
3 ) Geothermal energy provides base - load power .
Utility companies need a continuous source of energy to meet minimum energy demands , or basically a 24/7 source .
Geothermal provides that .
This is a big advantage over sources like solar and wind , which can be intermittent .
Like any alternative energy , there are barriers to entry .
To me , the most important factors that limit geothermal energy are A ) Political Will , and B ) Private Capital .
Political Will behind Geothermal Energy
As far as politics goes , the right group of politicians are in Washington if you ’re looking for a change in our energy plan .
Some of this is already happening .
You also have what are called “ renewable portfolio standards ” , which are being enacted all across the country .
They require states to generate a certain percentage of their electricity through renewable sources .
California is one of the first to go into effect with 20 % required by 2010 .
This is good news for geothermal , as much of its potential is in the Western U.S. , as evidenced by the included geothermal energy map .
We ’re also seeing plenty of tax credits and incentives through the federal government .
The economic stimulus plan added some money for renewables , and I expect those type of measures to continue .
Private Capital to Support Geothermal Energy Projects
Private capital funds and individual consumer money is flowing into geothermal as well .
Google ’s philanthropic arm Google.org is also granting money to geothermal research and projects .
This technology is definitely starting to gain some awareness , and Google is taking a big role in it .
How can you we invest in geothermal ?
The largest players are diversified energy companies like Calpine and Chevron .
For me , that is too indirect .
I like Ormat Technologies ( symbol ORA ) .
I think they are the best pure play on geothermal .
They sell electricity through their own plants , but also sell products and help set up geothermal projects for companies all over the world .
They just reported a great quarter with a strong outlook ahead .
The stock is expensive , at 22 x forward earnings , but the shares would look attractive if we see any pullback .
So what ’s the bottom line here ?
Geothermal is n’t developed enough to be a stand - along solution to our energy problems , but it can be a major player in our revamped energy plan .
It will just take more time , awareness , and willingness of political leaders .
Overall , I think geothermal has a bright future .

Yesterday on The Dennis Miller Show , The Weekly Standard editor , and FNC contributor , Bill Kristol urged Republicans to follow Sarah Palin ’s lead and co-opt the term progressive from Democrats .
Kristol said , “ Conservatives should not give up the notion that they ’re the progressive force now in American politics . ”
Is the GOP so empty that they now have to steal from Democrats ?
Here is the audio courtesy of Think Progress :
Advertisements
Kristol said , “ And I agree with you .
What ’s progressive about heaping tax burdens and energy costs burdens on working class and middle class people in a tough economic time ?
I mean , who ’s really for progress ?
People make fun of Sarah Palin , her grammar ’s not so good some times and she ’s always talking about “ progressing Alaska forward . ”
It ’s not a verb I usually use , but maybe she ’s on to something in the notion that conservatives should not give up the notion that they ’re the progressive force now in American politics . ”
Kristol was doing something interesting here .
He was trying to reframe the word progressive by using the standard dictionary definition , not the political definition .
The standard dictionary definition of a progressive is , someone who is “ favoring or advocating progress , change , improvement , or reform , as opposed to wishing to maintain things as they are , esp. in political matters : a progressive mayor . ”
The political definition is more associated with liberalism .
It is , “ making progress toward better conditions ; employing or advocating more enlightened or liberal ideas , new or experimental methods , etc. : a progressive community . ”
Notice that Kristol was n’t discussing redefining the word as a political slur , as the GOP did with the word liberal .
Instead , he wants to redefine the term .
Nothing is more indicative of the Democrats recent success , than some Republicans willingness to copy them .
The creative bankruptcy within the Republican Party is so severe currently that the only thing that they can think to do is imitate the Democrats and hope voters do n’t notice .
The problem with this strategy is that they already attempted it in 2008 with Sarah Palin .
A majority of non-Republican voters quickly saw through the ruse of Palin as some sort of progressive reformer .
In order to become relevant again , the Republican Party needs to come up with new ideas .
Voters are n’t stupid .
They wrap up the same failed policies with a new progressive ribbon , and expect to win a national election .
WASHINGTON With the market value of Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway down 30 percent in the last year , financial oracles seem highly overrated .
But a few got things right .
Jim Rogers , the legendary American investor , repeatedly warned against the real estate bubble and the fundamental weakness of economies that relied on credit without savings .
People should pay attention to his latest book , A Gift to My Children : A Fathers Lessons for Life and Investing , a short volume with advice to his daughters and all of us .
Rogers , 66 , founded the Quantum Fund with George Soros in 1970 .
He obtained returns of 4,200 percent in 10 years and then left to tour the world , first on a motorbike and then by car , with the eyes of an adventurer as well as an investor .
In 1998 , convinced that an imbalance between supply and demand would drive up the price of commodities for a long time , he founded the Rogers International Commodity Index .
He recently moved to Singapore with his family ; he wants his two young daughters to be bilingual in English and Mandarin .
In 2002 , he wrote that , contrary to reports of low inflation , everything in America was expensive .
He warned that the lack of savings , the gaping deficits , the mounting debt , and the looming war in Iraq would wreck the economy ( and , eventually , the dollar ) .
He declared that those who think that real estate is guaranteed money making are living in a dream . 
In his new book , Rogers gives examples of how he defied mob psychology from an early age by looking at the fundamentals of economies , industries , and companies , rather than just price charts .
There is nothing really all that new about what is happening to Americas auto industry .
In the 1960s , people told General Motors that the Japanese were coming to no avail .
Those who bet on Toyota anticipated the ruinous state of the Big Three today .
Similarly , anyone who looked at China carefully in the 1980s could see a juggernaut on the horizon .
Creativity and innovation are so powerful that they can beat the mastodons in the marketplace the reason why , Rogers reminds us , Apple was not crushed by IBM , as so many predicted .
The mob mentality lies at the root of many disasters .
Rogers learned that lesson when , observing that there was too much supply , he sold oil short in the early 1980s but , following the crowd , panicked and reversed his decision when the Iran - Iraq war broke out .
Eventually , oil fell as he had anticipated , but it was too late to profit .
We , in turn , learned the perils of the mob mentality in recent years when we bet on a never - ending real estate boom .
Rogers encourages his daughters to be citizens of the world  and not fear other people because they are basically the same , no matter what ethnic group . 
That is his answer to the growing sentiment of isolationism and xenophobia on the part of some of our leaders and citizens . 
Studying history is a good antidote to that danger , he suggests .
If it doesnt repeat itself , history at least in the words of Mark Twainrhymes .
Indeed , the lesson of 1929 should have prevented the real estate bubble , and that of Japan in the 1990s should have discouraged the bailout frenzy that has been the worlds response to the financial meltdown of the past year .
Be ethical , Rogers recommends , because the extension of civilization requires playing by  the rules , the law precisely why , for him , Russia , the land of outlaw capitalism ,  is doomed .
I asked Rogers if he thought that capitalism would eventually open up Chinas political system the way it did in South Korea and Taiwan .
 It is indeed happening as it did elsewhere in Asia ,  he told me .
 I first went to China in 1984 when there was one TV , one radio , one newspaper , etc .
Now they are everywhere , much less the Internet .
There are now thousands of demonstrations annually in China while there were none in 1984 .
Chinese citizens can also now travel easily and do so , so they know how the world works . 
Legend has it that Pythia , the priestess of Delphi , delivered the oracle in a state of frenzy , enveloped in vapor .
Bow - tied Jim Rogers is cooler than that .
He just looks at the world , wonders if we have all gone mad , and enjoys life while investing .
He is an eccentric who knows the center of things .
Maybe that makes the rest of us the real eccentrics .
Zoo Basel 's children's zoo welcomed eight miniature piglets this week or , as they call them , mini-schwein .
While not exactly exotic , the tiny piglets are the size of small puppies and have proven to be an absolute delight for the Swiss children lucky enough to see them .

After several victories in Danish courts , the entertainment industry is now trying to get The Pirate Bay blocked in Norway .
The country 's largest Internet provider ‘ Telenor ’ is now being dragged to court by IFPI , after it refused an earlier request to disable customer access to the world 's most prominent tracker .
Last year a Danish judge sided with IFPI and ordered the ISP Tele2 to block The Pirate Bay .
According to the court ’s decision , Tele2 was infringing copyright on a grand scale because users were transferring pirated material , copied via the ISP ’s routers .
The Danish case is not over yet as it ’s currently under appeal at the Supreme Court .
However , IFPI is already widening its territory in an attempt to score a similar victory in other countries .
This March , IFPI set course for Norway and gave the country ’s largest Internet provider ‘ Telenor ’ an ultimatum .
IFPI demanded that the ISP block access to The Pirate Bay within 14 days – or get taken to court .
“ This would be the same as demanding that the postal service should open all letters , and decide which ones should be delivered , ” was the response of Telenor ’s Ragnar Kårhus at the time , while he stressed that they follow the law and not the demands of the music industry .
Telenor thus refused to give into the demands of the music industry , and invited IFPI to file a lawsuit if they deem it necessary .
True to form and together with several movie studios , IFPI has now filed a lawsuit against Telenor .
Sveinung Golimo , a representative for Norwegian film makers said : “ We want to highlight this problem .
We do not wish to censor the Internet but we do want the possibility to make a living on what we create . ”
Apparently , the music and movie industries can’t make a living when Norwegians have access to The Pirate Bay .
The Pirate Bay team has always spoken out against IFPI ’s witch - hunt , and provided its users with several tutorials on how to circumvent the blockade .
Going even further , earlier this year Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde told Torrent Freak that they are seriously considering suing the IFPI for unfair competition .
“ They have had a monopoly on distribution and we ’re breaking that monopoly , and in turn they sue people that allow access to our distribution method , ” Sunde told us .
So your MacBook cost $ 1500 — boo hoo .
Thirty years ago , when the average salary was under $ 18,000 , you 'd have paid $ 2638 for an Apple II with 48 K of RAM ( $ 7770 in today 's dollars ) .
And a cellphone ?
Waaaay more .

Cellular technology had been in development since the early ' 50s , but cellphones did n't become commercially available until Motorola 's DynaTAC 8000X gained FCC acceptance in 1983 .
The DynaTAC had 30 minutes of talk time , 8 hours of standby and memory for 30 numbers .
It was also big enough to club that punk kid with the Flock of Seagulls haircut without getting blood on your favorite tweed jacket ( you know , the one with the elbow pads ) .
And the worst part is that you would have paid $ 4,000 for the privilege , $ 8,589 when you calculate for inflation .
Needless to say , spending $ 200 , or even $ 400 , for the latest smartphone does n't seem like a bad deal comparatively .

The point is this :
We all like to complain about the price of our gadgets , but the truth is that factors like increased competition and better manufacturing technologies have made the gadgets we buy today seem like extreme bargains when put in a historical context .
Let 's take a look at some more examples :
VCRs vs Blu-ray Players
In the late ' 70s , JVC 's 30 - pound HR - 3300 VHS player rolled out onto load - bearing retail shelves with a price tag of about $ 1400 ( $ 4,124 in 2009 dollars ) .
The rival Sony SL - 5400 Betamax player with its new fangled fast forward and rewind capability was n't much better at $ 1250 ( $ 3682 in 2009 dollars ) .
In contrast , the Samsung BD - P1000 was one of the first Blu-ray players to hit the US in 2006 — and it debuted for around $ 1000 .
That same year you could buy a Blu-ray player in a PS3 for under $ 500 .
Today , basic Blu-ray players can be had for less than $ 100 .
That 's a 90 % drop in just three years .

Computers
Then and Now
If the Apple II was too rich for your blood , you could have gone out and purchased the base model Atari 800 with up to 48 K RAM and a 1.8MHz MOS 6502 processor for $ 1000 ( $ 2,946 ) .
Want a floppy drive with that ?
No problem , that will be $ 600 ( $ 1,767 ) extra .
I 'll even throw in a black - on - white dot - matrix printer for $ 450 ( $ 1,326 ) .
If you are looking for something in the budget range , the original Radio Shack Tandy TRS - 80 with 4 - 16 K RAM and a 1.77 MHz Zilog Z - 80A processor starts at $ 600 ( $ 1,767 ) .

If you have a little more money to burn I could hook you up with the TRS - 80 Model II with 64 K RAM , 12 " monochrome monitor ( 40x24 or 80x24 text ) , and a built - in 500K 8 - inch floppy drive for $ 3899 ( $ 11,485 ) .
To put things into perspective , $ 11,000 is about what some silly gamer would pay for a top - of - the - line Alienware ALX X58 desktop with all the bells and whistles — including an overclocked Core i7-975 Extreme processor , dual 1.792MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295 GPUs , 24GB of RAM , and 2 x 256GB SSDs ( with 2 TB of additional storage ) , not to mention a 30 - inch high - def LCD monitor .
As you 'll see later on , in the late 1970s , many computers cost the same as new cars .

Gaming Consoles
Then and Now
If you were gaming at home in the late ' 70s , chances are you had the Atari 2600 .
It was the first console to feature plug - in cartridges and it cost $ 200 ( $ 589 ) at launch .
All in all , that figure is comparable to some configurations of the Xbox 360 and PS3 at launch , but it is important to consider that the latter consoles do more than just play games , acting as movie players , music decks , telecommunications hubs , all of which would have meant buying separate , expensive , primitive components back then .

Cassette Walkman vs MP3 Players
Advertisement
The cassette tape reigned supreme 30 years ago ; for most music lovers today , it 's all about the download .
Difference is , you can get an iPod shuffle that holds about 1000 songs for $ 79 ( and many other MP3 players cost far less ) .
In 1979 , a cassette Walkman that could only play one Supertramp album at a time cost $ 200 ( $ 589 ) .
Televisions
Then and Now
Television price records from the period around the late ' 70s are spotty at best , because then , as now , pricing was ultracompetitive .
But it is clear that most people would have to be content with a 25 - inch set ( and it was probably encased in a 2 - ton ornate wooden shell ) .
According to tvhistory.tv , color console models like a 25 - inch Sylvania cost $ 530 to $ 850 ( $ 1,561 to $ 2,503 ) , and a 19 - inch JVC " tabletop " model at $ 560 ( $ 1,650 ) .
On the other hand , black - and - white models like a 22 - inch Motorola console ran about $ 260 ( $ 766 ) .

Today , you can randomly walk into just about any electronics store and get a 40 - to 50 - inch 1080 p HDTV for around $ 1000 .
If you settle for 720 p you could be talking $ 500 or less depending on the size , and those would all be in full color , too .
Old fashioned tube TVs , ( the B &W sets of 2009 ) cost $ 100 to $ 300 new — if you can even find one .
Other Popular Gadgets
How much did other gadgets cost in the late ' 70s ?
• Clothes Washer / Dryer : From $ 199 and $ 219 respectively ( $ 586 to $ 645 ) — that 's fairly comparable to today 's lower - end models .
Although , if you are on a budget you can easily find models that are significantly cheaper .

• Microwave : From $ 169 ( $ 498 ) — today many standard microwaves can be had for $ 60 or less .
• Dishwasher : From $ 259 ( $ 763 ) — today you can easily find basic dishwashers for $ 300 or less .
Advertisement
• Stereo System : $ 299 ( $ 884 ) — options vary of course , but that 's what a typical AM / FM / 8 - Track / record stereo system cost .
Today there are a ridiculous number of devices available to play and stream music in the house — many with their own included speakers and amplifier , not to mention wireless connectivity and vast internal music and video storage — that cost less than half that .
• Calculator : $ 25 ( $ 73 ) — Calculators come attached to everything these days but in the late ' 70s , if you wanted to score an original TI - 30 , it would have set you back a few bucks .
Today 's TI - 30 models cost $ 20 or less .

Cars Then and Now
Advertisement
Cars exist on a different plane than consumer electronics .
Due to a different system of manufacturing , R&D and labor , prices have not steadily trended downward — in fact , quite the contrary .
For example , The People History gives us a good idea about the price of specific cars 30 years ago — including models that are still in production today .
One of those cars , the Toyota Corolla , is listed at $ 3,698 ( $ 10,893 ) .
Today , a Toyota Corolla starts at around $ 15,350 .
On the higher end , the Chevy Corvette ran about $ 12,313 ( $ 36,270 ) in 1979 .
Today , a base model Corvette sells for around $ 45,515 .
Still , if you have been thinking about getting a new vehicle , this might be the best time in 30 years to do so .
According to Comerica 's annual Auto Affordability Index , cars are actually more affordable now than they were in 1979 .
Plus , the economy is forcing automakers and the government to offer all kinds of incentives which are pushing prices even lower .

By now you are probably getting the idea — being a tech nerd is cheaper than ever .
Sure , new technology is going to be expensive , but that is a consequence that most early adopters are willing to accept .
The good news is that , for the most part , manufacturers are charging much lower early adopter premiums when compared to 30 years ago ( and charging them for a shorter period of time ) .
With fierce competition and advanced manufacturing driving down the price of new technology at a blistering rate , it takes less patience than ever to reap greater and greater rewards .
So quit yer bitchin ' !

Gizmodo ' 79 is a week - long celebration of gadgets and geekdom 30 years ago , as the analog age gave way to the digital , and most of our favorite toys were just being born .
I have my TiVo setup to auto - record shows with various keywords , such as “ brownies ” and “ sandwich * ” ( no kidding ) .
So , it auto - recorded the All About Peanut Butter episode of Sara ’s Secrets that aired recently .
Among the recipes — and the one that triggered the recording — was The Elvis , which is a peanut butter and banana sandwich .
According to The Presley Family Cookbook , the sandwich eaten by Elvis contained only peanut butter and bananas ( which was then pan - fried , of course ) .
However , the chef from Peanut Butter & Co ( the guest on Sara ’s Secrets ) spoke of a variety with bacon as well .
And that sounded mighty tasty .
So , during my trip to Super Target on Friday , I picked up some bacon and bananas ( we already have peanut butter and Mike has some honey ) .
The bananas were a bit green around the edges , at the time , but they were just perfect by today ( small brown speckles here and there ) .
So , Mike and I decided to embark on the Elvis adventure .
We started by frying the bacon and , as a non-bacon - connoisseur , I was surprised by how much the bacon shrank during cooking ( some 10 - inch pieces shrank to about half that size ) .
The bacon happened to be low sodium , but I ’d be kidding myself if I were to say that it made a difference to the overall healthiness of the dish ; ) .
As Mike kept watch of the bacon , I prepared the bread — which was just a matter of buttering the outside of each slice and spreading peanut butter on the other side of one slice ( so , invariably , some slices end up butter - side down on the cutting board ) .
I then sliced a banana length - wise and placed those pieces onto the peanut - buttered sides .
Once the bacon was ready , I placed the bacon on top of the banana ( which , of course , was on top of the peanut butter ) .
Each sandwich was about to hold about four slices of bacon .
And , I drizzled some honey on top of the bacon to finish it off .
After that , we grilled them grilled - cheese style in the pan .
Sure , Velvet Elvises are good , but the bacon is a really nice touch .
In particular , its oily saltiness goes very well with the peanut butter .
And , the honey gives balance to the sandwich ’s sweet - vs - savory nature .
Believe it or not , Mike and I each had two of these artery - busting monsters .
And , man , they were fantastic .
We both agreed that we ’d have to make them more often :) .
Though the recipe is fairly straightforward , here 's also the official version from the show :
A simple five - minute behavioral test for children entering kindergarten can predict significant gains in mathematics skills over the course of the year , researchers have found .
Claire Cameron Ponitz , a research associate at the University of Virginia , led a group that tested 343 children with the Head - Toes - Knees - Shoulders task , in which children perform the opposite of an oral command ( for example , the correct response for “ touch your toes ” would be to touch your head ) .
Higher scores , the researchers write in the May issue of Developmental Psychology , indicate a greater ability to control and direct one ’s own behavior , an ability essential for success in the structured environment of a kindergarten class .
Those with higher scores on the fall test generally reached higher scores in all areas in the spring , but showed significant gains compared with other children only in mathematics , not in literacy or vocabulary .
What ’s a parent to do ?
“ We know that consistency and giving children opportunities to control their own behavior helps them develop self - regulation skills , ” Dr. Ponitz said .
“ Playing games like red light , green light , or following through with consequences for violations of family rules  these are things that have been shown to be related to self - regulation in early childhood . ”
SACRAMENTO , California ( Reuters ) - Even if California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and top lawmakers quickly plug a $ 26.3 billion deficit to balance the state ’s budget , the state ’s weak revenues signal that a new shortfall will emerge .
Schwarzenegger and lawmakers say they are near a deal to balance the budget , even though a hoped - for agreement did not emerge on Wednesday because of a part of his plan to suspend a law on school funding .
A balanced budget for the fiscal year that started July 1 would allow the state to resort to traditional borrowing , providing a steadier supply of cash at a better price than the unorthodox IOUs it has been forced to issue in order to conserve cash .
But a balanced budget is seen as fleeting because California ’s economy , which is reeling from high unemployment and the recession , will remain in the dumps for some time .
Closing the current shortfall does not account for further deterioration in the economy -- and revenue -- that many economists expect .
“ It will be horrible next year , ” said economist Steve Levy of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy .
The UCLA Anderson Forecast unit last month said in a report that California ’s economy is in for a “ continued rough ride for the balance of 2009 and is not going to see economic growth return until the end of the year . ”
The unit also projected the state would suffer double - digit unemployment until 2011 .
California ’s revenues from personal income tax collections , its main revenue source , are posting their worst decline since the Great Depression .
“ By no stretch of the imagination is it done , ” said Christopher Thornberg , an economist at Beacon Economics in Los Angeles .
“ This is n’t going away any time soon . ”
RETAIL SALES TAXES WEAK
Orange County Supervisor John Moorlach said retail sales tax collections also will be weak for some time as consumers rein in spending .
Moorlach said he sees that happening all across Orange County , in Southern California , home to the subprime mortgage industry whose loans helped fuel the housing boom earlier this decade .
Many of the industry ’s former employees are living on bare - bones budgets and their absence from shopping malls will add strain to both local and state finances , Moorlach said .
“ Our social services offices have seen a lot of former mortgage brokers applying for food - stamps and welfare , ” he noted , adding that the number of individuals and businesses in his county seeking bankruptcy protection rose 62 percent in May from a year earlier and 5.4 percent from April .
“ Let ’s just hope the bottom ( of the recession ) is getting closer and closer , ” Moorlach said .
WALL STREET CONCERNED
Wall Street credit rating agencies are likewise on edge over California ’s tumbling revenues .
Moody ’s Investors Service earlier this week cut its rating on about $ 72 billion of the state ’s general obligation debt by two notches to Baa1 , or three notches above speculative status , and said the rating may suffer further downgrades .
Without a solution to the budget gap , the risk to priority payments is increasing , Moody ’s said .
To conserve cash for top payments , state finance officials began on July 2 issuing IOUs , an emergency measure they have taken only once before since the Great Depression .
Through Tuesday they had issued roughly 130,500 IOUs worth $ 588 million , according to the state controller ’s office .
Standard & Poor ’s managing director Steven Zimmermann is eager to see details of any budget agreement for signs of how Sacramento will manage its finances in coming months .
Zimmermann said it will be essential that Schwarzenegger and lawmakers not flinch from cutting spending beyond the deep levels they are now contemplating and from raising revenues to keep the state ’s budget in balance if necessary .
“ We hope the legislature would step up and with the governor make changes if they were necessary , ” he said , noting S&P rates the state ’s general obligation bonds at A and has them on its CreditWatch with negative implications .

Introduction
I 'm Dick Sutphen and this tape is a studio - recorded , expanded version of a talk I delivered at the World Congress of Professional Hypnotists Convention in Las Vegas , Nevada .
Although the tape carries a copyright to protect it from unlawful duplication for sale by other companies , in this case , I invite individuals to make copies and give them to friends or anyone in a position to communicate this information .
Although I 've been interviewed about the subject on many local and regional radio and TV talk shows , large - scale mass communication appears to be blocked , since it could result in suspicion or investigation of the very media presenting it or the sponsors that support the media .
Some government agencies do not want this information generally known .
Nor do the Born - Again Christian movement , cults , and many human - potential trainings .
Everything I will relate only exposes the surface of the problem .
I do n't know how the misuse of these techniques can be stopped .
I do n't think it is possible to legislate against that which often cannot be detected ; and if those who legislate are using these techniques , there is little hope of affecting laws to govern usage .
I do know that the first step to initiate change is to generate interest .
In this case , that will probably only result from an underground effort .
In talking about this subject , I am talking about my own business .
I know it , and I know how effective it can be .
I produce hypnosis and subliminal tapes and , in some of my seminars , I use conversion tactics to assist participants to become independent and self - sufficient .
But , anytime I use these techniques , I point out that I am using them , and those attending have a choice to participate or not .
They also know what the desired result of participation will be .
So , to begin , I want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing :
In the entire history of man , no one has ever been brainwashed and realized , or believed , that he had been brainwashed .
Those who have been brainwashed will usually passionately defend their manipulators , claiming they have simply been " shown the light " ... or have been transformed in miraculous ways .
The Birth of Conversion :
Brainwashing in Christian Revivalism in 1735 .
Conversion is a " nice " word for brainwashing ... and any study of brainwashing has to begin with a study of Christian revivalism in eighteenth century America .
Apparently , Jonathan Edwards accidentally discovered the techniques during a religious crusade in 1735 in Northampton , Massachusetts .
By inducing guilt and acute apprehension and by increasing the tension , the " sinners " attending his revival meetings would break down and completely submit .
Technically , what Edwards was doing was creating conditions that wipe the brain slate clean so that the mind accepts new programming .
The problem was that the new input was negative .
He would tell them , " You 're a sinner !
You 're destined for hell ! "
As a result , one person committed suicide and another attempted suicide .
And the neighbors of the suicidal converts related that they , too , were affected so deeply that , although they had found " eternal salvation , " they were obsessed with a diabolical temptation to end their own lives .
Once a preacher , cult leader , manipulator or authority figure creates the brain phase to wipe the brain - slate clean , his subjects are wide open .
New input , in the form of suggestion , can be substituted for their previous ideas .
Because Edwards did n't turn his message positive until the end of the revival , many accepted the negative suggestions and acted , or desired to act , upon them .
Charles J. Finney was another Christian revivalist who used the same techniques four years later in mass religious conversions in New York .
The techniques are still being used today by Christian revivalists , cults , human - potential trainings , some business rallies , and the United States Armed services ... to name just a few .
Let me point out here that I do n't think most revivalist preachers realize or know they are using brainwashing techniques .
Edwards simply stumbled upon a technique that really worked , and others copied it and have continued to copy it for over two hundred years .
And the more sophisticated our knowledge and technology become , the more effective the conversion .
I feel strongly that this is one of the major reasons for the increasing rise in Christian fundamentalism , especially the televised variety , while most of the orthodox religions are declining .
The Three Brain Phases : The Pavlovian Explanation
The Christians may have been the first to successfully formulate brainwashing , but we have to look to Pavlov , the Russian scientist , for a technical explanation .
In the early 1900s , his work with animals opened the door to further investigations with humans .
After the revolution in Russia , Lenin was quick to see the potential of applying Pavlov 's research to his own ends .
Three distinct and progressive states of transmarginal inhibition were identified by Pavlov .
The first is the equivalent phase , in which the brain gives the same response to both strong and weak stimuli .
The second is the paradoxical phase , in which the brain responds more actively to weak stimuli than to strong .
And the third is the ultra- paradoxical phase , in which conditioned responses and behavior patterns turn from positive to negative or from negative to positive .
With the progression through each phase , the degree of conversion becomes more effective and complete .
The way to achieve conversion are many and varied , but the usual first step in religious or political brainwashing is to work on the emotions of an individual or group until they reach an abnormal level of anger , fear , exitement , or nervous tension .
The progressive result of this mental condition is to impair judgement and increase suggestibility .
The more this condition can be maintained or intensified , the more it compounds .
Once catharsis , or the first brain phase , is reached , the complete mental takeover becomes easier .
Existing mental programming can be replaced with new patterns of thinking and behavior .
Other often - used physiological weapons to modify normal brain functions are fasting , radical or high sugar diets , physical discomforts , regulation of breathing , mantra chanting in meditation , the disclosure of awesome mysteries , special lighting and sound effects , programmed response to incense , or intoxicating drugs .
The same results can be obtained in contemporary psychiatric treatment by electric shock treatments and even by purposely lowering a person 's blood sugar level with insulin injections .
Before I talk about exactly how some of the techniques are applied , I want to point out that hypnosis and conversion tactics are two distinctly different things -- and that conversion techniques are far more powerful .
However , the two are often mixed ... with powerful results .
How Revivalist Preachers Work
If you 'd like to see a revivalist preacher at work , there are probably several in your city .
Go to the church or tent early and sit in the rear , about three - quarters of the way back .
Most likely repetitive music will be played while the people come in for the service .
A repetitive beat , ideally ranging from 45 to 72 beats per minute ( a rhythm close to the beat of the human heart ) , is very hypnotic and can generate an eyes - open altered state of consciousness in a very high percentage of people .
And , once you are in an alpha state , you are at least 25 times as suggestible as you would be in full beta consciousness .
The music is probably the same for every service , or incorporates the same beat , and many of the people will go into an altered state almost immediately upon entering the sanctuary .
Subconsciously , they recall their state of mind from previous services and respond according to the post - hypnotic programming .
Watch the people waiting for the service to begin .
Many will exhibit external signs of trance -- body relaxation and slightly dilated eyes .
Often , they begin swaying back and forth with their hands in the air while sitting in their chairs .
Next , the assistant pastor will probably come out .
He usually speaks with a pretty good " voice roll . "
The " Voice Roll " Technique
A " voice roll " is a patterned , paced style used by hypnotists when inducing a trance .
It is also used by many lawyers , several of whom are highly trained hypnotists , when they desire to entrench a point firmly in the minds of the jurors .
A voice roll can sound as if the speaker were talking to the beat of a metronome or it may sound as though he were emphasizing every word in a monotonous , patterned style .
The words will usually be delivered at the rate of 45 to 60 beats per minute , maximizing the hypnotic effect .
The Build - up Process : Inducing Altered States
Now the assistant pastor begins the " build - up " process .
He induces an altered state of consciousness and / or begins to generate the excitement and the expectations of the audience .
Next , a group of young women in " sweet and pure " chiffon dresses might come out to sing a song .
Gospel songs are great for building excitement and involvement .
In the middle of the song , one of the girls might be " smitten by the spirit " and fall down or react as if possessed by the Holy Spirit .
This very effectively increases the intensity in the room .
At this point , hypnosis and conversion tactics are being mixed .
And the result is the audience 's attention span is now totally focused upon the communication while the environment becomes more exciting or tense .
Assured Continuation : Fleecing the Flock
Right about this time , when an eyes - open mass - induced alpha mental state has been achieved , they will usually pass the collection plate or basket .
In the background , a 45 - beat - per - minute voice roll from the assistant preacher might exhort , " Give to God ... Give to God ... Give to God .... "
And the audience does give .
God may not get the money , but his already - wealthy representative will .
Bonding by Fear and Suggestion
Next , the fire - and - brimstone preacher will come out .
He induces fear and increases the tension by talking about " the devil , " " going to hell , " or the forthcoming Armegeddon .
In the last such rally I attended , the preacher talked about the blood that would soon be running out of every faucet in the land .
He was also obsessed with a " bloody axe of God , " which everyone had seen hanging above the pulpit the previous week .
I have no doubt that everyone saw it -- the power of suggestion given to hundreds of people in hypnosis assures that at least 10 to 25 percent would see whatever he suggested they see .
Testimony : Creating Community Spirit
In most revivalist gatherings , " testifying " or " witnessing " usually follows the fear - based sermon .
People from the audience come up on stage and relate their stories .
" I was crippled and now I can walk ! "
" I had arthritis and now it 's gone ! "
It is a psychological manipulation that works .
After listening to numerous case histories of miraculous healings , the average guy in the audience with a minor problem is sure he can be healed .
The room is charged with fear , guilt , intense excitement , and expectations .
Miracles
Now those who want to be healed are frequently lined up around the edge of the room , or they are told to come down to the front .
The preacher might touch them on the head firmly and scream , " Be healed ! "
This releases the psychic energy and , for many , catharsis results .
Catharsis is a purging of repressed emotions .
Individuals might cry , fall down or even go into spasms .
And if catharsis is effected , they stand a chance of being healed .
In catharsis ( one of the three brain phases mentioned earlier ) , the brain - slate is temporarily wiped clean and the new suggestion is accepted .
For some , the healing may be permanent .
For many , it will last four days to a week , which is , incidentally , how long a hypnotic suggestion given to a somnambulistic subject will usually last .
Even if the healing does n't last , if they come back every week , the power of suggestion may continually override the problem ... or sometimes , sadly , it can mask a physical problem which could prove to be very detrimental to the individual in the long run .
The Grey Area of Legitimacy
I 'm not saying that legitimate healings do not take place .
They do .
Maybe the individual was ready to let go of the negativity that caused the problem in the first place ; maybe it was the work of God .
Yet I contend that it can be explained with existing knowledge of brain / mind function .
A Game in Which the Rules Keep Changing
The techniques and staging will vary from church to church .
Many use " speaking in tongues " to generate catharsis in some while the spectacle creates intense excitement in the observers .
The use of hypnotic techniques by religions is sophisticated , and professionals are assuring that they become even more effective .
A man in Los Angeles is designing , building , and reworking a lot of churches around the country .
He tells ministers what they need and how to use it .
This man 's track record indicates that the congregation and the monetary income will double if the minister follows his instructions .
He admits that about 80 percent of his efforts are in the sound system and lighting .
Powerful sound and the proper use of lighting are of primary importance in inducing an altered state of consciousnes - - I 've been using them for years in my own seminars .
However , my participants are fully aware of the process and what they can expect as a result of their participation .
Six Conversion Techniques
Cults and human - potential organizations are always looking for new converts .
To attain them , they must also create a brain - phase .
And they often need to do it within a short space of time - - a weekend , or maybe even a day .
The following are the six primary techniques used to generate the conversion .
Isolation Intimidation , Deprivation and Indoctrination
The meeting or training takes place in an area where participants are cut off from the outside world .
This may be any place : a private home , a remote or rural setting , or even a hotel ballroom where the participants are allowed only limited bathroom usage .
In human - potential trainings , the controllers will give a lengthy talk about the importance of " keeping agreements " in life .
The participants are told that if they do n't keep agreements , their life will never work .
It 's a good idea to keep agreements , but the controllers are subverting a positive human value for selfish purposes .
The participants vow to themselves and their trainer that they will keep their agreements .
Anyone who does not will be intimidated into agreement or forced to leave .
The next step is to agree to complete training , thus assuring a high percentage of conversions for the organizations .
They will usually have to agree not to take drugs , smoke , and sometimes not to eat ... or they are given such short meal breaks that it creates tension .
The real reason for the agreements is to alter internal chemistry , which generates anxiety and hopefully causes at least a slight malfunction of the nervous system , which in turn increases the conversion potential .
The " Sell It By Zealot " Technique
Before the gathering is complete , the agreements will be used to ensure that the new converts go out and find new participants .
They are intimidated into agreeing to do so before they leave .
Since the importance of keeping agreements is so high on their priority list , the converts will twist the arms of everyone they know , attempting to talk them into attending a free introductory session offered at a future date by the organization .
The new converts are zealots .
In fact , the inside term for merchandising the largest and most successful human - potential training is , " sell it by zealot ! "
At least a million people are graduates and a good percentage have been left with a mental activation button that assures their future loyalty and assistance if the guru figure or organization calls .
Think about the potential political implications of hundreds of thousands of zealots programmed to campaign for their guru .
Be wary of an organization of this type that offers follow - up sessions after the seminar .
Follow - up sessions might be weekly meetings or inexpensive seminars given on a regular basis which the organization will attempt to talk you into taking -- or any regularly scheduled event used to maintain control .
As the early Christian revivalists found , long - term control is dependent upon a good follow - up system .
Wearing Down Resistance
Alright .
Now , let 's look at the second tip - off that indicates conversion tactics are being used .
A schedule is maintained that causes physical and mental fatigue .
This is primarily accomplished by long hours in which the participants are given no opportunity for relaxation or reflection .
Increasing Tension
The third tip - off : techniques used to increase the tension in the room or environment .
Introducing Uncertainty About Identity
Number four : Uncertainty .
I could spend hours relating various techniques to increase tension and generate uncertainty .
Basically , the participants are concerned about being " put on the spot " or encountered by the trainers , guilt feelings are played upon , participants are tempted to verbally relate their innermost secrets to the other participants or forced to take part in activities that emphasize removing their masks .
One of the most successful human - potential seminars forces the participants to stand on a stage in front of the entire audience while being verbally attacked by the trainers .
A public opinion poll , conducted a few years ago , showed that the number one most - fearful situation an individual could encounter is to speak to an audience .
It ranked above window washing outside the 85th floor of an office building .
So you can imagine the fear and tension this situation generates within the participants .
Many faint , but most cope with the stress by mentally going away .
They literally go into an alpha state , which automatically makes them many times as suggestible as they normally are .
And another loop of the downward spiral into conversion is successfully effected .
Jargon
The fifth clue that conversion tactics are being used is the introduction of jargon -- new terms that have meaning only to the " insiders " who participate .
Vicious language is also frequently used , purposely , to make participants uncomfortable .
Lack of Humor : No Release , No Resistance
The final tip - off is that there is no humor in the communications ... at least until the participants are converted .
Then , merry - making and humor are highly desirable as symbols of the new joy the participants have supposedly " found . "
Not Always a Bad Thing
I 'm not saying that good does not result from participation in such gatherings .
It can and does .
But I contend it is important for people to know what has happened and to be aware that continual involvement may not be in their best interest .
Over the years , I 've conducted professional seminars to teach people to be hypnotists , trainers , and counselors .
I 've had many of those who conduct trainings and rallies come to me and say , " I 'm here because I know that what I 'm doing works , but I do n't know why . "
After showing them how and why , many have gotten out of the business or have decided to approach it differently or in a much more loving and supportive manner .
Many of these trainers have become personal friends , and it scares us all to have experienced the power of one person with a microphone and a room full of people .
Add a little charisma and you can count on a high percentage of conversions .
The sad truth is that a high percentage of people want to give away their power -- they are true " believers " !
Cults : A Captive Course in Stockholm Syndrome
Cult gatherings or human - potential trainings are an ideal environment to observe first - hand what is technically called the " Stockholm Syndrome . "
This is a situation in which those who are intimidated , controlled , or made to suffer , begin to love , admire , and even sometimes sexually desire their controllers or captors .
But let me inject a word of warning here :
If you think you can attend such gatherings and not be affected , you are probably wrong .
A perfect example is the case of a woman who went to Haiti on a Guggenheim Fellowship to study Haitian Voodoo .
In her report , she related how the music eventually induced uncontrollable bodily movement and an altered state of consciousness .
Although she understood the process and thought herself above it , when she began to feel herself become vulnerable to the music , she attempted to fight it and turned away .
Anger or resistance almost always assures conversion .
A few moments later she was possessed by the music and began dancing in a trance around the Voodoo meeting house .
A brain phase had been induced by the music and excitement , and she awoke feeling reborn .
The Only Hope of Immunity
The only hope of attending such gatherings without being affected is to be a Buddha and allow no positive or negative emotions to surface .
Few people are capable of such detachment .
The US Marines as a Brainwashing Cult
Before I go on , let 's go back to the six tip - offs to conversion .
I want to mention the United States Government and military boot camp .
The Marine Corps talks about breaking men down before " rebuilding " them as new men-- as marines !
Well , that is exactly what they do , the same way a cult breaks its people down and rebuilds them as happy flower sellers on your local street corner .
Every one of the six conversion techniques are used in boot camp .
Considering the needs of the military , I 'm not making a judgement as to whether that is good or bad .
IT IS A fact that the men are effectively brainwashed .
Those who wo n't submit must be discharged or spend much of their time in the brig .
Steps in the Decognition Process
Once the initial conversion is effected , cults , armed services , and similar groups cannot have cynicism among their members .
Members must respond to commands and do as they are told , otherwise they are dangerous to the organizational control .
This is normally accomplished as a three - step ˜ Decognition Process .
Alertness reduction
Step
One is alertness reduction :
The controllers cause the nervous system to malfunction , making it difficult to distinguish between fantasy and reality .
This can be accomplished in several ways .
poor diet is one ; watch out for Brownies and Koolaid .
The sugar throws the nervous system off .
More subtle is the " spiritual diet " used by many cults .
They eat only vegetables and fruits ; without the grounding of grains , nuts , seeds , dairy products , fish or meat , an individual becomes mentally " spacey . "
Inadequate sleep is another primary way to reduce alertness , especially when combined with long hours of work or intense physical activity .
Also , being bombarded with intense and unique experiences achieves the same result .
Programmed Confusion
Step
Two is programmed confusion :
You are mentally assaulted while your alertness is being reduced as in Step One .
This is accomplished with a deluge of new information , lectures , discussion groups , encounters or one - to - one processing , which usually amounts to the controller bombarding the individual with questions .
During this phase of decognition , reality and illusion often merge and perverted logic is likely to be accepted .
Thought Stopping
Step
Three is thought stopping : Techniques are used to cause the mind to go " flat . "
These are altered - state - of - consciousness techniques that initially induce calmness by giving the mind something simple to deal with and focusing awareness .
The continued use brings on a feeling of elation and eventually hallucination .
The result is the reduction of thought and eventually , if used long enough , the cessation of all thought and withdrawal from everyone and everything except that which the controllers direct .
The takeover is then complete .
It is important to be aware that when members or participants are instructed to use " thought - stopping " techniques , they are told that they will benefit by so doing : they will become " better soldiers " or " find enlightenment . "
Thought Stopping Techniques
Marching
There are three primary techniques used for thought stopping .
The first is marching : the thump , thump , thump beat literally generates self - hypnosis and thus great susceptibility to suggestion .
Meditation
The second thought stopping technique is meditation .
If you spend an hour to an hour and a half a day in meditation , after a few weeks , there is a great probability that you will not return to full beta consciousness .
You will remain in a fixed state of alpha for as long as you continue to meditate .
I 'm not saying this is bad -- if you do it yourself .
It may be very beneficial .
But it is a fact that you are causing your mind to go flat .
I 've worked with meditators on an EEG machine and the results are conclusive : the more you meditate , the flatter your mind becomes until , eventually and especially if used to excess or in combination with decognition , all thought ceases .
Some spiritual groups see this as nirvana -- which is bullshit .
It is simply a predictable physiological result .
And if heaven on earth is non-thinking and non-involvement , I really question why we are here .
Chanting
The third thought - stopping technique is chanting , and often chanting in meditation .
" Speaking in tongues " could also be included in this category .
All three - stopping techniques produce an altered state of consciousness .
This may be very good if you are controlling the process , for you also control the input .
I personally use at least one self - hypnosis programming session every day and I know how beneficial it is for me .
But you need to know if you use these techniques to the degree of remaining continually in alpha that , although you 'll be very mellow , you 'll also be more suggestible .
True Believers and Mass Movements
Before ending this section on conversion , I want to talk about the people who are most susceptible to it and about Mass Movements .
I am convinced that at least a third of the population is what Eric Hoffer calls " true believers . "
They are joiners and followers ... people who want to give away their power .
They look for answers , meaning , and enlightenment outside themselves .
Hoffer , who wrote " The True Believer " , a classic on mass movements , says , " true believers are not intent on bolstering and advancing a cherished self , but are those craving to be rid of unwanted self .
They are followers , not because of a desire for self - advancement , but because it can satisfy their passion for self - renunciation ! "
Hoffer also says that true believers " are eternally incomplete and eternally insecure " !
I know this from my own experience .
In my years of communicating concepts and conducting trainings , I have run into them again and again .
All I can do is attempt to show them that the only thing to seek is the True Self within .
Their personal answers are to be found there and there alone .
I communicate that the basics of spirituality are self - responsibility and self - actualization .
But most of the true believers just tell me that I 'm not spiritual and go looking for someone who will give them the dogma and structure they desire .
Never underestimate the potential danger of these people .
They can easily be molded into fanatics who will gladly work and die for their holy cause .
It is a substitute for their lost faith in themselves and offers them as a substitute for individual hope .
The Moral Majority is made up of true believers .
All cults are composed of true believers .
You 'll find them in politics , churches , businesses , and social cause groups .
They are the fanatics in these organizations .
Mass Movements will usually have a charismatic leader .
The followers want to convert others to their way of living or impose a new way of life -- if necessary , by legislating laws forcing others to their view , as evidenced by the activities of the Moral Majority .
This means enforcement by guns or punishment , for that is the bottomline in law enforcement .
A common hatred , enemy , or devil is essential to the success of a mass movement .
The Born - Again Christians have Satan himself , but that is n't enough -- they 've added the occult , the New Age thinkers and , lately , all those who oppose their integration of church and politics , as evidenced in their political reelection campaigns against those who oppose their views .
In revolutions , the devil is usually the ruling power or aristocracy .
Some human - potential movements are far too clever to ask their graduates to join anything , thus labeling themselves as a cult -- but , if you look closely , you 'll find that their devil is anyone and everyone who has n't taken their training .
There are mass movements without devils but they seldom attain major status .
The True Believers are mentally unbalanced or insecure people , or those without hope or friends .
People do n't look for allies when they love , but they do when they hate or become obsessed with a cause .
And those who desire a new life and a new order feel the old ways must be eliminated before the new order can be built .
Persuasion Techniques
Persuasion is n't technically brainwashing but it is the manipulation of the human mind by another individual , without the manipulated party being aware what caused his opinion shift .
I only have time to very basically introduce you to a few of the thousands of techniques in use today , but the basis of persuasion is always to access your right brain .
The left half of your brain is analytical and rational .
The right side is creative and imaginative .
That is overly simplified but it makes my point .
So , the idea is to distract the left brain and keep it busy .
Ideally , the persuader generates an eyes - open altered state of consciousness , causing you to shift from beta awareness into alpha ; this can be measured on an EEG machine .
" Yes Set "
First , let me give you an example of distracting the left brain .
Politicians use these powerful techniques all the time ; lawyers use many variations which , I 've been told , they call " tightening the noose . "
Assume for a moment that you are watching a politician give a speech .
First , he might generate what is called a " yes set . "
These are statements that will cause listeners to agree ; they might even unknowingly nod their heads in agreement .
Next come the truisms .
These are usually facts that could be debated but , once the politician has his audience agreeing , the odds are in the politician 's favor that the audience wo n't stop to think for themselves , thus continuing to agree .
Last comes the suggestion .
This is what the politician wants you to do and , since you have been agreeing all along , you could be persuaded to accept the suggestion .
Now , if you 'll listen closely to my political speech , you 'll find that the first three are the " yes set , " the next three are truisms and the last is the suggestion .
" Ladies and gentlemen : are you angry about high food prices ?
Are you tired of astronomical gas prices ?
Are you sick of out - of - control inflation ?
Well , you know the Other Party allowed 18 percent inflation last year ; you know crime has increased 50 percent nationwide in the last 12 months , and you know your paycheck hardly covers your expenses any more .
Well , the answer to resolving these problems is to elect me , John Jones , to the U.S. Senate . "
Embedded Commands
And I think you 've heard all that before .
But you might also watch for what are called embedded commands .
As an example :
On key words , the speaker would make a gesture with his left hand , which research has shown is more apt to access your right brain .
Today 's media - oriented politicians and spellbinders are often carefully trained by a whole new breed of specialist who are using every trick in the book - - both old and new - - to manipulate you into accepting their candidate .
The Power of NLP
The concepts and techniques of Neuro - Linguistics [ Programming ] are so heavily protected that I found out the hard way that to even talk about them publicly or in print results in threatened legal action .
Yet Neuro - Linguistic training is readily available to anyone willing to devote the time and pay the price .
It is some of the most subtle and powerful manipulation I have yet been exposed to .
A good friend who recently attended a two - week seminar on Neuro - Linguistics found that many of those she talked to during the breaks were government people .
Interspersal Technique
Another technique that I 'm just learning about is unbelievably slippery ; it is called an interspersal technique and the idea is to say one thing with words but plant a subconscious impression of something else in the minds of the listeners and / or watchers .
Practical Examples
Let me give you an example :
Assume you are watching a television commentator make the following statement : Senator Johnson is assisting local authorities to clear up the stupid mistakes of companies contributing to the nuclear waste problems . "
It sounds like a statement of fact , but , if the speaker emphasizes the right word , and especially if he makes the proper hand gestures on the key words , you could be left with the subconscious impression that Senator Johnson is stupid .
That was the subliminal goal of the statement and the speaker cannot be called to account for anything .
Persuasion techniques are also frequently used on a much smaller scale with just as much effectiveness .
The insurance salesman knows his pitch is likely to be much more effective if he can get you to visualize something in your mind .
This is right - brain communication [ E.g. generates emotions ] .
For instance , he might pause in his conversation , look slowly around your livingroom and say , " Can you just imagine this beautiful home burning to the ground ? "
Of course you can !
It is one of your unconscious fears and , when he forces you to visualize it , you are more likely to be manipulated into signing his insurance policy .
Shock and Confusion
The Hare Krishnas , operating in every airport , use what I call shock and confusion techniques to distract the left brain and communicate directly with the right brain .
While waiting for a plane , I once watched one operate for over an hour .
He had a technique of almost jumping in front of someone .
Initially , his voice was loud then dropped as he made his pitch to take a book and contribute money to the cause .
Usually , when people are shocked , they immediately withdraw .
In this case they were shocked by the strange appearance , sudden materialization and loud voice of the Hare Krishna devotee .
In other words , the people went into an alpha state for security because they did n't want to confront the reality before them .
In alpha , they were highly suggestible so they responded to the suggestion of taking the book ; the moment they took the book , they felt guilty and responded to the second suggestion : give money .
We are all conditioned that if someone gives us something , we have to give them something in return -- in that case , it was money .
While watching this hustler , I was close enough to notice that many of the people he stopped exhibited an outward sign of alpha -- their eyes were actually dilated .
Subliminal Programming
Subliminals are hidden suggestions that only your subconscious perceives .
They can be audio , hidden behind music , or visual , airbrushed into a picture , flashed on a screen so fast that you do n't consciously see them , or cleverly incorporated into a picture or design .
Most audio subliminal reprogramming tapes offer verbal suggestions recorded at a low volume .
I question the efficacy of this technique -- if subliminals are not perceptible , they cannot be effective , and subliminals recorded below the audible threshold are therefore useless .
The oldest audio subliminal technique uses a voice that follows the volume of the music so subliminals are impossible to detect without a parametric equalizer .
But this technique is patented and , when I wanted to develop my own line of subliminal audiocassettes , negotiations with the patent holder proved to be unsatisfactory .
My attorney obtained copies of the patents which I gave to some talented Hollywood sound engineers , asking them to create a new technique .
They found a way to psycho-acoustically modify and synthesize the suggestions so that they are projected in the same chord and frequency as the music , thus giving them the effect of being part of the music .
But we found that in using this technique , there is no way to reduce various frequencies to detect the subliminals .
In other words , although the suggestions are being heard by the subconscious mind , they cannot be monitored with even the most sophisticated equipment .
If we were able to come up with this technique as easily as we did , I can only imagine how sophisticated the technology has become , with unlimited government or advertising funding .
And I shudder to think about the propaganda and commercial manipulation that we are exposed to on a daily basis .
There is simply no way to know what is behind the music you hear .
It may even be possible to hide a second voice behind the voice to which you are listening .
The series by Wilson Bryan Key , Ph.D. , on subliminals in advertising and political campaigns well documents the misuse in many areas , especially printed advertising in newspapers , magazines , and posters .
The big question about subliminals is : do they work ?
And I guarantee you they do .
Not only from the response of those who have used my tapes , but from the results of such programs as the subliminals behind the music in department stores .
Supposedly , the only message is instructions to not steal : one East Coast department store chain reported a 37 percent reduction in thefts in the first nine months of testing .
A 1984 article in the technical newsletter , " Brain - Mind Bulletin , " states that as much as 99 percent of our cognitive activity may be " non-conscious , " according to the director of the Laboratory for Cognitive Psychophysiology at the University of Illinois .
The lengthy report ends with the statement , " these findings support the use of subliminal approaches such as taped suggestions for weight loss and the therapeutic use of hypnosis and Neuro - Linguistic Programming . "
Mass Misuse of Subliminal Programming
I could relate many stories that support subliminal programming , but I 'd rather use my time to make you aware of even more subtle uses of such programming .
I have personally experienced sitting in a Los Angeles auditorium with over ten thousand people who were gathered to listen to a current charismatic figure .
Twenty minutes after entering the auditorium , I became aware that I was going in and out of an altered state .
Those accompanying me experienced the same thing .
Since it is our business , we were aware of what was happening , but those around us were not .
By careful observation , what appeared to be spontaneous demonstrations were , in fact , artful manipulations .
The only way I could figure that the eyes - open trance had been induced was that a 6 - to 7 - cycle - per - second vibration was being piped into the room behind the air conditioner sound .
That particular vibration generates alpha , which would render the audience highly susceptible .
Ten to 25 percent of the population is capable of a somnambulistic level of altered states of consciousness ; for these people , the suggestions of the speaker , if non-threatening , could potentially be accepted as " commands . "
Vibrato
This leads to the mention of vibrato .
Vibrato is the tremulous effect imparted in some vocal or instrumental music , and the cyle - per - second range causes people to go into an altered state of consciousness .
At one period of English history , singers whose voices contained pronounced vibrato were not allowed to perform publicly because listeners would go into an altered state and have fantasies , often sexual in nature .
People who attend opera or enjoy listening to singers like Mario Lanza are familiar with this altered state induced by the performers .
Extra-low Frequency Vibrations ( ELFs )
Now , let 's carry this awareness a little farther .
There are also inaudible ELFs ( extra - low frequency waves ) .
These are electromagnetic in nature .
One of the primary uses of ELFs is to communicate with our submarines .
Dr. Andrija Puharich , a highly respected researcher , in an attempt to warn U.S. officials about Russian use of ELFs , set up an experiment .
Volunteers were wired so their brain waves could be measured on an EEG .
They were sealed in a metal room that could not be penetrated by a normal signal .
Puharich then beamed ELF waves at the volunteers .
ELFs go right through the earth and , of course , right through metal walls .
Those inside could n't know if the signal was or was not being sent .
And Puharich watched the reactions on the technical equipment : 30 percent of those inside the room were taken over by the ELF signal in six to ten seconds .
When I say " taken over , " I mean that their behavior followed the changes anticipated at very precise frequencies .
Waves below 6 cycles per second caused the subjects to become very emotionally upset , and even disrupted bodily functions .
At 8.2 cycles , they felt very high ... an elevated feeling , as though they had been in masterful meditation , learned over a period of years .
Eleven to 11.3 cycles induced waves of depressed agitation leading to riotous behavior .
[ note from Ken Adachi : : Joe Vialls reported that the CIA and Air Force employed this technique using large dish transmitters beaming down from the back cargo ramps of C135 cargo planes to incite opposing tribal factions in Rwanda to become enraged and engage in mindless slaughter and barbarism ]
The Neurophone
Dr. Patrick Flanagan is a personal friend of mine .
In the early 1960s , as a teenager , Pat was listed as one of the top scientists in the world by " Life " magazine .
Among his many inventions was a device he called the Neurophone -- an electronic instrument that can successfully programm suggestions directly through contact with the skin .
When he attempted to patent the device , the government demanded that he prove it worked .
When he did , the National Security Agency confiscated the neurophone .
It took Pat two years of legal battle to get his invention back .
In using the device , you do n't hear or see a thing ; it is applied to the skin , which Pat claims is the source of special senses .
The skin contains more sensors for heat , touch , pain , vibration , and electrical fields than any other part of the human anatomy .
In one of his recent tests , Pat conducted two identical seminars for a military audience -- one seminar one night and one the next night , because the size of the room was not large enough to accommodate all of them at one time .
When the first group proved to be very cool and unwilling to respond , Patrick spent the next day making a special tape to play at the second seminar .
The tape instructed the audience to be extremely warm and responsive and for their hands to become " tingly . "
The tape was played through the neurophone , which was connected to a wire he placed along the ceiling of the room .
There were no speakers , so no sound could be heard , yet the message was successfully transmitted from that wire directly into the brains of the audience .
They were warm and receptive , their hands tingled and they responded , according to programming , in other ways that I cannot mention here .
Technological Tools for Mass Manipulation
The more we find out about how human beings work through today 's highly advanced technological research , the more we learn to control human beings .
And what probably scares me the most is that the medium for takeover is already in place .
The television set in your livingroom and bedroom is doing a lot more than just entertaining you .
Before I continue , let me point out something else about an altered state of consciousness .
When you go into an altered state , you transfer into right brain , which results in the internal release of the body 's own opiates : enkephalins and Beta - endorphins , chemically almost identical to opium .
In other words , it feels good ... and you want to come back for more .
Recent tests by researcher Herbert Krugman showed that , while viewers were watching TV , right - brain activity outnumbered left - brain activity by a ratio of two to one .
Put more simply , the viewers were in an altered state ... in trance more often than not .
They were getting their Beta - endorphin " fix . "
To measure attention spans , psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland of the Veterans Hospital in Bedford , Massachusetts , attached young viewers to an EEG machine that was wired to shut the TV set off whenever the children 's brains produced a majority of alpha waves .
Although the children were told to concentrate , only a few could keep the set on for more than 30 seconds !
Most viewers are already hypnotized .
To deepen the trance is easy .
One simple way is to place a blank , black frame every 32 frames in the film that is being projected .
This creates a 45 - beat - per- minute pulsation perceived only by the subconscious mind -- the ideal pace to generate deep hypnosis .
The commercials or suggestions presented following this alpha - inducing broadcast are much more likely to be accepted by the viewer .
The high percentage of the viewing audience that has somnambulistic - depth ability could very well accept the suggestions as commands -- as long as those commands did not ask the viewer to do something contrary to his morals , religion , or self - preservation .
The medium for takeover is here .
By the age of 16 , children have spent 10,000 to 15,000 hours watching television -- that is more time than they spend n school !
In the average home , the TV set is on for six hours and 44 minutes per day -- an increase of nine minutes from last year and three times the average rate of increase during the 1970s .
It obviously is n't getting better ... we are rapidly moving into an alpha - level world -- very possibly the Orwellian world of " 1984 " -- placid , glassy - eyed , and responding obediently to instructions .
A research project by Jacob Jacoby , a Purdue University psychologist , found that of 2,700 people tested , 90 percent misunderstood even such simple viewing fare as commercials and " Barnaby Jones . "
Only minutes after watching , the typical viewer missed 23 to 36 percent of the questions about what he or she had seen .
Of course they did -- they were going in and out of trance !
If you go into a deep trance , you must be instructed to remember - - otherwise you automatically forget .
In Closing
I have just touched the tip of the iceberg .
When you start to combine subliminal messages behind the music , subliminal visuals projected on the screen , hypnotically produced visual effects , sustained musical beats at a trance - inducing pace . . . you have extremely effective brainwashing .
Every hour that you spend watching the TV set you become more conditioned .
And , in case you thought there was a law against any of these things , guess again .
There is n't !
There are a lot of powerful people who obviously prefer things exactly the way they are .
Maybe they have plans for ...?

Fiery E- Mails from A Fundamentalist Hothead ( Mar. 18 , 2005 )
http://educate-yourself.org/lte/fieryemailsfromahothead10mar05.shtml
Stirling Energy Systems ( SES ) and Tessera Solar recently unveiled four newly designed solar power collection dishes at Sandia National Laboratories ’ National Solar Thermal Test Facility ( NSTTF ) .
Sandia ’s concentrating solar - thermal power ( CSP ) team has been working closely with SES over the past five years to improve the system design and operation .
The modular CSP SunCatcher uses precision mirrors attached to a parabolic dish to focus the sun ’s rays onto a receiver , which transmits the heat to a Stirling engine .
The engine is a sealed system filled with hydrogen .
As the gas heats and cools , its pressure rises and falls .
The change in pressure drives the piston inside the engine , producing mechanical power , which in turn drives a generator and makes electricity .
The SunCatcher is a 25 - kilowatt - electrical ( kWe ) solar dish system which consists of a radial solar concentrator dish structure that supports an array of curved glass mirror facets designed to automatically track the sun and concentrate its solar energy onto a Power Conversion Unit ( PCU ) .
The PCU converts the focused solar thermal energy into grid-quality electricity .
The conversion process does not consume water , as is required by most thermal - powered generating systems .
“ The four new dishes are the next - generation model of the original SunCatcher system .
Six first - generation SunCatchers built over the past several years at the NSTTF have been producing up to 150KW [ kilowatts ] of grid- ready electrical power during the day , ” says Chuck Andraka , the lead Sandia project engineer .
“ Every part of the new system has been upgraded to allow for a high rate of production and cost reduction . ”
The new SunCatcher is about 5,000 pounds lighter than the original , is round instead of rectangular to allow for more efficient use of steel , has improved optics , and consists of 60 percent fewer engine parts .
The revised design also has fewer mirrors — 40 instead of 80 .
The reflective mirrors are formed into a parabolic shape using stamped sheet metal similar to the hood of a car .
The mirrors are made by using automobile manufacturing techniques .
The improvements will result in high - volume production , cost reductions , and easier maintenance .
Among Sandia ’s contributions to the new design was development of a tool to determine how well the mirrors work in less than 10 seconds , something that took the earlier design one hour .
“ The new design of the SunCatcher represents more than a decade of innovative engineering and validation testing , making it ready for commercialization , ” says Steve Cowman , Stirling Energy Systems CEO .
“ By utilizing the automotive supply chain to manufacture the SunCatcher , we ’re leveraging the talents of an industry that has refined high - volume production through an assembly line process .
More than 90 percent of the SunCatcher components will be manufactured in North America .
” In addition to improved manufacturability and easy maintenance , the new SunCatcher minimizes both cost and land use and has numerous environmental advantages , Andraka says .
“ They have the lowest water use of any thermal electric generating technology , require minimal grading and trenching , require no excavation for foundations , and will not produce greenhouse gas emissions while converting sunlight into electricity , ” he says .
Tessera Solar , the developer and operator of large - scale solar projects using the SunCatcher technology and sister company of SES , is building a 60 - unit plant generating 1.5 MW ( megawatts ) by the end of the year either in Arizona or California .
One megawatt powers about 800 homes .
The proprietary solar dish technology will then be deployed to develop two of the world ’s largest solar generating plants in Southern California with San Diego Gas&Electric in the Imperial Valley and Southern California Edison in the Mojave Desert , in addition to the recently announced project with CPS Energy in West Texas .
The projects are expected to produce 1,000 MW by the end of 2012 .
Last year one of the original SunCatchers set a new solar - to - grid system conversion efficiency record by achieving a 31.25 percent net efficiency rate , toppling the old 1984 record of 29.4 .
Surprise , surprise : it turns out Fox 's story about when it got Doug Hampton 's letter regarding John Ensign 's affair was inaccurate .
Fox News received Doug Hampton ’s letter about Sen. John Ensign ’s adulterous affair three days earlier than the network reported , according to information obtained exclusively by the Las Vegas Sun .
Fox said it did n’t receive the letter until June 15 , when it arrived as an attachment to an e-mail .
But FedEx tracking of a “ priority envelope , ” which a reliable source said contained the hard copy , shows it was delivered on the morning of June 12 .
That would mean the national news organization had additional time to investigate and report Ensign ’s affair before the senator ’s own admission of the relationship with Hampton ’s wife , who worked for the senator ’s leadership political action committees .
The earlier delivery date also leaves a larger window of time for someone who either worked at the conservative network or was close to it to tip off Ensign .
On Tuesday , Tom Lowell , senior producer of “ America ’s Newsroom , ” declined to comment on the FedEx delivery .
Hampton had addressed his June 11 letter to the co-anchor of “ America ’s Newsroom , ” Megyn Kelly .
The Amazon River and its current lengthy and transcontinental bed is about 11 million years old , according to a new study .
Previously , the river 's exact age was unknown , researchers say .
The Amazon , which starts in the Andes and flows easterly into the Atlantic Ocean , originated as a transcontinental river back in the Miocene Epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago , and took its present shape about 2.4 million years ago , according to the study by Carina Hoorn of the University of Amsterdam , Jorge Figueiredo of the University of Liverpool , England , and colleagues .
The new estimate wo n't set any age records for rivers —
Earth 's oldest rivers are hundreds of millions of years old .
In fact , while the Amazon is said by some to be Earth 's longest river , it is " quite a youngster among rivers , " Hoorn told LiveScience .
" For comparison , the New River in North America and the Nile in Africa are thought to be several hundred million years old .
The reason for this is that rivers are controlled by their source area .
Rivers are as old as the mountains in the hinterlands , one could say .
The Andes uplifted mostly in the past 12 million years and hence the formation and shifting of drainage patterns . "
The research , published in the July issue of the journal Geology , was undertaken by Petrobras , the national oil company of Brazil , in cooperation with the University of Amsterdam .
The whole history of the fluvial drainage system that eventually became the transcontinental Amazon River that we know today is older than 11 million years , Figueiredo said .
The new estimate dates only the onset of the Amazon as a transcontinental river .
A " proto - river " flowed much earlier in geologic time , but only on the eastern part of the Amazon Region , Figueiredo said .
A more ancient predecessor to the Amazon actually flowed backward at times , from east to west , according to one unpublished study .
The current study focused on samples taken from two boreholes drilled by Petrobras near the mouth of the Amazon .
One of the boreholes was 2.6 miles ( 4.2 km ) below sea level .
Until recently , the Amazon Fan , a sediment column of around 6 miles ( 10 km ) thick , was difficult to age based on the jumble of local rocks , and scientific drilling expeditions could only reach a fraction of it , Hoorn said .
The new analysis of the borehole samples allowed the researchers to reconstruct the history of the Amazon River , and provides insights into the history of the river and the fan .
This research also has implications for understandings of South American paleogeography and the evolution of aquatic organisms in Amazonia and the Atlantic coast , Hoorn said .
Sediment aprons in the proximity of major rivers often hold continuous records of terrestrial material accumulated by the river over time , she said .
These records can provide insights into the historic climate and geography of the land .
According to the Chinese government , Namibia — a southern African country with a population of 2 million — does not exist .
Government censors ordered Chinese search engines to show no search results for the country 's name this week , following a corruption scandal involving a Chinese tech company 's dealings with Namibia 's government .
The company , Nutech , was formerly run by the son of Chinese president Hu Jintao .
It is under two separate investigations by Namibian and European Union officials for allegedly using illegal methods , including bribery and unfair trade practices , to secure a USD55.3 million contract to sell cargo scanners to the Namibian government .
Though Jintao's son is not a suspect in the case , government censors have reacted swiftly to the investigation , shutting down two Chinese tech news sites and blocking a list of keywords including " Hu Haifeng , Namibia , Namibia bribery investigation , Yang Fan bribery investigation , Nuctech bribery investigation , [ and ] southern Africa bribery investigation . "
Searching for these words on Chinese search engine Baidu.com produces an error message [ ZH ] that can be translated as , " Search results may not be in line with the relevant laws and regulations and policies , not shown . "
The past two months have been busy ones for Chinese censors .
In early June the government blocked access to Twitter , Hotmail and Flickr in preparation for the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre .
Less than a week later , the news broke that the government would begin requiring all PCs sold in the country to come equipped with Internet filtering software .
And in July , Internet access was completely shut down in the capital of the Xinjiang region after ethnic riots that left nearly 200 people dead .

Beirut
I confess .
I ’m a sucker for free and fair elections .
It warms my heart to watch people drop ballots in a box to express their will , especially in a region where that so rarely happens .
So I came to Lebanon on Sunday to watch the Lebanese hold their national election .
It was indeed free and fair  not like the pretend election you are about to see in Iran , where only candidates approved by the Supreme Leader can run .
No , in Lebanon it was the real deal , and the results were fascinating : President Barack Obama defeated President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran .
O.K. , I know .
Neither man was on the ballot , but there ’s no question whose vision won here .
First , a solid majority of Lebanese Christians voted against the list of Michel Aoun , who wanted to align their community with the Shiite Hezbollah party , and tacitly Iran , because he viewed them as being best able to protect Christian interests  not the West .
The Christian majority voted instead for those who wanted to preserve Lebanon ’s sovereignty and independence from any regional power .
Second , a solid majority of all Lebanese  Muslims , Christians and Druse  voted for the March 14 coalition led by Saad Hariri , the son of the slain Lebanese prime minister , Rafik Hariri .
This U.S. - supported coalition sees Lebanon ’s future as a state independent of Syrian and Iranian influence and committed to its pluralism , modern education , a modern economy and a progressive outlook .
Saad Hariri , with 71 out of 128 seats in Parliament , is likely to be the next prime minister .
He knows that his cabinet will have to include significant elements of the Aoun faction and Hezbollah .
But to the extent that anyone came out of this election with the moral authority to lead the next government , it was the coalition that wants Lebanon to be run by and for the Lebanese  not for Iran , not for Syria and not for fighting Israel .
Last - minute leaks of part numbers hint Apple is about to release both upgraded iMacs and Mac minis on Tuesday — along with an emphasis on larger screens for iMacs and a likely NVIDIA - based design .
French site MacBidouille on Monday detailed new model numbers that appear to confirm AppleInsider 's discovery of six new Apple products in resellers ' pipelines .
Of these , four models ranging from MB417 through MB420 are described as new iMacs , but with a different system balance than today 's lineup : only the first model would have a 20 - inch screen , while the remaining four would have 24 - inch displays .
In turn , two Mac mini models , the MB463 and MB464 , would represent updated low - and high - end versions of Apple 's compact desktops .
All four would be available tomorrow and ship almost immediately , according to the claim .
Additionally , Dutch site OneMoreThing — which just earlier today provided a claimed Mac mini box shot — now also claims to have rough details of the systems ' specifications .
The iMacs would come with 2.66GHz , 2.93GHz and 3.06GHz Core 2 Duo processors , with 2GB of DDR3 memory for the base model and 4GB for the rest ; they would also support up to 8GB of RAM and carry a Mini Display Port connector .
Mac minis would have the five USB ports , FireWire 800 and Mini DisplayPort as in photos and videos from last month and would start with a 2GHz Core 2 Duo and carry either 1GB or 2GB of memory depending on the model .
Hard drives would also start at a minimum 120 GB but top out at 320GB .
While such late - breaking claims must always be treated with caution , the details support Apple 's own unintentional leaks , which showed NVIDIA - based iMacs and Mac minis that were meant for 2008 but were ultimately pushed into early 2009 .
A list of specifications based on model numbers is available below :
iMac
MB417 : " Entry - level " 20 - inch with 2.66 GHz Core 2 Duo , 2GB of RAM
MB418 : " Mid-range " 24 - inch with 2.66GHz or 2.93 GHz Core 2 Duo , 4GB of RAM
MB419 : " High - end " 24 - inch with 2.93 GHz Core 2 Duo , 4GB of RAM
MB420 : " Very high - end " 24 - inch with 3.06 GHz Core 2 Duo , 4GB of RAM

Q . Why have there been such levels of recrimination over British troop numbers in Afghanistan ?
What is the situation now ?
A . The UK deployment of around 4,000 troops to Afghanistan in 2006 took place against a background of a major commitment in Iraq , with the force there coming under increasing attack from Shia militias .
There were deep concerns among military commanders about the strains of " overstretch " and fighting a war on two fronts .
Over the three years since , the size of the force rose to the current level of 9,100 .
When the UK began withdrawing from southern Iraq , the Americans , who had been against the pullout , wanted some of the forces to be sent to Afghanistan .
The Chief of Defence Staff , Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , warned that there could not be " one for one " transfer , but the senior officers , General Sir Richard Dannatt , and his successor in waiting General Sir David Richards in particular , wanted reinforcements of between 2,000 and 2,500 to be sent to Helmand .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The main reasons for the request were that a shortage of boots on the ground meant that strategic ground won from the Taliban could not be held , allowing the enemy to slip back and regain control .
There was also the feeling that with up to 22,000 US troops going into the south of the country , including Helmand , the British had to raise their numbers to maintain credibility with the Americans .
A series of options were put before the Government .
Gordon Brown , under Treasury lobbying , picked the one involving the lowest commitment : a temporary deployment of 700 for just the period of the Afghan national elections .
After the recent controversy over that decision , a review will take place after the election in the Autumn , and it is expected that the temporary 700 would become permanent and an additional force would be sent , numbers yet to be decided .
Q. What has been the British strategy in Afghanistan following the 2006 deployment ?
A. John Reid , then Defence Secretary , will never live down saying that he hoped the mission would end " without a shot being fired in anger " .
Figures vary , but around six million rounds are thought to have been fired in the following three years .
From the start of the mission UK policy appeared to be confused and drifting .
The official mission statement was that British troops would help President Hamid Karzai bring governance to a traditionally lawless part of the country and assist in the poppy eradication process .
What happened was that British troops charged off to outlying areas and set up platoon houses in effect inviting Taliban attacks .
The operation ran counter to a plan drawn up by General ( now Sir ) David Richards , the British commander of Nato forces , which called for secure areas to be set up around the larger towns , starting with the provincial capital , Lashkar Gar , where reconstruction can begin .
Instead , large swathes of Helmand turned into battlefields , and there was virtually no development .
Helmand was responsible for 26 per cent of the national poppy production in 2006 .
This went up to 44 per cent in the ensuing three years , although there has been a drop in the latest harvest .
Q. Gordon Brown has asked for more Afghan government troops to be based in Helmand .
Why ?
And how effective will this be ?
A . It is , of course , the eventual aim of Nato that Afghans will provide their own security .
It will be a long time before they are able to .
However , the Prime Minister stated that the Afghan forces should hold ground which British forces cannot .
In saying so he effectively acknowledged that there are not enough UK forces on the ground .

At present , around 11 per cent of the 85,000 - strong Afghan army are based in Helmand , which has seen almost 50 per cent of the recent fighting in the country .
But , taken at face value , these figures can be misleading .
Much of the Afghan forces are still going through training , and what the British and the Americans have in Helmand are some of the best trained and equipped of that number .
Also , the reason that the province is now seeing such a high level of combat is because of large - scale operations carried out by US and UK forces .
The plan is to expand the total strength of Afghan forces to 134,000 , and the US want allied countries which have not made troop commitments to the mission to pick up part of the bill .
However , even the enlarged Afghan force seems unlikely to be adequately manned to meet a Taliban emergency which is drawing increasing numbers of international jihadists and is supported by elements in the Pakistani military and intelligence service .
Iraq , with a not dissimilar population , has a security force of around 600,000 .
Q. What about contributions from other Nato countries ?
A . No less than 42 countries contribute to the International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) in Afghanistan .
Troops include nationals from the United Arab Emirates and Estonia .
But many of the contingents , including those from some Nato countries , operate under caveats which impose severe restrictions on what they are allowed to do on operations – rendering them virtually ineffective in combat scenarios .
The UK and US have repeatedly demanded that other Western states should do more to pull their weight .
The worst fatality rate has been suffered by the Canadians , who have lost 126 personnel out of a force of 2,800 , compared to 185 British deaths out of 9,000 and 723 Americans from a force of 60,000 .
The deadliest attack on international forces was on a French unit in August last year ; it lost 10 soldiers in an engagement at Sarobi , 40 miles from Kabul .
Sincehas been released recently , I think it is time for me to make a short and I hope clear introduction to it .
Trying to use a new program is most of the time a painful process , moreover if you are already used to software that does most things you need , and Blender is no exception to that I can even say that at first it can even look really opaque and odd , but all that is just an illusion ( remember ?
there is no spoon ) .
So I ’ll focus on the main thing in order to get you started quickly , and once accustomed to it the rest will come at an exponential rate 😀
The first thing I think you must know is that EVERY subdivision of the screen has a window type , and can be changed by clicking its type icon .
View commands
In example : the main menu is atype , but you can change it to anything like aif you want .
Toan area , simply move the cursor on the separation line between two areas that you want to resize until it takes the shape of a , thenand move the border to the desired dimension .
To add a subdivision , do the same thing as above except that youinstead and select for instancefrom the menu .
To change the POV in the 3D viewport , be sure that the cursor is on the viewport you want to affect :
Top : numpad 7
Left : numpad 3
Front : numpad 1
Hold Ctrl while pressing one of the above keys to get the opposite POV .
Numpad 5 : toggles between orthographic and perspective views .
Numpad 0 : sets the view to the active camera .
To set the active camera from a view press Ctrl +
Alt + numpad 0 .
Data commands
To save your work , go to the File label of an UI type window and select save ( ctrl + W ) or save as ( F2 )
To Import / Export a file go to the File label of an UI type window and choose the desired function in the lower part of the menu .
Modeling commands
Now that the UI has been roughly explained , here are some vital commands that you should know .
B( Box ) : let you drag a selection rectangle over the scene objects .
A( All ) : Toggle selects all / deselects all .
X ( well ..a cross ) or delete : deletes selected objects .
S ( Scale ) : let you scale the selected object .
Press x or y or z if you want to constrain the effect on one of those axis , and shift + x or y or z if you want to exclude the selected axis .
G ( grab ) : let you translate the selected object .
Press x or y or z if you want to constrain the effect on one of those axis , and shift + x or y or z if you want to exclude the selected axis .
R( Rotate ) : let you rotate the selected object .
Press x or y or z if you want to constrain the effect on one of those axis , and shift + x or y or z if you want to exclude the selected axis .
Use the middle mouse button to move the view around the view pivot .
You can vary the effect by pressing Ctrl to Zoom , Shift to Pan .
To focus the view on the selected object and set the view pivot to its center press “ numpad .( dot ) ”
To create a new object , either press spacebar or keep the right button pressed for awhile and then select add / mesh and select the shape you want .
New object will be created at the location of the 3D cursor ( left click to set it somewhere ) .
( without moving the mouse ) : an object , holdto build a selection : sets the 3D cursor / Move an object if clicked on the tripodCurrent frame from active camera .
That is all for the very basics , it was mostly based on the interface ’s discovery than on actual “ blending ” , next time we will see how to assign a material and textures to an object .

TEN banks slipped out from under the TARP last week , striking deals with the Treasury Department to repay taxpayer money they received last fall .
Many bailout - weary investors and taxpayers welcomed this sign that government intervention in the financial sector may finally be receding .
It has been a long slog through the credit morass , and investors are understandably eager to think they are emerging onto higher ground .
Still , the bad debt that was amassed by consumers and companies in recent years has n’t been fully purged , even with the help of the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
And the debt on financial companies ’ balance sheets must do a lot more shrinking before we can move on from this ugly chapter in financial history .
To get a fix on how much work remains to be done , consider the substantial amount of short - term debt coming due at financial companies in the next year or two .
As you absorb these figures , keep in mind that many of the entities that bought this debt when it was issued are n’t around now  they ’ve either left the market or are gone , casualties of the crisis .
As a result , they ’re not around to step up and buy the debt again .

The House unveiled its plan yesterday entitled : America ’s Affordable Health Choices Act .

You can access House Committee summaries and the actual text at the House Education and Labor Committee site .
Help us read through the bill .
First impression from the summaries : it 's an excellent reform package , with lots of very worthwhile features .
But we 'll be looking through the details in the next few days .
Here 's Matt Yglesias on the new plan :
The House of Representatives is now prepared to unveil their health reform legislation with markup taking place tomorrow and Thursday .
It ’s a good bill ( more on that later ) but it ’s worth also giving a tip of the cap in the direction of the House process .
The chairs and members of the three relevant committees did a great mitzvah by putting egos aside , forming a unified “ tri-committee ” bill writing process , largely shutting up about their internal negotiations , and getting down to the job of writing a bill that fits the parameters Americans voted for in November .
So what ’s in the bill ? --
Well , there ’s a fairly strong public plan .
It needs to be financially self - supporting and nobody will be forced to accept its reimbursement rates , but it will be open to anyone with access to the Health Insurance Exchange will model its payments on Medicare and they say the default assumption will be that anyone who serves Medicare clients will also take Public Plan clients .
I 'm still going through the entire plan myself , but please , let 's welcome the Speaker to the blogosphere .

What is a beautiful sound ?
So it ’s very subjective and not really a definable characterization .
Whereas the duration of sound and it ’s relation to silence is a very objective thing .
I sing a note or I whistle a note and when I have no more air , the note goes .
Where does it go ?
Into the silence again .
And when we observe that really more clearly we see that sound has a relationship with silence not unlike the law of gravity .
In order to lift a certain object from the ground we have to use energy .
But then to sustain it at that level , we have to keep on adding energy or otherwise the object falls to the ground .
It ’s exactly the same thing with the sound .
We need a certain amount of energy to produce the sound .
But then to sustain it we have to give more energy or otherwise it goes and it dies in silence .
And therefore sound is absolutely , inextricably connected to time , the length of time .
And this , I think , what gives it or even more so when it becomes music .
It ’s really tragic element of the fact that it can die , of the fact that it is a lifetime .
Every note is a lifetime for itself .
Texas Oil and Gathering Inc. , its owner John Kessel , and its operations manager Edgar Pettijohn , plead guilty to conspiracy and violating the Safe Drinking Water Act for illegally dumping refinery wastes at an underground injection well .
“ The defendants tried to make an illegal end run around our environmental laws in order to increase their bottom line .
These guilty pleas serve as a reminder that senior company executives who decide to commit environmental crimes will be prosecuted – not just the company . ”
– Warren Amburn , Special Agent - in - Charge of EPA criminal enforcement office , Dallas
The case , heard in U.S. District Court in Houston , covers crimes that were committed from January 2000 to January 2003 at an injection well in Rosharon , Texas .
Both the owner , John Kessel , and the operations manager , Edgar Pettijohn , face up to eight years in prison and fines up to $ 500,000 .
The charges came about from the company ’s fraudulent representation of the source of the wastewater going into the injection well .
Texas
Oil stated that the water came from an oil well being developed , but the wastewater actually came from the company ’s reclamation process , which involves distilling various liquids from refineries and chemical plants .
The accepted water for class II injection wells is primarily brine with some crude oil , but the reclamation water actually injected in this case contained other chemicals , such as higher concentrations of toluene and xylen .
“ The Safe Water Drinking Act and the regulations overseeing oil and gas related injection wells are designed to ensure safe sources of drinking water .
Violations of these laws will be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . ” – John C. Cruden , Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division .
The Alvin , TX , based company faces a maximum fine of $ 500,000 for the conspiracy count and $ 50,000 per day for violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( disposing hazardous waste at an unpermitted facility ) .
The sentencing hearing is set for September 15 , 2009 .
An update on the book
So , the repository for the second edition of Practical Django Projects is not yet done , but due to the general clamor I ’m opening up public access ; you can browse it , or check out a copy of the code , from its page on Bitbucket .
You ’ll probably want to have a look over the README file displayed on that page , since it provides helpful information on how the repository works .
Right now the first three chapters ’ worth of code ( covering the first project in the book — a very simple content - management system ) are in the repository ; the rest is in the process of being added , and will likely come in spurts as I push bunches of commits from my local copy up to the public repository .
But before I push any more commits I ’d like to take a moment to explain the workflow I ’m using for this , since it ’s both mildly interesting and somewhat helpful in understanding the time involved in getting this to work properly .
The repository you see on Bitbucket right now says it was created a little less than two days ago .
And it was , but also it was n’t .
The first attempt at this repository was created last year , when I started writing the second edition of the book .
The thinking was that this would provide the eventual model for the public repository , but that during the writing process it would be useful for doing tech review .
But that fizzled out , and for a while it was n’t updated ; it ended up containing a fun mishmash of corrections and backtracking edits that did more harm to its utility than good .
So as soon as I had a copy of the printed book in my hands — my first definitive copy of the text to work from , since there were a few changes still to be made to the book ’s content even on the final proofs —
I deleted the repository and re-created it , and started going through the book , following the general plan I ’d laid out : each code listing in the book would be a changeset in the repository , and readers would be able to step through the repository one change at a time as they went through the book .
Once all the code was in , I ’d add a bunch of tags to the repository to mark things like where chapters begin and end .
And all was well for a little while until I noticed that I ’d made a mistake in one of the early changesets and pushed it into the copy of the repository on Bitbucket .
Crap .
Being a stickler and a perfectionist , I once again dropped the repository and started over , this time from just before the spot where I ’d screwed up .
And all was well for a little while until I did it again .
So on Sunday , I dropped and re-created the repository again , and started it over from scratch with a new workflow :
I have a local copy of the repository , cloned from Bitbucket .
We ’ll call this Repository A . I have another local copy of the repository , cloned from Repository A . We ’ll call this Repository B. Repository A is treated , essentially , as untouchable .
I do not edit files in that repository .
Repository B is where all the action happens ; I pick up the book , make the changes in the next code listing , test them to make sure they work , and commit .
Every so often — typically at useful break points — I pause and push from Repository B to Repository A . Having done that , I test again , then finally push from Repository A up to Bitbucket .
The advantage of this is that I ’m free to screw up as much as I need to ; if I do , I blow away the local Repository B , and re-clone from Repository A at a point before the mistake .
And if a problem does creep into Repository A , I ’m still doing another round of testing to try to catch it before it becomes public ; in that case I blow away both repositories , re-clone from Bitbucket and try again .
The disadvantage of this is that it ’s a timesink .
Taking all of the testing and repository shuffling into account , each changeset can end up representing ten minutes ’ worth of work or more ( especially if I find an error ; larger gaps between commits on the public history usually happen because of this ) .
I pushed just shy of twenty commits tonight , for example , and it shows up as three hours on the timeline , or roughly nine minutes per changeset .
Oh , and these are from the easy , beginner portion of the book .
Some of the later stuff ’s going to be really fun .
But I ’ve finally got a workflow that lets me keep a clean history in the public repository while still being able to correct mistakes , and that ’s what counts .
I do realize that certain other version - control tools would let me reach back and just edit history to suit whatever I ’d like it to be , but I ’m also quite heavily committed to Mercurial at this point ; not being able to edit history , though it requires contortions at times , is generally a good thing ( as is the overall simplicity of working with Mercurial ) .
And I do realize that I could get the same effect in Mercurial with a patch queue , but that ’s a much bigger can of worms than I ’d care to deal with right now .
Anyway , that ’s what ’s up right now .
Three chapters ’ worth of code so far , all tested against current Django trunk , with more on the way .
For those who desire it , a feed of commits to the repository is available , so you can track it in real time .
Meanwhile , I think the overall effect of this approach ends up looking rather nice .
If somebody can come up with a way to make it easier to manage , I ’d love for this to become a usual thing for technical books to publish code .

Steve Silberman sez , " An ' enterprising and creative ' 17 - year - old with Asperger syndrome convinced British aviation officials that he was launching a new airline .
Posing as a visionary global entrepreneur — his email .sig files read ' American Global Group , 35 Countries , 22 Languages , One Team ' — he used phony websites and human engineering to arrange meetings with airport directors and book a local appearance for the 300 - person US cast of ' High School Musical . '
"
Tait , who said he was in his twenties , even flew to Jersey to attend a 1 ½ - hour long meeting with the director of its airport .
Their talks were considered promising enough for a further meeting to be arranged , which was due to be held next week .
Other air industry bosses found themselves dealing by telephone or e-mail with Tait 's fellow executives , David Rich and Anita Dash , who proposed to launch a cut- price Channel Islands - based airline servicing most of Europe …
" Some of the things he said were the sort of things that were indicative that there might have been some substance to his claims , " said Coupar .
" If they were real then there would have been opportunities for us to expand our business and that 's not the sort of thing we are going to ignore . "
Tait also made approaches , with varying levels of success , to other airlines , including Titan Airways and Aer Arann .
When he made contact with Jersey airport , his patter was convincing enough to effect a 90 - minute face - to - face meeting with Julian Green , the airport 's director , who said last night : " Jersey airport can confirm it has had discussions with Adam Tait over recent weeks about an ambitious network of services between Jersey , the UK and Europe .
The Ariel Atom 3 sprints from 0 to 60 mph in under 3 seconds and can hit 100 mph in under 7 seconds .
With these numbers you would have thought that aiming higher was a moot point .
But the folks at Ariel Motor Company decided to run a special project for extreme performance , partnering with RS Developments back in 2007 .
And so the Ariel Atom 500 V8 was born .
The car uses the same signature exposed - chassis - exoskeleton sans roof and windows but throws in a monster power plant .
Ariel decided to use the Russell Savory 2.4 - liter V8 engine with 500 bhp at a whopping 10,000 rpm featuring alloy construction and a dry sump .
The engine comes supercharged outside the US and naturally aspirated domestically .
Power is delivered to the rear wheels via a 6 speed sequential Sadev gearbox with flatshift capability and paddle controls .
A manual overide along with launch and traction control will be offered .
Other notable features inlcude Dymag magnesium wheels , Alcon 4 pot caliper brakes , chromemoly aerofoil wishbones and carbon fiber weaved into the rear wing , underbody tray and wheel arches .
What began as an experiment has resulted in an actual production vehicle with a limited run .
A few lucky individuals will have an opportunity to own the 1,102 pound roadster with the highest power to weight ratio of any production car .
No pricing information has been released to date on the Ariel Atom 500 V8 .
The car is now licensed and built in the US by TMI AutoTech in Virginia and estimates put the price tag in the six figures .

Jenin � Ma�an � Israeli soldiers poured dirt , stones and toxic chemicals in the only well in the hamlet of Khirbat Makehl near the village of Ya�bad in the northern West Bank overnight on Saturday , according to Palestinians in the community .
The village�s official representative , Walid Hamdan , said soldiers riding in three military jeeps entered the community overnight and sabotaged the well .
The chemicals caused the water to change color and taste , he said .
The 80 cubic - meter well is the only source of water for the village of 70 to 80 families , Hamdan said .
He also said that , since the village lies near the Israeli settlement of Hermesh , the armed guards of the settlement often harass and assault Palestinians , particularly herders who venture near the edges of the settlement .
Israeli forces also sometimes close the road leading to the community , preventing deliveries of food .
Hamdan invited human rights organizations to visit the community to see the situation there and ultimately put pressure on Israel stop the abuses in the area .
He said the situation is " unbearable , " and some of the local families have begun moving to nearby towns and cities because of these repeated attacks .
People talk about Twitter and ROI ( return on investment ) and how there ’s no real definable way to measure success or use the tools to your best advantage .
At least , not unless you put a whole load of time into it .
While that can be true depending on your needs , there are also plenty of ways to use Twitter more effectively as well as offer measurable ROI .
Here are three of the tools I use – hopefully they ’re as useful to you as they are to me .
Topify
The way Topify works is pretty simple – it takes over your email account from Twitter .
It does n’t hack into your existing email to do so .
Instead , you set up your account at Topify and they provide you with a personal email address .
You then go into your Twitter account settings and replace your normal email address with the Topify one .
Once you ’ve amended your settings , Topify starts to send you the same alerts from Twitter that you used to get , but to the power of ten .
Now , you get to see the user ’s bio , their followers / following ratio , when they joined Twitter , their five most recent updates , their website – basically everything you ’d see on their Twitter homepage .
Topify then gives you the option of following that user by simply replying to the Topify email .
No message needed – just hit reply .
You can also send direct messages by replying with your message , or block unwanted users by forwarding that user to Topify .
By giving you all the options via one single email that it could take you several minutes to check out via Twitter itself , you can see why Topify is gaining popularity with Twitter users .
Seesmic Desktop
Up until now , the reigning champion of third - party applications to help run your Twitter account has been Tweetdeck .
Its use of columns , groups and account management has been hugely popular .
Now , its time as undisputed champ might be near an end , thanks to Seesmic Desktop .
From the same guys that gave us Twhirl , Seesmic Desktop is more than just a possible alternative to Tweetdeck – it ’s better ( to me , anyhoo ) .
Here ’s why :
Cleaner layout with fresh neutral colours as opposed to the dark Tweetdeck ( although Tweetdeck ’s colour options can be changed in the settings )
Multiple accounts , ideal for users who want separate personal and business accounts
Excellent Facebook integration
Better API usage – Tweetdeck limits how many updates you can have per hour , Seesmic seems to avoid this ( so far )
Less memory suck on your system compared to Tweetdeck
Easier navigation between columns and searches
Remembers your preferences for URL shortening services and image uploaders
There are numerous other little tweaks – suffice to say , as an alternative to Tweetdeck , Seesmic Desktop comes up trumps .
And then some .
I love it .
bit.ly
Since Twitter only allows 140 characters per message , you need to optimize your space and make sure you ’re not wasting any real estate .
To help with this , there have been a host of URL shorteners that allow you to share a website link without having to post the complete URL .
My favourite is bit.ly .
While you can use bit.ly straight from the box , the really good stuff happens when you sign up for an account .
Once you ’re logged in , you can tweet your link and message straight to Twitter .
You can then track how many times your link was clicked , who by , what ’s being said about your link and more .
There are also a host of additional tools , including support for Firefox , Gmail , email , Facebook , mobile use and much more .
A really cool feature is bit.ly ’s support for Google Documents – you can create a Google Spreadsheet template and convert your links into an Excel report .
Of all the URL shortening systems , bit.ly is definitely my favourite .
So these are three great tools – but where does the ROI come into play ?
There are a few ways :
Better time management , allowing you to interact with more people , more effectively , building the relationships that could lead to customers / clients
Keep tracks on the searches that matter most to you , your brand and your customers / clients
See who ’s discussing your links , helping you target warm leads for promotional or sales campaigns
Of course , you do n’t need to worry about ROI if it does n’t affect you .
But , if you ’re trying to convince your boss ( or client ) why they should get on Twitter from a business point of view , and need to convince them it ’s not a waste of time and does offer ROI , you could do a lot worse than the three examples here .
How about you ?
What are you using to better manage your time on Twitter and how are you measuring success ?

This story was updated to correct factual errors contained in an IDG News article that first reported the vulnerability .
If you own an iPhone , security researcher Charlie Miller can knock it off the network .
And if his hunch is right , he just might be able to do a lot more , at least until Apple fixes the flaw .
Exploiting a bug in the way iPhones parse SMS messages , the principal analyst at Independent Security Evaluators has demonstrated how to crash a part of the phone that allows him to temporarily disconnect the device from the network , he told The Register .
He 's still trying to figure out if the vulnerability will allow him to remotely execute code , a feat that would allow attackers to do much more nefarious things , including sending malicious commands to monitor the phone 's location or turn on its microphone so it becomes a remote bugging device .
" I can definitely make the thing crash , " Miller said .
" I have still to determine whether it 's actually exploitable or not .
This thing has the potential to be really serious , but I 'm still looking at it and Apple is still looking at it . "
Miller presented his findings at the SyScan conference in Singapore on Thursday and plans to offer additional details later this month at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas .
Researcher Collin Mulliner was also instrumental in discovering the bug , Miller said .
If the vulnerability turns out to be exploitable , it would be significant because there are few measures iPhone users can take to prevent an attack , said Dino Dai Zovi , a security researcher who along with Miller is the co-author of The Mac Hacker 's Handbook .
Dai Zovi has yet to see technical details behind the vulnerability , but he has already experienced its effects last week .
While the two were speaking on a land line , Miller told Dai Zovi he found a new bug in the iPhone and , as a demonstration , instructed him to look at his own Apple handset .
The display bore the words " No service . "
( The outage caused by Miller 's proof of concept was only temporary ) .
" My reaction was that this has the potential to be a very serious vulnerability and likely the worst that has affected the iPhone to date , " Dai Zovi told The Register .
" I was very surprised that he had a vulnerability that was triggerable with just an SMS message . "
Dai Zovi and several other iPhone experts we consulted said there is no way to prevent the iPhone from receiving SMS messages .
While AT&T allows users to block text messages and multimedia messages sent as emails using this site , we found no way to block all SMS messages .
An Apple representative did n't respond to our email requesting comment .

Even its author admits that a 20 - page strategy paper for government departments on how to use Twitter might be regarded as " a bit of over the top " for a microblogging tool with a limit of 140 characters a message .
Indeed , the 5,382 - word official " template " , which translates into 36,215 characters and spaces , would need roughly 259 separate tweets to put the word around Whitehall using Twitter .
But its author , Neil Williams , who describes himself as head of corporate digital channels at Lord Mandelson 's Department for Business , Innovation and Skills , admits that when he sat down to write a proper plan for his department 's corporate Twitter account , " I was surprised by just how much there was to say ‑ and quite how worth saying it is . "
Whitehall 's official use of Twitter was pioneered by Downing Street , the Foreign Office and the Communities and Local Government department .
Their low - profile experiments have grown into a regular feature of their official digital output .
Now Williams , a self - confessed web geek , has turned his template into an official Whitehall Twitter guide and posted it on the Cabinet Office 's digital engagement blog .
He suggests that nothing too onerous is involved .
Each department 's " digital media team " should only need to spend less than an hour a day running their Twitter streams .
A quick discussion of potential tweets at the morning press cuttings meetings should be followed by emails to minister 's private offices to gather more material , and any incoming messages should be replied to .
However , the idea of official government use of a tool that provides a confidential and confessional glimpse into somebody 's personal life and views appears at first sight to be something of an oxymoron .
The official guide seems to acknowledge this when it recommends that exclusive content such as " insights from ministers " and " updates on their movements " in a light or humanised style will be needed for the Twitter stream beyond the " business as usual " content of daily press releases and announcements .
It also concedes there is a problem with one of the basic Twitter features , the ability to " follow " any other users .
It admits that if government departments start following individual users on Twitter uninvited , this may well be interpreted as " interfering ' Big Brother ' - like behaviour " .
However , once anyone does follow a Whitehall Twitter stream it recommends they should automatically be " followed back " on the grounds that it is not only good etiquette , but could result in a poor Twitter reputation if not done ‑ and in extreme cases could lead to the account being suspended .
In urging his fellow Whitehall civil servants to use Twitter , Williams sets out several grounds rules for the kind of content that needs to make it work :
• Human :
He warns that Twitter users can be hostile to the " over-use of automation " - such as RSS feeds – and to the regurgitation of press release headlines : " While corporate in message , the tone of our Twitter channel must therefore be informal spoken English , human - edited and for the most part written / paraphrased for the channel . "
• Frequent : a minimum of two and maximum of 10 tweets per working day , with a minimum gap of 30 minutes between tweets to avoid flooding followers '
Twitter streams .
( Not counting @replies or live coverage of a crisis / event . )
Downing Street spends 20 minutes on its
Twitter stream with two - three tweets a day plus a few replies , five - six tweets a day in total .
• Timely : in keeping with the " zeitgeist " feel of Twitter , official tweets should be about issues of relevance today or events coming soon .
• Credible : while tweets may occasionally be " fun " , their relationship to departmental objectives must be defensible .
Alongside the promised tweetable content of minsters ' thoughts and reflections following key meetings and events is something rather more sinister sounding called " thought leadership " .
Also known as " linked blogging " , the idea is that by highlighting relevant research , events , awards and other action elsewhere on the web , the department 's Twitter feed gets a reputation as a reliable filter of high quality content .
It even holds out the promise of " crisis content " in which the Twitter feed becomes a primary channel alongside the official website for up to the minute guidance and advice in the event of a major incident .
Perhaps the biggest stumbling block is that in true Whitehall tradition everything that goes out has to be approved and cleared first .
So news releases are to be cleared for use only if they have first been paraphrased for Twitter .
All other tweets have to be cleared by staff at information officer grade in the digital media team and colleagues in ministers ' private offices and communications units have to be consulted as well .
The guidelines recommend that " light - touch controls " will also be needed to prevent " inappropriate content " being published in error such as embargoed news releases , information about the location of ministers that could put their security at risk , or other commercially or politically sensitive content .
Steps are also to be taken to avoid hacking or vandalism of content .
But it is perhaps the " tone of voice " that is most troubling about the idea of Whitehall twitter stream .
" Though the account will be anonymous ( ie , no named officials will be running it ) it is helpful to define a hypothetical ' voice ' so that tweets from multiple sources are presented in a consistent tone ( including consistent use of pronouns ) , " recommends the official template .
" The department 's Twitter voice will be that of the digital media team , positioning the channel as an extension of the main department website ‑ effectively an ' outpost ' where new digital content is signposted throughout the day .
This will be implicit , unless directly asked about by our followers , " it advises .
Williams , the author of this template , launched the first ever blog by a British cabinet minister .
He admits he once ran a comedy website called idiotica.co.uk but the Cabinet Office confirm that his Twitter guidelines are genuine .
Health Care Reform for Beginners : The Many Flavors of the Public Plan
For most of you , this is the big one .
The inclusion of a strong public insurance option has become , for most observers I know , the single most recognizable marker for victory .
If the public plan exists , liberals have won .
If it 's eliminated , or neutered , then conservatives have triumphed .
The public plan has a very particular political lineage :
The lesson liberals took from the 1994 health reform fight was that you could n't threaten the insurance coverage individuals already had .
For many policy wonks , the central problem in health care was the existence of private insurance coverage .
For most Americans , however , the central problem was that they could lose their private insurance coverage , and be left with something they did n't like , or nothing at all .
This effectively ruled out something like single - payer , or even Bill Clinton 's managed - care - within - managed - competition model .
It ruled out anything that began by changing the health care coverage of those who wanted to keep their current policies .
But that political insight did n't cancel out the policy insight :
The private insurance market is a mess .
It 's supposed to cover the sick and instead competes to insure the well .
It employs platoons of adjusters whose sole job is to get out of paying for needed health care services that members thought were covered .
Moreover , public insurance is simply more efficient .
Medicare holds costs down better than private health insurance .
The substantially public systems employed by every other industrialized nation cost less and cover more than the American model .
So the question became how to marry the policy need for public insurance with the political need to preserve the status quo .
Enter the public insurance option .
It does n't replace the insurance individuals already rely on .
But it provides an alternative .
It lets them make the decision .
It 's the health care equivalent of being pro-choice .
And it thus serves two purposes .
The first is to act as a public insurer .
To use market share to bargain down the prices of services , much as Medicare does .
To lower administrative costs .
To operate outside the need for profit , and quarterly results .
The Commonwealth Fund estimated that this would result in savings of 20% - 30 % over traditional private insurance :
The second is to apply competitive pressure to the rest of the insurance industry .
If the public plan is ruthlessly lowering its administrative costs and garnering a reputation for decent , good - faith service , it will take market share from the private insurers .
The private insurers will have to respond in kind to retain their customers .
If they fail to adapt , the system could become something resembling a single - payer structure .
But that 's not the most likely outcome .
Rather , the theory here is simple :
If you can't replace them , convert them .
If the public plan works , then private insurance will work better as well .
In this telling , the simple existence of the public plan forces a more honest insurance market : Private insurers need to offer premiums closer to their marginal cost , and they have to cut administrative costs , and they have to work on their reputation for cruelty and capriciousness .
The existence of another option changes the market .
Individuals will have access to private insurers , but they 'll no longer be stuck with them .
Private insurers , of course , do n't want to face that kind of competition .
And they have enlisted many members of Congress to help protect them from the public insurer .
In recent weeks , however , the Obama administration has put some muscle into the preservation of the public option .
Most observers now think that some form of public plan will survive in the final bill .
The question is what form of private plan ?
There are three options :
• The " Trigger " Plan : Olympia Snowe is pushing this compromise , as are some conservative Democrats .
The basic idea is that the public plan would act as an invisible threat :
It would be " triggered " into existence if the private insurance market was unable to offer , say , enough options in a particular region , or enough cost control .
In addition , the public plan would only come into existence in this or that region , or this or that state .
It would be effectively useless as an insurer .
It could potentially have some competitive effect in that private insurers would still work to avoid its existence .
Some have argued , however , that the conditions being mentioned in the " trigger " proposals have already been met .
• The Weak Public Plan :
This is what people are talking about when they refer to a " level - playing field . "
This incarnation of the public plan -- first proposed by Len Nichols at the New America Foundation and later echoed by Peter Harbage and Karen Davenport at the Center for American Progress -- would have no special advantages over private insurers .
It could n't use the low rates that Medicare sets or access taxpayer subsidies .
It could n't force its way into networks .
It would simply be another insurer , albeit with different incentives than traditional insurers .
• The Strong Public Plan :
This would be like Medicare for the rest of us .
It could throw the federal government 's weight around .
It could negotiate deep discounts with providers .
It could muscle its way into networks .
Outside groups like the Commonwealth Fund estimate that it would save the average consumer 20 percent to 30 percent .
That would give it a massive competitive advantage over private insurers , and would probably result in tens of millions of Americans dropping their current coverage and entering the public plan to save money .
A variant of this was in the draft of Ted Kennedy 's bill that was leaked last week .
As someone who thinks cost control and efficiency are important in health reform , I 'm most interested in the strong public plan .
Folks who are more interested in preserving something that looks like the current private insurance market tend to fall behind the trigger public plan , largely under the theory that it would be pretty much the same as no public plan at all .

I ragazzini e gli emuli di Peter Pan spesso ben conoscono la favola di Pinocchio e poco amano le fate madrine ed i grili parlanti .
Così pare .
Tra di loro però , sanno anche essere sinceri , fin troppo , fino all ’inverosimile .
E quando c’è qualcosa a proteggerli dal giro perverso del pettegolezzo tra i banchi di scuola non c’è segreto , fantasia , dubbio , domanda imbarazzante che li trattenga dallo stare in silenzio .
Anche in pubblico , in rete , in particolare …su Yahoo Answers .
Al suo quinto anniversario di successo nel nostro
Paese , è una delle community più popolate del web .
E’ qui soprattutto che pensieri e confessioni viaggiano liberamente camuffati da domande e risposte .
E spesso fanno anche riflettere .
Abbiamo scelto un paio di topic quasi a caso : il prelievo di sangue e di urina , quello di routine , momento topico nella vita di molti adolescenti , e , naturalmente , il sesso ossessione più o meno costante per molti di più .

“ Guarda che oggi giorno dalle analisi si vede tutto… più che medici infatti li definirei chiromanti… l’ultima volta mi hanno anche detto come si chiamava il pesciolino rosso che avevo nell ’infanzia morto suicida circa 15 anni fa… Quindi per sicurezza non masturbarti nei 3 giorni antecedenti le analisi…e soprattutto non dire parolacce …. lo scoprirebbero ….!!!“ .
E se c’è qualcuno che arriva a chiedere se le analisi di routine possano svelare “ quando ognuno accarezza la sua solitudine ” è perché la Nannini non si è sgolata abbastanza nel cantare la sua America o perché noialtri non le abbiamo fatto il coro .
Il piacere è ancora un tabù , anche se “ fare sesso e’ naturale e fa bene ad ogni eta ’ non c’e ’ niente d’immorale e’ beato chi lo fa “ .
La magia e le emozioni dell ’ innamoramento , della condivisione , della scoperta non sono ancora universalmente riconosciute come qualcosa di naturale .
Non se ne può parlare con troppa leggerezza , certo , ma nemmeno con terrore .
Soprattutto non si dovrebbe averne vergogna , in famiglia .
Ma ancora succede .
Non si spiega altrimenti perché tante ragazzine abbiano timore che il fatidico giorno delle analisi di routine possa segnare la fine della clandestinità dei modi amorosi della propria relazione , che essa sia o no più o meno nascosta .
E non solo su yahoo .
In un forum tra tanti una ragazza si chiede se nelle urine possa raccogliersi in qualche strano modo qualche traccia di sperma .
Forse pensa ad un qualche spermatozoo di quelli “ appiccicosi “ , che non muoiono mai , di quelli che la nonna di qualcuna raccontava facessero casina persino sugli accappatoi e sugli asciugamani dei maschi , tanto che le era vietato assolutamente prenderne uno , anche per errore , pena l’urgenza di portarla dal medico .
BAURA BAURA BAURA .
A VOLTE GIUSTIFICATA – Nella community di yahoo anwers c’è poi un dubbio ricorrente .
Le giovani donne hanno paura che l’esame del sangue possa svelare ai genitori che fanno uso della pillola anticoncezionale .
Tranquille fanciulle , se non sono tanto fetenti da chiedere al vostro medico di richiedervi controlli specifici in tal senso potete stare serene .
E lasciatevi pure prendere dalla passione la sera prima – No , non si vede nulla … .
“ se faccio sesso con il mio raga e poi il gg dopo devo fare prelievo e analisi delle urine … può essere visto ?
Può portare delle alterazioni dei risultati ? “ .
A quelli di voi che vivono , senza farsi tutte queste menate , tutti gli amori che possono , fregandosene dei giudizi e dei pregiudizi della gente , vien forse spontanea questa domanda .
Ma perché tutti questi segreti ?
Ce lo spiega – almeno ci prova a nome di tutti gli altri , questa ragazza “ purtroppo non tutti hanno la fortuna di avere un buon rapporto con i genitori .
E il rapporto con mia madre è del tutto inesistente .
Di conseguenza sono costretta a mentire ….
non ho paura di niente , lo faccio per evitare problemi .
I miei genitori sono di quei religiosi incalliti che ti impongono il sesso dopo il matrimonio .
E cosa più grave non accetterebbero mai la mia relazione con questo uomo .
Infatti tengo segreta anche la mia relazione oltre la pillola .
Anche se ho 20 anni e sono maggiorenne , vivo comunque sotto il loro tetto , e sarebbe frustante avere ogni giorno discussioni “ .
Questa tipa , quantomeno , sa di avere una relazione e può delegare giustamente la propria incapacità di vivere senza serenità la propria relazione amorosa .
Ma , insomma , almeno sa che significa .
DUBBI ANCESTRALI – C’è chi , invece , ingenuamente o provocatoriamente non si sa , sembra non avere le idee chiare su argomenti del genere .
Chiede : ” Dubbio da ignorante … come si capisce se si ha veramente fatto l’amore o il sesso ? “ .
Ma c’è di peggio : “ E come si comprende se qualcuno è un incallito o sporadico fumatore oppure no ?
Bastano le analisi ?
– sono in tanti , davvero in tanti , a fare questa domanda – … Ma se fumo sigarette posso fare le analisi del sangue stando tranqy ? “ .
Drogati di sigarette , di cannabis , spaventati dall ’esito perché si viziano di nascosto dalla famiglia o perché , strano ma vero , dall ’esito del prelievo temono possa dipendere la loro eventuale assunzione in un luogo di lavoro , hanno terrore che la nicotina , il Thc e quant ’altro , possa essere svelato nel fatidico giorno dell ’appuntamento con l’infermiera nell ’ambulatorio .
Alle domande in tal senso qualcuno risponde che non è possibile , in quanto solo esami specifici possono rintracciarne i metaboliti , ma tanti son convinti del contrario e raccomandano , quasi in coro : Bevi latte , bevi tanto latte !
“ Disintossica “ .
PERICOLI – Lo dicono anche a chi , ahimé , fa uso di qualcosa di davvero pesante .
“ Salve il 18 devo fare a lavoro le analisi del sangue e dell ’ urina la mia domanda e’ si vede l’uso di cocaina ? “ .
Qualcuno però sbotta e risponde : “ Spero di sì , e spero anche che tu e tutti gli altri criminali come te finiate in galera “ .
Le risposte più simpatiche vanno di pari passo con le domande .
Niente è scontato .
Niente è impossibile da chiedere su yahoo anwers .
Vi siete mai posti questa questione voi ?
“ Ma quando mi faccio le analisi del sangue , dopo che fine fa il mio sangue ? ” dubbiosa si chiede ggr .
“ Lo bevono alla tua salute “ , gli risponde pulce .
Capita poi di capire che la psicologia debba ancora confrontarsi con nuovi quesiti , tipo questi : “ Esiste un complesso di Edipo provato dal figlio maschio verso il padre e non il genitore di sesso opposto ? ” ….. “ Se un cattolico / a non riesce a trovare una moglie / marito non può fare sesso per tutta la vita ? …..
“ Il cattolicesimo dice che il sesso va fatto solo all ’interno del matrimonio , quindi chi non si sposa mai non potrà mai fare sesso ? “ .
That is the question .
E chissà quale sarà la risposta giusta .

Tel Aviv police “ invented ” a machine proving to a suspect that , contrary to his claims , he remembered all that happened the night of the murder .
The Tel Aviv Police Department “ invented ” a new machine that seemed likely to change the face of criminal interrogations – but it will apparently not be used more than once .
The contraption was called a “ memory machine , ” and was used to persuade a murder suspect that , contrary to his impassioned and repeated claims , he in fact did remember what happened the night of the murder .
Maariv / NRG reports that the story began two weeks ago , when the body of Andrei Shalhov was found outside his home in the central Israel city of Yahud .
His neighbor Andrei Polokhin , 47 , was arrested , after it was learned that the two had gotten into a fight , which ended with the stabbing death of Shalhov .
The investigation was entrusted to the Dan Region Police , headed by Superintendent Itzik Kumriel .
Polokhin refused to cooperate , claiming he was drunk at the time and does n’t remember a thing .
One of the detectives then had an idea .
He rushed to nearby Tel HaShomer Hospital and requisitioned an ECG machine used to check cardiac activity , together with the printout of the annual ECG exam performed on one of the detectives the day before .
The detective then summoned Polokhin for a “ memory test . ”
The suspect did not object , and the detective attached several electrodes to his head and chest , other wires to a laptop computer , and began asking questions .
Polokhin continued to maintain that he did not remember , and finally , at the end of the “ exam , ” the detective told him , “ You ’re lying !
The exam shows that the memory in your head is full and that you do remember ! ”
He showed him the printout as proof – and the suspect , faced with the “ evidence , ” could do nothing but confess that he did , in fact , remember everything and that he killed his neighbor .
Polokhin then reviewed the events of that night in detail , and later reenacted the killing itself .
The police later explained to him that in actuality there was no such thing as a “ memory machine ” – though they did have to include the ECG printout as part of the “ investigation material ” in the file they submitted to the court .

The development of iPhone applications has recently become a hot topic in the design community ; everybody tries to come up with some creative idea , port it into a stylish iPhone - alike application and sell it to thousands of users through the iPhone app store .
However , many of these applications are poorly designed and therefore miss the chance of providing users with a truly useful product that users would find worth recommending to friends and colleagues .
We want to take a closer look at the design of iPhone applications and showcase some good and bad examples , best practices as well as useful ideas and recommendations for your next iPhone app design .
This article is a first post of a new series related to the design of iPhone applications .
Please let us know if you are interested in the follow - ups to this article in the poll and in the comments below .
How should it look like ?
What should we improve ?
Please also feel free to suggest more iPhone app design mistakes in the comments to this post !

Are iPhone apps really not good enough ?
“ It ’s only 99 cents .
Who cares if it sucks ?
I ’m still trying it . ”
How many times have you said something like that to yourself before downloading the next promising iPhone app ?
How many screen - fulls of those apps do you have on your iPhone ?
4 ? 6 ? 10 ?
And how many of them do you actually use ?
On average , only 3 % of people who have downloaded an app use it after 30 days .
Why ?
Because the majority of iPhone apps do n’t make any sense to users .
The situation is similar to that of PC software a couple of decades ago .
Have we not learned from our mistakes ?
i Phone applications nowadays are designed by developers who seem to care only about their app ’s implementation .
When an app goes live , its beautiful code or visual design often fail to address real customers ’ needs .
The result : thousands of useless applications in the App Store that people download and use once and then never again .
These applications often do n’t make sense to customers because of a poor interaction design .
Free applications usage over time : Percentage of users returning versus number of days since first used .
On second day , 20 % returning users ; on the 30th day , only 3 % .

It ’s not really different from the graph above .
Paid applications generally retain their users longer than free applications , although the drop - off is still pretty steep .

It should n’t be this way .
Developers should be writing applications that people love so much that they would pay $ 9.99 or even $ 99.99 for each of them .
There ’s no programming technique that teaches you how to do this .
But there is something else , and it ’s called interactive design .
Five Most Frequent iPhone Design Mistakes
Many applications share the same design problems that prevent customers from fully enjoying them .
Recently , I conducted a review of 100 apps from the App Store and identified the five most frequent iPhone design and usability mistakes , which are :
Over - blown visuals .
Neglecting technological limitations , such as slow Internet connection , slow processors and single - threaded OS architectures .
Confusing navigation ( flow , layout and taxonomy ) .
Confusing the iPhone with a computer .
Neglecting to use new iPhone interactions ( fingers instead of the mouse ; multi - touch gestures ; turn , tilt and rotate ) and technological features such as phone functions , built - in GPS and accelerometer .
Disregard of context .
A lack of understanding of how , when , where and why the mobile device is being used .
Let ’s start with the first one in this article and proceed with the next ones in the follow - ups to this article .
Mistake # 1 . Over -Blown Visuals
Probably the oldest , yet extremely popular design problem is overdesign .
Designers of iPhone applications often tend to disregard common design and usability conventions by offering users slick and shiny user interface designs that go way beyond their standard look and also way beyond their claimed functionality .
Why make things look , feel and work complicated and why do designers like to re-invent the wheel ?
The answer is simple : they want the application to be different ; look different and stand out from the crowd .
Unfortunately , a different look is n’t necessarily helpful for application ’s usability and functionality .
So how does an over - design in iPhone applications look like ?
To better understand it , let ’s look at an example :
Motion X GPS settings .
What do you think is wrong with the design in this first screenshot ?
Some of you may say , “ Well , nothing is really wrong with it .
It ’s beautiful . ”
I agree , it ’s pretty slick .
But , there ’s a catch : while beautiful , it is also inconsistent with other apps .
It ’s different .
Let ’s compare this screen to the settings screens of other iPhone applications :
Motion X GPS settings screen , compared to the settings screens of other apps .
( Click to enlarge . )
Noticed the difference ?
Being inconsistent with other products makes yours worse for two reasons :
Going against convention makes your application less intuitive .
Over - styled controls look different and require users to re-learn how they work .
It ’s a waste of time and money .
The resources you have spent to make your app look different , but not necessarily better , could have been used much more effectively .
Breaking Convention Makes Your App Less Intuitive
The more familiar the parts of your app are , the more intuitive the app will be for whoever uses it .
If we recognize the parts , we will be able to learn how to use the whole faster .
It ’s like reading : knowing the alphabet and meanings of words allows us to “ decode ” books we have n’t seen before .
Here ’s an example from the real world .
Try to make the stop sign more “ beautiful ” and people will inevitably start dying :
“ Sign B , 2 , ‘ STOP , ’ shall be used to notify drivers that , at the intersection where the sign is placed , they shall stop before entering the intersection and give way to vehicles on the road they are approaching . ”
Article 10 of 2006 road signs convention .
In his paper Intuitive Equals Familiar ( Communications of the ACM .
37:9 , September 1994 , page 17 ) , Jeff Raskin , an American human - computer interface expert best known for starting the Macintosh project for Apple Computer in the late 1970s , writes :
“ The impression that the phrase ‘ this interface feature is intuitive ’ leaves is that the interface works the way the user does , that normal human ‘ intuition ’ suffices to use it , that neither training nor rational thought is necessary , and that it will feel ‘ natural . ’ ”
However ,
“… it is clear that a user interface feature is ‘ intuitive ’ insofar as it resembles or is identical to something the user has already learned .
In short , “ intuitive ” in this context is an almost exact synonym of ‘ familiar . ’ ”
Drastically re-designing every user interface element will make your application less intuitive , which will lead to more user mistakes and a longer learning curve .
Eventually , you will lose customers because of it .
What About Branding ?
Is there place for branding in applications that are strictly following general design guidelines and usability conventions ?
Definitely !
It is possible to strike a balance between having a unique look but not over - designing .
Here ’s one example :
Let ’s take a look at an example of overdesigning by Bloomberg .
Here , we have an over - designed text input field at the top .
You can barely recognize this as a field when you first look at it .
The version on the right hand side is much better .
A standard input field makes the screen ’s purpose much clearer , while remaining consistent with the application ’s style and branding .
Larger version .
Here is another example by iFitness .
Users are supposed to enter their weight day by day on this screen .
But you have to flip through the months and days with a horizontal swipe to find the right one , and then you have to enter your weight digit by digit using five separate scroll fields .
And then you have to press the very modest “ Record ” button , which you miss at first anyway and only find the hard way : after you have lost data .
Much better :
Larger version .
99.9 % of users will want to enter today ’s weight .
This redesigned interface has one - quarter of the controls .
The screen space that has been saved can now be used to present useful information , such as weight statistics .
Date and time can be recorded automatically , and the selection of the metric or imperial system of measurement , which is not terribly important , has been demoted to a settings screen .
The Yellow Pages app uses tabs , which work well on the Web , but standard toggle controls are more familiar to iPhone users .
Larger version .
Waste of Time and Money
Apple has already done an excellent job of creating standardized controls .
Losing some of that functionality is almost guaranteed if you try to reinvent the wheel .
Back to our earlier example :
If we take a closer look , we ’ll see that one - third of the screen space we would have had is now lost because of over - designing .
i Phone OS 3.0 introduced accessibility features .
One of the modes is White on Black .
Here ’s what happens to our controls after inverting colors :
In the original control , color , shape and text survived color inversion .
However in re-designed one , 2 ⁄ 3 of original meaning is lost .
Now there is only text .
In sum , this redesign has given us twice as many UI elements , taking up twice as much real estate .
The catch is , even if you have n’t made the controls worse , you still have n’t added much value and you have lost time and money in the process .
That Time and Money Could Have Been Spent On …
Design is all about solving problems .
Sometimes , when people do n’t know exactly what problem they are solving , they wander in the design process , and the result is over - designed .
To avoid that , you must have a clear picture of the problem you need to solve .
One of the best ways to get that picture is to talk to your users ( both current and potential ) .
Only when you know your customers ’ needs will you be able to build an application they ’ll love .
Do n’t overdesign .
Be sure your house has a solid foundation before you decorate it .
You will be rewarded with more loyal customers and higher download rates surprisingly quickly .

Yet the fight against cancer is going slower than most had hoped , with only small changes in the death rate in the almost 40 years since it began .
One major impediment , scientists agree , is the grant system itself .
It has become a sort of jobs program , a way to keep research laboratories going year after year with the understanding that the focus will be on small projects unlikely to take significant steps toward curing cancer .
The institute ’s reviewers choose such projects because , with too little money to finance most proposals , they are timid about taking chances on ones that might not succeed .
The problem , Dr. Young and others say , is that projects that could make a major difference in cancer prevention and treatment are all too often crowded out because they are too uncertain .
In fact , it has become lore among cancer researchers that some game - changing discoveries involved projects deemed too unlikely to succeed and were therefore denied federal grants , forcing researchers to struggle mightily to continue .
“ You ca n’t prove it will work in advance , ” he said .
“ If you could , it would n’t be a high - risk idea . ”
For 25 years , Eileen K. Jaffe received federal grants to run her lab .
As a senior scientist at the Fox Chase Cancer Center , with a long list of published papers in prestigious journals , she is a respected , established researcher .
Then Dr. Jaffe stumbled upon results that went against textbook explanations , suggesting that it might be possible to find an entirely new class of drugs that could disable proteins that fuel cancer cells .
Now she wants to find chemicals that might be developed into such drugs .
But her grant proposal was rejected out of hand by the institutes of health , not even discussed by a review panel .
She had no preliminary data showing that the idea was likely to work , something reviewers always want to see , and the idea was just too unprecedented .
Dr. Jaffe epitomizes the scientist who realizes that if she were to single - mindedly pursue her unorthodox idea , her “ career may be ruined in the process , ” in the words of Dr. Brawley of the American Cancer Society .
Dr. Jaffe is just conceiving her project ; it is much to soon to know whether it will result in a revolutionary drug .
And even if she does find potential new drugs , it is not clear that they will be effective .
Most new ideas are difficult to prove , and most potential new drugs fail .
The biomedical community has become too risk - averse , according to a recent NY Times piece .
I agree , although I do n't agree with the dramatic presentation ( it 's not some dirty scientific secret - it's not hard to find scientists , and the leaders of the funding agencies themselves talking about it ) .
Here are the basic issue : Before we go on , we need to first note that claims about lack of progress have been overblown .
Cancer survival rates , for most cancers , are much better now than they were 30 years ago .
But the funding system is conservative .
Why ?
Frankly , it 's a perverse result of competition .
The biomedical community has undergone a tremendous expansion , and even though funding has increased substantially over the last 30 years , the number of scientists entering the field has grown even more .
It works like this : let 's say that 15 % of the applications for a given grant review section are excellent , but only 7 % can be funded with the available money - then it 's basically a crapshoot , and any reason why your proposal wo n't work is enough to tank your grant .
Thus , risky projects , that is , ones that offer a potentially high payoff , but their chances of success are harder to gauge ( because these projects explore an area where our existing knowledge is shaky ) , are very likely to be trashed by the reviewers .
Projects that make incremental progress are , obviously , much less likely to have more certain prospects of success , because they stick close to what we already know .
A project that has the potential for a major breakthrough is going to be much more uncertain , because it 's a bigger leap away from certain knowledge .
If uncertainties are viewed as weaknesses in a proposal , then risky projects do n't get funded .
And keep in mind that generally , there are few projects that have breakthrough potential and very clearly have a high probability of success .
Making breakthroughs is n't easy .
This is the conclusion the Times ' piece reaches :
As once scientist notes in the piece , The Times ' story relates a typical example : Having preliminary data is huge .
You must have accomplished a good deal of the project by the time you submit the proposal ; this is generally done by siphoning off money from other projects .
This system also puts younger , new investigators at a disadvantage - they 're still getting their labs staffed and running , and thus are n't able to generate the amounts of preliminary data their senior competitors generate .
There is another problem here : when your faculty job , and the existence of your lab , depends on the success of your grant proposal , you 're less likely to propose a risky grant .
As a result , there is too much conservative science .
This problem is understood in business : the whole point of a limited liability company is to allow entrepreneurs to take reasonable business risks and pursue potentially good ideas , without being personally ruined if the business plan fails to work out .
This is where private foundations , which do n't have the same legally - mandated beaureaucratic structure as the NIH ( the NIH reports to Congress , and Congress ' oversight has a big influence on the way things are done ) .
They could fill an important role by funding more risky projects .
On the other hand , private foundations simply have n't matched the resources of the NIH in funding basic cancer research done in academic labs : since 1971 , the National Cancer Institute has funded $ 106 billion in research , while the American Cancer Society ( which funds my research ) , has put out $ 3.4 billion since 1946 .
Just to keep things in perspective : nobody is arguing that what the NIH has done has been a waste .
The incremental progress over the years has added up , and cancer survival rates now are much better than they were 10 , 20 , and 30 years ago .
But we need our scientific community to stay fresh , we need to nurture innovations , and that involves working some sort of cultural change .
We need to figure out how to avoid mediocrity , which is difficult in a rapidly growing community .
An afterthought for you history buffs out there ( and in honor of Lincoln 's 200th birthday ) :
People frequently misunderstand that taking risks in science is a good thing .
It 's not about risking someone life , or world destruction ( no one 's arguing that we should do riskier biological weapons research ) .
It 's about be willing to handle uncertainty and make big moves .
If the role of risk is n't clear in science , it should be in war : willingness to take calculated risks is why Grant won the US Civil War , and why McClellan was booted out of his command .
Hot on the heels of a Financial Times report that a discounted iPhone would be available in Apple Stores this Monday comes a report from Gearlive that the upcoming iPhone Video ( if that ’s what it ’s called ) will be available for purchase as early as this Monday .
According to the report , the iPhone Video will be available in 8GB , 16GB , and 32 GB configurations .
Interestingly , Gearlive writes that while a 4GB model is in the works , it wont yet be ready for sale on Monday , which contradicts the earlier report from the Financial Times .
My understanding is that availability will be limited , because the plan was to launch in July .
This means that Apple does n’t have all the phones available now that they would have had in July for a launch – but you can expect regular replenishments of product .
Is Apple pushing up the release date to steal away some of the Palm Pre ’s thunder ?
Or are Gearlive ’s sources completely bogus ?
I ’m leaning towards the latter , but would love to be proven wrong .
A term used to describe a sexual position , or situation .
Often used during an orgy .
This particular " maneuver " is implemented when one woman takes on a minimum of either 3 , or a maximum of 5 penis ' at a time .
A penis in her vagina , one in her left and right hands , one in the anus and one in the mouth .
With all of this action going on , she will look like a wounded seagull struggling for her life .
This should have been the lead :
The long - awaited research on the effects of calorie restriction on aging in rhesus monkeys from the University of Wisconsin and Wisconsin National Primate Research Center have just been released .
It found no statistically significant difference in the number of deaths among the monkeys who ’ve been eating a calorie - restrictive diet for more than 20 years compared to the monkeys who ’ve been allowed to eat ad lib all day as much as 20 % over their normal calories .

To determine if the verdict in the Pirate Bay case was biased , the connections of Judge Tomas Norström to national and international pro-copyright lobby groups will be reviewed by another judge .
However , the judge that was initially appointed has already been replaced because she was linked to the same organizations as Norström , and her replacement is not exactly unbiased either .
Pirate Bay judge Tomas Norström ’s objectivity has been called into doubt because of his ties to national and international pro-copyright lobby groups .
Furthermore , one of the defense lawyers claimed to have evidence that Norström was handpicked and not assigned to the case randomly .
To investigate these accusations of bias , the appeal court appointed a judge , Ulrika Ihrfelt .
Her task is to decide whether or not Norström ’s verdict could have been biased since this issue must be resolved before they will look into the appeal request .
If it ’s determined that Norström was indeed biased , the case will be resubmitted to the district court for retrial , meaning that an appeal is not needed at this stage .
However , soon after the appointment of Ulrika Ihrfelt , it became known that she too had been a member of the same pro-copyright organizations as the ‘ biased ’ judge .
The appointment was criticized by several judicial analysts who said she was n’t fit either .
Judicial praxis dictates that the court must not only be unbiased , but also be BELIEVED to be unbiased , which is clearly not the case here .
As a consequence and in order to avoid more negative press , the appeal court sent out a press release today in which they announce that Ihrfelt has been taken off the case .
She has been replaced by three new judges from a separate division of the court .
In the press release , the appeal court writes : “ The reasons for this is that the question of whether the original judge was biased needs to be tried by other judges other than those that later may have been given the case .
Furthermore , because of the content of the claim of bias , it has been deemed proper that the question should be answered by a division that is not specialized in copyright . ”
“ None of the three judges are or have been members of the [ pro- copyright ] organizations in question , ” the appeal court announced .
But is this really the case ?
With a simple Google search Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde has already discovered that one of the replacements , Anders Eka , is connected to the The Stockholm Center for Commercial law , together with movie industry lawyers Monique Wasted and Peter Danowsky who represented the music industry in the Pirate Bay trial .
Nevertheless , the appeal court does not intent to replace the new judge(s ) .
“ The group Anders Eka is member of has no connection to copyright issues and the interests that are present in the case .
I cannot see how this specific connection could lead to that Anders Eka is n’t suitable to try the question of bias , ” Fredrik Wersäll , the president of the appeal court said .
The court will not look at the appeal case before the question of Norström ’s bias is settled .
The bias issue will be given priority and should be settled “ in a few weeks at the maximum ” , according to the appeal court president .
With all the commotion and judicial incompetence displayed after the Pirate Bay trial it seems almost unthinkable that a retrial wo n’t be granted .
It is therefore no surprise that the entertainment industries try to get some cash off the defendants before it ’s too late .
Tampa , FL ( July 1 , 2009 ) —
A human growth factor that stimulates blood stem cells to proliferate in the bone marrow reverses memory impairment in mice genetically altered to develop Alzheimer ’s disease , researchers at the University of South Florida and James A. Haley Hospital found .
The granulocyte - colony stimulating factor ( GCSF ) significantly reduced levels of the brain - clogging protein beta amyloid deposited in excess in the brains of the Alzheimer ’s mice , increased the production of new neurons and promoted nerve cell connections .
The findings are reported online in Neuroscience and are scheduled to appear in the journal ’s print edition in August .
GCSF is a blood stem cell growth factor or hormone routinely administered to cancer patients whose blood stem cells and white blood cells have been depleted following chemotherapy or radiation .
GCSF stimulates the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells needed to fight infection .
It is also used to boost the numbers of stem cells circulating in the blood of donors before the cells are harvested for bone marrow transplants .
Advanced clinical trials are now investigating the effectiveness of GCSF to treat stroke , and the compound was safe and well tolerated in early clinical studies of ischemic stroke patients .
“ GCSF has been used and studied clinically for a long time , but we ’re the first group to apply it to Alzheimer ’s disease , ” said USF neuroscientist Juan Sanchez - Ramos , MD , PhD , the study ’s lead author .
“ This growth factor could potentially provide a powerful new therapy for Alzheimer ’s disease — one that may actually reverse disease , not just alleviate symptoms like currently available drugs . ”
The researchers showed that injections under the skin of filgrastim ( Neupogen® ) — one of three commercially available GCSF compounds — mobilized blood stem cells in the bone marrow and neural stem cells within the brain and both of these actions led to improved memory and learning behavior in the Alzheimer ’s mice .
“ The beauty in this less invasive approach is that it obviates the need for neurosurgery to transplant stem cells into the brain , ” Dr. Sanchez - Ramos said .
Based on the promising findings in mice , the Alzheimer ’s Drug Discovery Foundation is funding a pilot clinical trial at USF ’s Byrd Alzheimer ’s Center .
The randomized , controlled trial , led by Dr. Sanchez - Ramos and Dr. Ashok Raj , will test the safety and effectiveness of filgrastim in 12 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer ’s disease
The researchers worked with 52 elderly mice , equivalent to the human ages of 60 to 80 years .
About half ( 24 ) were mice genetically altered to develop symptoms mimicking Alzheimer ’s disease by the time they reach 5 - months old .
The others ( 28 normal , or non-Alzheimer ’s , mice ) were not .
The researchers confirmed through a series of tests that the Alzheimer ’s mice were memory impaired before beginning the experiments .
Some mice were treated for three weeks with injections of the GCSF compound filgrastim .
At the end of study , the Alzheimer ’s mice treated with GCSF demonstrated clearly improved memory , performing as well on behavioral tests as their non-Alzheimer ’s counterparts .
The Alzheimer ’s mice administered saline injections instead of GCSF continued to perform poorly .
GCSF treatment did not boost the already excellent memory performance demonstrated by the non-Alzheimer ’s mice tested before the study began .
Further experiments showed that the size and extent of beta amyloid deposited in the brains of the Alzheimer ’s mice was significantly less in those treated with GCSF .
Depending on their ages , mice treated with GCSF had a 36 to 42 - percent reduction in beta amyloid , the protein considered a major culprit in the development of Alzheimer ’s disease .
GCSF reduced the burden of beta amyloid deposited in the brains of the Alzheimer ’s mice by several means , the researchers found .
One was by recruiting reinforcements to clear beta amyloid accumulating abnormally in the brain .
The growth factor prodded bone - marrow derived microglia outside the brain to join forces with the brain ’s already - activated microglia in eliminating the Alzheimer ’s protein from the brain .
Microglia are brain cells that act as the central nervous system ’s main form of immune defense .
Like molecular “ Pac - men , ” they rush to the defense of damaged or inflamed areas to gobble up toxic substances .
The growth factor also appeared to increase the production of new neurons in the area of the brain ( hippocampus ) associated with memory decline in Alzheimer ’s disease and to form new neural connections .
“ The concept of using GCSF to harness bone marrow - derived cells for Alzheimer ’s therapy is exciting and the findings in mice are promising , but we still need to prove that this works in humans , ” said Dr. Raj , a physician researcher at the Byrd Alzheimer ’s Center at USF Health .
In addition to Dr. Sanchez - Ramos , other authors of the Neuroscience paper were Shijie Song , PhD ; Vasyl Sava , PhD ; Briony Catlow , PhD ; Xiaoyang Lin ; Takashi Mori , PhD ; Chuanhai Cao , PhD ; and Gary Arendash , PhD .

This week , Stephen Colbert took his show , “ The Colbert Report , ” to Baghdad as part of a U.S.O. tour .
Sending entertainers to perform for the troops overseas has been a long - time American tradition .
Maintaining good troop morale is essential to a successful military mission .
What does it take to do that , especially in the face of multiple deployments ?
We asked current and former servicemembers , a historian and the spouse of an Army officer for their thoughts .
We also invited several comedians — Gary Brightwell , Keith Alberstadt , Sarah Tiana , Dave Mishevitz , Tom Foss , Leighann Lord — who have toured with Comics on Duty in Iraq and Afghanistan to tell us what they learned and the jokes that brought down the barracks .
Build Morale Back Home
Jim Murphy and Bill Murphy Jr. are fellows with the Truman National Security Project .
Jim Murphy , a Marine Corps officer in Iraq in 2003 , works for Activision Blizzard , a videogame publisher .
His brother , Bill Murphy Jr. , was an officer in the Army Reserves and is the author of “ In a Time of War , ” about West Point ’s class of 2002 .
It was a great gesture of solidarity for Stephen Colbert to get his head shaved during his televised U.S.O. morale - building tour in Iraq .
But there was another moment that was more motivating .
In one of his monologues , Mr. Colbert casually used the all - purpose Army slang , “ hooah . ”
His audience did what soldiers do in that situation : they called it back to him , loud and proud , several hundred men and women in uniform shouting a single , slurred syllable : “ HOOOAAAAHHH ! ”
Mr. Colbert seemed startled , and his reaction symbolized the barrier between military and civilian society , which is part of what he went over to address in the first place .

By getting American civilians to notice and care about the war again , Colbert motivated the soldiers we still have on the ground .
The U.S.O. is a fantastic organization with a storied history , but Mr. Colbert ’s effort this week stood apart , because it was as much about boosting the morale of civilians back home as it was about boosting the morale of the troops .
Getting American civilians to notice and care about the war again ca n’t help but have an impact on the motivation of the 130,000 or so soldiers we still have on the ground .
Not to get all Matthew - Broderick - in - “ Election ” here , but there is an important difference between morale and motivation .
If you ’ve ever been on a large U.S. base in Iraq and seen eight kinds of ice cream in the dining hall : that ’s for morale .
If you see a platoon of dirty , tired , proud soldiers or Marines returning together from a successful mission : that ’s motivation .
Motivation is basic , it ’s a soldier or Marine ’s knowledge that they ’re doing an important job and doing it well .
Were Mr. Colbert ’s jokes all hilarious ?
Well , the troops laughed politely at military themed jokes they ’d heard variations of before , perhaps understanding that for Mr. Colbert ’s character and his civilian audience , they were brand - new .
We ’re reminded of some Army specialists and Marine lance corporals we ’ve known whose keen observations and acute sense of irony could put most Hollywood comedians to shame .
But what Mr. Colbert did was important .
He tried to affect civilian morale , and he did it in an honest way that the troops themselves could see .
And that ’s pretty motivating .
It ’s All About Trust
Maj . Gen. Mark Hertling has served in the United States Army for 34 years .
Most recently , he commanded the First Armored Division in Germany , and from October 2007 to December 2008 , he commanded Task Force Iron — a force of 30,000 servicemen and women — in northern Iraq .
How do I keep up troop morale ?
All commanders are responsible for the morale of their soldiers , and they execute this in a variety of ways .
Commanders must ensure that their troops are properly trained and disciplined , and they must provide rewards and ensure that spouses and family members are cared for while their soldiers are deployed .
Commanders also need to ensure that their soldiers have access to things like appropriate food , adequate quarters , clean hygiene facilities , mail delivery ( including phone and Internet access ) , and rest .
But there ’s much , much more .
Read more …
When a commander is present during the toughest of times , morale is high .
When a commander is present during the toughest of times ; when soldiers know their leaders wo n’t ask them to do anything they wo n’t do themselves ; when “ the brass ” live in the same conditions their soldiers do ; when those in authority dole out fair discipline and at the same time appropriately reward those who have gone the extra mile , morale is high .
When soldiers know their leaders are agonizing over battle plans , working and reworking them and then rehearsing them with the appropriate rigor until risks are mitigated and dangers are brought to the lowest levels ; when a commander is out in the scorching heat or the torrential rain or the extreme cold with their soldiers ; when a leader shares a meal , a wet bunker and a dark night , talking with the troops , spending time with them , morale is high .
When there is trust between the leader and the led , morale is high .
U.S.O. shows raise morale , and so do the occasional steak dinners in the field , care packages from home or a great handwritten letter .
( And by the way , handwritten letters are always better than an e-mail because you can carry it around and read it over and over ; plus it holds perfume much better than an e-mail . )
While all those things are great , I believe the best way to keep up morale is to do the very best I can — as a leader — to ensure soldiers know they are taken care of , that they are part of a high - performing team that we have built together , and that they know they can trust me to do my very best to bring them home to their loved ones .
Remember the Families Left Behind
Melissa Seligman is the author of “ The Day After He Left for Iraq ” and the host of “ Her War , ” a podcast for military wives .
Walking through the airport , hand in hand with my husband , an Army officer dressed in his battle fatigues , I ca n’t help but notice the stares , the curious looks and the sympathy of strangers .
Within each person ’s eyes , I see the desire to help .
To fix him .
To wipe the tears from my children ’s eyes and to show support and compassion .
People stop him , wanting to shake his hand .
“ Thank you , ” they say , over and over again , unable to say more .
What more can be said ?
The hole in his heart will continue to grow with each deployment .
That ca n’t be helped .
But it is possible to ease his pain .

Boosting troop morale does n’t always involve looking overseas .
It also involves looking next door .
Soldiers have always enjoyed care packages , letters of support , banners of encouragement and celebrity visits .
But one thing often haunts them : they feel guilty for leaving their families behind .
They vow to die for those they have never met , yet they are rarely home to protect , touch and defend their families .
The answer to boosting their morale does n’t always involve looking overseas .
It involves looking next door .
A small nod of encouragement to his children as they ride their bikes .
The willingness to open the door while his wife juggles the groceries and small children .
Returning her empty trash can from the curb .
A quick phone call to “ check in . ”
Taking the time to simply offer to help with the lawn .
Or , just lowering your gaze long enough to acknowledge the child carrying the weight of a war .
The small things do matter .
The next time you see him at that airport , struggling with his goodbye , you can do something to help .
You ca n’t mend his broken heart , but you can remember it by reaching out to a military family in his absence .
What Soldiers Need to Hear
Richard H. Kohn is professor of history and peace , war , and defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
A former president of the Society for Military History , he is co-editor of “ Soldiers and Civilians : The Civil - Military Gap and American National Security . ”
During the American war for independence , the drill master Friedrich von Steuben complained that American soldiers had to have the war explained in order to motivate them .
That was one reason why Abraham Lincoln spoke frequently to Union soldiers eighty - some years later , and why at the beginning of World War II , George C. Marshall asked the famed movie director Frank Capra to produce training films for the troops , which resulted in the now - iconic series “ Why We Fight . ”
Those armies were composed overwhelmingly of recruits or draftees who served only for the war : “ citizen - soldiers . ”
Today ’s military is peopled by much more highly trained men and women who think of themselves not only as citizens but as professionals even though many will serve only one “ hitch . ”
They are led by much more professional officers and above all by skilled , experienced , long - service non-commissioned officers who are in many respects the backbone of the armed forces .

Morale rests to some degree on soldiers ’ sense that America ’s goals are praiseworthy .
Soldiers today –- including National Guard and Reserves — are volunteers , older , often married , better trained , more experienced , and more ethnically diverse than in the past .
Yet morale still rests to some degree on soldiers ’ sense that America ’s goals are praiseworthy .
Other factors have also influenced morale like confidence in their political and military leadership ; belief that the strategy and tactics being employed are smart and will succeed ; faith in their equipment ; unit pride and cohesion ; and the conditions of service , from food and living conditions to the belief in the fairness of their treatment .
Also important is their expectation that the government and the people care about them , will care for them and support what they are doing and how they are doing it .
That ’s the overriding message of Stephen Colbert ’s visit beyond the sheer entertainment value : that famous Americans care , and that the American people respect and support their service and sacrifice .
A Little Escapism
Gary Brightwell , a stand - up comedian , is a writer for the television show “ Country Fried Home Videos ” on CMT .
The troops in Iraq and Afghanistan were probably the best audiences I have had .
I ca n’t count how many times a soldier would tell me and the other comedians how much they liked having a two - hour escape from the daily pressures of fighting these wars .
What did the troops find funny ?
They liked jokes about things that were part of their daily experience , like :
I would like to thank the Army Corps of Engineers for the thermostat in our tent that regulates the temperature .
It has two settings … HANG MEAT … and BAKE A CAKE !
And those waste - cleaning trucks :
I love the “ crap ” trucks that come by everyday to clean the Port - A - Potties …
You get all excited when they come around , do n’t you ?
They are like the ice cream truck back home .
In fact , they should play a jingle like an ice cream truck — that way you would know the toilets were clean .
You would hear that jingle and say , “ Hey the crap truck is here !
New blue juice !
HOORAH !
Ah , Those Frequent Flyer Miles
Keith Alberstadt has been seen on “ The Late Show with David Letterman ” and is a contributing writer for both “ Saturday Night Live ’s Weekend Update ” and “ Late Night with Jimmy Fallon . ”
My three tours provided a wonderful opportunity not only to give back to our bravest , but to also get behind the news and be a part of their lives .
Not to mention rack up some serious airline miles !
Most material about the war zone was better received if it was lighthearted rather than political or bitter .
For example , “ I did n’t know this until I visited the Marines there , but Djibouti Africa is only 6 miles away … from the sun . ”
I often heard that they love us coming over because they sometimes feel forgotten , that many back home have moved on to other things .
Or something like that ; I was too busy Tweeting about American Idol and fantasy golf .
I ’m kidding , of course , but sometimes troops expressed a concern that the mundane narcissism of our society was forcing them to the back burner .
Their morale always seemed to be up when I was there .
Whenever they want me back , I ’ll go .
Especially since I need another 3,000 Delta miles for a free bag of pretzels .
‘ You Smell Like My Wife ’
Sarah Tiana is in the movie “ Comics On Duty ” a documentary about the experience of four comedians in Iraq .
She also plays “ Carmen ” on Reno 911 .
I wrote jokes for every base that we visited , which was always easy because we took a tour of each base right after we landed .
Correction , right after we ate .
We ate before we left a base and right when we landed at the next base .
Sometimes we would eat eight times a day !
I probably gained 10 pounds in three weeks .
I wrote a lot of military jokes before and during my trip .
But it was never the focus of my act .
Those guys do n’t want to think about their situation any more than we do .
It ’s like any job .
You do n’t want to be reminded of work .
For them , I represented home and companionship .
I reminded them of their wives , but not in a take out the trash and do the dishes kind of way .
Those flack jackets and helmets did nothing for my appearance , so I always brought a change of clothes , high heels , a portable curling iron and tons of perfume with me .
I never got tired of hearing , “ you smell just like my wife . ”
The single guys said , “ will you marry me ? ” I do n’t know .
Is that an order ?
The Absurd
Dave Mishevitz directs a sketch comedy show with The Strait Jacket Society and is a regular at The Comedy Store .
The troops are in a state of Groundhog Day .
So when a new face appears to break up the monotony it ’s exciting .
We comedians get to point out the absurdity of what they see everyday , and it relates instantly .
The comedy does n’t have to come from the experience of cockpits , mess halls and mortars though .
Funny is funny , unless you ’re ordered to laugh .
I always asked if there were National Guard soldiers in the audience .
After their hoots and claps and whistles I ’d say , “ ‘ How ’s your weekend ? ’
You can always tell who ’s in the Guard .
They walk around base staring at their watch , muttering ‘ It ’s got to be Monday by now ! ' ”
The different branches , though sharing in the true spirit of brotherhood , can be readily identified by their barks .
“ Hoo - Ah ! ” is the Army ’s answer for everything .
They take it too far , literally having ‘ Hoo - Ah ’ candy bars and “ moist ” wipes .
You Hungry ?
Hoo - Ah .
Want a candy bar ?
Hoo - Ah .
Going to the latrine ?
Take a Hoo-ah .
‘ Just Like Home ! ’
Tom Foss is a comedian who has traveled to 18 countries to entertain the troops , including four tours of Iraq and three of Afghanistan .
As a comedian I use my freedom of speech to make a living , so it ’s an honor to entertain the troops .
I get my biggest laugh when I tell them they make me feel like I am back at home in West Virginia .
They have me staying in a trailer , I am working in a tent , its hot out and the Christmas lights are still up .
Just like home !
I never go overseas with the idea that I am going to tell the troops what they are doing or what I would do if I were them .
I try to bring them home for a couple of hours .
I mostly tell Wal - Mart and Nascar jokes and let their minds get away from the stress of war .
It ’s always hard to leave when the tours are over .
But I still keep in touch with many of these great troops I ’ve met on my tours .
Entertaining them is the best thing that I can do with the skills I have .
Taking the Heat
Leighann Lord has appeared on Comedy Central , HBO and The View .
She writes a weekly humor column , “ Leighann Lord ’s Comic Perspective . ”
My family was very concerned about me performing in a war zone , but I figured as a married woman , I could handle it .
I traveled with Armed Forces Entertainment in June 2002 during Operation Enduring Freedom to Afghanistan , Pakistan , Bahrain and Saudi Arabia .
The soldiers were great audiences .
Not having a lot of first hand exposure to the military actually worked in my favor .
Observations about their everyday environment got the biggest laughs :
The flies here are huge !
They do n’t land on you .
They bump into you .
I thought I ’d be safe if I put on some Avon Skin - So - Soft , but apparently they like to eat that .
And :
Mobsters are smuggling guns into Hong Kong .
The police orchestrate a raid at a teahouse where an ace detective loses his partner .
Meanwhile , the two main gun smugglers are having a war over territory , and a young new gun is enlisted to wipe out informants and overcome barriers to growth .
The detective , acting from inside sources , gets closer to the ring leaders and eventually must work with the inside man directly .

BOSTON , Massachusetts ( CNN ) --
The Boston police officer who sent a mass e-mail in which he compared Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. to a " banana - eating jungle monkey " has apologized , saying he 's not a racist .
Boston Police Officer Justin Barrett has apologized for the e-mail he sent about Harvard professor .
Officer Justin Barrett , 36 , told a Boston television station Wednesday night that he was sorry about the e-mail , a copy of which he also sent to The Boston Globe .
He repeated his apology Thursday night on CNN's " Larry King Live . "
" I would like to take this opportunity to offer fellow police officers , soldiers and citizens my sincerest apology over the controversial e-mail I authored , " Barrett said on CNN .
" I am not a racist .
I did not intend any racial bigotry , harm or prejudice in my words .
I sincerely apologize that these words have been received as such .
I truly apologize to all . "
Barrett was suspended from his military duties as captain in the Army National Guard and placed on administrative leave from the Boston Police Department pending the outcome of a termination hearing .
Watch Barrett apologize »
Barrett said he was moved to write the note because he felt The Boston Globe column about the Gates incident to which he was responding " seemed like it was biased .
" It did not show the roles and duties of a police officer and how dangerous it already is without having a debate about people getting in a police officer 's face , which should never happen at all . "
Asked what led him to choose to use such language , he said , " I do n't know .
I could n't tell you .
I have no idea . "
He added , in response to a question , that he had never used such language before .
In a news conference Thursday morning , Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis denounced the e-mail .
" We have a relationship to maintain with the community , " he said .
" Police officers certainly have First Amendment rights , but they can't cross the line .
I believe this crosses the line . "
Watch Davis say Barrett will be held accountable »
Davis also said he spoke Wednesday with Gates , whom he described as " gracious and incredibly thankful that we took action . "
In his fiery e-mail , which he sent to some fellow Guard members as well as the newspaper , Barrett vented about a July 22 Globe column about Gates ' arrest .
The African - American scholar was arrested July 16 and accused of disorderly conduct after police responded to a report of a possible break - in at his Cambridge home .
The charge was later dropped , but the incident sparked a debate about racial profiling and police procedures .
President Obama stepped into the debate and drew criticism by saying the Cambridge police acted " stupidly . "
Obama , who later said he spoke without knowing all the facts , tried to calm the debate , meeting Thursday with Gates and the arresting officer , Sgt. James Crowley , for a beer at the White House .
" At this point , I am hopeful that we can all move on , and that this experience will prove an occasion for education , not recrimination , " Gates said afterward in a written statement .
" I know that Sergeant Crowley shares this goal . "
" What you had today was two gentlemen agree to disagree on a particular issue , " Crowley told reporters afterward .
" I do n't think we spent too much time dwelling on the past ; we spent a lot of time discussing the future . "
Globe columnist Yvonne Abraham , who wrote the editorial that sparked Barrett 's e-mail , supported Gates ' actions , asking readers , " Would you stand for this kind of treatment , in your own home , by a police officer who by now clearly has no right to be there ? "
Watch Blogger Bunch : Is race discussion possible ? »
In Barrett 's e-mail , which was posted on a Boston television station 's Web site , he declared that if he had " been the officer he verbally assaulted like a banana - eating jungle monkey , I would have sprayed him in the face with OC ( oleorosin capsicum , or pepper spray ) deserving of his belligerent non-compliance . "
Barrett used the " jungle monkey " phrase four times , three times referring to Gates and once referring to Abraham 's writing as " jungle monkey gibberish . "
He also declared that he was " not a racist but I am prejudice [ sic ] towards people who are stupid and pretend to stand up and preach for something they say is freedom but it is merely attention because you do not get enough of it in your little fear - dwelling circle of on - the - bandwagon followers . "
According to a statement from Boston police , Davis took action immediately on learning of Barrett 's remarks , stripping the officer of his gun and his badge .
Barrett 's prior arrests and field investigations will be looked at for indications of racial bias , Davis said .
The department will also delve deeper into the officers who received or viewed the e-mail .
All About Henry Louis Gates , Jr. • Racial Issues • Boston
" The three - year - old just walked right past me , " the Santa Rosa , CA , pediatrician reported , " talking into a cell phone . "
That stark image of toddler attached to machine has troubled me .
" I was amused at first , " the physician continued .
" Then I felt sad .
She was learning how to relate to people through a machine .
It was so mechanical .
Cell phones can connect people , but they also speed things up . "
Must we rush even toddlers into machines ?
" Half of British children aged 5 to 9 own a mobile phone .
Some Experts are Unhappy , " headlines a June 23 , 2009 article in the UK 's daily " The Times . "
It reports that " Lawrie Challies , an emeritus professor of physics who has led the Government 's mobile - phone safety research , says that parents should not give children phones before secondary school . "
( Mobile phones for children : a boon or a peril ?
Times Online - UK ) University of Melbourne pediatrics professor Michael Carr - Gregg , a leading Australian psychologist , " is worried about the power of mobile phones to distract and overexcite " and " says that no children should be allowed a mobile phone until the age of 12 . "
The French Government bans sales of mobile phones to children under 6 .
The long - term consequences of young children already taking their gaze away from living people and constantly - changing nature to look down into and be captured by static machines concerns me .
Who benefits and what is lost ?
What is appropriate technology use ?
What induces obsessive / compulsive / addictive behavior ?
Though I sometimes use a cell phone , with moderation , I am concerned about the unconscious and excessive use of them , like while driving or talking so loud in a restaurant that one disturbs the peaceful meals of others .
The issue is how we use technology , rather than abuse it .
Some people seem always on call , slaves to their cell phones , willing to drop a live person in favor of talking into that tiny machine .
The disadvantages of cell phones , including texting , warrant attention , including unintended consequences and collateral damage .
At issue is when and where and what the consequences might be at certain ages and in certain situations .
What might be appropriate cell phone and texting etiquette for young people at different ages ?
My goal is to encourage people to engage in critical thinking about consequences before placing pulsating plastic to hand then ear , rather than using more primitive and holistic communication methods , like face - to - face .
Cell phones can be good for emergencies , convenient , functional , practical , and have some advantages , as demonstrated by the global communication from the recent twittering from Iran .
They can enable even a young person to speak to a distant relative or a parent who is out of town .
However , walking around in the streets texting while looking down is sometimes dangerous and at least rude .
As with Petaluma , CA , artist Sally Krah , I am concerned about " the health risks of cell phones . "
She uses hers " carefully and infrequently , " so that " it does n't rule my life .
It 's a blessing if used in moderation . "
The immediacy of cell phones and their push - button control can increase impatience with slower things , like the development of deep human relationships , lasting love , growing plants , and caring for animals .
Cybertime creates unnatural time pressures , heightening stress and anxiety .
The tools and technologies that we use are not neutral ; they help shape who we become .
The addiction to technological progress has heightened in recent years , especially with respect to telecommunications and cybernetics .
This growth further exhausts fossil fuels .
The development , manufacture and maintenance of high technology tools and weapons depend upon ample cheap energy from fossil fuels .
As oil supplies decline and the pace of life quickens even more rapidly , the demand for more coal extraction will increase , which will heighten pollution and speed - up global climate chaos .
" Every single machine in the nation runs on lubrication , " notes David Frindley , staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
This includes electrical and wireless tools that require crude oil byproducts .
He was quoted in a recent article about Transition Towns in the weekly " North Bay Bohemian , " where he purchased a small farm in Sonoma County .
Frindley is a fellow at the Post Carbon Institute , based in small town Sebastopol , Northern California .
CAUGHT IN THE CELL PHONE SNARE
Alas , I have also been caught in the cell phone snare .
While speaking to my Sonoma State University students one day , mine went off , much to their delight , giggles , and snickers , as well as my embarrassment .
We may have a social epidemic on our hands .
Studies reveal that American teenagers sent and received an average of 2,272 text messages a month in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
One person reported that his 13 - year - old exchanged 14,528 texts in one month .
The number of text messages rose to about 75 billion earlier this year and is going up .
Downsides include declines in spelling , word choice and writing complexit and an inability to focus .
Text - bullying and sending naked photos have become problematic , resulting in at least one documented suicide .
I invited a SSU freshman class off - campus for a film and dinner .
The first thing that some of these teens did at the restaurant was to put their cell phones on the dinner table .
Some of their little gadgets promptly vibrated , buzzed , and made a variety of demanding sounds .
My dinner guests were soon miles away texting , having what sounded like one - way conversations intruding into our dinner , and playing phone games , ignoring the rest of us at the table in front of them .
What happened to old - fashioned connective meal - time conversations ?
When the primary relationship becomes with a talking machine , rather than with a multi- dimensional person with whom to have spontaneous , life - deepening and life - changing dialogue , something is lost .
As they multi-tasked on so - called " smartphones , " I felt annoyed and alone -- a slow dinosaur at a table with fast - moving butterflies with short attention spans flickering away into cyberspace , their consciousnesses split .
They are masters at quick scans of screens , rather than reading entire books .
I must admit that I am old - fashioned and prefer home - made music and food to the factory - made stuff .
I prefer live story - telling and the oral tradition of recited poetry to television .
I resist being drawn into the need - it - yesterday world .
But I did n't say anything to my students , though I did later circulate an article on the downsides of texting to initiate discussion .
The students were defensive , but it was a good experience in critical thinking , which is what I teach and seek to practice here .
One of the students in that class , Sally - Anne Petit , helped me understand the use of cell phones from the perspective of her generation as follows : " Changes in our world have made us feel uncomfortable .
Or even in danger of being without a mobile technological device .
We use these devices to hide us from scary things in this world .
It provides shelter , or even a friend .
This is important because part of growing up is defending yourself and learning how to act in awkward , or uncomfortable , perhaps even dangerous situations . "
" Its not about the technology so much as it is how the technology is used , " added one of my Teaching Assistants , social worker Victoria Fleming , M.S.W .
" It calls for a new etiquette .
It is harder for us as we get older to find relevance in young technology and this creates a rift between generations .
This is hardly a new phenomenon , but it is accelerated by the pace of emerging technology . "
I later walked on SSU 's beautiful redwood - lined campus .
Many students had their faces buried in that consumptive machine , missing the redwoods and other humans passing by , as well as the birds above calling to them .
I 've even seen two people walking along talking to each other -- on their cells phones .
Those with bluetooths in their ears reminded me of the part - machine , part - human race called Borgs in " Star Trek . "
Some SSU students understand the downsides of texting and related phenomenon .
" Digital Communication : The Death of Verbal Communication in our Society " was recently published by the campus newspaper .
Brian Evans contends that " we as a society have been spoiled by the luxuries of Internet , cellular communication , iPhones , Blackberries , etc . "
He laments that they have " diminished the personalization of communicating " and " texting has limited our laughter to Lol . "
The sound - bite , minimalist approach that texting and twittering employ can contract the soul and imagination , rather than expand them ; they narrow the range of emotions that can be expressed .
The frequency with which some fiddle with their phones , eyes down , makes it more difficult to make eye contact with them .
" TECHNO - ADDICTION "
" Techo- addiction " is how some psychologists describe this phenomenon , which includes other recent developments , such as Facebook , My Space , You Tube , and Twitter .
An indication that addiction is an appropriate description is when you see someone walk across a busy street , not in the crosswalk , texting , instead of looking , thus risking their life .
Texting and twittering also seem to shorten the attention span and heighten one 's vulnerability to distraction , rather than focus and concentration .
New technologies can promise a lot , and then entangle users in a growing web of products , often quite expensive .
Cell phones expand the consumer culture of instant messaging and instant gratification , thus reducing the time for embodied human relations and dialogue that leads beyond data and information to depth and textured wisdom .
It is illegal to hold cell phones to one 's ear while driving in California , though I notice many violators , who thus threaten the rest of us with more accidents .
Plane , train , and ship accidents have been documented to have happened while or just after pilots ' attentions were diverted while texting .
In contrast to the three - year - old with cell phone , I recently visited friends with a five - month - old bundled onto her mother 's chest , eyes locked , occasionally smiling at the rest of us , returning to absorb her mother 's warm intimacy .
It comforted me .
I have also been delighted to hang out with a neighbor 's seventeen - month - old , so full of vitality , splashing in water , beginning to form words .
He inspires me .
I worry about what is in store for these children in this high - tech , sped - up digital world .
I watch with delight as youngsters interact with chickens on my small farm , look up with awe into the giant redwoods , feel their powerful dance partner the wind , and see the birds above .
My seventeen - month - old friend eagerly stuffs his mouth with berries , whose purple color ring his wide smile .
At a library I recently also saw a small girl , probably under three , fixated on a computer screen .
She skillfully moved the " mouse " around and watched the machine respond promptly .
Screens radiate light , which looking at directly can be harmful , especially to young eyes and brains .
Sonoma State University psychology graduate student Julie Perkins is writing her thesis partly on " the gaze " and reports that she " is concerned with the use of machines and the deleterious effect of gazing on a screen in the digital world . "
This trend of children absorbed by machines rather than living beings or even picture books concerns me .
On the other hand , I 've heard of toddlers who throw cell phones into toilets .
Good for them !
This could be a direct way of communicating " Pay attention to me ! "
Such spontaneous play is a healthy alternative to the beginning of consumerism .
Technophiles seek to protect their expensive hand - held devices , whereas I am more concerned to protect children from pre-mature technology and the addiction to a cell phone culture that is not age appropriate .
One toddler 's mother explained that cell phones can have a candy - like appeal , which can lead to a child wanting to consume too much , unless appropriate limits are discerned and established .
" THE FLICKERING MIND "
" The Flickering Mind " titles a book by award - winning journalist Todd Oppenheimer , sub - titled " The False Promises of Technology in the Classroom and How Learning Can Be Saved . "
Though published what some now consider long ago , 2003 , its nearly 500 pages document the downsides of computers in education long before texting became so popular and disruptive .
His chapters include " Hidden Troubles , " " Bulldozing the Imagination , " and " The Human Touch . "
" Time poverty is now a recognized psychological and social stressor , " according to psychotherapist Linda Buzzell , co-editor of the new Sierra Club Book 's " Ecotherapy : Healing with Nature in Mind . "
She adds , " We struggle with diminishing success to adapt to the strange mechanical and disembodied world we have created , " including " endless 24/7 online communications ... constantly rushing to keep up as we inevitably fall further behind . "
In that machine - driven process " we find ourselves destroying not only our own health , but our habitat and the habitat of the people , plants and animals with whom we share the planet . "
My college students tend to be sweet and open - hearted .
They also have more trouble reading entire books and sustaining attention than they did even a few years ago ; they appear more distant and distracted .
Their emails have gotten briefer and are not always in standard English ; they employ abbreviations that I do not understand .
They seem to have less patience for ambiguity and paradox , preferring a machine - like yes and no and making overstatements like " always " and " never . "
I do not allow cell phones to be on during class .
The tapping while texting can be as annoying as cross- talking and insulting to whoever is speaking .
However , I still sometimes hear them vibrate and know that some students are so addicted that they are adept at concealing these tools -- which can become almost like armor or weapons -- under their clothes and desks the way earlier generations of youth would carefully conceal cigarette smoking .
It took a long time to make cigarette smoking illegal in certain public places , though the dangers had been clearly documented for decades .
I hope that it does not take as long to make cell phones illegal in some places , especially moving vehicles , as well as elsewhere .
Cell phones can be powerful forces in expanding the consumer culture and reducing embodied human relations and deep communication with others that involves texture , emotion , and nuances .
The critique of soulless machines implicit in this article echoes a tradition reaching back more than a century that includes British novelist D.H. Lawrence , German - speaking poet Rilke , German - American psychologist Erich Fromm , American gardeners Scott and Helen Nearing , and French sociologist Jacques Ellul .
Contemporary American advocates of this tradition include psychotherapist Chellis Glendinning ( " When Technology Wounds " ) , public relations expert Jerry Mander ( " In the Absence of the Sacred " ) , and farmer Wendell Berry ( " In the Presence of Fear . " )
The three - year - old witnessed by the pediatrician was being conditioned for an adult life of consumption with an early onset cell phone addiction .
Instead of speeding up to follow the commands of goal - oriented machines such as cell phones , we humans could benefit from slowing down to nature 's meandering pace , especially here in the gorgeous Redwood Empire .

The latest rewrite of the Web 's mother tongue wo n't recommend the use of specific audio and video encoding formats that could make it cheaper and easier for people to distribute multimedia content .
The major browser makers have been unable to agree on an encoding format they will support in their products , wrote Ian Hickson , editor of the HTML5 specification for the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) .
[ Keep up with app dev issues and trends with InfoWorld 's Fatal Exception and Strategic Developer blogs . ]
Plans have been discussed for years to incorporate two new tags -- < audio > and < video > -- into HTML5 , the next specification under development .
The original HTML specification never included those tags .
Because of that , people have to download plugins from various vendors to play audio and video content .
If browsers support the audio and video tags , however , as well as a common encoding format , Web users would n't have to use third - party applications for that content .
The browser would play the content natively , which makes Web development somewhat simpler and would not require users to download a raft of plugins .
But the issue of what codec to use has been a hot potato .
The codecs likely to have been recommended would have been Ogg Vorbis for audio and Ogg Theora for video , both of which can be implemented without paying royalties unlike with other formats .
Supporters for the use of those formats argue that no one company should profit or hold the power over a particular codec , which could influence its development and use depending on a company 's business plans .
If browsers supported those codecs , Web developers could use open - source tools and encoders for those formats to put multimedia on their site for free , potentially striking a blow against vendors such as Adobe , Microsoft , RealNetworks and others that sell multimedia software tools .
Apple wo n't support Ogg Theora in QuickTime , the company 's multimedia player , Hickson wrote .
Apple has also expressed concern over patents associated with Ogg Theora .
Even though the codec can be used royalty - free , Apple has been concerned that some party could make a claim if it ends up implemented in its products .
Opera and Mozilla oppose using the H.264 video compression standard for various reasons , including the cost of licensing the relevant patents as well distribution issues , Hickson wrote .
Google uses H.264 and Ogg Theora in Chrome , but also has a problem in how it can distribute the browser through third parties due to licensing issues with H.264 , he wrote .
Microsoft has n't made a commitment to support the video tag , he wrote .
" After an inordinate amount of discussions , both in public and privately , on the situation regarding codecs for < video > and < audio > in HTML5 , I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that there is no suitable codec that all vendors are willing to implement and ship , " Hickson wrote .
" I have therefore removed the two subsections in the HTML5 spec in which codecs would have been required , and have instead left the matter undefined , as has in the past been done with other features , " Hickson concluded .
Browser makers , however , can always make their own decision on what they want to support in their products .
Mozilla 's latest browser , Firefox 3.5 which was released this week , supports the audio and video tags as well as the Ogg Theora and Ogg Vorbis codecs .
Climate change poses as great a threat to the world as the nuclear arms race , scientists warned yesterday as they called on leaders to take urgent action to tackle the problem .
The scientists and Nobel laureates attending a three - day conference hosted by St James 's Palace drew up a memorandum calling for global greenhouse gas emissions to peak by 2015 .
The memorandum from the experts , who included the US energy secretary Steven Chu , said a new global deal on emissions expected at the UN conference on climate change in Copenhagen in December was urgently needed .
It must undertake to cut greenhouse gases by half by 2050 , the document urged .
And while developed countries should take the lead , with cuts of 25 per cent to 40 per cent by 2020 , every nation must act , on the " firm assumption that all others will also act " .

Professor Hans Schellnhuber , director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany , said that with " probably the biggest concentration of brains on the planet " drawing up the memorandum , it could be more vital than many mass protests on climate change .
" We are in a crisis as deep as the times of the arms race , " he added .
The memorandum from the conference said that without protecting tropical forests , there was no solution to tackling climate change .
Dr Rajendra Pachauri , chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , warned that the impacts of climate change could cause havoc in many of the poorest places in the world .
The experts ' memorandum called for resources being used to aid economic recovery to put the world on to a path towards a low - carbon economy .
Introduction
Enermax , as the name suggests , is a company mainly remembered for their magnificent power supplies , though they have been attempting to branch out into other areas , such as cases and peripherals .
Enermax has put their time and and effort into designing a keyboard that is affordable for the every day person , yet good enough for the every day enthusiast .
Today , we ’ll be looking at just that .
The Enermax Aurora Micro , an unusually sturdy compact keyboard .
Let ’s see if this is a mighty mite , or just shrimpy .
Packaging & First Looks
The packaging is fairly minimal , with a profile shot of the keyboard front and center , and the keyboard itself peeking out to the left side , underneath a plastic shell .
The back of the box goes into detail about all the features offered , in as many languages as they can cram on .
The keyboard itself is black anodized aluminum , with a silver accent strip along the top and silver Enermax logo in the upper left corner .
The keycaps are matte black plastic , with what Enermax claims to be “ Everlasting key top printing ” .
The USB 2.0 ports on the Enermax Aurora Micro are split , with one on each side of the unit near the top .
This makes plugging in large flash drives simpler , though a truly oversized flash drive may run into the lip on the top .
The bottom of the keyboard is flat , with three rubber feet along the bottom edge and two along the top to hold it still .
If an upward tilt is desired , the two - stage feet can raise the back end up by about five degrees .
One thing that is immediately apparent with this keyboard is the feel : solid .
The main enclosure is milled from a solid piece of aluminum , and the other parts have been fitted into it solidly , with no flex or looseness .
Attempts to deliberately torque the frame , by twisting the ends between my hands , could not elicit so much as a creak .
If you ’re looking for a keyboard that can stand up to abuse , the Aurora Micro will certainly fit the bill .

Are you ready to hear the Indiana Jones theme song one more time ?
Indy 's co-star from the Crystal Skulls says Spielberg is gearing up for another Indy — which explains why they changed Crystal Skull 's original ending .
We explain below .

Talking to the BBC , Shia LaBeouf drops some big news about the next Indiana Jones outing :
" Steven [ Spielberg ] just said that he cracked the story on it before I left and I think they 're gearing that up . "

Funny he should mention that , because we sure as heck could n't get it out of Indiana Jones Producer Frank Marshall , when we spoke with him last .
But he did share this gem : one draft of the Crystal Skull script actually called for Shia to put on Indy 's infamous fedora , signalling that Indy was passing the baton to his son Mutt .
But Spielberg changed this ending , so that Indy kept his own hat .
Which means
Indy still has at least one more adventure in him — but it also means we 're not done with his son , either .
I owe a debt of gratitude to Moroccan cooking expert Kitty Morse .
After all , she ’s the one who taught me just how easy it is to make my own preserved lemons .
How easy ?
So easy that you do n’t even need a real recipe for it .
I took a cooking class at Draeger ’s years ago that Morse taught .
It was there that she turned me on to the endless wonders of preserved lemons .
They cost a tidy sum if you buy them already made in jars in fancy gourmet stores .
They cost mere pennies if you make them yourself , especially if you have your own lemon tree .
I always use Meyer lemons just because I love the floral , complex , and less puckery taste that they have .
But I also know that Mourad Lahlou , the Marrakech - born chef - owner of Aziza in San Francisco , likes both Meyers and Eurekas , but for different uses .
At a cooking demonstration late last year at the Culinary Institute of America ’s Greystone Campus in St. Helena , Lahlou said he favors the more delicate preserved Meyer lemons in salads , but preserved Eurekas in long - cooked stews because the rind is thicker and does n’t break down so much .
Whatever lemon variety you choose , I guarantee you will have a fascinating time making preserved lemons .
If you have kids , they ’ll have fun watching the lemons do their thing , too .
Think of it as your own little science experiment .
Indeed , the first time I wrote about making preserved lemons years ago in the San Jose Mercury News , I admitted I could n’t stop looking at my lemons as they transformed themselves .
I was n’t the only one .
Many readers wrote back after making their own batch , confessing that if they woke up in the middle of the night , they ’d sneak a peek at their lemons .
Morse even laughed that my lemons had become my pets .
So how do you make them ?
Simple .
All you need are washed and preferably organic lemons ( either Eurekas or Meyers ) , kosher salt , and a glass jar with a tight lid that has been sterilized by running it through the dishwasher .
Make two cuts in each lemon so that the quarters created remain attached .
Stuff kosher salt into the crevices of the lemons .
Then , place salted lemons tightly into the glass jar .
If I have one or two leftover lemons , I ’ll often squeeze the juice into the jar before closing it .
But you do n’t have to .
This just gives the lemons a little bit of a head start .
Place the jar on a counter top , and then just watch and wait .
Over the next few days , more and more juice will exude from the lemons , filling the jar .
You can give it a shake now and then — or not — to keep the salt blended well in the liquid .
In about three weeks , the lemons will get very soft , and the brining liquid thick and cloudy .
Once that happens , you can store the jar in the refrigerator .
As long as the brine covers the lemons , they ’ll keep for about a year refrigerated .
To use , pick a lemon or part of one out of the jar with a clean fork .
Give the lemon a quick rinse .
Remove any seeds .
Then , use the peel however you like — chopped or sliced in thin slivers .
Some people discard the flesh , but Morse considers that wasteful .
I always add some of the chopped flesh in with the rind in whatever I ’m making .
Use preserved lemons in your favorite Moroccan chicken tagine recipes .
Or stir it into tuna salad for sandwiches , pasta salad , bean salad , vinaigrettes , marinades for fish or Cornish game hens , or in couscous topped with toasted pine nuts .
With their bright , salty - citrus taste and jammy texture , you ’ll find that preserved lemons add complexity and depth to so many dishes .
Of course , there are faster ways to make preserved lemons .
Some people boil the lemons in the jar in a water bath , thereby cooking the lemons , and making them ready to use the very next day .
Others freeze the lemons first , so they start to break down .
But I like to wait for mine .
After all , that ’s half the fun .

Costa Rica is the happiest place earth and environmentally friendly
Costa Rica is the happiest place on earth , and one of the most environmentally friendly , according to a new survey by a British non-governmental group .
The New Economics Foundation looked at 143 countries that are home to 99 percent of the world ’s population and devised an equation that weighed life expectancy and people ’s happiness against their environmental impact .
By that formula , Costa Rica is the happiest , greenest country in the world , just ahead of the Dominican Republic .
Latin American countries did well in the survey , occupying nine of the top 10 spots .
Australia scored third place , but other major Western nations did poorly , with Britain coming in at 74th place and the United States at 114th .
The New Economics Foundation ’s measurements found Costa Ricans have a life expectancy of 78.5 years , and 85 percent of the country ’s residents say they are happy and satisfied with their lives .
Those figures , taken along with the fact that Costa Rica has a small “ ecological footprint , ” combined to push the small nation to the top of the list .
A 2006 New Economics Foundation study designated Vanuatu the world ’s happiest nation , with Costa Rica at second place .
Sociologist Andrea Fonseca said Costa Rica gives its citizens the “ tools ” to be happy , but cautioned that happiness cannot be calculated just by looking at life expectancy and environmental practices .
She added that the country ’s rise to the top of the Happy Planet Index “ has a lot to do with social imagination . ”
Costa Rica has a peaceful reputation because it does not have an army , and is also known for its protected ecological zones and national slogan “ pure life , ” she said .

NABLUS , West Bank ( Reuters ) - Ramzi Abu Redwan says he remembers waiting in the halls of Al - Fara ’a prison as a boy , holding his grandfather ’s hand and staring up at the walls as he waited to see his father , jailed by Israel .
Now , those same walls echo , not with the footsteps of Palestinian prisoners , but with music and children ’s laughter .
The prison , just outside the West Bank city of Nablus , was used in turn by the British , Jordanians and Israelis .
It was made into a youth sports center in the 1990s , after limited Palestinian self - rule began in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war .
Now , each summer , Abu Redwan turns the facility into a music camp for Palestinian youth from poor families and refugee camps .
Abu Redwan is not the only one whose past meets the present in the halls of Al - Fara’a .
The parents of some 20 youngsters who have attended the camp have been imprisoned there , and one teacher is a former prisoner .
Palestinians jailed by Israel for anti-Israeli activity or violence are widely seen by their brethren as heroes of what Palestinians describe as resistance against occupation .
“ We ’re trying to liberate people .
We ’re giving our children a kind of internal freedom , ” Abu Redwan said .
“ Maybe ( my generation ) did n’t have the means of expressing ourselves , but our children will have a different means of resisting occupation that is better , and stronger . ”
Abu Redwan , who got an opportunity to leave his home in Al - Amari refugee camp to study music in France , wants to offer the same chance to other Palestinian children from disadvantaged backgrounds .
INTERNATIONAL INSTRUCTORS
His project , called “ Al - Kamanjati ” ( “ The Violinist ” ) offers youngsters musical training from September to June .
They are given instruments , and to wrap up the school year , they spend a week at Al - Fara ’a and perform in an end - of - session concert .
About 25 instructors come from Europe and the United States to participate at the summer camp .
Ethan Cardoze , a member of the Paris Orchestral Ensemble , has come to the camp for the past two years .
He said he benefits as much from the experience as his pupils .
“ Each day I ’m learning Oriental music , and that ’s something that makes me richer .
I love the freeness ( of Oriental music ) .
Western music is really square , with bars , with rhythms .
It ’s very strict .
Oriental music is much more supple .
You have to listen more , you have to adjust your personal sense of rhythm . ”
This year , the project will fund a visit to London by 18 - year - old Shehadeh Shalady , where he will study violin - making .
At the camp , he proudly shows off the first two violins he has made .
One has a tiny Palestinian flag painted on it .
Asked if he feels strange using a former prison as a music camp , Abu Redwan shook his head .
“ It ’s true that this was a prison , but walls do n’t hurt you .
It ’s the people who use them that do .
It ’s true that this place brings back a lot of memories , but it ’s great that now we can fill the place with something positive , ” he said .
Local Child Discovers ' Fuck '
Eight year - old Richie Harding of Quakertown , Pennsylvania reportedly discovered the obscenity " fuck " late last Thursday night , according to reports from friends and family , and has already succeeded in using it proficiently in at least eight sentences the following day at school .
Mother Jane Harding says she first learned of her son's discovery when he was requested to go up and wash up for bed , to which he replied " I 'm not fucking tired . "
" I was completely shocked , " Harding said .
" Primarily because he knew that word , but also because he had already advanced far enough in his analysis of the word to be able to use it as an adjective . "
Harding quickly attempted to explain why using the word was wrong , but was thwarted by her son 's incessant questioning .
" I told him he could n't use it because it was rude , but he asked me why it was rude , and there went the ball game , " she said .
" I mean , I could 've attempted to delve into the history of obscenities and explain that most are derived from old rules of lower - class versus higher - class languages that are largely irrelevant in today 's society , but I do n't think he would 've understood .
On the other hand , I did n't want to confuse him by explaining that there is no real reason for words to be obscene in the modern English language , and that it 's just a nonsensical vestige of earlier times , like saying ' God bless you ' . "
Faced with a lack of an acceptable choice of explanation , Harding opted to sidestep the issue by saying , " Because it 's just wrong , " and sending her son to bed .
" I was hoping that would somehow nip the problem in its bud , but I knew in my heart it would n't , " she said sadly .
" Fuck is just too attractive a word to just forget about . "
Harding 's instincts proved correct , as peers and teachers reported Richie 's continued usage of the word during school the next day .
" I had always prided my classroom on being obscenity free , but then that Harding bastard had to come and ruin everything , " said Mrs. Joan Reed , Harding 's math teacher .
" As soon as he asked me what the fuck the answer to eight time eight was , I knew the classroom was fucked . "
" Fucked right up the ass , " she added with a sigh .
Conversely , many of Harding 's peers were impressive with the new word , and began adding it to their lexicon instantly .
" I asked Richie what it meant , and he said he did n't know , " said classmate Laura Jones .
" But he said using it seemed to make the adults mad , which meant that it made him look cool .
So I had to start using it , too . "
" The fact that I can't say it makes it so much fucking fun to say ! " exclaimed Jane Kerok .
" Fucking fun , fucking fuck ! "
The word 's introduction to the other students prompted teacher Reed to hold an emergency meeting with Principal Ron Jones during recess , who expressed outrage " for some reason " .
" Fuck if I know why our kids saying fuck should make me mad , but it does ! " he said .
" Hell , it has to , or the do - gooder parents will want my fucking head faster than you can say ' My god damned kid heard that word at your fucking school ! ' "
Secretary Martha Simpson agreed .
" There 's just some things our kids should n't see or hear , like bad words and women 's breasts , " she said , shaking her head .
" You can't really say a reason .
It 's just wrong , like a white woman marrying a nigger . "
Science teacher Ron Kimball took his worries a step further , expressing fear that the current generation of children would grow up as criminals , having " seen and heard too much " .
" When you have kids running around saying dirty words , it 's not hard to imagine them taking the next logical step and putting a knife in somebody 's head , " he said , his eyes wide with fear .
" And I do n't want it to be my head ! "
Johnson added that he would be stopping his own cursing , in order to encourage the children to stop as well .
" We do n't need those words in our society , and I for one am taking a stand against it , " he said firmly , striding out of the room .
Johnson then stubbed his toe on the doorframe , causing him to yell , " Fuck , my fucking toe ! "
But while those at the school are concerned about the future of humanity , Richie Harding 's father Jim is worrying about one thing : his son .
" At this point , his future is probably gone , " he said glumly .
" Really , the sooner I accept that , the sooner we can move on to our other kid .
Maybe we 'll do a better job at keeping him from all of the world 's evils -- at least until he 's 30 . "
This is how it starts .
I dial the arranged number , and a female voice tells me that our conference call is about to begin .
Then , just as I realise I have no idea what Ralf Hütter 's speaking voice is like , there he is : much younger - sounding than his 62 years , and , by the sound of it , a lot more relaxed about the interview ritual than I 'd have thought .
" Hello , it 's me , " he says , enthusiastically .
I then try a bit of night - school German .
How are you ?
Wie geht's ?
" Oh , you speak German . "
A little , I tell him .
Ein bisschen
" But you understand the lyrics in German ? "
Some of them , I think , which really does n't seem good enough , so I tell him that even if a lot of Kraftwerk 's lyrics enter my head as sound rather than words , I definitely prefer listening to his group 's music in its original language ( take , for example , their 1981 UK No 1 The Model : in its English translation , rather clunky ; in Hütter 's mother tongue , both elegant and precise ) .
There 's then a quick exchange about the fact that he translates his own lyrics , before a pause .
" Have we talked before ? "
No .
" How come you are into this type of music without meeting Kraftwerk ? "
Well , here 's the thing : you really do n't do many interviews .
At all .
At that , the last remaining original member of the most influential group besides the Beatles emits a sound I was not quite expecting to hear : the merest hint of a laugh .
In general , Hütter spares time for journalists about as frequently as Kraftwerk put out records .
And look how infrequently they come : aside from the 2005 live recording Minimum - Maximum , Kraftwerk 's last proper album was 2003 's Tour de France Soundtracks .
Before that they broke cover in 1991 to release The Mix , an anthology of souped - up treatments of some of their best songs , which represented the hard - won fruits of their conversion from analogue to digital .
This latter process , focused on their Düsseldorf studio - cum - HQ Kling Klang , seems to have taken around five years , which highlights Kraftwerk 's somewhat mindboggling work cycles .
Hütter talks about his operation in terms of a strong work ethic , and insists that he and his colleagues need to go into non-communicative seclusion to create their art ; it is part of Kraftwerk 's mythology that Kling Klang does n't even have a phone .
Less exacting minds might use all that time and calm to create no end of music , but that is not the Kraftwerk way , which seems to explain why three of the group 's members - Wolfgang Flür , Karl Bartos , and , latterly , the group 's co-founder , Florian Schneider - have now left Kling Klang for good .
There are at least three reasons to suspect that Hütter and his three new ( ish ) Kraftwerk colleagues - Fritz Hilpert , Henning Schmitz and Stefan Pfaffe - may now be visible a bit more often .
First , they have a brand - new live presentation , including a 3D segment ( for which you 'll need the obligatory glasses ) , about to receive its British premiere at the Manchester International festival .
Second , this September should finally see the release of definitive versions of the eight albums - from 1974's Autobahn onwards - that form the Kraftwerk canon .
On top of all that , Hütter assures me that new music will be on the way " soon " , though this being a Kraftwerk interview , what that might mean remains unclear .
The prospect of interviewing Hütter only highlights his prolonged periods of public absence .
It seems very odd that I know what he thinks about telephones , but aside from the prophetic hints contained in Kraftwerk 's 1981 album Computer World , I have no idea what he makes of the ubiquity of text messaging and email .
Mystery also surrounds the departure of Schneider , a subject rendered even more problematic by Hütter 's famed reluctance to talk about either his personal life or his interior universe .
His droll summary of his average day runs thus : " I wake up in the morning , I brush my teeth , I go to the studio , I work , I go back home , I eat , I sleep . "
All we know is that he lives close to Düsseldorf , taking time out to cycle thousands of kilometres every year , and apparently working diligently - but moving painstakingly slowly , while the world outside speeds on .
" We always work on new projects , " he claims , before dispensing a beautifully Kraftwerkian take on what has often slowed them down .
Essentially , they spent too long stuck in the dying days of the steam age , waiting for the right equipment to come along - particularly when it came to performance .
" I remember once , we played in Paris , starting around 8 o'clock or something , " he says .
" And all the big steel factories in the suburbs turned their electricity down , or up , and there was this big shock in the cable system , and the sequencers ran at double speed .
We were so surprised . "
Another laugh .
" The whole technical situation caused a lot of problems for us , so we could n't play live .
And all through the 80s , we did n't play at all . "
This highlights one of Kraftwerk 's interesting tensions : underneath the super - calm exterior , they have probably spent far too much of their career feeling terribly frustrated .
This , Hütter reckons , is an essential matter of what he calls " psycho-electronics " .
" It takes all kinds of different mental states , from patience , to anger , to a big smile when everything is functioning , " he says .
" But we chose to continue working , and follow the idea of the Man Machine .
And for us , it 's still working positively . "
These days , their greatest allies are the laptops that carry the essentials of their show - which , he assures me , have worked just as well in freezing auditoriums in Tokyo as overheated festival tents in Australia .
Technology , in short , has belatedly delivered : as Hütter coolly puts it , " The equipment is finally up to our standards . "
Back in the distant past he issued one of his most fondly reproduced quotes , which once again seemed to cry out for a development that had not yet arrived .
The telephone , he said , was " an antiquity - you never know who is calling , there is no image , it is an outmoded product that constantly disrupts work " .
" Yes , " he says now .
" That was the 70s and 80s , [ but ] it still stands .
You'd be polite , and pick up , and say ' Hello ' and be surprised at what was at the other end of the line , maybe directing your future for the next minutes , hours , days .
That 's why in the studio we never have telephones .
We choose to go into the music , creative process .
Once this is finished , and we close the session , we come out again , and then , we 've enough time to get in contact with our friends . "
Has he been liberated by the advent of caller ID , or email , or SMS ?
Do those things make him more communicative ?
" Yes , but it has n't changed my general attitude .
You know these situations : you 're talking to somebody , and everybody 's on different platforms all the time , so nobody 's really concentrating . "
What he says next is probably not intended as his verdict on Twitter - a Kraftwerkian development , if ever there was one - but it may as well be .
" Everybody is becoming like ... " - he pauses - " a Stasi agent , constantly observing himself or his friends . "
The concert in Manchester happens on 2 July .
To Hütter 's delight , it will take place in the city 's Velodrome , also known as the National Cycling Centre - the mention of which takes us into a conversation about his most beloved pastime .
Hütter , along with Schneider , took up cycling around the time of 1978 's The Man Machine , and became such a fanatic that both Flur and Bartos blamed his obsession for Kraftwerk 's dwindling productivity .
At one point , he was said to be managing 200 km a day ; these days , he says , " a couple of thousand kilometres a year is possible " .
And is he still in the habit of leaving the tour bus 100 or so miles outside the next city , and pedalling the rest of the way ?
" Unfortunately not , " he says .
" We did that in the 80s : the bus would drop us , and we 'd finish the last couple of hours by bike .
But now , the tour schedule is so tight that mostly we 're using planes .
And when you do n't know the territory and the habits of the traffic , or like in England on the other side of the road ... well , we have to concentrate on the concert . "
On a recent trip to New York , he says , he enjoyed cycling every day in Central Park , but avoided the roads .
" It 's not a competition with cars .
I think that 's a dangerous game . "
In the early 80s , Hütter was injured in a cycling accident that happened on a dam on the Rhine .
Cycling with his usual racing team , he apparently collided with another rider , and fractured his skull and went into a coma .
Even temporarily , did it put him off ?
" No .
A lot of nonsense has been told about this , by people who were not even cycling with me . "
It did n't affect the way he felt about cycling at all ?
" No , and it did n't affect me .
I got a new head , and I 'm fine .
It was a few days in hospital , and that 's it .
A very normal accident .
It 's one of those things where somebody tells a story , and the next guy adds another story , and in the end ... like I say , I got a new operation , and I got a new head .
I just forgot my helmet , and I was in hospital for three or four days . "
Is it true that having emerged from a coma , his first words were " Where 's my bicycle ? "
" Er ... no .
I do n't think so .
But a lot of fantasy has been written . "
Hütter does his best to benignly close such subjects down , a tendency that becomes even more pronounced when I ask him about the fate of Schneider , the member of Kraftwerk whose blankly kind face - seemingly always on the verge of a smile , without ever quite getting there - seemed to sum up their music 's subtle emotional warmth to accidental perfection .
It may not be one of the records that 's about to be rereleased , but it is surely some token of his place in Kraftwerk history that their fourth album was titled Ralf und Florian .
Nevertheless , in January this year , just prior to Kraftwerk touring South America with Radiohead , it was announced that he too had left , after around 40 years at Hütter 's side .
News of his movements is hard to find : the most a few hours ' research throws up is that he recently popped up at an electronic music convention in Frankfurt , looking as un-Kraftwerkish as could be imagined , wearing - of all things - a flat cap .
" He worked for many , many years on other projects : speech synthesis , and things like that , " says Hütter .
" He was not really involved in Kraftwerk for many , many years . "
Do you miss him ?
" Oh , what can you say ?
You have to ask him . "
But do you feel his absence ?
" No , not now .
Because it 's been such a long time , you tend to forget , because we 're looking more forward .
And it 's been such a long time since he stopped working with us , so what can I say ? "
Well , to take this down to brass tacks , are you in contact with him ?
" No . "
Needless to say , when the conversation returns to art and technology , he brightens up .
For the record , Hütter does not own an iPod ( " I compose music - I do n't listen to much " ) , but when pushed , he sounds open to the possibilities that life beyond the CD is opening up .
" What is an album ?
In that format , it was 40 minutes , by a decision made by vinyl : side A , and side B .
And then the CD was longer - and now , it could be endless .
We could do an endless album ... because for me , music is like 24 hours .
We created the 168 - hour week for Kraftwerk . "
So in theory , there could be a 168 - hour Kraftwerk record ?
" Yes .
Why not ? "
This is how it finishes .
A day after we speak , Hütter 's PR forwards me an email .
Peppered with Kraftwerk song titles , and written in the capitals - free argot that suggests a mind well acquainted with online communication , it reads a bit like a poem :
" hello john
further to our interesting conversation this afternoon
some thoughts about the continuum in the music of kraftwerk since the seventies
autobahn ... the endless journey ... the timing of the composition resulting from the technical possibilities of the vinyl longplaying record ...
europe endless .... and the final sequence ... endless endless
trans europe express .... sequencer rhythms playing themselves ...
and finally .... the robots .... and ...... music non stop .... "
His last words sound like a bit of a tease , but they will surely raise the spirits of those of us who would hate to see Kraftwerk tumble back into seclusion : " .... to be continued .

Check out the styles we found and absolutely adore , we love them because they are totally unique , gorgeous or just take our breath away .
The crazy shoe trend marches on unabated and many celebrities , who seem to be reveling in this footwear madness , step out each day in some truly perplexing styles .
Look at the crazy footwear of Celebs that are cool , hideous , bold and outrageous to wear .
High - steppin’ Beyonce strutted into two April TV appearances in New York in blingin’ heels .
The French actress , who won an Oscar for portraying Edith Piaf in “ La Vie en Rose , ” picked a classic pair of heels for recent event in New York City in early June – classically statuesque , that is .
“ Public Enemies ” star Marion Cotillard rocked some red slippers – on steroids – at the film ’s Paris premiere , following up a pair of seriously puzzling shoes recently …
“ Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince ” author J.K.
Rowling wore a pair of sky - high gold shoes to the film ’s premiere .
Meanwhile , Heidi Klum ’s taking fashion to new heights .
The 35 - year - old supermodel added 12 inches to her 5 - foot , 9 - inch frame while modeling a pair of thigh - high leather Alexander McQueen boots for a German Vogue shoot .
Charlize
Theron turned heads when she totters down the red carpet at the Paris premiere of “ The Burning Plain . ”
Today ’s tale of people who do n’t really get how the internet works comes to us from Audra Shay , vice chairman of the Young Republicans .
Shay , 38 , ( which does n’t seem that young , amirite ? ) is slowly coming under fire for what was seemingly a lighthearted , giggly reaction supporting racist comments made on her Facebook page by an illiterate Facebook friend .
I wonder what her Indian buddy Bobby Jindal thinks of that ?
In the discussion of a status update wherein Shay referred to how “ WalMart just signed a death warrant in ( her ) eyes ” as they ’re “ endorsing Obama ’s healthcare plan , ” the comments start out predictably .
Here , I ’ll paraphrase : OMG socialism communism everybody panic , yall !- but it does n’t take too long for the discussion to descend into outright ignorance .
With Shay ’s approval .
Shay ’s friend Eric S Pike ( or Piker ) pipes in with these two well - reasoned bon mots .
I shall leave the spelling , grammatical and ideological errors intact :
“ It ’s the government making us commies … ca n’t even smoke in my damn car … whats next they going to issue toilet paper once a month … tell us how to wipe our asses … ”
“ Obama Bin Lauden is the new terrorist …
Muslim is on there side … need to take this country back from all of these mad coons … and illegals . ”
Shay responds :
“ You tell em Eric ! lol . ”
According to The Daily Beast , Shay is backpedalling fast now , claiming that she was only responding to comment one - despite the fact that eight minutes elapsed between her pal Eric ’s two insights .
And indeed , other Young Republicans immediately responded expressing their outrage at the idiocy ignorance existing in their party today .
Cassie Wallender , a national committeewoman from the Washington Young Republican Federation , then wrote : “ Someone please help a naïve Seattle girl out , is Eric ’s comment a racist slur ? ”
She answered her own question one minute later : “ Okay , why is this okay ?
I just looked it up .
‘ It comes from a term baracoons ( a cage ) where they used to place Africans who were waiting to be sent to America to be slaves . ’
THIS IS NOT OKAY AND IT’S NOT FUNNY . ”
This was followed soon after by the chairman of the D.C. Young Republicans , Sean L. Conner , who wrote “ I ’m really saddened that you would support this type of racial language …wow !
Thanks Cassie for standing up … ”
Naturally , some called for de-friending went down next .
Oh wait - she de-friended the critics of the comment .
Way to not be racist , Audra .
And , if her description of events is not a big fat lie , then why would she defriend the people who gently pointed out calling black people “ coons ” was “ not okay ” and not the dude who started the whole thing ?
Because , homeboy had to be around to wrap it all up with incoherent , vague and violent threats against any and all black people in possession of asses at sundown in the South .
“ I agree with dale … this is still America … freedom of speech and thought is still allowed … for now any ways … and the last time i checked I was a good ole southern boy … and if yur ass is black do n’t let the sun set on it in a southern town … ”
Shay eventually issued a half - assed apology that was more a whiny rant about internet bullying she believes is directed at her .
Shay states :
“ It is a disgrace that these types of political attacks are taking place and once again , it proves that my opponents will stoop to the lowest levels to steal this election from the jaws of victory . ”
Well , Audra , maybe not everything ’s about you , honey .
Could it be some of your fellow party members are horrified that friends of yours still hold and voice such ugly thoughts in this day and age ?
Let us not forget , this is n’t the first embarrassing nudge - nudge , wink - wink racist scandal to emerge in recent months via the GOP .
Or the second , for that matter .
The Young Republicans are slated to convene this weekend at a conference in Indianapolis .
It will be interesting to see how this influences Audra Shay ’s chances to become the new vice chair of the group .
Overall , it seems that Republicans in general need to decide if they ’re going to keep condoning this type of commentary on the down low - remember , in the “ Historical Keepsake Photo ” debacle , Sherri Goforth did n’t apologize for sending that racist e-mail– just for sending it to “ the wrong list . ”

Fedora 12's artwork process is going to work a little differently than our artwork process has worked in the past .
Rather than having multiple theme concepts competing with one another and dividing artists ' time and energies , we 're going to try having one theme concept ( inspired by the release codename ) that everyone works together on .
We 're hoping to produce higher - quality artwork in a more timely manner this way .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Six Flags Inc SIXF .OB , the world 's largest regional theme park company , said on Saturday it filed for bankruptcy protection .
The New York - based company operates amusement parks across the United States , Canada and Mexico .
Six Flags said it filed for Chapter 11 protection with the unanimous support of its lenders ’ steering committee .
The plan will result in a deleveraging of the company ’s balance sheet by about $ 1.8 billion , as well as the elimination of more than $ 300 million in preferred stock obligations .
“ The current management team inherited a $ 2.4 billion debt load that cannot be sustained , particularly in these challenging financial markets , ” Mark Shapiro , the chief executive of Six Flags , said in a news release .
“ As a result , we are cleaning up the past and positioning the company for future growth . ”
Shapiro said the action will not affect day - to - day park operations .
The bankruptcy filing “ paves the way for a full revival of the company , ” he said .
Six Flags , which offers 800 rides at its 20 parks , had been burdened with a massive debt load and a looming cash payment in August .
" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 26 - Exceptions and control exceptions
try { die " OH NOEZ " ; CATCH { say " there was an error : $ ! " ; } }
Exceptions are , contrary to their name , nothing exceptional .
In fact they are part of the normal control flow of programs in Perl 6 .
Exceptions are generated either by implicit errors ( for example calling a non-existing method , or type check failures ) or by explicitly calling die or other functions .
When an exception is thrown , the program searches for CATCH statements or try blocks in the caller frames , unwinding the stack all the way ( that means it forcibly returns from all routines called so far ) .
If no CATCH or try is found , the program terminates , and prints out a hopefully helpful error message .
If one was found , the error message is stored in the special variable $ ! , and the CATCH block is executed ( or in the case of a try without a CATCH block the try block returns Any ) .
So far exceptions might still sound exceptional , but error handling is integral part of each non-trivial application .
But even more , normal return statements also throw exceptions !
They are called control exceptions , and can be caught with CONTROL blocks , or are implicitly caught at each routine declaration .
Consider this example :
use v6 ; sub s { my $ block = -> { return " block " ; say " still here " } ; $ block ( ) ; return " sub " ; } say s( ) ; # block
Here the return " block " throws a control exception , causing it to not only exit the current block ( and thus not printing still here on the screen ) , but also exiting the subroutine , where it is caught by the sub s... declaration .
The payload , here a string , is handed back as the return value , and the say in the last line prints it to the screen .
Adding a CONTROL { ... } block to the scope in which $ block is called causes it to catch the control exception .
Contrary to what other programming languages do , the CATCH / CONTROL blocks are within the scope in which the error is caught ( not on the outside ) , giving it full access to the lexical variables , which makes it easier to generate useful error message , and also prevents DESTROY blocks from being run before the error is handled .
Perl 6 embraces the idea of multi threading , and in particular automated parallelization .
To make sure that not all threads suffer from the termination of a single thread , a kind of " soft " exception was invented .
When a function calls fail ( $ obj ) , it returns a special value of undef , which contains the payload $ obj ( usually an error message ) and the back trace ( file name and line number ) .
Processing that special undefined value without check if it 's undefined causes a normal exception to be thrown .
my @files = </etc / passwd /etc/shadow nonexisting > ; my @handles = hyper map { open ( $_ ) } , @files ; # hyper not yet implement
In this example the hyper operator tells map to parallelize its actions as far as possible .
When the opening of the nonexisting file fails , an ordinary die " No such file or directory " would also abort the execution of all other open operations .
But since a failed open calls fail ( " No such file or directory " instead , it gives the caller the possibility to check the contents of @handles , and it still has access to the full error message .
If you do n't like soft exceptions , you say use fatal ; at the start of the program and cause all exceptions from fail ( ) to be thrown immediately .
A good programming language needs exceptions to handle error conditions .
Always checking return values for success is a plague and easily forgotten .
Since traditional exceptions can be poisonous for implicit parallelism , we needed a solution that combined the best of both worlds : not killing everything at once , and still not losing any information .

It is a groundbreaking book that transforms the debate about global warming by offering a fresh perspective based on human needs as well as environmental concerns .
Rather than starting with the most radical procedures , Lomborg argues that we should first focus our resources on more immediate concerns , such as fighting malaria and HIV / AIDS and assuring and maintaining a safe , fresh water supply - which can be addressed at a fraction of the cost and save millions of lives within our lifetime .
He asks why the debate over climate change has stifled rational dialogue and killed meaningful dissent .

Team Garmin - Slipstream will pursue Alberto Contador if the two - time Tour de France winner becomes available after the potential breakup of his team , Garmin - Slipstream sporting director Jonathan Vaughters said Sunday .
Vaughters spoke from Paris two hours after Contador won his second Tour in three years .
He is signed through 2010 , but his Team Astana ’s status remains in question .
Seven - time winner Lance Armstrong , Astana ’s third - place finisher who helped Contador win this Tour , announced he is leaving to join RadioShack ’s new team .
Joining him likely will be Astana ’s Levi Leipheimer , a potential Tour winner , and Astana director Johan Bruyneel , who directed Armstrong ’s seven wins .
Astana missed paychecks during the Giro d’Italia in May , nearly voiding Contador ’s contract until he was paid in June .
“ The game starts now , ” Vaughters said .
Signing the Spaniard would be massive for the Boulder - based cycling team , which placed two cyclists in the top eight of only its second Tour de France .
Contador , 26 , has proved he is the top cyclist in the world with two Tour wins and last year ’s victories in the Vuelta a España and the Giro .
It was widely reportedly before the Tour that Contador wanted out of Astana .
He was n’t happy with the missed paychecks or a perceived favoritism toward Armstrong .
Is his contract voided if Bruyneel leaves ?
What happens if Armstrong attracts current teammates to RadioShack and Astana folds ?
Does Contador become a free agent ?
“ We ’d be interested , ” Vaughters said .
“ But there are so many variables .
We ’ll have a better idea in 10 days or two weeks . ”
Contador and Vaughters are on good terms .
Vaughters , whose team has a training base in Spain , speaks Spanish and frequently talks to Contador .
The Tour champion ’s price will be expensive — and it went up after Sunday — but Vaughters thinks he can sell him on Garmin - Slipstream , which has proved better than any Spanish team in the Tour .
Christian Vande Velde finished fourth last year and despite a crash in the Giro , he still finished eighth and helped Bradley Wiggins to fourth .
“ I like Alberto a lot , ” Vaughters said .
“ He wants to win the Tour de France .
He ’d rather take a winning team over a big paycheck .
Our team is capable of propelling him to win the Tour de France . ”
As for his team ’s performance in France , Vaughters was overjoyed even though it failed in its goal to win a stage for sprinter Tyler Farrar , who could n’t overcome Mark Cavendish ’s six stage wins .
“ I ’m extremely satisfied , ” Vaughters said .
“ Now it ’s onward .
We have to win the thing .
It ’s just that Cavendish is the best sprinter the sport ’s seen in a long time .
He ’s the best sprinter I ’ve ever seen . ”

Facebook has successfully launched Facebook Usernames .
In 3 minutes , there were 200,000 usernames registered .
In 15 minutes , over half a million , and it is rising .
So what were the difficulties ?
How did they overcome issues ?
What is coming next ?
And most of all , how did the Facebook team celebrate the successful launch ?
There have been some amazing happenings here , and so we grabbed a Flip HD and recorded it .
In our first video , we spoke with Jared Morgenstern , Product Manager , and Guy Rom , Engineering Team Manager for the Commerce and Payment System .
They explain why they did n't use an auction system , the " nuclear option , " and more .
The second video is from the Facebook War Room itself .
Come see what 's been happening live at Facebook !

" You can raise the argument that intractability is relative .
You can boldly thrust forward Moore 's Law - like a child that 's made a macaroni bird in art class - but if you do , you 're not getting it .

Nice quote , but did he bargain on an infinitely fast CPU ?
ince the dawn of time , man has yearned to extract more CPU cycles from the calculating machine we call the ' computer ' .
And no wonder either ; faster speeds equate to more fun , greater productivity , and further scientific progress .
In a way , we 've been spoilt with our multi GHz CPUs .
Compared to 20 years ago , most tasks now are performed in the blink of an eye ...... But on the other hand , the reverse could be true .
Maybe we subconsciously expect infinite levels of speed , and detest the limits we have to endure .
Perhaps we loathe optimising and pandering to the whims of the CPU only to find that the running speed still is n't up to par .
For sure , there are many problems and tasks which require exponentially faster speeds than anything we have today .
And even our best algorithms do n't come close ( or ca n't ever come close ) to solving them .
And that 's what this article will address .
The potential that lies in an .
Not just one that is super humungously fast , but one which pops out the answer in O ( 0 ) each time , every time .
Finally , we'd be able to beat a 9th dan
Go player , and words such as " intractable " or " combinatorial explosion " would lose their sting .
Of course , truly infinite speed is as much a pipe dream as infinite free energy , and it 's true that we may reach a temporary upper limit to CPU power by 2020 .
But we always have the promise of multi-core and even quantum computing to help quench our thirst .
While truly infinite speed may be forever beyond our reach , these technologies may eventually help materialize at least some of what 's below .
And hence we present the top 20 ( well 17 ) applications that would benefit most from infinite speed ( or close enough ) , starting with the least desirable , and finishing with the dream application .

I made this delicious delight last summer , lost the photos on my gargantuan ( at the time ) hard drive , and never got to post it .
I made it a couple of days ago , did n’t take several crucial photos , and did n’t get to post it .
So I made another batch for you today .
I took one for the team .
It ’s the kinda gal I am .
This is a custard - based ice cream , which is the best kind of ice cream there is .
You ’ll need an ice cream maker ; mine ’s an old wooden one .
The kind you get at The Wal Marts .
But any ol’ ice cream maker will do .
You ’ll need 2 pints of blackberries .
Beautiful , dark , glorious blackberries !
5 eggs .
Lemon juice and half - and - half and heavy cream and sugar .
That ’s it !
THE BERRIES :
First thing we need to do is cook down the blackberries a bit .
Throw them into a medium saucepan over low to medium - low heat and squeeze in the juice of half a lemon .
Add in 1/4 cup sugar .
It ’ll keep ya honest .
Now cover the pan and cook for about 20 minutes , or until the liquid has cooked out of the berries and begun to thicken .
And when it ’s done …
Pour it into a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and allow the delicious purple liquid to drain .
Use the back of a spoon to extract as much liquid as you can .
This is liquid deliciousness .
THE MILK / SUGAR :
In a separate pan , combine 1 1 / 2 cups of half - and - half …
With 1 cup sugar .
Mix together , then warm up over low heat .
Now , in a separate bowl , pour 1 1/ 2 cups heavy ( whipping ) cream .
Cream .
Half and half .
I just love ice cream , do n’t you ?
THE EGGS :
Throw 5 egg yolks into a bowl .
You can either beat them by hand , or take the easy route like I do and use an electric mixer .
Beat ’em until they ’re light yellowish .
TEMPER THE EGG YOLKS :
Now , grab a little bit of the warm half - and - half / cream mixture and slowly drizzle it into the egg yolks …
… As you whisk the egg yolks constantly .
Repeat this with a little more of the half - and - half mixture .
NOW you can slowly drizzle the tempered egg yolks into the pan with the rest of the half - and - half ( whisk constantly ) without the egg yolks cooking .
Stir the mixture in the pan as it cooks over low to medium - low heat until it thickens into a loose custard .
Now , normally I ’d just strain the custard mixture right into the bowl with the heavy cream .
But since my other large mesh strainer was at the Lodge , I had to use this little shrimp of a strainer …and the pitcher of my blender !
Please do n’t let the blender throw you .
It really has nothing to do with this recipe .
When it ’s all strained , pour the custard into the bowl with the heavy cream .
Stir together until the mixture is totally combined .
Now you can pour the blackberry juice / puree into the cream mixture .
Get ready .
You ’re gonna love this next part .
Yummy …
Yummy …
Purple !
Now , if you have the time you can refrigerate this for a couple of hours to chill it .
But I want to hurry the process along .
So I throw some ice into my little sink .
You can use a separate bowl , too .
Then just stir it occasionally over a period of ten minutes or so to speed - chill it !
I ’m very impatient in the kitchen .
When it ’s thoroughly chilled , pour it into the bucket of your ice maker .
I like these old fashioned numbers .
They remind me of 1974 for some reason .
Not 1975 , mind you .
1974 .
Now you just layer ice …
With ice cream salt .
Then turn it on to churn …and walk away !
I ’ll be back in a bit to share the recipe … and show you the delicious results .
You ’re gonna want to see this .
UPDATE : I ’m adding in the final steps from Post # 2 :
When the ice cream maker stops , it ’s ready !
Now , if you simply can’t wait , go ahead and serve it up now … ” soft serve ” style !
Or , if you ’re brimming with self control , you can scrape it back into the bucket with a rubber spatula …
Smooth out the surface so it ’s nice and even , then cover tightly with the lid ( or plastic wrap ) , then stick it in the freezer to harden for at least an hour or two .
And then …
And then …
And OH …. then …
THIS is what you ’ll have .
This ice cream is SO creamy and smooth .
I ’ll be using the basic recipe tomorrow to make Peach Ice Cream , which is one of Pesky Tim ’s faves
This , my darling friends , is it .
The recipe of your Blackberry Ice Cream dreams .

Explorer Tree
Remember that movie ‘ Explorers ’ from 1985 ?
There was a scene when the children are testing their computer generated bubble device on a hillside , near an interesting looking tree .
In the scene the bubble forms around one of the boys and proceeds to take him on a harrowing journey underground and through the sky .
Anyway , this is the tree from that scene .

The first mass antiracist protest march of the week , organised by anarchists , clash with strong riot police forces and a handful of collaborating nazis leading to long street battles around the coveted Agios Panteleimonas area .
On Tuesday 7/7 the first antiracist protest march of a week filled with marches against the government 's anti-immigration policy and its sponsoring of nazi vigilantes took place in Athens .
The protest march was organised by anarchists and attended by 3000 people or around , taking the route from Omonoia square to the coveted square of Agios Panteleimonas where the police and its fascist collaborators have been running a pilot apartheid counterinsurgency programme since the beginning of the year .
Fascists with the protection of the police and active contribution of retired army officers have unleashed a pogrom against immigrants in the area , beating and knifing anyone who dares visit the square , while even threatening the local priest for offering free food to the homeless .
In a stunt to legalise their racist bigotry , the nazis have formed a ' local committee ' with the bourgeois media giving their full support .
The protest march proceeded to the square of Agios Panteleimonas chanting antiracist and antifascist slogans like " Cops , TV , Neonazis - all the scum work together " and " The people do n't forget , they hang the fascists " .
Upon reaching the square through a street too narrow for the size of the demo , the head of the march was attacked without the slightest provocation by riot police forces who were supposedly protecting the 30 ' local committee ' members that had gathered in the square .
These ' patriotic citizens ' lost no time to deploy their usual tactic and launch an attack through police lines , with flares and even molotov cocktails .
Unfortunately for the agents of the parastate , one of the molotov cocktails landed on the bald head of their attacking friends , leading the nazi to seek protection from the police which obliged .
After defending the protest march with use of stones and sticks , the protest march reversed , broke through police lines and proceeded to the Athens School of Economics where the battles continued late into the night with flaming barricades erected along Patision street .
At the same time another antiracist protest march against the government 's anti-immigration policy and support of the nazis took place in Salonica .
The march which was attended by more than 1000 people ended with small damages against distinguished banks of the city .
Earlier the same day a group called Antifascist Attack Cells took responsibility for an arson mechanism attack against the home of a leader of the neonazi party Golden Dawn who is serving as a policeman in Salonica .
“ It ’s the same everywhere , ” he said .
On a Friday in January , 6 of 20 patients in the women ’s ward were recovering from attempted abortions .
One , a 25 - year - old schoolteacher , lay in bed moaning and writhing .
She had been treated at the hospital a week earlier for an incomplete abortion and now was back , bleeding and in severe pain .
She was taken to the operating room once again and anesthetized , and Emmanuel Makanza , who had treated her the first time , discovered that he had failed to remove all the membranes formed during the pregnancy .
Once again , he scraped the inside of her womb with a curet , a metal instrument .
It was a vigorous , bloody procedure .
This time , he said , it was complete .
Mr. Makanza is an assistant medical officer , not a fully trained physician .
Assistant medical officers have education similar to that of physician assistants in the United States , but with additional training in surgery .
They are Tanzania ’s solution to a severe shortage of doctors , and they perform many basic operations , like Caesareans and appendectomies .
The hospital in Berega has two .
Abortions in Berega come in seasonal waves  March and April , August and September  in sync with planting and harvests , when a lot of socializing goes on , Dr. Mdoe said .
He said rumor had it that many abortions were done by a man in Gairo , a town west of Berega .
In some cases , he said , the abortionist only started the procedure , knowing that doctors would have to finish the job .
Dr. Mdoe said he suspected that some of the other illegal abortionists were hospital workers with delusions of surgical skill .
“ They just poke , poke , poke , ” he said .
“ And then the woman has to come here . ”
Sometimes the doctors find fragments of sticks left inside the uterus , an invitation to sepsis .
In the past some hospitals threatened to withhold care until a woman identified the abortionist ( performing abortions can bring a 14 - year prison term ) , but that practice was abandoned in favor of simply providing postabortal treatment .
Still , women do not want to discuss what happened or even admit that they had anything other than a miscarriage , because in theory they can be prosecuted for having abortions .
The law calls for seven years in prison for the woman .
So doctors generally do not ask questions .
“ They are supposed to be arrested , ” Dr. Mdoe said .
“ Our work as physicians is just to help and make sure they get healed . ”
Trivia
Over dinner one night , Sir Alfred Hitchcock related to Ernest Lehman his giddy enthusiasm for what this movie is really about .
He said , " Ernie , do you realize what we 're doing in this picture ?
The audience is like a giant organ that you and I are playing .
At one moment , we play this note on them and get this reaction , and then we play that chord and they react that way , and someday we wo n't even have to make a movie , there 'll be electrodes implanted in their brains , and we 'll just press different buttons and they 'll go ' ooooh ' and ' aaaah ' ' and we 'll frighten them , and make them laugh .
Wo n't that be wonderful ? "

The president of the Southern Poverty Law Center , J. Richard Cohen wrote a letter to CNN president Jonathon Klein calling for Lou Dobbs to be taken of the air for spreading racist conspiracy theories about Barack Obama ’s birth certificate .
Cohen wrote , “ Respectable news organizations should not employ reporters willing to peddle racist conspiracy theories and false propaganda . ”
Cohen began his letter , “ As an important and respected news organization , CNN has a special responsibility to ensure the accuracy of its reporting .
We have written to you before about our concern that Lou Dobbs repeatedly fails to live up to this standard in his reporting on immigration .
Now , Mr. Dobbs is again trading in falsehoods and racist conspiracy theories , questioning President Obama ’s American citizenship . ”
Over the past couple of weeks Dobbs has slipped into full birther mode :
Advertisements
Cohen pointed out that the birther conspiracy originated on the radical racial right , “ As he has in several other instances , Mr. Dobbs , in taking up the birthers ’ claims , is adopting an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that originated on the radical racist right .
As Gawker.com has reported , this particular conspiracy theory was first developed by an open anti-Semite and circulated by right - wing extremists who cannot accept the fact that a black man has been elected president of the United States .
Among its adherents was neo -Nazi James von Brunn , the alleged murderer of a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , D.C. , this June .
Von Brunn had helped spread the birthers ’ claims on the Internet and attacked the “ dishonest & conspiratorial Media ” for not taking them up . ”
He also noted that this is n’t the first time that Dobbs has advanced racial conspiracy theories on his show , “ This is not the first time Mr. Dobbs has pushed racist conspiracy theories or defamatory falsehoods about immigrants .
We wrote you in 2007 to bring to your attention his utterly false claim that 7,000 new cases of leprosy had appeared in the United States in a recent three - year period , due at least in part to immigrants .
( The real number , according to official statistics , was about 400 .
Mr. Dobbs took his spurious information from the late right - wing extremist , Madeleine Cosman . ) … ”
Cohen concluded with a call for CNN to take Dobbs off the air , “ He has falsely claimed that “ illegal aliens ” fill one third of American prison and jail cells .
And Mr. Dobbs has routinely disparaged , on CNN ’s air , those who have had the integrity to point out the falsity of these and similar claims .
Respectable news organizations should not employ reporters willing to peddle racist conspiracy theories and false propaganda .
It ’s time for CNN to remove Mr. Dobbs from the airwaves . ”
CNN definitely has a Lou Dobbs problem .
However , the network seems willing to hang on to him .
CNN pointed out that it has nothing to with Dobbs ’ radio show , and as a spokesperson told , TVNewser , “ On CNN , Lou is an independent reporter who covers stories that people are talking about , and often showcases issues that are n’t being covered by the mainstream media . ”
I do n’t know how much credibility Lou Dobbs had left before he went birther , so I ca n’t imagine him damaging CNN more than he already has with his nightly anti-immigration rants .
CNN is a struggling network that might view any ratings as good ratings , no matter where they come from .
Dobbs does n’t win his time slot , but he does n’t finish near the bottom of the ratings either , like CNN ’s prime time lineup .
It is a just a guess , but Dobbs is n’t going anywhere .
The SPLC made a great argument , but this is n’t about journalistic integrity .
It is about ratings and money , and CNN , like almost all television news networks is always looking for more of both .
Want to know what video applications the Canon 5D MK2 DSLR is suited for ?
Watch this video by Danfung Dennis , a photographer who recently started shooting video in the field .
Not only is it perfectly edited and produced , it shows the incredible strengths of this DSLR with video .
You ’ll find the video and technical details below …
Afghan Hearts and Minds from Danfung Dennis on Vimeo .
I spoke with Danfung , and he provided the following details :
The bank defrauded traders , farmers and its own landlord
Scammers have targeted a town on the Uganda - Kenya border with an elaborate fraud - setting up a fake bank and taking deposits , before fleeing .
The bank opened an office in Malaba town , advertised on radio and took $ 100,000 in deposits over two months .
But when investors turned up to reclaim their money , all they found was a note saying : " Sorry the bank operations have been moved to a new place . "
The scammers had paid for food , rent and advertising with fake cheques .
Richard Ojore , the landlord of the building where the fraudsters set up shop , said he had believed they were " genuine people " .
" We signed an agreement , and they even issued me a cheque for the duration of a year , " he told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
" That 's when I went to the bank and presented the cheque for confirmation .
The bankers confirmed to me that the thing is a fake .
" By the time I reported back to Malaba , they had already fled . "
The BBC's Abraham Odeke in Malaba says crowds of people gathered outside the bank 's offices as the story spread .
He says most of them are retail traders and the small - scale farmers from the villages surrounding Malaba .
But he says all that is left inside the office of Visa Finance Bank are empty chairs - the cashiers , fans and even the carpets have all gone .
Grown on the south - facing slopes of Mont Ventoux , the 2003 Murmurium Carpe Diem is an exciting Syrah / Grenache blend from Côtes - Du-Ventoux , a wine growing appellation in southeastern Rhône .
The dry , limestone - rich soil and extremely low - yielding vines of Côtes - Du-Ventoux , consistently produce easy drinking , early maturing , fruit - forward red wines with distinctive flavor profiles of spicy black fruit .
Carpe Diem ’s nose heavily displays this region ’s characteristically spicy properties , along with rich blackberry , black - cherry and rhubarb .
Light accents of vanilla , wet cardboard , lead pencil , and cool mineral notes contribute to the nice complexity of this vibrant , young wine .
The spice box and black pepper strongholds on the nose slacken nicely in the mouth .
A spirited dryness , combined with a smooth juicy textural mouth - feel , allow Carpe Diem to play a much more elegant hand than the price tag would have you expect .

We always intended to give the contributed content back to the community as a whole .
Our primary concern was making sure we did n’t have an AOL - style “ incident ” where we accidentally release personally identifying information in so - called “ sanitized ” data .
Stack Overflow user Greg Hewgill was kind enough to help us beta test several iterations of the data dump , ensuring that we did n’t release anything except content that is visible on the public website .
He also suggested several improvements to improve the data dump , so that it contains as much useful public information as possible .
Cheers , Greg !
Also , thanks to Stack Overflow Valued Associate # 00003 , Geoff Dalgas , who patiently worked through many iterations of this to get it together on our end .
All public Stack Exchange sites are now included in the data dump : including Stack Overflow , Server Fault , Super User , and so on .
Note that if you republish this data , we require attribution as described in this blog post .
Most importantly , there should be hyperlinks back to the original question , and the profiles of all participants .
Our plan is to create a new data dump every two months , reflecting all data in the system up to that date .
We will seed the latest and greatest dump ( at a low bitrate ) as long as we can , ideally permanently .
And yes , it ’s still fun to say “ data dump ” .
We look forward to seeing what the community can do with this data !
update : per this message from Cameron Parkins of Creative Commons , cc - wiki is now an alias for cc - by - sa .
Hi Stack Overflow -ers ,
My name is Cameron Parkins – I do community outreach at Creative Commons and recently stumbled across your latest CC data dump .
Very cool that you all are using CC !
I wanted to give you a heads up that the license you ’ve chosen , the “ CC Wiki - License ” , is n’t really around any more .
It is in the sense that it links directly to our CC BY - SA license , but our attempt to brand it as a separate license for wikis never got off the ground .
We do n’t use or promote it anymore and when we see it , we try and reach out to whoever is using it to let them know .
Part of the problem is that the Wiki License does n’t carry any value , while our BY - SA license ( which is what the wiki license is ) has widespread community support around it .
Would you all consider switching your indication as such ?
Let me know if you have any questions – would like to promote the project through our networks .
Best ,
C —

The CN Tower - it 's Toronto 's most iconic and unavoidable building .
Ever since its completion in 1976 , the Tower has not only dominated the city 's skyline , but at just over 553 metres , it 's been a ubiquitous presence in general .
And with this in mind , I 've often wondered what the city might look like without it .
In fact , it was a tragedy that got me dwelling on this hypothetical scenario .
After a 2002 visit to the former World Trade Center site in New York City , I could n't help but imagine what the loss of the CN Tower would mean to my city 's physical and psychological landscape .
With a brief exception when the so - called Toronto 18 were alleged to have plotted to take down the Tower , these ominous thoughts eventually faded from mind .
And yet , every time I would take a photograph that included the CN Tower , it would again spark a curiosity about what the city would look like in its absence .
So , after becoming relatively proficient with the digital manipulation of photographs , I decided to go ahead and remove the Tower from a few .
Liking what I saw , I proceeded to do a more extended series , of which these are some of my favourites .
All of the photographs here depict a scene of the city in which the Tower is included in so - called real life .
I once heard that the 19th century French writer Guy de Maupassant hated the Eiffel Tower so much that he ate his lunch there everyday so as not to have to see it .
Personally I 've always been ambivalent about Toronto 's most famous landmark .
Sometimes I think it 's quite cool , and at others , I think its vaguely ' futuristic ' appearance is annoying to have to look at everyday .
Perhaps more than anything , these images were a way of asking a question about my photographic relationship to the city .
I 've often felt limited when continually shooting Toronto , thinking there 's little left for me to contribute to the wealth of images others have shot .
And , to a great extent , these images were originally quite clichĂŠd and even touristy .
But , post - manipulation , they depict an imaginary Toronto that is surprisingly unfamiliar to me .
Indeed , I 've even returned to a few of them long after the removal process to find that I can't exactly place where the Tower was located .
One of the reasons for this is that I 've done my best to capture the city from a variety of perspectives and angles , which seems to make it more difficult to ' re - place ' the Tower .
A CN Tower - less Toronto is strange and a far more anonymous place .
Take , for instance the image of the construction of condos southeast of Bathurst and Front : I often think this one makes the city look like one of the many Asian cities undergoing rapid expansion .
But , of course , after a longer look the other landmarks give it away .
There is much debate about the manipulation of photographs .
Just last week a photo essay in the New York Times Magazine by Edgar Martins was cause for great controversy when it was discovered that his photos featured a number of alterations .
Well , this is n't that .
I make no bones about the presence of the manipulations and have little doubt that a really trained eye could see evidence of my tinkering .
But the wonderful thing about new photo technology is that , in a case like this , it can allow for the imagination of strange and compelling scenarios , which make no claim to be ' real . '
At a minimum , the depiction of this simulated Toronto has enabled me to look at my city with a fresh set of eyes .
For a look at the photos prior to the removal of the CN Tower , check out my Flickr slideshow .

Optimism about our future is compulsory .
It is politically incorrect to profess anything else .
No matter what problems we face - ecological overshoot , global warming , energy decline , overpopulation - we must nevertheless be optimistic and hopeful that we will find solutions .
People who do not believe that we will overcome our difficulties and continue ever upwards on a path of continuing economic growth and progress are " doomers " .
They spruik " doomer porn " .
They utter their nonsense because they hate the human race .
If we fail and fall it will be their fault for being so pessimistic !
They are undermining our resolve and ability to respond .
Human ingenuity can always find a way if we only believe it !
I like to think of myself as a scientist ( but that is always for others to judge ) .
For a scientist the principal we hold most dear is objectivity .
We must try to interpret data without superimposing our own beliefs , values or desires upon it .
Even when it tells us what we do not want to believe .
Even when the data make us sick to the pits of our stomachs with terror .
I am pessimistic about the future because I have seen and understood the data on resources .
I know that oil production peaked in July 2008 .
( I have seen the unpublished reanalysis of the International Energy Agency ’s own 2008 report that shows this conclusively . )
I know that our use of other resources - such as water and phosphate - is critically unsustainable .
Now that energy is declining there will not be enough to invest in building the alternative energy future that many of us dream of .
Advertisement
The nature of our economic / political system means that the declining fossil energy supply will go to the shorter term priorities of growing food , supporting armies and maintaining ( as far as possible ) the comfortable lifestyles of an ever - contracting circle of the wealthy .
The time needed to build any form of alternative energy infrastructure - and the scale of the expansion needed in the face of the current and worsening energy decline - mean that it will simply never happen .
If I am so pessimistic , why do I bother writing about it ?
What good does it do ?
As a scientist I know that you must understand a problem in order to solve it .
To have any chance of coping with this developing disaster we need to see it for what it truly is - not pretend that it does not exist ( for example , the population problem ) or that it will never happen ( for example , peak oil ) .
If we do not understand the true nature of the problem the " solutions " we attempt may make the problem worse .
Like supporting future population growth through more efficient use of resources .
Or growing biofuels on marginal land without considering how you will replace the soil nutrients they deplete .
Or planning to electrify of the car fleet without considering the load that will place on an overstretched grid or where the energy and materials will come from to maintain the road network it requires .
If we objectively understand our true situation and what , feasibly , we can do about it then we can take appropriate action and not waste our precious remaining fossil energy on optimistic - but ultimately futile - " solutions " .
We will not end up where we want to be ( there will be no return to the peak of the oil age and the extravagant technologies it supported ) but we may avoid falling the entire distance to the brutal bottom of the energy curve that awaits .
" Optimism " is the problem , not the solution .
We use it as an excuse to avoid thinking about the desperate measures we must take to cope with what is coming .
We use it to put off actually doing anything .
As long as Dr X , CEO Y or Minister Z says , " I ’m optimistic that we will develop new energy sources " then we can go back to sleep because someone is obviously taking care of the problem - are n’t they ?
When Einstein and Szilárd wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II warning about German interest in uranium and nuclear fission ( the letter that ultimately spawned the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb ) they did not do it because they felt , " optimistic " about the future .
They were shit scared the Germans would develop nuclear weapons first !
Winston Churchill did not rally the British saying , " I ’m optimistic we will develop new solutions to the Nazi problem " .
Rather , he declared , " I have nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears and sweat …
It is victory , victory at all costs , … however long and hard the road may be ; for without victory , there is no survival " .
Today we are often told we need a new " Manhattan Project " for alternative energy but we will never make the sacrifices necessary for this in our already worsening economic situation if we are not truly , deeply fearful of the consequences of failure .
Only fear - not optimism - can motivate populations sufficiently when they are already struggling with rising food prices , falling incomes and unemployment .

Tragically , our sensationalist media also know that fear grabs people ’s attention .
Our collective crisis fatigue is now so great that we ignore truly significant threats such as climate change and energy decline .
Our anxiety is diverted into worrying whether it ’s safe for our children to step outside the 4WD ( SUV ) .
But soon we will be worrying if we can find or afford to put food in their mouths .
Declining oil and water supplies , climate change and increasing population numbers are undermining Australia ’s food security .
We who formerly prided ourselves on our ability to feed other nations have now become a net importer of fruit and vegetables .
Statistical stupidity by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics ( ABARE ) has led us to believe we export 80 per cent of our agricultural production .
However , as Mark McGovern of the Queensland University of Technology has shown , in fact we export less than 30 per cent .
This may not sound like much of a difference but it means that instead of producing 400 per cent more food than we ourselves consume it is less than 40 per cent !
What will we do as energy decline , water shortages and climate change drastically cut our food production - or as our current record population growth rate doubles Australia ’s population within 37 years - or both !
As other nations struggle to feed themselves , who will feed us ?
My grandmother was a refugee during World War II in Europe .
She would skip her meagre rations to give her toddler daughter ( my mother ) more to eat .
Unlike most Australians , she knew real hunger !
Australia needs a " Manhattan Project " for local , sustainable food production .
But it will take unaffordable staples , empty shelves at the supermarkets and empty middle - class stomachs before we wake up to our food insecurity .
Optimism will not put food on the table as oil , water and fertiliser dwindle .
I ’m shit scared of the future and what it means for my two children .
How about you ?
If you are looking to accept credit cards for your online store , you are probably considering one of the big three , Paypal , Authorize.net and Stripe .
But the problem with choosing between these payment options is that all 3 services look similar on the surface .
One , they all offer the same introductory rates with a transaction fee of 2.9 % + $ .30 .
And two , they all claim to provide a “ robust integration with leading shopping cart providers ” for all sized businesses .
In fact , if you look at the sales pages for all 3 services , they all read pretty much the same with the exception that Stripe does n’t charge a monthly fee .
But here ’s the thing .
Once your store has some decent transaction volume , the transaction rates change dramatically and none of these rates are documented anywhere .
In fact , you often have to negotiate the rates yourself .
To further muddy the waters , services like Paypal often have multiple options to choose from which all behave differently .
So today , I ’m going to explain in plain language what sets these 3 payment processors apart from each other .
In addition , I ’ll tell you what rates that I ’ve been able to negotiate with each of these services and where the cut off points are .

The Difference Between Paypal Standard , Paypal Checkout , Paypal Advanced And Paypal Payments Pro
Right now , Paypal now offers 4 different choices to accept credit cards on your site .
Paypal Standard – Free for all merchants
– Free for all merchants Paypal Checkout – Free for all merchants
– Free for all merchants Paypal Advanced – $ 5/ month
– $ 5 / month Paypal Payments Pro – $ 30 / month
Unfortunately , it ’s not very intuitive which one you should choose and what the advantages are for each .
Therefore , I ’m going to start by summarizing Paypal ’s 4 offerings below .
Paypal Standard
Paypal standard is completely free of charge and allows you to accept both credit cards and Paypal with your online store .
However , there are 2 main disadvantages with Paypal Standard .
For one thing , Paypal Standard does not allow a customer to complete checkout on your website .
Instead a customer is whisked away to Paypal ’s site where they will be heavily influenced to create a Paypal account to pay for their goods .
Because a customer must leave your website , a high rate of customers will abandon their purchase altogether .
And to make things worse , Paypal does not make it obvious how to pay by credit card once you make it onto their site .
The picture above shows what a customer sees when they checkout using Paypal Standard .
As you can tell , it ’s not obvious how to pay by credit card .
You have to click on the “ Do n’t have a PayPal account ” button in order to be directed to a form where you can enter your credit card info .
Overall , I guarantee that you ’ll shed many potential customers this way .
As a result , Paypal Standard is not a good credit card solution for an ecommerce store .
The only advantage is that it ’s free .
Paypal Checkout
Paypal Checkout is also completely free of charge and allows a customer to pay by credit card and Paypal .
In fact , it is more or less identical to Paypal Standard except for one very important feature .
Paypal Checkout allows you to import a customer ’s information directly into your shopping cart so they do n’t have to fill out any forms .
Here ’s what the flow looks like .
A customer is presented with the option to pay by Paypal Checkout .
When they click on the Paypal button , they are whisked off to Paypal ’s website .
Just like Paypal Standard , the option to pay by credit card is not very prominent .
If a customer has a Paypal account , all of their address information on file at Paypal is magically imported into your shopping cart .
They also have the option to store a cookie on their browser via Paypal One Touch so they never have to login to pay by Paypal again .
The following photo illustrates the Paypal Checkout flow on my online store after a customer logs in .
As you can see , the customer is just one click away from completing their purchase and no forms need to be filled out .
In fact , this is the primary advantage of Paypal Checkout and it makes Paypal Standard obsolete .
Paypal Payments Pro
On the other end of the spectrum , Paypal also offers a high end payment product called Payments Pro .
With the pro version of Paypal , you can process credit cards directly on your site .
In addition , you have access to a virtual terminal in which you can process phone orders as well .
Paypal Pro costs $ 30 per month and offers a complete solution to all of your credit card processing needs .
However the one big drawback is that since you are accepting credit cards on your own server , you must deal with PCI compliance .
What is PCI compliance ?
PCI compliance is a set of standards enacted by the credit card community to ensure that all credit card transactions are secure .
In order for your online store to be PCI compliant , you must follow a set of guidelines in order to process credit cards on your website or face fines or penalties set forth by your credit card processor .
Honestly , becoming PCI compliant is not that big of a deal but the language used in the PCI compliance documentation is a nightmare to read and go through .
In fact , it ’s like reading a law document .
As a result , many new entrepreneurs are often confused and scared off by the whole process .
But nonetheless , if you use Paypal Pro on your online store , the payment transaction is seamless .
As you can see above , credit card processing is well blended with my website .
To a customer , it appears as if everything is being processed natively in my shop .
Paypal Advanced
Paypal Advanced is a hybrid solution between Paypal Payments Pro and Paypal Standard / Checkout .
Like Paypal Payments
Pro , a customer can process their credit card payment online without leaving your website .
But unlike Paypal Payments
Pro , the credit card information is not processed on your server but on Paypal ’s instead .
As a result with Paypal Advanced , you do n’t have to worry about PCI compliance .
So how does it work ?
How can a customer still be on your website but not use your server to process and transmit their payment ?
The answer is that Paypal Advanced uses iframes to process the payment .
If you are not technical , an iframe is basically a piece of your website that is hosted somewhere else .
So when a customer is checking out from your online store , everything on your webpage will be hosted on your own website except for the credit card form fields .
Below is a screen shot of what the credit card form looks like as hosted on PayPal ’s servers .
Everything you see in the box above can not be changed .
However with some amount of work , you can often blend the box in with the rest of your website .
Paypal Advanced is not advertised by Paypal much at all and most people do n’t know about it .
But it costs just $ 5 per month .
Pros And Cons Of Paypal Advanced Vs Paypal Payments Pro Vs Paypal Checkout
Because a customer is taken off of your site , Paypal Checkout and Paypal Standard are not good solutions for accepting credit cards online .
As a result , your decision comes down to Paypal Pro or Paypal Advanced , both of which carry a monthly fee of $ 30 and $ 5 respectively .
But does it make sense to pay $ 30 / month for Paypal Payments Pro when Paypal Advanced is only $ 5 ?
Here are some of the disadvantages of Paypal Advanced compared to Paypal Payments Pro .
You can not customize the way the credit card form looks on your site .
Because the credit card fields are hosted on Paypal ’s servers , you pretty much have to tailor your checkout page around their credit card form to make it look good
Because the credit card fields are hosted on Paypal ’s servers , you pretty much have to tailor your checkout page around their credit card form to make it look good
You do not have access to a virtual terminal – A virtual terminal allows you to process a credit card payment by hand which is useful when you take orders over the phone or when you have to conduct a special transaction
The biggest advantage of Paypal Advanced is the cost , the fact that you do n’t have to worry about PCI compliance and the ability to process credit cards directly on your store without the customer having to leave your website .
Authorize .
Net
Authorize.net is the traditional , old school credit card gateway solution that ’s been around for decades .
If you try to sign up for Authorize .net , you ’ll find that there are many different vendors that will quote you wildly different rates .
In fact , it ’s like shopping for insurance .
You have to find a provider that you like and then negotiate rates down based on your volume .
If you are a brand new store , you ’ll likely end up paying $ 30 / month with a rate of 2.9 % .
However once you achieve some decent transaction volume , you can push your rates down dramatically to a fixed rate above interchange .
This transaction rate is otherwise known as Interchange Plus .
What is Interchange Plus ?
The Interchange rate is the cost that your merchant account provider gets charged by VISA and MasterCard .
Interchange Plus means that your merchant account provider will pass through whatever they are getting charged by the interchange plus a markup for their services .
This mark - up is charged on a per transaction basis as well as a percentage fee .
As a result , the Interchange Plus transaction rate tends to be much more steady and is in general lower than anything you can get with Paypal and Stripe .
Stripe
Stripe is probably the cheapest and easiest way to get started with your ecommerce store .
It is supported by practically every ecommerce platform out there and it carries no monthly fee .
Not only that but you can often get approved in a matter minutes and start processing credit cards immediately !
The major downside to Stripe is that their rates are pretty much non-negotiable until you can consistently process at least $ 80 K / month .
And even once you do achieve those levels , the negotiated rates are often on the order of 2.3 % which is still higher than what you can get with Paypal and Authorize .
net .
If You Process More Than 50 K / Month – The Cheapest Solution Is …
First off , Stripe is never going to be the best deal unless you process a very low volume of $ $$ per month .
As a result , your best payment processing choice will be either Paypal Advanced , Paypal Pro or Authorize.net .
A typical Authorize.net merchant account and gateway will run you between 20 - 30 dollars a month .
But the big advantage is that Authorize .
net will give you a super low transaction rate .
For example , eMerchant , an Authorize .
net credit card processor that I recommend , will allow you to process credit cards at a flat rate above interchange once you exceed $ 10 k / month .
The exact rate depends on your volume but if you process over $ 50 K / month , you can expect to pay anywhere between 2.0 - 2.3 % on average in transaction fees for Visa and Mastercard .
The rates for accepting American Express are on the order of 2.5 % .
Debit cards are the lowest at around .5 % .
The reason the rate is a range and not a fixed number is because different rewards cards get charged different rates on the interchange .
( The exact reason why is beyond the scope of this post )
As for Paypal , your credit card processing rate at $ 50 K / month would be a fixed 2.2 % for Visa / Mastercard and 3.5 % for American Express .
Let ’s do some math shall we ?
e Merchant charges a $ 30 monthly fee and let ’s assume that you can get an average rate of 2.15 % for Visa / Mastercard payments .
Paypal Advanced costs $ 5 / month and the difference in monthly cost compared to eMerchant is $ 25 .
Because the credit card processing rate differential is .05 % , the breakeven point between Paypal Advanced and eMerchant is $ 50,000 / month .
As a result , eMerchant will be cheaper than Paypal Advanced ( and Paypal Pro ) at volumes greater than $ 50,000 / month .
However , there are some other factors to consider .
With Authorize.net , you have to get your server scanned on a quarterly basis for PCI compliance .
Even though these scans are free , it ’s still something extra that you ’ll have to deal with .
If you accept a lot of American Express payments , Authorize .net will almost always be cheaper .
The same goes with Visa / Mastercard debit cards .
While Paypal still charges 2.2 % for a debit card , you will only pay .5 % with Authorize.net .
If You Process Between 10 K And 50 K / Month – The Cheapest Solution Is …
At this volume Stripe is still going to be the most expensive solution since you ca n’t negotiate rates .
As a result , your cheapest solution is either Paypal Advanced / Pro or Authorize.net .
However in the 10 - 50 K / month processing range , the waters are a little murkier because it depends on your ability to negotiate .
Anecdotally , you can negotiate with Paypal on their credit card rates down to 2.2 % as soon as you process over 10 K / month .
Note :
You can never negotiate with Paypal on Paypal processing rates .
Only their credit card processing rates are negotiable .
Unfortunately , Paypal payments are always a fixed 2.9 % regardless of volume .
However with Authorize.net , it ’s not as clear cut what you can get .
At this volume , I ’ve seen quotes from Authorize .
net in the range of .4-.6 % above interchange which works out to about 2.3%- 2.5 % .
Your mileage will vary but it implies that Paypal Advanced and Paypal Pro will be cheaper at this volume .
On the other hand , using Paypal has some major drawbacks which I outline in my article below .
Why Paypal Freezes Or Limits Accounts And How To Prevent This From Happening To You
But overall , both Paypal Advanced and Paypal Pro are great options once you process more than $ 10 K / month .
If You Process Less Than 10 K / Month – The Cheapest Solution Is …
At credit card processing volumes below 10 K / month , your costs will be dominated largely by the fixed monthly processing fee .
And because Stripe carries no monthly fees whatsoever , they will tend to be the cheapest .
As a result if you are a brand new ecommerce store , going with Stripe as your primary payment processor is a no brainer .
However , the waters get a little murkier once you start doing around $ 7500ish / month .
With Authorize.net and Paypal , you can sometimes negotiate the rates down to 2.5 % after you exceed $ 5 k in volume .
Now if you do the math , your break even point equation is simply ( your monthly fee ) / ( 2.9 % - 2.5 % )
With Paypal Advanced , your break even point is 5/.004 = $ 1250
With Paypal Pro and Authorize.net ( assuming a $ 30 monthly fee ) , your break even point is 30/.004 = $ 7500
Once again , your exact savings depends on your ability to negotiate rates down but Stripe is almost always cheaper if you process below $ 5 / month and remains a good solution up to $ 10 K / month .
Summing It All Up
When it comes to getting the best rate for credit card processing , it depends on your sales volume and your ability to negotiate .
But whatever you do , do n’t sit there idly and pay a higher rate out of laziness .
Get on the phone and demand a lower rate !
After all , you ca n’t save money unless you ask .
In general , Stripe is the best credit card processor for new online stores because it ’s 100 % free with zero monthly fees .
But after a certain threshold , both Paypal Advanced , Paypal Pro and Authorize .net become much more economical solutions .
If you are doing high volumes of sales ( > $ 50 K ) , going with Authorize .
net will almost always be your cheapest solution .
But anything under that volume depends on your ability to find a good deal .
Good luck !

A rogue Internet Service Provider that recruits , knowingly hosts , and actively participates in the distribution of spam , child pornography , and other harmful electronic content has been shut down by a district court judge at the request of the Federal Trade Commission .
The ISP ’s upstream providers and data centers have disconnected its servers from the Internet .
According to the FTC , the defendant , Pricewert LLC , which does business under a variety of names including 3FN and APS Telecom , actively recruits and colludes with criminals seeking to distribute illegal , malicious , and harmful electronic content including child pornography , spyware , viruses , trojan horses , phishing , botnet command and control servers , and pornography featuring violence , bestiality , and incest .
The FTC alleges that the defendant advertised its services in the darkest corners of the Internet , including a forum established to facilitate communication between criminals .
The complaint alleges that Pricewert actively shielded its criminal clientele by either ignoring take - down requests issued by the online security community , or shifting its criminal elements to other Internet protocol addresses it controlled to evade detection .
The FTC also alleges that the defendant engaged in the deployment and operation of botnets – large networks of computers that have been compromised and enslaved by the originator of the botnet , known as a “ bot herder . ”
Botnets can be used for a variety of illicit purposes , including sending spam and launching denial of service attacks .
According to the FTC , the defendant recruited bot herders and hosted the command - and - control servers – the computers that relay commands from the bot herders to the compromised computers known as “ zombie drones . ”
Transcripts of instant - message logs filed with the district court show the defendants ’ senior employees discussing the configuration of botnets with bot herders .
And , in filings with the district court , the FTC alleges that more than 4,500 malicious software programs are controlled by command - and - control servers hosted by 3FN .
This malware includes programs capable of keystroke logging , password stealing , and data stealing , programs with hidden backdoor remote control activity , and programs involved in spam distribution .
The FTC charged that the defendants ’ distribution of illegal , malicious , and harmful content and deployment of botnets that compromised thousands of computers caused substantial consumer injury and was an unfair practice , in violation of federal law .
The court issued a temporary restraining order to prohibit Pricewert ’s illegal activities and require its upstream Internet providers and data centers to cease providing services to Pricewert .
The order also freezes Pricewert ’s assets .
The court will hold a preliminary injunction hearing on June 15 , 2009 .
This case was brought with the invaluable assistance of NASA ’s Office of Inspector General , Computer Crime Division ; Gary Warner , Director of Research in Computer Forensics , University of Alabama at Birmingham ; The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ; The Shadowserver Foundation ; Symantec Corporation ; and The Spamhaus Project .
The Commission vote to authorize staff to file the complaint was 4 - 0 .
The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California , San Jose Division .
NOTE : The Commission files a complaint when it has “ reason to believe ” that the law has been or is being violated , and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest .
The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has actually violated the law .
The case will be decided by the court .
The Federal Trade Commission works for consumers to prevent fraudulent , deceptive , and unfair business practices and to provide information to help spot , stop , and avoid them .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - The Revolutionary Guards said on Saturday that Iran would strike Israel ’s nuclear facilities if the Jewish state attacked it , state television reported .
Mohammad Ali Jafari , new commander of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , salutes next to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during a ceremony to commemorate the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war in Tehran September 22 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Morteza Nikoubazl
“ If the Zionist Regime ( Israel ) attacks Iran , we will surely strike its nuclear facilities with our missile capabilities , ” Mohammad Ali Jafari , Guards commander - in- chief , told Iran ’s Arabic language al - Alam television .
The Revolutionary Guards are the ideologically driven wing of Iran ’s military with air , sea and land capabilities , and a separate command structure to regular units .
Iranian leaders often dismiss talk of a possible strike by Israel , saying it is not in a position to threaten Iran , the world ’s fifth - largest oil exporter .
They say Iran would respond to any attack by targeting U.S. interests and Israel .
“ We are not responsible for this regime and other enemies ’ foolishness ...
If they strike Iran , our answer will be firm and precise , ” state television quoted Jafari as saying .
The United States , Israel and their Western allies fear that Iran is enriching uranium with the aim of producing nuclear weapons and have not ruled out military action if diplomacy fails to resolve the row .
Iran says it is pursuing only a nuclear power generation program .
Israel , widely believed to be the Middle East ’s only nuclear power , has repeatedly described Iran ’s nuclear program as a threat to its existence .
Iran refuses to recognize Israel .
“ NOT SCARED ”
Jafari said Israel was entirely within the reach of Iran .
“ Our missile capability puts all of the Zionist regime ( Israel ) within Iran ’s reach to attack , ” Jafari said .
“ The Zionist regime is too small to threaten Iran . ”
Military experts say Iran rarely reveals enough detail about its new military equipment to determine its military capabilities .
Israel has so far quietly acceded to Washington ’s strategy of talking to Tehran about curtailing its sensitive nuclear work .
Israel believes that a multi- level missile shield underwritten by the United States would protect the country against possible missile attacks .
Jafari said such a shield could only protect Israel “ in a limited way . ”
“ But they will have no answer when Iran bombards them ( and ) sends a great number of its missiles , ” he added .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in May Iran had tested a missile that defense analysts say could hit Israel and U.S. bases in the Gulf .
Washington said the test was a “ step in the wrong direction ” to remove concerns over its nuclear work .
Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz , conduit for about 40 percent of globally traded oil , if it is attacked .
The U.S. military says it will prevent any such action .
Military experts say Iranian missiles often draw on technology from China , North Korea and other countries .
Israel has three German - made submarines that are widely assumed to carry nuclear missiles .
One of the submarines sailed from the Mediterranean , via the Suez Canal , to Israel ’s Red Sea port of Eilat in early July , seen as a signal to Iran of the long reach of its arsenal .
Jafari said Iran “ was not scared ” of Israel ’s military capabilities .
“ It is part of the psychological war that the West has launched against Iran , ” he said .
Ahmadinejad , who has called for Israel to be wiped off the map , was re-elected in a disputed June 12 presidential vote that stirred the largest display of internal unrest in the country since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Today it became apparent that with the constant spraying of teargas tainted with thinner , strikers are suffering from their skin blistering and peeling off with an extreme burning sensation .
With no water in the occupied factory to wash off the toxins , it is becoming a severe health problem .
There was also a tripartite meeting between government , Ssangyong management , and the union .
The company bosses refused to negotiate until the occupation ends , stating that they wo n't back down on the layoffs .
Today , 24 July 2009 , is Day Five of the battle over the occupied Ssangyong Motors factory at Pyeongtaek in South Korea .
Below is a diagram of the paint department , where most of the occupiers are now holed up .
It describes the various flammable liquids that are stored on the 1st and 2nd floors ( e.g. thinner , gasoline , diesel , etc. ) ; there are 200,000 liters of these .
This afternoon a committee made up of the families of the factory occupiers staged a sit-in at the offices of the chairman of ruling party in their headquarters in Seoul .
Throughout the day the cops continuously sprayed toxic thinner - tainted tear gas from both helicopters and from armored watercanon trucks .
The cops maintained positions of about 50 meters from the perimeter of the factory .
Strikers occupying the factory are suffering from the effects of the toxicity of the tear gas on their skin .
It is still uncertain what the ingredients are , but they are obviously some kind of flammable liquid like thinner .
With so much of this flammable liquid being dropped on the roof of the factory 's paint department where most of the strikers are , it is an dangerous hazard should some spark set if off .
When it contacts someone it causes severe burning and the skin to peel off .
It is worried that if coming in contact with someone 's eyes , it will cause blindness .
Photos from today of pigs dropping bags of toxic liquid from helicopter :
As you may or may not know both Telus and Bell currently charge users without text messaging packages for any incoming texts received .
That ’s right , incoming texts .
Rogers , having waited many months to follow suit , will finally do so as of July 7 , 2009 .
If you do n’t agree with this ridiculous practice you do n’t have too many options .
Unfortunately , it appears that the “ big 3 ” ( Telus , Bell , and Rogers ) have banded together in this regard and are forcing this charge down their customers throats .
You know that $ 7.95 “ system access fee ” charge ?
It was once mandatory for providers to pay the Canadian government .
Now , they are no longer required to pay the government , yet they still collect the fee .
Makes sense , does n’t it ?
More information on your options can be found in this thread : http://forums.beyond.ca/st/263324/rogers-to-charge-for-incoming-text-messages-july-7/.
Send a Message to the Cellular Providers !
Unfortunately , if you ’re stuck with the big 3 for some reason ( need data access for BlackBerry or do n’t want to pay the $ 400 to get out of your contract , for example ) your options are severaly limited .
However , if you ’re a little more free ridin ’ you do have options .
Smaller providers , such as Virgin Mobile , Boost Mobile , and PC Mobile , all offer pre-paid cellular services with text messaging , picture messaging , and basic data offerings .
If you ’re an iPhone user you ’re pretty much boned ( Fido is owned by Rogers ) , but if you are n’t you can switch over and ditch the rediculous fees .
The longer that Canadians let this extortion happen the more it will cost us in the end .
After all , if they can charge us for incoming text messages ( which users have absolutely no control over ) , what ’s to stop them from charging a per-minute rate simply for accessing their network ( ie- having your phone turned on ) ?
There is much about Freemasonry that remains shrouded in mystery to the outside world .
But a group of members in the US state of Georgia appear to have clarified one thing - the supreme being in which all Masons are required to believe is not likely to be black .
Freemasonry lodges in Georgia are at loggerheads over the admission of a " non-white " member to an organisation that was founded on the principles of the Enlightenment but which is apparently still struggling to catch up with the latter part of the 20th century .
Now the issue is headed for a Masonic trial and the state courts after some lodges in Georgia sought to revoke the charter of one in Atlanta for admitting Victor Marshall , a 26 - year - old African - American army reservist , last autumn .
The Atlanta lodge has fought back in the state courts by seeking to block the move on the grounds that is based on " racial animosity and hatred " .
The row blew up after Marshall attended a celebration in Savannah in February to mark the 275th anniversary of a lodge in the city .
Although there are other Masons of colour in Georgia , including Asians and Hispanics , some members were disturbed to encounter a black man and laid a complaint that he did not belong .
" There were ill - informed brethren who were surprised that there was an African - American brother , " David Llewellyn , a Freemason and lawyer for the Atlanta lodge , told the New York Times , " and some of them were very upset " .
The stipulations to join the Masons are that members must be male , not slaves , of good character and have faith in a supreme being but no mention is made of racial origin .
The grand master , or leader of the Masons in Georgia , J Edward Jennings Jr , sent an email to members saying that Marshall was a legitimate member and should be treated as such .
But that did not quell the row .
Under pressure , Jennings agreed to convene a Masons court to hear a complaint against the head of the Atlanta lodge , Michael Bjelajac , who is accused of violating " moral law " , the " ancient landmarks " and " immemorial usages " of Freemasonry by admitting Marshall .
But the complaint has met with ridicule in part because there are largely black Masonic lodges in the US as well as in African countries such as Ghana .
The objections to Marshall 's membership have been led by Douglas Ethridge and Starling Hicks , both worshipful masters of their respective lodges in Georgia who have both declined to be interviewed .
In court papers , Llewellyn said that when he called Etheridge to discuss the lawsuit , the Mason replied , " To hell with you , buddy " , and hung up .
Freemasonry in the US has a long history of segregation .
A black stream of the organisation , known as Prince Hall Masons , was only recognised by mainstream Masons in 1990 and even then several states , including Georgia , refused to do so .
The Grand Master of the Prince Hall Masons in Georgia , Ramsey Davis , told the New York Times that he approached the mainstream leaders in the state to discuss recognition but was rebuffed .
" There 's deep - rooted racism in the leadership , " he said .
" I 've had many calls from white Masons to say they cannot understand why things are this way . "
Marshall told the Associated Press that while he is disillusioned by the attitudes of some of his fellow Masons he has not lost faith in the organisation .
" I hope we 'll be victorious and that Freemasonry will come out in a more powerful light , " he said .
" But of course sometimes the bad side can overwhelm the good side . "
Big Brother is watching you : CCTV cameras have become one of the most contentious pieces of technology in public use Photo : PA
The furore around the Chinese government ’s Green Dam software has raised the issue of the way modern technology is used to monitor our daily lives .
Here , we list seven of the technologies that can be used to keep track of your movements .
CCTV
Closed - circuit television cameras were first used in Germany in 1942 to remotely monitor the launch of V2 rockets .
Since then , CCTVs have become one of the most contentious pieces of technology in public use .
The government and law enforcement agencies claim the use of video monitoring technology can help reduce crime and improve public safety ; critics argue that the cameras serve only to displace crime to unmonitored areas , and do not act as a deterrent .
With more than four million CCTV units in the UK , the network of cameras captures the average person around 25 times a day .
RFID tags
Radio frequency identification chips are already widely used in supermarkets and shops for the purpose of stock control , but some people fear their use could be widened to monitor the habits and behaviour of ordinary citizens .
At the moment , these tags , which are little bigger than a grain of sand , are embedded into pints of milk and library books .
When paired with an RFID reader , the tags can help to provide detailed information about items , such as their location , or how many there are .
Although most people are happy for RFID tags to be used in stores to monitor stock levels , they ’re less happy about the idea of the chips still sending out a signal once they leave the shop .
On a benign level , such tracking capabilities would mean a store would know that people in Hertfordshire prefer blue cashmere jumpers , while those in Aberdeen favour the brown versions .
But on a more sinister level , it could also enable them to glean an unprecedented insight into our personal lives , and target their brands to us accordingly .
To those people who fear a “ surveillance culture ” , the ability to tag and track everything from our food to our clothes would be the next step on an already slippery slope .
Telecoms technology
The recent election protests in Iran have raised some interesting questions about the technology used by the country ’s government to not only censor and control the spread of information , but monitor the ways in which citizens have been communicating and mobilising .
It now appears that some of the technology the Iranian authorities have been using to listen in on phone calls made on fixed - line phones and mobile handsets was sold to the government by Nokia Siemens , a joint venture between the Finnish phone maker and the German technology giant .
Nokia Siemens said it believed the product was being used by the government to monitor calls , but some experts have speculated that it could also be used for a practice known as “ deep packet inspection ” – a process that enables agencies to block communications , as well as monitor the nature of conversations and even covertly alter this for the purpose of propaganda and disinformation .
Nokia Siemens , rocked by this association with a repressive regime , have pointed out that Iran is not the only country using its monitoring technology – many Western governments , including the UK and US , apparently use it for “ lawful intercepts ” …
Email monitoring software
Who is reading your emails ?
Chances are , if you work for a big company , your boss could be keeping an eye on how many messages you send in the course of a day .
According to recent research by Forrester , 44 per cent of companies read outgoing mail , using a combination of digital scanning software and real people .
The primary concern for businesses appears to be the dissemination of inappropriate or commercially sensitive information rather than time - wasting , but with more and more distractions available at our office computers , from Facebook and Twitter to online shopping , many more businesses may decide to start monitoring just how their employees spend their work time .
Information - gathering technology
Gunwharf Quays shopping centre in Portsmouth shot to fame last year when it was revealed that surveillance software was monitoring the signals given off by shoppers ’ mobile phones to track their movements .
The technology allowed researchers to tell when someone entered the shopping centre , what stores they visited , how long they spent in each one , and what time they left .
It could even tell what route they took , and the country they were visiting from .
Although all monitoring is anonymous – it does not identify the owner of the phone , rather than handset ’s unique IMEI network number – it raised some concerns from privacy campaigners .
While , at its most innocuous , this sort of information could help business and shopping centres pinpoint areas of high footfall or congestion , and redesign the space accordingly , or spot a surge in late shoppers that could prompt them to extend store opening hours , it also implies that this technology could be extended to minutely measure purchasing habits and retail behaviour .
Perhaps that scene from Minority Report , in which Tom Cruise is bombarded by tailored , personalised advertising as he passes every hording , is not too far away .
Targeted advertising
One of the most contentious issues facing businesses and consumers at the moment is targeted advertising .
With companies struggling to find a profitable business model in the digital age , a greater premium is being placed on targeting products , services and content directly to people on the basis of their specific likes , dislikes and needs .
Phorm ’s
Webwise technology is a good example of this new way of thinking – it works by scanning users ’ browsing history , and matching keywords found in these websites to targeted adverts , provided by other companies , which match the interests of web users .
Phorm has stressed that the entire process is anonymised , so that interests cannot be directly traced to a named individual , but that has still lead some web users , as well as technology luminaries such as Sir Tim Berners - Lee , to be suspicious of the concept .
Sir Tim likened commercial traffic monitoring by internet service providers as akin to “ allowing them to put a television camera in your living room ” .
GPS - enabled phones
Most modern mobile phones have a small GPS chip inside them , which means your location can be pinpointed to within a few hundred metres by the network of satellites floating in orbit .
Of course , most people will use this technology in combination with the mapping software loaded on to their phone to make it easier to find their way around ; some phones are now so sophisticated that they can provide real - time turn - by - turn directions , just like a satnav .
The inclusion of GPS cGPShips in handsets has also opened up a new world of location - based services – now that your phone “ knows ” where you are , it can feed that information in to , say , your phone ’s search engine to provide data , links and recommendations for local amenities for whichever area you find yourself in .
The flip side of that , of course , is that with the right kind of software installed on your phone , it ’s possible to remotely monitor your location for less innocuous reasons .
Services such as Google Latitude and Sniff are opt-in , consensual examples of this sort of technology , although some worry that in time , these kinds of monitoring software will be commonplace and non-negotiable , rather than a matter of personal choice .
This article lists some extensions that are known to cause problems .
There are hundreds of extensions , and most problems are not listed here .
If you do not find the problem listed below , follow the steps outlined in the Standard diagnostic - Firefox article .
Extensions are not written by Mozilla and they are not tested with the browser or in combination with each other .
Extensions are normally installed by visiting a website such as addons.mozilla.org and clicking an " Install " link but there are also many applications that include Firefox extensions or toolbars that can be installed without you being aware of it . [ 1 ] , [ 2 ]
Updating extensions can solve many problems .
Extensions installed as experimental do not get automatically updated .
Extension versions needed after upgrading Firefox may be experimental or only available on the extension developer 's site .
Most extensions can be disabled or uninstalled in Firefox using the Add - ons manager ( " Tools -> Add-ons -> Extensions " ) although a few extensions may present removal problems .
In some cases , you may need to run Firefox in a special mode called " Firefox Safe Mode " to access the Add - ons manager .
You may also need to reset preference changes made by the extension that may persist after it is disabled or uninstalled .
See Uninstalling add - ons and Uninstalling toolbars for more information .

1.Black and White Twins A mixed - race British mom , Kylie Hodgson , gave birth in 2005 to twins , one of each — one black , the other white .
...
Ten years later , they ’re still together …
The Girl in the Mirror
She looks at herself in the full length mirror that hangs from her bedroom wall .
Completely naked and exposed , yet confident .
She ’s older than she was five years ago , but feels much younger .
And she thinks momentarily about the different men who held her in front of this mirror .
They thought they possessed her .
They thought she was theirs .
Because she was in their arms , so delicate and sweet .
But really she possessed them .
Because she possesses the space in front of the mirror .
And the moments that occur there too .
She gazes down at the man lying naked in her bed .
But he ’s not just another man .
For the first time in years , this one sleeps differently .
With a subtle smile , a dash of poise , and a history free of envy .
And she smiles and giggles to herself .
Just then , he stirs , slowly lifts his head , squints his eyes , and looks at her standing across the room , naked in front of the mirror .
His movement startles her and she jumps .
Not because he sees her naked , but because she is n’t ready for him to be awake .
Not yet .
This is her time , the early morning , when the world is quiet and she can hear the sound of her own breathing .
It ’s a sacred time when answers and insights are n’t as hard to come by .
A time when her mind is at peace and her heart beats slower .
And it begins beating slower again .
Because he closes his eyes and falls back asleep .
She slips on her robe , tiptoes into the kitchen , pours coffee grounds and water into the coffee maker , places two slices of bread in the toaster , and opens the window curtains .
The warm , early morning sun floods into her apartment .
A few minutes later , the toaster pops .
She spreads strawberry jam on the toast , pours a cup of coffee , opens the front door , and sits down on the doorstep .
And she thinks about how happy she is .
Happy to simply be .
To be free .
To not be tied down by another person or have another person tied down by her .
She stares up at the morning sky for a prolonged moment and smiles .
“ I ’m in love , ” she says aloud .
The Guy in the Bed
He has n’t fallen back asleep .
When he lifts his head , squints his eyes , and sees her standing naked in front of the mirror , he senses that she is n’t yet ready for him to join her .
So he closes his eyes and pretends to sleep .
He listens as she giggles , slips on her robe , tiptoes into the kitchen , and rattles the toaster , the coffee maker , and the curtains .
He loves these little noises …
Noises he calls music .
Like the music of last night , when they talked and laughed for hours over a bottle of wine .
Until unexpectedly , she kissed him .
And then he kissed her back .
Because of her philosophy and her beauty .
She took off his shirt .
He took off hers .
And it went on like that for what seemed like hours until they were together in bed , naked .
He thought he could love her .
He wondered if he did love her already .
And he wondered if she felt the same way .
When the kitchen noises stop , he gets up , slips on his boxers , and tiptoes into the living room where he sees her sitting peacefully on the doorstep .
She ’s completely bathed in the sun ’s light .
As she eats toast and drinks coffee , she seems to be laughing … a sweet , silent laughter .
He wants to bother her .
To tell her that he ’s hungry too , and that he would n’t mind sharing a slice of her toast .
But he does n’t .
Because she seems so happy and free … the way it should be .
So instead he stands in the doorway and admires her from a distance .
And he thinks about the fact that she is n’t his … that she will never be his .
And that it ’s okay .
Because she just said , “ I ’m in love . ”

Howard Manoian pretended he had been part of a dramatic D - Day mission An American veteran who said he parachuted into Normandy as part of the D - Day landings in June 1944 has been exposed as a liar .
Howard Manoian , 84 , had been awarded the prestigious French award the Legion d'honneur for bravery .
He claimed he had landed in Sainte - Mere - Eglise in France - the setting of a fierce battle immortalised in the John Wayne film The Longest Day .
But his military records reveal he spent the war behind the front line .
Mr Manoian was a local war hero in Sainte - Mere - Eglise , with a plaque erected in his honour .
He said he had served with the famous 82nd Airborne Division , and would tell vivid tales of his parachute mission .
" Even in the aeroplane I was wondering what it was going to be like .
They are going to start firing at us when we get near the land , " he said .
" One planeload jumped and landed in the square by the church and of course the Germans were already up and they were firing as they came down ...
Half of them were killed and wounded immediately .
That was the first time I saw a person dead face to face . "
War injuries
In fact Mr Manoian served with the 33rd Chemical Decontamination Company , which operated well behind the front line .
He spent most of the war looking after a supply dump in northern France after arriving on Utah beach by supply ship .
Mr Manoian claimed he had been hit by German machine gun bullets in the left hand and both legs during a fire fight on 17 June 1944 , and then again by a Nazi plane that targeted the hospital where he was recovering .
In fact his only war injuries were a broken middle finger while on standby in England and then heavy bruising to another hand .
The lies came to light when military records were obtained by the Boston Herald .

UPDATE , 1/20/2010 :
There is a newer libtcod and Python tutorial aimed at beginners at the Roguebasin wiki .
What follows is a less comprehensive approach .
If you follow this series of posts here you ’ll find many detours and returns , which may be educational , but if you want a good tutorial I recommend the above link .
The original post :
I ’ve known about the libtcod roguelike library for a while , mainly through the Python port in development by Kyle Stewart .
However that project seemed to be in stasis .
Then just a week or so ago I looked at libtcod again , because of some beautiful roguelikes that are using the C/C++ version of the library .
Pretty amazing , no ?
And that ’s all textmode !
So it turns out , in the meantime the developer jice created a Python wrapper and some Python samples to go with it .
From there it was quite easy to use the samples as a base for a simple ‘ get your @ on the screen moving around ’ demo .
I know for some people a lot of the fun of programming roguelikes is doing everything yourself — the console , the input and output routines , and so on .
It ’s not that I do n’t find that fun — just that I ’m bunk at programming , and I ’d rather learn and make some progress with the actual game .
As I go I do find myself learning more about the nitty - gritty programming details .
It ’s a combination of active learning and some sort of bottom - up osmosis I guess .
So let ’s create a roguelike in Python with libtcod .
The first thing to do is download the libtcod library and python module ( one download , choosing your platform ) .
Of course , you ’ll need Python as well if you do n’t have it .
Remember , if you ’re on Windows , set your PATH environment variable to include the Python directory .
The total download for me was about 4 1/2 MB , so I copied out files to create a minimal directory of about 2 MB .
You can lose the docs , samples , and miscellaneous .
PNGs ( but not the terminal.png , as that ’s the default font — you do n’t need it , but it makes things simpler to start ) .
You ’ll notice that much of this demo is straight from samples_py.py , so if you ’re feeling like you want to make a go of it yourself , make your own basic demo from samples_py — you can do it !
If you ’d rather listen to me blather on , please continue .
The full listing is at the bottom , but first I ’ll explain as I go .
Create a Python file and put it in your minimal libtcod directory .
Let ’s start from the top .
#!/usr/bin/python ''' libtcod python tutorial
This code modifies samples_py .py from libtcod 1.4.1 .
It shows a ' @ ' walking around with a source of light giving simple FOV .
It 's in the public domain . ''' ############################################# # imports ############################################# import os import libtcodpy as libtcod
Import the os module , as we ’ll use it to create the path for our font file later ; import libtcod , naming it whatever you like , but for simplicity ’s sake I ’ll call it libtcod .
The rest of the code is in four main parts : global constants and variables , the drawing routine , the update routine , and the main loop .
For each cycle of the main loop , the code runs the drawing and update routines once , using the global constants and changing the global variables in the process .
First , though , there ’s one utility function I created to make things easier :
############################################# # utility functions ############################################# def get_key ( key ) : if key.vk == libtcod .
KEY_CHAR : return chr ( key.c ) else : return key.vk
get_key is a simple function I wrote to make handling keyboard input a little easier .
The properties key.vk and key.c are from libtcod ’s TCOD_key_t structure — you can read up on them in the ‘ Console emulator ’ chapter of the documentation .
Unlike some game libraries I ’ve used , in libtcod there is not a symbol for something like KEY_h , the keyboard character ‘h’ .
However there are symbols for keyboard keys like the up arrow ( KEY_UP ) , or the ‘ 7 ’ on the number pad ( KEY_KP7 ) .
This means that if you want to test for a key in your code that is a printable character , such as ‘ h’ , you need to use its ASCII code , not a unique libtcod symbol — with , for example , something like ord ( ‘h ’) instead of KEY_h .
It ’s simpler for me to just think of letters and other printable characters as the characters themselves , as a string like ‘ h’ , though , so I wrote get_key to let me use simple strings whenever I ’m working with keyboard input .
You ’ll see what I mean in a moment .
Next define some constants :
#############################################
# global constants and variables ############################################# window_width = 46 window_height = 20 first =
True fov_px = 20 fov_py = 10 fov_recompute =
True fov_map =
None fov_colors = { ' dark wall ' : libtcod .
Color ( 0 , 0 , 100 ) , ' light wall ' : libtcod .Color ( 130 , 110 , 50 ) , ' dark ground ' : libtcod .Color ( 50 , 50 , 150 ) , ' light ground ' : libtcod .
Color ( 200 , 180 , 50 ) } fov_init =
False fov_radius = 4 move_controls = { ' i ' : ( 0 , - 1 ) , # up ' k ' : ( 0 , 1 ) , # down 'j ' : ( - 1 , 0 ) , # left 'l ' : ( 1 , 0 ) , # right libtcod .
KEY_UP : ( 0 , - 1 ) , # example of alternate key libtcod .
KEY_KP8 : ( 0 , - 1 ) # example of alternate key }
Do n’t worry too much about what these mean right now , just notice a couple of things .
First , fov_colors defines the colors of different types of cells ( that is , tiles ) on our map .
If you look at samples_py .
py you ’ll see cell colors are defined differently , as individual constants instead .
I used a Python dictionary type here for two reasons .
In my mind it makes the constants themselves easier to read , and it simplifies the code where the constants are used .
If you compare the code in this demo to the samples_py .py field - of - view demo you ’ll see what I mean .
This way of doing it may not be to your taste , so this would be a good spot to compare this demo and the library ’s demo to see which you prefer .
Second , move_controls defines which keys do what in the demo ( where movement is the only thing going on , so that ’s all we ’re concerned with ) .
Again , this is different from samples_py — samples_py uses an if / elif control structure to define what keys do what ( in fact , it deals with cell colors in a similar way ) .
What I like about using a dictionary like this is it makes changing keyboard commands very easy ; rather than editing a long if structure , I change the entries in the dictionary instead .
There ’s one more constant to define — the map .
I just copied this from samples_py .
A hardcoded map is easy to work with .
This would be the entry point for a generated map .
smap = ['##############################################' , '#######################
#################' , '#####################
# ###############' , '######################
### ###########' , '##################
##### ####' , '################
######## ###### ####' , '###############
####################
####' , '################
###### # #' , '######## ####### ###### # # # ## ' , '######## ###### ### ##' , '######## ##' , '# ### ###### ### # # # ## ' , '# ### ### ########## #### ##' , '# ### ### ########## ###########=##########' , '#### ##################
##### #####' , '# ### ### #### ##### #####' , '# ### # #### #####' , '######## # #### ##### #####' , '######## ##### ####################' , '##############################################' , ]
Next comes the code that draws the map and its contents to the console .
############################################# # drawing ############################################# def draw ( first ) : global fov_px , fov_py , fov_map global fov_init , fov_recompute , smap if first : libtcod.console_clear(0 ) libtcod.console_set_foreground_color(0 , libtcod.white ) libtcod.console_print_left(0 , 1 , 1 , libtcod .
BKGND_NONE , " IJKL : move aroundn " ) libtcod.console_set_foreground_color(0 , libtcod.black ) libtcod.console_put_char(0 , fov_px , fov_py , '@ ' , libtcod .
BKGND_NONE ) for y in range ( window_height ) : for x in range ( window_width ) : if smap[y ] [ x ] == '=' : libtcod.console_put_char(0 , x , y , libtcod .
CHAR_DHLINE , libtcod .
BKGND_NONE )
You ’ll notice I ’m using global variables in these functions — it ’s a simple way to do it for this demo , but not necessarily how you ’ll want to do it for a complete game .
In the first if structure we test if first is true .
Then the code draws the first characters that we see — some simple instructions that appear on the console , the ‘ @ ’ ( that ’s you ) , and the ‘ = ’ characters , representing windows in the map display ( look at the smap array above ) .
All of these libtcod functions are described in the libtcod documentation , so give that a look as you follow along .
You ’ll notice that first it sets the foreground color to white — this is so it draws the instructions in white .
Then it changes the foreground color to black for the rest of the drawing .
This routine only needs to run once , which is why it ’s controlled by the test of first .
Now we want to do two things in the drawing routine — draw the rest of the map , and test if we need to recalculate the player ’s field - of - view .
We recalculate when the player moves .
if not fov_init : fov_init = True fov_map = libtcod.map_new( window_width , window_height ) for y in range ( window_height ) : for x in range ( window_width ) : if smap[y ] [ x ] == ' ' : libtcod.map_set_properties ( fov_map , x , y , True , True ) elif smap[y ] [ x ] == '= ' : libtcod.map_set_properties ( fov_map , x , y , True , False ) if fov_recompute : fov_recompute = False libtcod.map_compute_fov(fov_map , fov_px , fov_py , fov_radius , True )
You can think of fov_init as a checkbox .
If it ’s False , the program has n’t been run yet and the checkbox is n’t checked .
Once we do run the program , the code puts a check in the checkbox ( setting fov_init to True ) and draws the rest of the map to the console .
Note that the code only draws the entire map once , when the game begins .
In the future , we only need to draw those parts of the map that have changed .
This is a simple technique common to most games .
The code also tests fov_recompute to see if it should recalculate the field - of - view of our player .
Look map_compute_fov up in the documentation to see what all its arguments mean .
After the field - of - view is computed ( or not — in that case , it remains the same as before ) , the code needs to draw the cells affected by the fov .
We have four types of cells here , dark walls , light walls , dark ground , and light ground — the entries in our fov_colors dictionary above .
Here is the code :
for y in range ( window_height ) : for x in range ( window_width ) : affect , cell = ' dark ' , ' ground ' if libtcod.map_is_in_fov(fov_map , x , y ) : affect = ' light ' if ( smap[y ] [ x ] == ' # ' ) : cell = ' wall ' color = fov_colors [ ' %s %s ' % ( affect , cell ) ] libtcod.console_set_back(0 , x , y , color , libtcod .
BKGND_SET )
Again we loop through each cell of the smap .
The first thing the code does is set the variables affect and cell to ‘ dark ’ and ‘ ground ’ respectively .
Then if the cell is within the field - of - view , it sets the affect variable to ‘ light ’ instead , and similarly if the cell is a wall .
Finally , it creates a variable called color that is the entry in the fov_colors dictionary corresponding to the key ‘ affect cell ‘ .
The code uses that color variable to set the background color of the cell .
If we wanted to add a different color — say , making the windows pink when in the fov — we would just need to add a test to find ‘ =’ characters , and in that test change the ‘ cell ‘ to ‘ window ’ appropriately .
Then , define ‘ light window ’ in the fov_colors dictionary as pink , and define its counterpart — perhaps ‘ dark window ’ .
What I like about this method , as I described above , is it avoids a long if / else structure to do the same thing .
The drawing routine is complete ; now on to the update function .
#############################################
# game state update ############################################# def update ( key ) : global fov_py , fov_px , fov_recompute , smap key = get_key ( key ) if key in move_controls : dx , dy = move_controls [ key ] if smap [ fov_py+dy ] [ fov_px+dx ] == ' ' : libtcod.console_put_char(0 , fov_px , fov_py , ' ' , libtcod .
BKGND_NONE ) fov_px = fov_px + dx fov_py = fov_py + dy libtcod.console_put_char(0 , fov_px , fov_py , '@ ' , libtcod .
BKGND_NONE ) fov_recompute = True
This update function is quite simple , as all it ’s doing is updating the position of the player if they move .
You ’ll notice the libtcod drawing function console_put_char does the main work , drawing over the map cells if the player moves .
It ’s here that I use the get_key function defined above to set the value of the key variable .
The key variable will be either a special libtcod symbol , or a string , depending on what key the player presses on the keyboard .
Look again at get_key to see what that function returns if you need to .
An important note
If you look again at move_controls defined above in the global constants section , you ’ll notice that pressing an up key sets ( dx , dy ) as ( 0 , - 1 ) — in effect , reducing the value of fov_py ( fov_py is the y - point from where we do the field - of - view calculation , and not incidentally where the @ character is drawn too ) .
If you ’re not familiar with the SDL library ( which libtcod uses under the hood ) it might seem strange to reduce the y value as you go upward , but it ’s simply because SDL defines the ( 0,0 ) x , y coordinate position to be in the upper left corner of whatever you ’re drawing to .
Conversely , if you were to use a library such as OpenGL , you would increase the y value as you go up , as in OpenGL the ( 0,0 ) position is in the lower left corner of the display .
If the player does move , the code will need to recompute the field - of - view on the next cycle of the game loop .
That ’s it for the update function — now for the main loop .
#############################################
# initialization and main loop ############################################# font = os.path.join(' fonts ' , ' arial12x12.png ') libtcod.console_set_custom_font( font , libtcod .
FONT_LAYOUT_TCOD
| libtcod .
FONT_TYPE_GREYSCALE ) libtcod.console_init_root(window_width , window_height , ' Python Tutorial ' , False ) while not libtcod.console_is_window_closed ( ) : draw ( first ) libtcod.console_flush ( ) key = libtcod.console_wait_for_keypress( True ) update ( key ) if key.vk == libtcod .
KEY_ESCAPE : break
There ’s not much to it .
One thing we do first , before creating the console with console_init_root , is set a custom font .
This is why I imported the os module earlier , as the font is located in a fonts directory located inside the working directory .
The game loop itself just draws to the console , waits for a key press , then calls the update function .
If the player presses the escape key the game exits .
This is a classic turn - based game loop , but libtcod also supports real - time game loops , and you can read more about that in the documentation .
So that ’s everything !
A functional roguelike demo in Python in 173 lines of code .
Remember , much of this code is directly from the samples_py .py file included with the download — there ’s a lot more to learn there , and on the libtcod site as well .
I ’m hoping to expand on this demo as I create a functional game , so any feedback ( on my hacky code or this hacky tutorial ! ) would be terrific .
Thanks for reading .

Today , we at Qt Software have opened our repositories to the public .
Any developer can now help guide and shape the future development of Qt by contributions of code , translations , examples and other material to Qt and Qt- related projects .
We have also published our roadmap and released Qt Jambi under the LGPL .
Read on for details .
Since we moved to Git as our version control system in late summer 2008 , the web - based Gitorious was an obvious choice for helping us manage the contributions .
We have funded its founder Johan Sørensen and one of his colleagues to work on tweaks and added functionality like team support and wikis that are now available to all projects using Gitorious .
We will continue to work on improvements to Gitorious together with the project in the future .
The new contribution site will not only host Qt itself but also a number of Qt- related tools and projects including the Qt Creator IDE , Qt Jambi and various Qt Labs projects .
Details about the contribution model can be found on our website or in Tor Arne 's blog posting .
Qt Roadmap Published on qtsoftware.com
Along with the launch of the open repositories , we are publishing a roadmap that gives an overview of current features in development and research projects and helps you understand Qt 's future direction .
Not only that , we would love you to help us shape this direction through feedback and contributions .
Qt Jambi 4.5.0_01 Released Under LGPL
Additionally , we have released Qt Jambi to the open repositories today .
This is the final feature release which will be followed by a one - year maintenance period .
We are confident that a commited group of developers will take over and make it a successful open source community project .
Read more about the Jambi release in Eskil 's blog posting .
Scotland Yard today announced that it will launch an investigation into alleged cases of the misuse of expenses by MPs .
At 5.10 pm , the Metropolitan police announced an inquiry into a " small number " of MPs and peers would be carried out , but refused to confirm names .
Police had originally said they would not be pursuing the matter .
The decision to launch an investigation came as the leaders of the major political parties announced that , in future , all expenses would be published in full with no redcation of key information .
The next tranche of MP 's expenses , for the financial year that ended in April , is due to be published in October .
Officers from the Met 's economic and specialist crime command will conduct the investigation , which will be overseen by the Met 's temporary assistant commissioner , Janet Williams , a former special branch commander .
In a statement , the force said : " After consideration by the joint Metropolitan police and Crown Prosecution Service assessment panel , the Met has decided to launch an investigation into the alleged misuse of expenses by a small number of MPs and peers . "
Police sources had previously indicated that , if any criminal investigations were launched , they would be into allegations of fraud .
Sources say those cases in which an MP might have claimed interest for a mortgage they had paid off might warrant a criminal inquiry for fraud .
Other inquiries could be in to phantom travel expenses .
Labour MPs Elliot Morley and David Chaytor both continued to claim for mortgage interest payments despite having paid off their loans - £ 16,000 and £ 13,000 respectively .
Labour peer Baroness Uddin is accused of claiming as much as £ 100,000 for a property reportedly left empty , while the Conservative Bill Wiggin claimed £ 11,000 in parliamentary allowances for a property he owned outright .
Police and leading prosecutors have spent several weeks going through suspicious claims from MPs and peers .
Officers have interviewed staff in the fees office as part of their inquiry to satisfy themselves that MPs were following the rules in most cases .
They are refusing to say how soon any charges if any could be brought .
Parliament today published a list of MPs who have repaid claims , suggesting that 182 from all parties had returned a total of £ 478,616 .
Most MPs insist their behaviour was within the rules and that they paid money back to alleviate voter anger .
MICAH HILDENBRAND and her husband , Eric , are corporate lawyers who live in an affluent neighborhood in Washington and drive a Lexus SUV .
But when their son , Chase , was born in January , they trawled friends ’ garages rather than shop at places like Buy Buy Baby , the megastore that caters to new parents .
Nearly all of Chase ’s belongings are hand - me - downs or were bought secondhand , from the onesies to the fully tricked - out Bugaboo Cameleon  the top of the line Dutch stroller that the Hildenbrands bought on a listserv for a fraction of its $ 900 price tag .
Mrs. Hildenbrand said that a good salary was n’t reason enough to spend money that might not always be there .
“ We want to hedge in case something does happen , ” she said .
Observers of baby consumerism say such caution is not unusual these days .
It is mirrored in the declining fortunes of the $ 343 - million “ play and discover ” market  toys and goods marketed to parents of children under a year old  which has fallen by more than a third over the last year and a half .
The recession , it seems , has catalyzed a moment of reflection among the formerly free - spending new - parent set : used is good ; free is best .
New purchases have become more considered , less spontaneous .
Experts say the children ’s market is just playing catch - up to a radical consumer shift taking place across all luxury sectors .
But some say the new attitude reflects a broader change in perspective when it comes to conspicuous consumption for young children .
No longer is it necessary to buy a thousand - dollar changing table in order to prove your parental savvy and breadth of love ; if anything , the opposite is true .

A while back I posted about the sales tax deduction on new car sales that was included in Obama ’s 2009 Economic Stimulus package .
Basically the provision in the bill gives every taxpayer who buys a new ( not used ) car after Feb.
16 , 2009 the ability to claim a deduction on their 2009 income tax for the sales tax that they pay on their new car purchase .
For example , let ’s say you buy a new car for $ 20,000 after February 16th .
At a tax rate of 6.5 % you would end up paying about $ 1300 in taxes .
That means your taxable income could be reduced by $ 1300 when you file your 2009 taxes .
( Note : this does not mean that you will get a $ 1300 check in the mail . )
Since I made my original post , I ’ve gotten a lot of questions about the provision .
I decide to answer the most common ones here .
If you have more questions , please leave them in the comments .
7 Common Questions About The Sales Tax Deduction On New Car Sales
When do I have to buy the car to get the deduction ?
Purchases must occur after Feb. 16 , 2009 , and before Jan. 1 , 2010 .
Can I claim the deduction on my 2008 taxes ?
The deduction may not be taken on 2008 tax returns .
When do I get the deduction ?
Taxpayers will claim this deduction when filing their 2009 federal income tax return next year .
How expensive of a car can I buy and still deduct sales tax ?
State and local sales taxes paid on up to $ 49,500 of the purchase price of qualifying vehicles are deductible .
Can I get this deduction on the purchase of a used car ?
No . Qualified motor vehicles generally include new cars , light trucks , motor homes and motorcycles .
Do I have to itemize on my taxes in order to get this deduction ?
This deduction can be taken regardless of whether or not you itemize other deductions on your tax return .
Our family does well financially .
Can we still get the deduction ?
The amount of the deduction is phased out for taxpayers whose modified adjusted gross income is between $ 125,000 and $ 135,000 for individual filers and between $ 250,000 and $ 260,000 for joint filers .
If You Do Buy A New Car , Remember These Things
If you do end up buying a new car , it ’s important to go in with the right mindset , and with certain goals in mind .
Remember these things .
Do n’t get car fever !
Take your time , and look for the best deals and research the car you want .
You can find a lot of good deals right now , so take the time to find them .
Negotiate the price .
If you get a deal from one dealer , take that dollar amount to another dealer , see if they ’ll come down on the price .
Ask for factual information .
For example , do n’t ask , “ Does it get good gas mileage ? ”
The dealer may consider 10 miles to the gallon to be good mileage , but you wo n’t .
Ask , “ How many miles per gallon does it get ? ”
Be willing to walk away .
Do n’t get so set on a certain car that a dealer can sense he ’s got you hook line and sinker .
If he does , you wo n’t get as good of a deal .
Forget the extras .
Do n’t pay for things that you do n’t need like pin striping , special detailing and extended warranties .
If you have your full emergency fund in place , it ’ll cover any costs you have if the car has problems .
2 are better than 1 .
Take a friend or family member who can help you keep your head .
Your friend can also help you to remember details about the car that the dealer tells you , which can help you make your decision .
Have you purchased a new car since the tax deduction went into effect ?
Was it a factor in your decision to buy ?
Do you think it ’s enough of an incentive to actually get more people on the showroom floor ?
Tell us your thoughts in the comments .

Big , big , big step backwards for the Kindle book platform .
And even with a poetic twist .
It seems Amazon snuck into people ’s electronic libraries overnight and deleted their George Orwell books .
( I ’m not clear what happened in cases where people had also saved their electronic copies to the computer in addition to their Kindle — if anyone knows , lemme know . )
The technology and execution is amazing , as I ’ve noted before .
But it really seems like Amazon Inc. might be too craven to make it work .
Global warming is not necessarily always bad .
A 400 - year warm spell in South America fueled the Incas ’ rise , British archaeologists reported Monday , helping them build the largest empire that ever ruled the continent .
A several - degree increase in temperature allowed the Incas to move higher into the Andes mountains , opening up new farmland and providing a water source through the gradual melting of glaciers at the top of those mountains , paleoecologist Alex Chepstow - Lusty of the French Institute of Andean Studies in Lima reported online Monday in the journal Climate of the Past .
“ They were highly organized and they had a sophisticated [ governance ] , but it would n’t have counted a jot without being underpinned by the warming of the climate , ” he said in a telephone interview .

Other experts were cautious about his interpretation .
“ The premise that the Incan expansion was driven by climate change is quite revolutionary , ” said archaeologist Mark Bush of the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne .
Confirming it will require a great deal more work for paleoecologists and archaeologists alike .
The new research is important because “ data on Andean climate during this time period are scant , ” said archaeologist Warren Church of Columbus State University in Georgia , who works in Peru .
“ However , it is important to remember that climates do not make empires .
People do . ”
Chepstow - Lusty , geographer Mick Frogley of the University of Sussex and their colleagues have been studying a 26 - foot - long core of mud drilled from the sacred Lake Marcacocha in the Patacancha Valley of Peru , near Cuzco .
Seeds , pollen , charcoal bits and other debris from successive layers in the core paint a picture of climate and agriculture in the region for 4,000 years .

Analysis of the core showed that a major drought began in the region around the year 880 and lasted for at least 100 years .
That drought , Chepstow - Lusty speculated , may have been the cause of the demise of the Wari empire , which lasted from 550 to 1000 .
The region was also colder than normal for the 3,000 years before 1000 .
Beginning about 1150 , the climate began warming and eventually got “ several degrees centigrade ” warmer , Chepstow - Lusty said .
That had the net effect of extending arable regions to an altitude about 300 yards higher in the mountains , he suggested , vastly extending the area that could be cultivated .
It also might have caused the Peruvian glaciers to melt slowly , providing water that the Incas captured with large irrigation systems and agricultural terraces .
The major evidence for the warming , Chepstow - Lusty said , was the appearance of alder - like trees that had n’t been seen in the region before , as well as increased insect activity .
The trees , which normally grow in warmer climates , grow well in poor soil and fertilize it by converting nitrogen from the atmosphere into a usable form .
Advertisement
The increased cultivation would have led to large surpluses of maize and potatoes , the researchers speculated , freeing the Incas to undertake other activities , including building monuments and roads and creating a large standing army that allowed them to conquer nearby peoples .
By the time the Spanish arrived in 1533 , the Incas controlled an area that stretched from what is now the Colombian border with Ecuador to the middle of Chile , with more than 8 million inhabitants .
When the Spanish arrived , they noted that the Incas had enough food in warehouses to last for 10 years .
The Incan empire ended after the arrival of the Spanish , who inadvertently brought diseases that devastated the population , allowing the invaders to conquer the survivors and push them to the highest altitudes , where they are still marginalized economically .
The story has a powerful moral for today , Chepstow - Lusty said .
Peru is one of the countries most threatened by global warming , and the glaciers that provide much of the water for the capital , Lima , are rapidly melting and are expected to be gone in 20 years .
The terraces that previously trapped water for agriculture have fallen into disuse , and the predominant tree in the region is the eucalyptus , which saps what water remains in the soil and deposits resins that poison other plant life .
Advertisement
Chepstow - Lusty called for removal of the eucalyptus tree and a massive reforestation effort with alder or similar trees to replenish the soil , as well as repair of the derelict irrigation systems so they can once more support agriculture .
But Church , who also works in Peru , cautioned that without more research , such an approach could be “ premature and risky . ”

German Pirate Party gains first seat in country 's parliament
The German Pirate Party may not have fared quite as well as its Swedish colleagues in the recent European election , but it still has something to boast about : Joerg Tauss , who has been in the parliament for the Social Democrats ( SPD ) since 1994 , declared today that he 's switching his affiliation to the Pirate Party .
That makes Germany the first country with a pirate as a member of parliament .
Tauss has been one of the most knowledgeable experts on IT policy in the German parliament .
He served as the spokesperson for the SPD 's education and science working group and was a founding member of the party 's online - only " virtual local chapter .
" Tauss left the Social Democrats after the party helped to pass a law mandating ISPs to block a number of websites with DNS block lists .
The law aims to stop child porn , but Tauss and other critics have argued that it's the first step towards an extensive Internet censorship regimen .
These fears are not unfounded : Conservative politicians have repeatedly raised the idea to also censor websites distributing violent video games , and the entertainment industry has been lobbying to block the Pirate Bay and other file sharing sites .
Tauss ' membership will definitely give the German Pirate Party some additional publicity - but it may not all be good press .
The politician found himself in the spotlight in March when police raided his offices and private residence in search for child porn .
Tauss later admitted that the police found illegal child porn during these raids , but has since maintained that he just wanted to familiarize himself with the inner workings of this scene and that he tried to infiltrate and take down a child porn distribution group .
The case against Tauss is ongoing .
The whole affair got mixed reactions from Germany 's Internet activists .
Some have called his behavior stupid at best .
Others however have wondered about the curious timing between the raid and the new censorship bill , which could have gotten much more scrutiny with Tauss uncompromised .
Germany 's next federal election is at the end of September .
Joerg
Tauss has already announced that he wo n't run for office again .
The German Pirate Party will have to fight to keep his seat after Tauss leaves :
It only won 0.9 percent of the vote in the EU elections .
It needs at least five percent in the federal election to send representatives to Berlin .
Then there 's the jump in house prices .
Over the past five years housing prices have grown much faster than the overall cost of living , adding about $ 5 trillion to the public 's wealth .
Typical estimates say that each additional dollar of housing wealth adds about 3 cents to annual consumer spending , as families reduce their savings and borrow against their newly valuable homes .
So we 're talking about an additional $ 150 billion in spending , and roughly 1.5 million more jobs .
Does anything else in the U.S. economy rival housing as a source of job creation ?
Well , there 's also the military buildup .
The Economic Policy Institute estimates that increased military spending over the past four years has created 1.3 million private - sector jobs .
And , yes , there are the Bush tax cuts , which the administration insists are the source of everything good in the economy .
And it 's true that some portion of the tax cuts , which amounted to $ 225 billion this year , must have been spent in ways that created jobs .
Given reasonable estimates of the effect of tax cuts on spending , however , they were probably a smaller force for job creation than the military buildup , and dwarfed by the housing boom .
So it 's an economy driven by real estate .
What 's wrong with that ?
One answer is that it has been a pretty disappointing recovery .
Two new reports , one from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and one from the Congressional Budget Office , compare the current economic expansion with other postwar recoveries .
By any measure except corporate profits , which have done very well , this one comes up short .
Even the good months would have been considered subpar in the past : the administration hailed last month 's job growth as something wondrous to behold , yet there were 68 months during the Clinton years when employment grew faster .
Those young whipper snappers back in 1979 could n't hold a candle to this archaic computational device , the abacus .
Gizmodo 600 BC , anyone ?

Reader Robin says this little guy was hiding out in the drawer of a recent vintage purchase :
My wife , Deborah , recently bought a secretary style vintage desk from an estate seller .
In one of the drawers along with some staples & glue was this little abacus .
It 's about 2 x 4 inches .
Thought you might enjoy seeing this - no clue of it's history or age & I do n't see anything about it searching google .

Personally , I love the simple juxtaposition of the label .
An abacus , one of the oldest counting tools on the planet , with a General Electric " Computer Department " label on the side ?
Classic Retromodo .

Filed under 1.5 . Dr. Jeff's Jeffisms , 1.6 . Dr. Jeff Speaks Out , 4 . The Earth , 4.1 . Environment and Climate Change , 4.2 . General Biosphere
Copyright 2009 | About this blog
This post is a ‘ Jeffism ’ by Dr. Jeff and a Dr. Jeff Speaks Out .
Last time on the blog , I used astronaut John Grunsfeld ’s recent Business Trip to the Hubble Space Telescope to show you that the perceived limitless ocean of air under which we live is really not limitless .
At an altitude of 62 miles ( 100 km ) above Earth ’s surface , you ’re effectively at the top of the atmosphere ( since 99.99 % of it is beneath you . )
So let ’s really put this in perspective with a Dr. Jeff Jeffism :
Earth ’s atmosphere compared to Earth is thinner than
the skin of an apple compared to an apple .
I truly hope that makes an impression on you .
Read it again and let it sink in .
Then take a moment and reflect on what you ’re thinking .
Now … for the rest of the story —
Our atmosphere is nothing more than a slender veil surrounding our planet .
It supports all life on spaceship Earth , and its composition , temperature , and weather are clearly changing .
So next time you ’re in a debate about global warming , pull this Jeffism out of your pocket .
It ’s a simple model that provides deeper conceptual understanding , and opens up discussions about the fragility of the atmosphere and the capacity of the human race to affect it .
Clearly there can be no argument that a threshold for atmospheric change exists beyond which dramatic consequences for life on Earth can be expected .
The key questions : are we approaching or even past that threshold , are we causing that change , and if we are what can we do about it ?
We all therefore have a vested stake in this debate for we ALL have something to lose – ‘ we ’ the human race ; and ‘ we ’ the other countless species of Earth .
My view ?
We humans are indeed the agents of global change , and that all of humanity needs to collectively consider the consequences of our actions , of our industrialization , and define a rational response – very very quickly .
The diversity of life on Earth – on the savannas of Africa , in the rain forests of Central and South America , and beneath the worlds ’ oceans – is at risk .
All these species are voiceless in this debate , and powerless to intervene .
For a conceptually powerful educational essay on global warming as an outgrowth of human activity , read A Day in the Life of the Earth here at Blog on the Universe , or
at the Huffington Post .
It includes a foreword by Dr. James Hansen , Director of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York .
Teachers and parents :
Before reading the Jeffism above to your class or child , use a familiar model to identify their preconceptions and misconceptions about the atmosphere .
Get a classroom globe of the Earth and ask how high above the globe the atmosphere extends .
Then read the Jeffism , and ask who ’s shocked and why .
Ask them to reflect on the difference between their perception of the atmosphere and reality .
Here ’s more to consider :
• Have a thoughtful and interdisciplinary discussion as a class or as a family considering the larger and inter-connected issues we face on global warming in terms of : science , technology , politics , economics , funding , the need for global partnerships , ethics , and morality .
Science should not be taught in isolation from all other human considerations .
The world is interdisciplinary , so why would we want to teach about the world only subject by subject ?
• Visit my Favorite Quotes page and read the quotes by astronaut Ulf Merbold and cosmonaut Yuri Artyukhin .
How are their words relevant to the discussion ?
• The Jeffism above is effective because it builds a bridge to the familiar using a model — in this case using an apple as a conceptual model to understand Earth .
Read the Power of Models page to gain deeper insight into how to use modeling in learning environments , and realize that you surround yourself with countless models every day to make the world understandable .
The Experiment
Do n’t let your students just assume the Jeffism is correct .
Help them to insist on testing it .
That ’s what science is all about .
Scientists ( your kids ) should put ideas to the torture test — and own the process .
So assume my Jeffism is a hypothesis , and have them test it for themselves .
And let them frame the experiment with guidance from you .
Here ’s the concept : the atmosphere is 62 miles ( 100 km ) thick and the Earth ’s diameter is 7,900 miles ( 12,700 km ) .
So how does Earth ’s diameter compare to the thickness of the atmosphere ?
That ’s just the ratio : 12,700 / 100 = 127 .
So the diameter of Earth is 127 times the thickness of the atmosphere .
What about the apple ?
The skin of the apple is what I ’ll define as the peeling you get when you peel an apple with a good potato peeler ( one that does not dig deeply into the apple ) .
Here ’s the creative thinking part of the experiment — your students / children need to propose how to measure the thickness of an apple skin .
One of a number of approaches is to use a peeler to carefully peel a really long strip from an apple .
Then tear off reasonably sized pieces and stack them in layers until you have a thickness you can measure with a ruler with millimeter divisions .
Measure the thickness of the stack , then count the layers , and divide the thickness of the stack by the number of layers to get the thickness of a single layer .
That ’s the thickness of the apple skin !
Finally , measure the diameter of the apple and calculate the ratio of apple diameter to skin thickness .
This ratio is what you compare to the 127 we got for the ratio of Earth ’s diameter to the thickness of the atmosphere .
I just did it with a golden delicious apple .
My stack of 10 layers had a measured thickness of 11 mm , corresponding to 1.1 mm for a single layer –which is the thickness of the apple skin .
The apple has a diameter of 80 mm .
So the diameter of the apple is only 80 / 1.1 = 72 times the thickness of the skin .
Comparing that to Earth ’s diameter equal to 127 times the thickness of the atmoshere means the Jeffism ( at least with my apple ) is confirmed !
A final thought — you can ask your students or child to go back to the classroom globe of Earth and calculate the thickness of the atmosphere on the globe .
It ’s just the diameter of the globe divided by 127 .
Science — it ’s fun , it ’s a team effort , it ’s eye - opening .

Three different species of frogs have been discovered living in the dung of the Asian elephant in southeastern Sri Lanka .
The discovery — the first time anyone has recorded frogs living in elephant droppings — has widespread conservation implications both for frogs and Asian elephants , which are in decline .
“ I found the frogs fortuitously during a field study about seed dispersal by elephants , ” Ahimsa Campos - Arceiz , a research fellow from the National University of Singapore , told Monagaby.com .
“ I thought it was an interesting phenomenon and commented it with some colleagues , experts on elephant and amphibian ecology .
None of them had heard about such a thing before .
Local people in the study area… seemed also unaware of it . ”

Campos - Arceiz examined 290 elephant dung piles and found six frog individuals in five dung piles , representing three species : the ornate narrow - mouthed frog Microhyla ornata , another narrow - mouthed species Microhyla rubra , and a frog species in the Sphaerotheca genus .
While Campos - Arceiz is uncertain why the frogs were residing in the elephant dung , he speculates that “ elephant dung provides a good shelter .
I found the frogs in an arid area during the dry season .
Under such conditions and in the absence of litter , elephant dung is probably a good alternative to spend the day in .
Elephants digest food very poorly .
Their feces contain a large proportion of undigested material and are highly fibrous .
When fresh , elephant dung is humid and probably cooler than the environment during the day .
Moreover , frogs could eat some of the many invertebrates present in elephant dung . ”

As Campos - Arceiz alludes to , he found more than just frogs taking refuge in the elephant droppings .
Although frogs were the only vertebrates , he also found beetles , ants , centipedes , millipedes , scorpions , crickets , spiders , and termites , “ suggesting that a dung pile can become a small ecosystem on its own , ” Campos - Arceiz writes in the paper announcing his discoveries in Biotropica .
With the dung piles becoming like island ecosystems , it was apparent that these discoveries held import for biodiversity .
Elephant dung as a micro-ecosystem .

“ Elephants ( and their dung ! ) can play a facilitative role for other organisms , ” Campos - Arceiz says explaining the many roles elephant dung plays in the larger forest ecosystem .
“ For plants , elephant dung provides a suitable germination environment after being dispersed by elephants .
Fungi are also dispersed by elephants and some are extremely common growing in elephant dung .
Invertebrates are extremely common as well .
I was indeed impressed with the quantity and diversity of invertebrates in some dung piles … Vertebrates like jungle fowls and land monitors pick elephant dung to feed on these invertebrates ; others like small birds and mammals can consume undigested material from the dung , sometimes acting as secondary seed dispersers .
Elephant dung plays some role in nutrient cycling as well , moving nutrients from the vegetation to the soil .
Elephants are capable of controlling the availability of resources for other organisms modifying the physical environment acting thus as ecosystem engineers . ”
To test the importance of elephant dung regarding forest biodiversity , Campos - Arceiz searched through an additional 180 dung piles of free - ranging cows and buffaloes and found no frogs and far less diversity of invertebrates .
Classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List , Asian elephants are threatened by the illegal ivory trade and habitat degradation and loss .
Their range has shrunk significantly over the last centuries , and many researchers worry it will contract further .

“ If we loss elephants from one particular site , all the biological interactions and ecosystem processes in which they are involved are lost as well , ” Campos - Arceiz notes .
“ We know really little of how this affects to other organisms but cascade effects are expectable .
Asian elephants are now Endangered after disappearing from most of their historical range .
The same is true — if not worse — for most of very large animals in tropical Asia . ”
Campos - Arceiz views elephant dung as a rich ecosystem with many mysteries .
Aside from frogs , he suspects that “ there could be some highly specialized taxa in elephant dung which , in the absence of elephants , might have difficulties to find an alternative in surrogates such as livestock dung . ”
He plans to continue studying the species living in elephant dung as well as its vital role as a seed - disperser .

Vital corridor for Asian elephants to be severed by government development in India
( 04/05/2009 )
The largest wild population of Asian elephants in the world is threatened by development over a 2.5 kilometer wide corridor , according to Rainforest Information Centre which is apart of an international campaign to change the location of the development .
The corridor , located in the Western Ghats of India , is the last unbroken forest leading the elephants from wet season to dry season feeding grounds .
Unfortunately the corridor also connects two different Indian states : Kerala and Karnataka .

New NASA Images Indicate Object Hits Jupiter
Carolina Martinez 818-354-9382
Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
carolina.martinez@jpl.nasa.gov
Scientists have found evidence that another object has bombarded Jupiter , exactly 15 years after the first impacts by the comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 .
Following up on a tip by an amateur astronomer , Anthony Wesley of Australia , that a new dark " scar " had suddenly appeared on Jupiter , this morning between 3 and 9 a.m. PDT ( 6 a.m. and noon EDT ) scientists at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , using NASA 's Infrared Telescope Facility at the summit of Mauna Kea , Hawaii , gathered evidence indicating an impact .
New infrared images show the likely impact point was near the south polar region , with a visibly dark " scar " and bright upwelling particles in the upper atmosphere detected in near - infrared wavelengths , and a warming of the upper troposphere with possible extra emission from ammonia gas detected at mid-infrared wavelengths .
"
We were extremely lucky to be seeing Jupiter at exactly the right time , the right hour , the right side of Jupiter to witness the event .
We could n't have planned it better , " said Glenn Orton , a scientist at JPL .
Orton and his team of astronomers kicked into gear early in the morning and have n't stopped tracking the planet .
They are downloading data now and are working to get additional observing time on this and other telescopes .
This image was taken at 1.65 microns , a wavelength sensitive to sunlight reflected from high in Jupiter 's atmosphere , and it shows both the bright center of the scar ( bottom left ) and the debris to its northwest ( upper left ) .
" It could be the impact of a comet , but we do n't know for sure yet , " said Orton .
" It 's been a whirlwind of a day , and this on the anniversary of the Shoemaker - Levy 9 and Apollo anniversaries is amazing .
" Shoemaker - Levy 9 was a comet that had been seen to break into many pieces before the pieces hit Jupiter in 1994 .
Leigh Fletcher , a NASA postdoctoral fellow at JPL who worked with Orton during these latest observations said , " Given the rarity of these events , it 's extremely exciting to be involved in these observations .
These are the most exciting observations I 've seen in my five years of observing the outer planets !
" The observations were made possible in large measure by the extraordinary efforts of the Infrared Telescope Facility staff , including telescope operator William Golisch , who adroitly moved three instruments in and out of the field during the short time the scar was visible on the planet , providing the wide wavelength coverage .
JPL is managed for NASA by the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .

We like portable apps because those applications are lightweight and require no installation to run .
As a web designer / developer , I used to work with different PCs .
Rather than carrying my laptop everywhere , I prefer saving frequently used applications into my USB drive .
I had to collect a lot of useful portable applications and I would like to share those applications with my readers .

So , grab the portable version of Google Chrome and start chroming .
3. OperaUSB
Probably you want to try out your design in different browsers .
We have Firefox portable , Chrome portable and IE installed by default .
So , it is better for us to have Opera usb installed on our USB drive so we can try out our design in these popular web browsers no matter where we are .

Now personally , I ’m always interested in anything that can enhance further the fun of watching a movie on a huge screen .
I buy tickets for any IMAX release of a film I want to see over seeing said flick on a conventional screen , for instance .
And while I ’ve always suspected that 3D is the answer to a question that not many people seemed to be asking – films have , after all , survived in two dimensions perfectly well for a long time now – I do believe that evolution of the medium is a good thing .
Even if , for some time , 3D was something that was there , but few really seemed interested in doing much with it .
The Journey
Any movie studio that was reluctant to embrace 3D film making , though , surely had its head turned by the performance of last year ’s Brendan Fraser headliner , Journey To The Center Of The Earth .
This was , to be fair , a shitty little film , but one that played for most of the summer , solely off the back of its 3D gimmickry .
And said gimmickry was out in force , with the film feeling like a feature length version of those old 3D cinemas you used to get in theme parks .
Any excuse to lug something unconvincingly towards the camera was not resisted , and the end result was a film that coasted by on its 3D work , and little else .
Given that it took over $ 100 m at the US box office as a result , it ’s unsurprising that a sequel is on the way .
Yet Journey To The Center Of The Earth Again , or whatever the sequel may be called , will have a far tougher time when it finally arrives .
For it now seems that there ’s not a major movie studio out there that ’s not trying to frantically re-tool releases old and new to make the most of the 3D ‘ revolution ’ while it ’s in its infancy , and arguably audience interest is at its highest .
Raiding through the archives , films such as the Toy Storys , Beauty And The Beast , Titanic , Star Wars and Lord Of The Rings are all rumoured or have been confirmed for the 3D treatment .
I ’m always cautious about ‘ retrofitting ’ such an effect to material that was n’t intended for 3D transmission in the first place , but nonetheless , I suspect I ’ll be buying a couple of tickets for some of those anyway , intrigued to see just what difference 3D will make .
Studios are falling over themselves to add 3D to their existing slate , too , no matter how far into production certain films are .
Take the recent Ice Age : Dawn Of The Dinosaurs .
This was a two and a half to three year production , yet when we spoke to one of the project ’s lead animators ( link at the bottom of the article ) , he revealed that the notion of it being released in 3D was n’t there from day one .
Instead , a stereoscopic team was brought in , with less than a year of production left , to add the necessary effects .
That , to us , sounds more like jumping on a bandwagon rather than attempting to properly integrate 3D into a motion picture .
I 'm not talking about the mere existence of these people ; of course both parties have their nut - wings .
I 'm talking about the willingness of the party 's establishment to pander to them , to embrace and utilize them .
Upright , respectable Republicans have often , in the past , privately recoiled from the pitchfork brigade in their midst ; Eisenhower found McCarthy despicable and Nixon distasteful , for example , and Nixon himself , during his presidential years , held Agnew in contempt .
George H. W. Bush restricted Atwater 's machinations to the times he regarded himself as being in " campaign mode , " an implicitly unsavory state of existence from which he tried to distance himself when no election was in the immediate offing .
But with the arguable exception of Lyndon Johnson 's " Daisy " ad , I can't think of anything comparable to the ad hominem red meat the Republicans have been willing to throw to their base as an integral component of their political strategy .
They may have disdained these people when they were in their sitting rooms and salons , but they found them invaluable in the arena .
The current birther nonsense is the latest manifestation .
It is n't so much that this mindless drivel , repeatedly disproved with incontrovertible documentation and rendered implausible by the promptings of simple common sense , persists in the nutosphere .
One expects lunacy from guys who live in their parents ' basements and spend their days staring at computer screens .
What 's distressing is the unwillingness of respectable or at least influential public figures , the Sean Hannitys and Rush Limbaughs and Liz Cheneys and G. Gordon Liddys , not to mention twelve sitting members of Congress , to disavow it .
They must know better .
They do know better .
They often phrase their suspicions in coy ways that prove they know better but are trying to squeeze a few drops of political advantage out of it just the same .
Something troubling has happened to the Republican Party in the last twenty years or so , and it demonstrates why these tactics are always a bad idea , even if they win you the occasional election .
The respectable , responsible wing of the Republican Party , the wing that for decades thought it could use its crazies but still control them , has been unhorsed .
The crazies are in the saddle .
The sorry spectacle of the noble John McCain forced continually to kowtow to the religious right wing honchos of his party during last year 's presidential campaign , and his evident although only intermittent pain at being confronted with what he had thereby unleashed ; the transparent and pusillanimous eagerness of Mitt Romney in pursuit of his party 's approval to disavow almost everything he has ever stood for in public life ; the willingness of putatively serious conservative pundits to defend and even laud the indefensible and incoherent Sarah Palin ; the reduction of a once - proud political philosophy to a set of simple - minded bromides and shibboleths , combined with vitriolic , dishonest , and irrelevant personal attacks on the other side ... these bespeak a party that has lost not only its way , but its soul .
If you 're willing to keep on telling your supporters that the other side fucks pigs , at some point they may actually believe it , and beyond that , they may think pig- fucking is what elections are about .
Sun Microsystems '
OpenSolaris project has quietly announced the operating system that just added support for Sparc has now been ported to ARM - commonly used in embedded devices , handhelds and , increasingly , netbooks .
It is perhaps an indication of how just stressful things are at Sun these days , with the $ 5.6bn acquisition by Oracle hanging over it combined with what 's shaping up as terrible fiscal fourth - quarter results coming ahead of the crucial July 16 vote by shareholders on the Oracle deal , that no one at Sun or OpenSolaris mentioned the ARM port was coming when announcing OpenSolaris 2009.06 last week .
The leader for the ARM port of OpenSolaris is William Kucharski , who leads the PowerPC and container development efforts for Solaris and who is also the leader of the port to IBM's System z mainframes .
IBM and Sun made some noise about this mainframe port last November when IBM finally and officially sanctioned the deployment of OpenSolaris on mainframe engines configured originally to run Linux .
Since then , this Sirius variant of OpenSolaris has gone about as far as the Polaris port for Power iron : just this side of nowhere .
Late last year , Sun announced that OpenSolaris was supported on Intel 's Atom processors .
It is hard to imagine there is a lot of room for OpenSolaris on the kinds of devices served bv Atom - based processors , a market where Linux is finding a home and Windows could extend its existing PC hegemony .
Linux is being customized by many different projects - there 's Google 's Android and Intel 's Moblin for netbooks and possibly for so - called " smartbooks " - plus the question of whether Microsoft will port the Windows client operating system commonly found on laptops and desktops to ARM .
Windows Mobile already runs on ARM - based phones .
Then again , a good device can drive the operating systems ’ sale .
Look at the iPhone .
End users and consumers buying these new classes of computers do n't really care what the operating system is , even if the vendor does .
And that means OpenSolaris might have a better chance on netbooks and smartbooks and other devices than it does on the desktop .
Of course , this would have to be true by definition , since OpenSolaris has very little chance on desktops outside of the Solaris developer community .
One problem with OpenSolaris on ARM - based machines is the relative lack of applications .
OpenSolaris 2009.06 has 1,700 applications , as this review of the operating system at Ars Technica correctly pointed out , a lot lower than the 26,000 packages in the Ubuntu repository , for example .
While the OpenSolaris repository has most of what developers need to create code as part of their day jobs or hobbies , ARM - based machines are all about end - user applications .
The OpenSolaris ARM port , as you can see from the updated OpenSolaris 2008.05 release notes , is actually based on the initial 2008.05 Project Indiana release of OpenSolaris , which is now two releases behind .
The ARM port is specifically for NEC's NaviEngine 1 multicore system - on - chip ARM processor and a reference board outlined in the release notes .
There ’s no word on when the ARM port will catch up and be part of the standard releases , or when other ARM chips and products will get support . ®

Despite the NoSQL movement trying to flag traditional databases as a dying breed , the RDBMS keeps evolving and adding new powerful weapons to its arsenal .
In this talk we 'll explore Common Table Expressions ( SQL - 99 ) and how SQL handles recursion , breaking the bi-dimensional barriers and paving the way to more complex data structures like trees and graphs , and how we can replicate features from social networks and recommendation systems .
We 'll also have a look at window functions ( SQL:2003 ) and the advanced reporting features they make finally possible .
The first part of this talk will cover several different techniques to model a tree data structure into a relational database : parent - child ( adjacency list ) model , materialized path , nested sets , nested intervals , hybrid models , Common Table Expressions .
Then we 'll move one step forward and see how we can model a more complex data structure , i.e. a graph , with concrete examples from today 's websites .
Starting from real - world examples of social networks ' and recommendation systems ' features , and with the help of some graph theory , this talk will explain how to represent and traverse a graph in the database .
Finally , we will take a look at Window Functions and how they can be useful for data analytics and simple inline aggregations , among other things .
All the examples have been tested on PostgreSQL >= 8.4

I. Introduction
The time was 13:00 approximately a week before this report 's composition .
I had just woken up , well - rested , and called to get a bit of ( weak ) cocaine , and on the way out I discovered that the sample containing several capsules of the aforementioned dose of mephedrone ( purportedly ) had arrived .
The package was not held in customs for an inordinate amount of time , and there was no indication that it had been opened at any point between the sender and me .
Returning about an hour later , I examined the sample .
The bag smelled strongly of cocktail shrimp or some other seafood -- pretty unpleasant -- and the capsule exteriors became rather sticky on contact with water .
I 'm not sure if this was because of residual compound or because of the gelatin , but my fingers were coated with a foul residue after minimal contact .
I had to use soap and warm water to get it off my hands each time after handling the capsules .
The powder itself was very tractable and seemingly not hygroscopic after six hours of sitting out at 28 degrees C . No breaking up was necessary to prepare 100 mg for insufflation .
It did not appreciably stick to the razor or glass , and there was no subjective change in the potency of a full capsule 's content exposed for the same time .
I was completely naive of this chemical before this experiment .
I decided to take notes .
My handwriting is ( I 'm told ) very neat for a guy , and one can easily see its getting progressively worse as the experienced continued because I was compelled to write faster and faster up to a certain point , after which I put zero effort into forming identifiable symbols .
It 's pretty funny , actually .
Note that items in square brackets are my comments / corrections for clarity upon writing this report .
I can remember the experience and writing these notes as vividly as anything else from the past week .
II .

Soon after , I insufflated the 100mg , and it was acutely painful initially ; I definitely did n't want to do it again .
I did not notice a very strong effect , but at this point it was hard to gauge reactions because I began redosing orally every hour until I had only one left .
This stuff is extremely more - ish .
III .
Drug InteractionsWith Cocaine------- The cocaine I had , as I said , was quite heavily cut , and there was n't an appreciable synergy between the two when I insufflated 30mg of the mixture during one of the ( extremely weak ) peaks of the subsequent doses - - towards the end .
There was perhaps an enhancement of cocaine 's time - slowing effect .
The mephedrone was so overpowering that I consider this a total loss of the money spent on that ( albeit tiny ) portion ; it may have not been the case with stronger material or with a higher dose , but my nose was already quite sensitive because of the mephedrone .
It never bled , though .
With Nicotine ------- Nicotine seemed to be a bit synergistic in terms of stimulation , and I did cheat once and have a Newport before I smoked a bowl of cannabis .
It was nice and buzzing for a couple of minutes , and it definitely quenched my desire for a cigarette for the rest of the night .
However , this could easily be attributable to the fact that I am in the process of quitting and do n't have more than one or two cigarettes a day ( and Newports are heavy hitters , especially compared to painfully slow - releasing gum ) .
With Cannabis------- Mid-grade cannabis was a pleasant and much - welcomed additive at the end of the night before I went to bed , as it usually is .
The spatial effects were very pronounced , and the sweating was controlled , which was nice .
There was significant audio distortion with anything that was n't music , and time was highly slowed when listening to music .
Rather nice indeed .
IV .
The Bad NewsAcute Negative Effects ( Absolute First Dose ) ------- Profound feeling of cold ; profuse , shrimpy - smelling ( disgusting ) sweating ; very light nausea ; headache .
Kind of like having an extremely mild fever .
Binging Effects / The Next Day ------- I took approximately 1820 mg over twelve hours .
This was incredibly stupid and irresponsible of me !
The only effect that carried on the entire night was the bubble - like hallucinations , and I was sweating the whole time ; the clothes I was in and my bed sheet had to be washed because they had that odor .
Thankfully , I did n't have any trouble sleeping after I stopped taking it , nor did I dream / remember a dream ( but that 's typical ) .
I strongly caution against using the extreme amount I took as an indication of safety ; I am generally very healthy , but I also tend to diminish the severity of less - than - enjoyable drug experiences for various ( dumb and immature ) reasons .
Of course , I had to take the last capsule .
Re-dosing the next evening on an empty stomach ( I had eaten hours earlier ) and on only a few hours of sleep led to an experience similar to the first time , but there was no bubbling , definitely more nausea , and it subsided very quickly .
Just as well , because by the peak I wanted it to end .
I chewed a vitamin pill in the hope that it would change something , but no .
Afterwards , I did n't feel good at all .
The nausea rose as the drug subsided , and eventually I threw up multiple times -- to the point where a foamy mix of protein and acid was coming out .
Each time I knew I was going to throw up again , but it was painfully slow to come .
The first time it happened , I opened my eyes and there was blood running out of my nose and into the sink , which scared the hell out of me .
My senses were also uncomfortably heightened , and my balance was very off .
It was not unlike having a deep sinus infection : in short , awful .
I should have thrown the last capsule away , but I wanted to see how my body would react .
Stupid .
Of course , I may not have had such a bad reaction if I had n't binged the night before , but I can't say that for certain ; it does n't work like that with the friendly chemicals I usually partake of , even if I do it heavily , but I had a similar experience with my first two ( and only two ) recreational doses of DXM .
I did not insufflate any more of the cocaine that day before or after , and I felt that cannabis would make coming down worse in that case , though I had smoked a bowl hours earlier after eating .
The next day , I felt fine for the most part .
I was quite irritable for most of the morning , and I was totally aware of it yet could n't keep myself from snapping .
Bleh .
There was also still some effect on my balance .
V. Retrospective / Summary
The first dose was pleasurable , but overall I regret buying such a large quantity .
If there was magic here , I certainly lost it over the course of a couple of days .
Worryingly , it was much more acutely psychologically addicting than MDMA / MDMA adulterated with methamphetamine , Bk - MBDB and the various piperazine combinations I 've had ( though I will certainly place my satisfaction with this above that of those nasty pipes or of Bk - MBDB ! ) .
Hell , I felt more like doing this the next day than I felt like getting to my cocaine , and that 's even after having a bad experience .
This propensity for addiction has been echoed across the internet .
Fortunately , it does n't seem to be anywhere near as physically addictive as methamphetamine .
As of a week after the experience , I 'm not interested at all in getting more ( past the background desire of my generally addictive personality , but even that 's weak towards this stuff ) , and I can't notice any withdrawal symptoms .
In fact , reflecting on some of the things I 've written made my stomach churn .
Lastly , there is apparently VERY , VERY little information available about this particular research chemical .
Scouring the internet returned almost no real scientific information about it .
This is precisely reason I took the hours to write this report , so please keep what I 've said in mind .
I really , really do n't want to read about anymore of my brothers and sisters in the exploration of consciousness becoming ill or dying from this stupid drug .

There have been disputes over discussing creationism in science
An exam board has scrapped a GCSE biology question about creationism after admitting it could be misleading .
The Assessment and Qualifications Alliance paper asked pupils how the Bible 's theory of creation seeks to explain the origins of life .
AQA stressed that pupils taking its biology GCSE were not required to study creationism as a scientific theory .
But it admitted that describing it as a " theory " could be misleading , and said it would review the wording of papers .
The review was prompted by a complaint from teachers and a university lecturer .
' Misleading '
In a statement , AQA said : " Merely asking a question about creationism and intelligent design does not imply support for these ideas .
" Neither idea is included in our specification and AQA does not support the teaching of these ideas as scientific . "
Nonetheless , the candidates were expected to have some understanding of it .
A spokeswoman explained that pupils had been asked to match up several theories , including the Biblical theory of creation , with descriptions of them .
She said pupils were not taught creationism as a valid scientific theory but that it would be strange not to mention it when discussing Darwinism .
AQA added : " The use of the term ' theory ' was intended in its common , everyday sense .
" However , we accept that in the context of a science examination this could be misleading and we will be addressing this issue for any future questions . "
The row over whether creationism has a place in the science classroom has been debated for some time .
Last year , this issue led to the resignation of Professor Michael Reiss as director of education at the Royal Society .
Department for Children , Schools and Families advises that creationism is tackled in religious education classes but not as part of a science syllabus .
Leinenkugel ’s Summer Shandy
J. Leinenkugel Brewing Company , Chippewa Falls , WI
Info : “ Get a taste of the freshest flavor under the sun !
A Shandy is a lemonade - flavored beer , A European favorite during the Summer months .
Each batch is carefully brewed using the finest wheat , malted barley , and just a hint of real Wisconsin honey . ”
Though I have certainly said it before , the fact bares repeating : the 12 - pack beer sampler box is such an amazing gift .
With a selection of four different beers , you ’d regularly have to either grab four six - packs ( even I ’m not that addicted ) or find a place where you can make your own .
But even then you would n’t get three of each flavor .
Nice .
Unfortunately , I do n’t often go for the Leinenkugel’s .
I do n’t know why , maybe it ’s because I got fully immune to them after a year drinking nearly nothing but whe I was in college in the U.P .
Whatever the case , I really need to rethink my selection options since I ’ve been really missing out on some awesome brews .
One in particular is this very glass I ’m currently looking at : Summer Shandy .
As it says right up there in the description , this is indeed a lemonade - flavored beer .
Not so much so that it ’s in the neighborhood of a Jack ’s Hard Lemonade , but it is definitely a tart and citrusy ale to be sure .
It ’s about a pale as you can get and still have a coy hint of yellow .
It reminds a bit of Bell ’s Oberon in not only its hue , but also its rindy and crisp nose .
The head is sparing and only leaves a trace of lacing .
The taste .
My goodness , this is something almost magical .
It is quite reminiscent of someone having dissolved a lemon Jolly Rancher into a Pilsner beer .
It ’s tart - but nicely so and not overtly harsh like it certainly could have been .
The lemon and honey mouth feel do , ever so slightly , bring to mind thoughts of an herbal cough drop .
I know , I know , that instantly dredges up fears of drinking a liquid lozenge , but it ’s not like that at all : it ’s a splendid taste blend that works fine for the beer itself .
The Shandy is fantastically refreshing and crisp and is such a nice change from the standard ‘ fruity ’ brews that seem to be inundating the stores of late .
The more you drink it , the more you want to .
I very much appreciate the way a ‘ small - batch ’ brewery like Leinenkugel ’s has perfected a craft they ’ve been working on since 1867 ; their art shows through in a well - rounded and excellent Summer selection .
Try it with a burger …
I did !
Rating : * * * * 1/2
Lemon and honey play very well together on this beer : an excellent choice for the hot summer .
Revised From May 14 , 2017
by Henry Makow PhD .
My life was dysfunctional until the age of 50 partly because I accepted the feminist assumptions purveyed by the mass media .
I never imagined the financial elite is engaged in a war to destabilize society by trashing heterosexual roles .
This government hate attack on the traditional family continues unabated today .
The purpose is to create a totalitarian New World Order where people are socially isolated and mind controlled .
Like millions of men , I was let " off the hook " by sexual liberation and feminism .
Instead of becoming a husband and father , I was free to have sex and search for my " identity . "
Often sex and identity were confused .
I did n't understand that men mature and find purpose by assuming the responsibility of marriage and family .
As a result , I suffered from arrested development ( immaturity ) and missed my opportunity to have a family .
What follows is an antidote to elite feminist propaganda .
I do n't want young men to make the same mistakes i did .
1 . The creation of a strong and loving family is perhaps the highest goal to which a man can aspire .
This is the natural process by which men ( and women ) grow over a lifetime .
This is how we find love and intimacy .
It is n't for everyone but for most , it is the path to happiness .
2 . Stop listening to the media , your peer group or parents .
" Trust thy self , " Emerson says in Self Reliance ( 1841 ) " Whoso would be a man , must be a nonconformist . "
What are your instincts telling you ?
For example , I always knew I wanted to rule my own roost but feminism prohibited this .
Obey your instincts .
3 . Make work ( not women ) your passion .
Work is the backbone of a man .
Men gain self - confidence from performing a task well , and receiving reward and recognition .
Women may try to come between a man and his work but do n't let them .
Do n't let anyone or anything thwart your gift .
Women do not respect men who make them their first priority .
Your work will keep you on course and help you to avoid temptation .
4 . Do n't mistake sexual attraction for love .
Our society makes female beauty and sex into a phoney religion in order to distract us .
Sex and beauty soon become tedious .
The magic ends .
Do not marry someone based on sexual infatuation .
Real love develops over a long period of time and is based on mutual dependence , trust and caring .
5 . Do not put beautiful women on a pedestal .
They is no relationship between a woman 's appearance and her character .
Beautiful women are flawed like everyone else .
They 're much more trouble because of their sense of entitlement .
6 . Never show weakness .
In courtship , do n't appear eager .
Women interpret this as weakness .
Keep your dignity .
Nothing earns her respect quicker than rejection .
Men think they 'll be loved for their sterling qualities .
This is not so .
Women are focused on themselves .
They 're looking for men who make them feel secure .
They want men who exude confidence .
If you 're insecure , find a woman who has lower self esteem than you .
7 . The best way to fight sex addiction is to get married .
Sex without love is degrading and dehumanizing .
Sexual liberation is not wanting sex ( because you have it . )
Sex is used to manipulate us .
People would n't be sexually frustrated if they got married at a young age as they did in the 1950's and started families .
Women should marry and have kids before going to university ; men after beginning their careers .
8 . Do not marry a woman who does n't make you and her family her first priority .
Do you want to share your wife with her boss ?
If you have an aim in life , why marry someone who does n't support it ?
Or has a competing agenda ?
In the marketplace of love , men have the power .
Our fertility lasts three times as long as theirs .
We 're the buyers .
There are plenty of fine women , especially if we look abroad .
9 . Real women are self - effacing .
They put their husbands and their children before themselves .
This is how women show love : by self - surrender .
Avoid the four - C's : Women who compete , control , criticize or complain .
Avoid women who are overachievers or neurotic .
Do n't get hung up on unavailable women .
They 're are n't as special as they think .
Choose a wife who complements you and is a good companion .
Do n't look for your " female counterpart . "
( You 're looking for yourself . )
Choose one who has qualities you lack and will be a good mother .
10 . Being possessive is natural .
A man wants to possess a woman .
Women want to be possessed .
In the act of love , a man " possesses " a woman .
Total love equals total possession .
This is not the same as domination .
It is a partnership based on mutual trust and respect .
My wife does not share my political views or read my website .
11 . Your seed ( semen ) is your unique spirit and essence .
Would you entrust it to a vulgar or mediocre woman just because she 's attractive ?
Ideally we would only have sex with a woman we would want to mother our children .
This is why sex was reserved for marriage .
12 . Children represent your organic growth .
They are an extension of yourself .
The media is doing a number on us .
How often do we see children portrayed in a positive light ?
As the angels they often are ?
We are rich in proportion to the things we love .
The highest love is between husband and wife , and parents and children .
13 . Do n't waste your time " looking for God . "
We find God by serving and obeying Him .
God speaks through our sense of right and wrong , and ideals of absolute truth , justice and love .
We are not men if we refuse to sacrifice our " selves " to God ( i.e. obey ) .
Truth is liberating even if the truth is about our present bondage .
14 .
You are not the voice in your head .
We cohabit with a monkey .
Do n't be deceived or upset by how mean and vulgar his thoughts often are .
They 're not you .
You are a spark of Divine consciousness housed in the body of an evolved ape .
Your job is to train the ape by training the shared mind .
Some of this was common knowledge when I was a child in the 1950's .
Over the years , the Illuminati have gradually undermined the natural order by promoting homosexuality which includes sexual liberation and lesbianism in the guise of feminism .
An establishment that sows fear and confusion between the sexes , and promotes promiscuity and family breakdown does not have the country 's best interest at heart .
Many of our feminist political , cultural and economic " leaders " are moral whores , dupes , traitors and often worse .
We resist them by building strong healthy families and giving our children wholesome values .

What 's Gambit ?
Gambit consists of two main programs : gsi , the Gambit Scheme interpreter , and gsc , the Gambit Scheme compiler .
The interpreter contains the complete execution and debugging environment .
The compiler is the interpreter extended with the capability of generating executable files .
The compiler can produce standalone executables or compiled modules which can be loaded at run time .
Interpreted code and compiled code can be freely mixed .
Gambit - C is a version of the Gambit programming system in which the compiler generates portable C code .
The main features of Gambit - C are :
Conformance .
The Gambit - C system conforms to the R4RS , R5RS and IEEE Scheme standards and implements all optional features .
Tail calls and first class continuations conform to the Scheme semantics .
The full numeric tower is implemented , including : arbitrary precision integers ( bignums ) , rationals , inexact reals ( floating point numbers ) , and complex numbers .
Several extensions to Scheme are provided , including : lightweight threads , a foreign - function interface ( FFI ) , and extended I/O capabilities ( Unicode , networking , subprocesses , ... ) .

Several extensions to Scheme are provided , including : lightweight threads , a foreign - function interface ( FFI ) , and extended I/O capabilities ( Unicode , networking , subprocesses , ... ) .
Portability .
Because the system is mostly written in Scheme and the compiler generates portable C code , it is easy to port the system as well as programs compiled with it to any platform with a decent C or C++ compiler .
There is no reliance on a particular C compiler , although the system can take advantage of some gcc - specific constructs .
The C code generated is oblivious to the endianness and word size of the target environment ( 32 and 64 bit architectures are currently supported ) .
There are no external library dependencies , and OS API dependencies can be removed so as to run directly on the bare metal .
The system includes high - performance bignum support utilizing sophisticated algorithms , implemented in Scheme .

Performance .
The compiler includes several powerful program transformations such as user procedure inlining , partial - evaluation , and lambda - lifting .
With appropriate declarations in the source code the executable programs generated by the compiler run roughly as fast as equivalent C programs .
Programs containing no declarations are also optimized without compromising the Scheme semantics by speculatively inlining predefined procedures ( see the benchmarks page for a comparison with other Scheme implementations and other languages ) .
Thanks to an efficient implementation of continuations , the thread system is very efficient and can support millions of concurrent threads .

Reliability .
Stable releases typically have very few bugs .
Bug tracking is done with the issue tracker on github .
Gambit - C has been used to develop large - scale real - world software and services in academic and commercial settings .
An overview of the Gambit system was presented by Marc Feeley at the 2010 International Lisp Conference .

Since ownership plays a major role in race - free programming , it will be the first topic in my proposal for a race - free system .
I presented the bird ’s eye view of the system and provided a few teasers in my previous post .
The design is based on published papers ( see bibliography at the end ) .
My contribution was to integrate several ideas into one package .
When I showed this proposal to my friends they either did n’t believe it could work or considered it too complex , depending which end they were looking at .
From users ’ perspective , the system looks relatively simple , so the natural reaction is :
That ca n’t work .
If you get into the details of why it works , and how the compiler knows you are in danger of a data race , you need some theory , and that is complex .
So I decided to deal with some theory first , to show that the things work .
If you ’re not into theory , just look at the examples .
They are usually simple to understand .
Owners
The ownership relationship is necessary to establish a tree - like structure among objects .
This is needed by the compiler to decide which lock , if any , is responsible for the protection of each object , and take it when necessary .
Simply speaking , the lock at the root of each tree protects the rest of the tree .
If you think that your multithreaded programs do n’t follow a tree structure , look at them closely .
If they do n’t , you either already have data races or are likely to develop them in the future .
- Every object has an owner
The owner may be another object–usually the embedding object .
In the example below :
class Foo { void doWork ( ) { _bar.doWork ( ) ; } private Bar _bar ; } auto foo = new Foo ;
the embedded object _bar is owned , at runtime , by the object foo ( I repeat , the concrete object , not the class Foo ) .
This is the default ownership relationship for embedded objects , so no special notation is needed to establish it ( I ’ll show later how to override this default ) .
There are also special symbolic “ owners ” that are used for the roots of ownership trees :
thread ,
, self ,
, unique , and
, and immutable .
unique and immutable are included in this list for convenience .
I ’ll discuss them later .
- Trees
Every object has just one owner for life , a condition necessary to create ownership trees that can be checked at compile time .
Every tree has a single root and a lock is attached to that root , if needed .
The ownership information is embedded in the type of the object .
Using this information , the compiler is able to deduce which lock must be held while accessing that object , and what kind of aliasing is allowed .
All races ( access to mutable shared variables without locking ) are detected at compile time .
I ’ll sketch a proof later .
- What may be shared
Only immutable objects or objects rooted with a self - owned object may be shared between threads .
Additionally , objects whose direct owner is self ( such objects are called monitors ) may have multiple aliases while being shared .
Monitors may own ( and protect ) other objects that are not monitors .
- Locking
The compiler will make sure that access to an object can only happen when the root of its ownership tree is locked ( symbolic owners other than self are considered locked at all times ) .
Since an object may only have one lock associated with it ( at the top of its ownership tree ) , this condition is enough to ensure freedom from races .
Proof : I have to show that when a ( mutable ) object is seen by more than one thread , each access to it ( read or write ) is always protected by the same lock .
Indeed , for an object to be shared between threads , the root of its ownership tree must be self , hence the top object must be a monitor .
This monitor ’s lock is always , automatically or explicitly , taken before accessing any member of the tree .
The compiler knows which lock to take because the ownership information is encoded in the type of the object .
Introducing ownership annotations
Ownership is specified at the instance level ( although it may be restricted at the class level ) .
The previous example , which relied on default assignment of owners , is equivalent to the more explicit instance - level specification ( that you will never see in actual programs ) :
Foo <owner : : thread > foo = new Foo<owner : : thread > ;
This declares and constructs foo as being owned by the symbolic owner , thread .
The embedded object _bar ‘s owner is foo .
- Creating a monitor
A self - owned object is a monitor ( I will alternate between the notation using shared type modifier or explicit owner annotation , < owner : : self > ) .
It contains a hidden lock and its methods are , by default , synchronized .
Continuing with my example :
auto fooMon = new shared Foo ; //
The same as : // auto fooMon = new Foo< owner :: self > ; fooMon.doWork ( ) ;
The variable fooMon is a monitor and the doWork method is implicitly synchronized .
The object _bar is now owned by fooMon .
Its type can be expressed ( this is rarely needed , however see the example of external ownership ) as :
Bar<owner :: fooMon >
Types parameterized by runtime entities ( fooMon is a runtime handle ) are known in programming language theory as dependent types .
Notice that I ’m using the same class to create thread - local and shared instances .
This is usually possible unless there is a specific restriction at the class level .
Note to D programmers :
The current semantics of D “ shared ” is slightly different from my proposal .
For instance , it forces all embedded objects to be monitors ( their methods must be synchronized by their own lock ) , requires explicit use of the synchronized keyword , and forces all access in non-synchronized methods to be sequentially consistent .
( And it does n’t guarantee freedom from races . )
Thread - local objects
The special thread owner , which is the owner of all thread - local objects , is conceptually always locked , so thread - local objects do n’t require any synchronization .
Also , thread is the default owner so , in the absence of any ownership annotations , all objects are thread - local .
That ’s one of the defaults that makes single - threaded programs work as -is .
Here ’s an interesting twist–global and static objects are by default thread - local .
This part has been implemented in D , uncovering a number of threading bugs in the process .
Monitors
The special self owner ( or the shared type modifier ) is used to create monitor objects .
A monitor has a built - in lock and all its public methods are by default synchronized .
As always with defaults , the language must provide a ( preferably safe ) way to bypass them .
To prevent locking , a method may be explicitly marked as lockfree .
The compiler is obliged to check if the lockfree method does n’t access the object ’s members in a non-safe way ( although it ca n’t prevent high - level races on lockfree variables ) .
That restricts the lockfree constructs to those that do n’t require whole - program analysis to prove their safety .
The lockfree annotation is essential for , among others , the double - checked locking pattern ( DCLP ) .
I showed its implementation as a teaser in my previous post .
Subobjects
As I explained earlier , data members of an object are by default owned by that object .
This way they inherit the root owner from their parent .
This is another default that makes single - threaded programs run without additional qualifiers .
Notice that there are two important aspects of ownership , the direct owner and the root owner , which might be different .
The direct owner is used in type - checking , the root owner in deciding which synchronization method to use .
Both are known or inferred during compilation .
As usual , the defaults may be overridden .
For instance , you may embed a monitor in a thread - local object by qualifying it as self - owned / shared :
class Holder { private Mon<owner : : self > _mon ; }
or , in common notation , as shared :
class Holder { private shared Mon _mon ; }
Here , _mon is not owned by Holder ( the default has been overridden ) so it does n’t inherit its root owner .
Its methods are synchronized by its own lock .
As you can see , ownership tree not always reflects embedding .
An embedded monitor starts a new tree .
Well , the situation is a bit subtler .
Objects in Java or D have reference semantics , so there is a hidden pointer , or handle , in the code above .
Accessing the handle is not the same as accessing the object proper .
Consider this example :
class Holder { private shared Mon _mon ; public setMon ( shared Mon newMon ) { _mon = newMon ; } }
Let ’s instantiate a self - owned Holder and a self - owned Mon :
auto holder = new shared Holder ; auto newMon = new shared Mon ; holder.setMon(newMon ) ;
Since holder is itself a monitor , the setMon method is automatically synchronized by its lock ( it must be ! ) .
Therefore , strictly speaking , the handle part of _mon is owned by holderMon , whereas the object - proper part is self - owned .
You cannot embed a thread - owned object inside a monitor –the compiler would flag it as an error .
This is part of alias control–a thread - local object might possibly have thread - local aliases that may be accessed without locking .
Being part of a monitor , it could then migrate to another thread and cause a race .
What if a subobject is accessed directly ( not through a method ) ?
This may happen when the subobject is declared public :
class Foo { public Bar _bar ; }
In that case not all uses of _bar are allowed .
Consider this :
auto foo = new shared Foo ; foo._bar.m( ) ; // error
Access to _bar must happen only when foo is locked .
The compiler knows it because the full type of _bar is :
Bar <owner : : foo >
Here ’s the corrected code :
synchronized ( foo ) { foo._bar.m( ) ; }
An even better solution is to make _bar private and provide appropriate methods to access it .
Those methods would be automatically synchronized for a shared foo .
unique and immutable
I discussed unique objects in one of my previous posts .
Although not strictly required in the ownership scheme , uniqueness allows for very efficient and safe transmission of large objects between threads .
It makes sense to include unique as another symbolic root owner , since its multithreaded semantics is different from other types and it does n’t require locking .
Some languages , including D , define immutable objects , which cannot be modified after creation .
Such objects may be freely shared and passed by reference between threads .
Again , immutable may be used as a root owner .
Example
With the preliminaries out of the way , I can now explain in more detail the workings of the teaser from my previous post .
Here ’s the definition of the class MVar :
class MVar <T> { private : T _msg ; bool _full ; public : void put ( T msg ) { _msg := msg ; // move _full = true ; notify ( ) ; } T take ( ) { while ( ! _full ) wait ( ) ; _full = false ; return := _msg ; } }
First , let ’s instantiate MVar as a shared ( self - owned ) monitor that is used to pass unique objects of class Foo as messages :
auto chanUnique = new shared MVar< unique Foo > ;
The type of _msg in this instantiation is unique Foo , which is the same as Foo<owner : : unique > .
The method put takes unique Foo , so the following code is type - correct :
auto foo = new unique Foo ; chanUnique.put ( := foo ) ; // move foo
Notice that unique objects cannot be assigned or passed by value–they have to be moved , hence the use of the move operator , := .
Internally , the method put also uses the move operator ( good thinking on the part of the designer –otherwise MVar could n’t be instantiated with unique ) .
What ’s interesting about this example is that messages are not deep - copied between threads .
They are safely passed by reference .
Since chanUnique is self - owned ( shared ) , both put and get are automatically synchronized .
Now let ’s access chanUnique from another thread :
// another thread unique Foo f2 = chanUnique.get ( ) ; // implicit move of rvalue
The return type of get is unique Foo , so the types check .
I could have used the move operator , but since the right hand side is an rvalue , the compiler lets me use the assignment .
Now for the tricky case :
What ’s wrong with this code ?
auto mVar = new shared MVar < Foo > ; auto myFoo = new Foo ; m Var.put( myFoo ) ; myFoo.unsyncMethod ( ) ; // ouch !
Since myFoo is created as thread - local ( that ’s the default ) , its methods are not synchronized .
If I were able to pass it to shared MVar , another thread could obtain it through get .
It could then call the unsynchronized method unsyncMethod at the moment when I was calling it .
A data race would be possible !
Or would it ?
Guess what –the compiler wo n’t let you shoot yourself in the foot .
It will notice that it would have to instantiate a shared object mVar with a thread - local member _msg .
That ’s against the rules !
( A shared object cannot own a thread - local object . )
External ownership
In the original GRFJ paper the authors showed an example where one object was owned by another object without the former being embedded in the latter .
They made an observation that , for the purpose of locking , the ownership relationship must be unchangeable :
You ca n’t switch the owner on the fly .
Therefore external ownership is allowed only if the owner is declared final .
final shared Lock lock Obj = new shared Lock ; auto foo = new Foo<owner::lockObj > ; auto bar = new Bar< owner::lockObj > ;
In this case , the compiler will only allow access to foo under the lock of lock Obj , as in :
synchronized ( lockObj ) { foo.method ( ) ; bar.method ( ) ; }
This construct is useful in situations where the locking discipline is not easily convertible to object hierarchy .
Conclusion
You might have noticed my use of dual notation .
Most user code would be written with type qualifiers such as shared , unique , or immutable .
However , in some cases I used an alternative notation that looked more like the specification of template parameters : < owner : : self > , < owner : :unique > , < owner : : immutable > , or even < owner : : thread > ( in D they would be surrounded by ! ( and ) ) .
This was not meant to further confuse the reader , but as a gentle introduction to qualifier polymorphism , which I will describe in the next installment .
I will show how classes and methods may be parameterized with different types of ownership , cutting down code duplication .
I ’d like to thank Andrei Alexandrescu , Walter Bright , Sean Kelly and Jason House for very helpful comments .
I ’m also indebted to the D community for discussing my previous posts .
