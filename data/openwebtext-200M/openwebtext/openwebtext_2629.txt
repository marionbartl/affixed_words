The two crew members of the hijacked helicopter were unhurt A convicted sex offender and cult leader has escaped by helicopter from a prison on the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion , officials say .
Juliano Verbard , 27 , serving a 15 - year term , and two followers , were pulled on to the helicopter by three accomplices .
The accomplices had pretended to be tourists when boarding the helicopter , but then forced the pilot to land in the prison grounds before flying off .
They then landed a few hundred metres away , and drove off in a waiting van .
The island 's police force said a major search was now under way for Verbard and his fellow prisoners , Alexin Jismy and Fabrice Michel .
One of them put a gun to my temple while another threatened to set fire to a bottle of petrol he had in his hand with a cigarette lighter
Pilot of hijacked helicopter Verbard , the leader of the pseudo - religious cult , the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary , was jailed in 2008 for rape and sex attacks on children , and the other two for their roles in a kidnap .
At the time of his trial , psychiatrist Gerard Toulfayan described Verbard as an " extremely powerful manipulator with great intelligence " .
The two helicopter crew members were unhurt .
The pilot later told a local radio station about the hijacking : " One of them put a gun to my temple while another threatened to set fire to a bottle of petrol he had in his hand with a cigarette lighter . "
" You see , they had nothing more to lose .
They were ready to blow it up , ready to die . "

On August 1 , 1966 , the day psychiatrist Stuart Brown started his assistant professorship at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , 25 - year - old Charles Whitman climbed to the top of the University of Texas Tower on the Austin campus and shot 46 people .
Whitman , an engineering student and a former U.S. Marine sharpshooter , was the last person anyone expected to go on a killing spree .
After Brown was assigned as the state ’s consulting psychiatrist to investigate the incident and later , when he interviewed 26 convicted Texas murderers for a small pilot study , he discovered that most of the killers , including Whitman , shared two things in common : they were from abusive families , and they never played as kids .
According to the industry , nuclear energy is on the verge of an enormous resurgence , fulfilling the promise that was thwarted by the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island reactor accidents , the Washington Public Power Supply System financial collapse , and other misadventures .
These upbeat accounts point to new technology , legislation , energy realities , and management teams as reasons for optimism .
Skeptics portray these opportunities as mirages , obscuring the unresolved problems that undermined nuclear expansion plans a generation ago .
According to the industry , nuclear energy is on the verge of an enormous resurgence , fulfilling the promise that was thwarted by the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island reactor accidents , the Washington Public Power Supply System financial collapse , and other misadventures .
These upbeat accounts point to new technology , legislation , energy realities , and management teams as reasons for optimism .
Skeptics portray these opportunities as mirages , obscuring the unresolved problems that undermined nuclear expansion plans a generation ago .
They point to insurance , financing , proliferation , siting , accident and attack vulnerability , staffing , nuclear waste , and other uncertainties as reasons for pessimism .
When offered by partisans , neither account is entirely trustworthy , nor entirely believed by those issuing it .
Rather such accounts represent the posturing of advocates who hope to spin self - fulfilling prophesies and create an aura of inevitable success–or failure .
Working the crowd is essential for a technology such as nuclear energy , which depends on the public ’s acceptance to host plants , invest in industry firms , and support government subsidies and loan guarantees .
Proponents want the world to believe that the public will increasingly be open to an energy source that directly produces no greenhouse gases , while opponents want the world to believe that the public will increasingly fear accidents , cost overruns , the uncertain future of nuclear waste , and the diversion of weapon - grade material to bomb making .
In truth , neither side really knows what the public fears or wants .
Unless supported by sound empirical evidence , claims about public opinion are just speculation .
In the case of nuclear energy , there ’s surprisingly little research describing the public ’s concerns about nuclear energy in any real depth .
Moreover , predicting future public concerns requires predicting how nuclear energy will emerge as an issue through legislation , protests , hearings , accidents , terrorist diversions , oil embargos , climate change - linked disasters , or other currently unknowable events .
One can , however , predict how the industry will be judged by the public when it responds to events ( or creates them ) .
If the industry is seen as responsible and genuinely concerned with the public ’s welfare , as well as its own , then it will be judged fairly .
The following principles , drawn from research and experience , specify what it takes to be seen as such a partner .
Adhering to them does n’t guarantee public acceptance or an end to vigorous public debate over nuclear energy .
But it does increase the chances of having fewer , but better conflicts , ones that focus on legitimate differences in the interests of the industry and the public , made up of diverse constituencies with their own distinct interests and views ( e.g. , plant neighbors , environmental justice communities , and elected officials ) .
Following these principles wo n’t be easy for an industry that has often viewed communication as a one - way process .
It will need to move beyond a “ decide - announce - defend ” communication strategy to an approach that begins by listening to the public and moving in a more acceptable direction .
In fact , the industry ’s relationship with the public must be paramount .
That means worrying at the highest levels of management about whether the industry actually has a story worth telling , in the sense of bringing genuine benefits and acceptable risks to society .
The principles listed below are , in effect , corollaries of adopting the strategy of achieving this aim :
Senior management must be committed to treating communication as a strategic activity , not an afterthought .
Organizations are busy places , consumed with meetings , paperwork , and intrigue .
They do n’t naturally invest in listening to outsiders unless their senior management treats communications with the public as a strategic matter , essential to its success .
People are poor judges of what others think about them , especially when they have different life experiences–as when members of a technically sophisticated industry , such as nuclear energy , imagine the beliefs and motives of a nontechnical public and vice versa .
Organizations that forgo direct two - way communication with the public ( especially when they disagree ) are choosing to fly blind , relying on intuition , rather than evidence , regarding the conditions necessary for public acceptance .
Management must consider communication in all activities .
A firm ’s public face can be shaped by any of its actions .
For the nuclear industry , those actions include how it maintains plants , disposes of waste , conducts siting processes , lobbies for permits , participates in electoral politics , deals with neighbors in routine times and emergencies , and treats workers .
Communication must be a strategic part of each activity :
Have we listened to the public ’s concerns ?
What is our duty to inform ?
What is our story ?
Is it one that can be told with pride ?
If not , can we change our operations so that there ’s a better story to tell ?
Without such awareness , firms can unwittingly send messages that undermine their cause .
For example , a labor dispute might raise doubts in the surrounding community about worker morale and plant safety .
Issue advertising might make people wonder what an industry is hiding and why it ’s trying so hard to sell itself .
Management must assume stewardship over the life cycle of its technology .
A firm ’s reputation depends not only on its own actions , but also on the actions of the organizations that provide it with ancillary services , such as independent audits , regulatory oversight , materials transport , waste handling , and personnel screening .
Even when these partners are beyond a firm ’s direct control , their actions communicate on its behalf .
If they ca n’t be completely trusted , then the firm must either supplement their management or ensure that they are subject to effective regulatory oversight .
Management must press for industry - wide discipline .
Industry associations are designed to address diffused responsibilities such as those requiring stewardship ( e.g. , materials transport , nuclear waste disposal , and storage ) .
They can , however , face pressure to act in ways that undermine their effectiveness .
One such pressure is keeping their members happy –including members whose behavior undermines the industry ’s overall credibility .
A second such pressure is the temptation to exaggerate the external threats posed by “ irrational ” citizens or “ evil ” anti-nuclear opponents .
An industry association that sounds these scary tropes can hardly treat the public as a respected partner or be seen as such .
Management must separate public affairs communications from public health communications .
Any firm needs a public affairs office to advocate on its behalf .
Any firm that creates health risks also needs a public health communications office to tell the public what it needs to know in order to understand the risks that it faces .
Public affairs communicators worry about defending the firm ; public health communicators worry about defending those affected by its actions .
Successful public health communicators also defend the firm by demonstrating its competence and honesty .
Management must staff its public health communications adequately .
Effective public health communications require four distinct kinds of expertise :
subject - matter specialists such as nuclear engineers , radiation physiologists , and evacuation coordinators who can provide the best available facts ;
risk and decision analysts who can identify the most critical facts and characterize their uncertainties ;
behavioral scientists who can design and evaluate communications ; and
system specialists who can make the communication process work .
It ’s not hard to imagine what can go wrong when people are asked to go beyond the limits of their expertise .
Few behavioral scientists know anything about radiation physics .
Few nuclear engineers know how to explain technical concepts to lay audiences .
Few risk analysts know how laypeople think about uncertainty .
But together , these specialists have the skills needed for effective public health communication .
Management must learn from experience .
Effective managers ensure that they receive clear signals regarding their firm ’s successes and failures .
Evaluating the quality of a firm ’s communications requires assessing how well it has understood the public that it affects and how well the public has understood it .
Those assessments require applied social science , conducted with the methodological rigor of peer - reviewed research .
Firms cannot learn if they contract with researchers who lack the needed technical expertise and produce research that could not survive academic peer review , or if they create incentives for biased results–e.g. , by having the same people create and evaluate their communications or by rewarding those who make management feel good , regardless of what the public thinks .
Management must value its intangible assets .
Effective communications require adequate resources .
These resources are minor relative to the overall expenses of a capital - intensive industry such as nuclear energy .
They ’re even minor relative to the cost of vanity advertisements , a common form of corporate communication .
The return on this investment , however , may be undervalued because it ’s intangible –protecting and enhancing a firm ’s trustworthiness .
Management needs to remember that the intangible asset of trust bears tangible returns in the form of reduced uncertainty about public acceptance and regulatory approval , as well as reduced executive time putting out avoidable fires .
Good communication cannot guarantee success .
It can , however , reduce the risk of needless conflicts that arise when otherwise acceptable stories are not understood by the public , when solvable problems are not addressed , or when people feel like they are not being treated respectfully .
Good communications might even suggest ways to accommodate public concerns–e .g. , managing plant sites for wildlife , instituting confidence - building safety measures , creating employment opportunities , or shifting transportation routes .
On the other hand , communication research also can reveal insoluble problems–at least for some plant designs , at some sites , under some regulatory regimes , in some financial climates .
That , too , is worth knowing .
If the industry does not have a story that will bring the public to its side , then it will either need to change itself so that its story is acceptable or rely on strong - arm tactics , exercising political clout , to achieve its ends–a strategy that presents its own set of issues and problems .
Strategic communications , following these principles , provide the best chance to win the battle for hearts and minds and the clearest signal for whether that battle will succeed .
Those betting on the industry ’s future can see how serious it is about its partnership with the public–by whether it invests in top - down , one - way communication or open , two - way dialogue–and place their money accordingly .

Synchronized , goal - directed actions are nothing new ; that concept is the foundation of civilization .
But it goes much deeper than previously realized , according to research in BMC Neuroscience .
It is n't just voluntary cooperation that happens , sometimes it is at the unconscious brain level .
A new study shows that when musicians play along together it is n't just their instruments that are working together , it is happening at the brain wave level also .
The research details how EEG readouts from pairs of guitarists become more synchronized , a finding with wider potential implications for how our brains interact when we do .
Ulman Lindenberger , Viktor Müller , and Shu - Chen Li from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin along with Walter Gruber from the University of Salzburg used electroencephalography ( EEG ) to record the brain electrical activity in eight pairs of guitarists .
Each of the pairs played a short jazz - fusion melody together up to 60 times while the EEG picked up their brain waves via electrodes on their scalps .
The similarities among the brainwaves ' phase , both within and between the brains of the musicians , increased significantly : first when listening to a metronome beat in preparation ; and secondly as they began to play together .
The brains ' frontal and central regions showed the strongest synchronization patterns , as the researchers expected .
However the temporal and parietal regions also showed relatively high synchronization in at least half of the pairs of musicians .
The regions may be involved in processes supporting the coordinated action between players , or in enjoying the music .
" Our findings show that interpersonally coordinated actions are preceded and accompanied by between - brain oscillatory couplings , " says Ulman Lindenberger .
The results do n't show whether this coupling occurs in response to the beat of the metronome and music , and as a result of watching each others ' movements and listening to each others ' music , or whether the brain synchronization takes place first and causes the coordinated performance .
Although individual 's brains have been observed getting tuning into music before , this is the first time musicians have been measured jointly in concert .
So interpersonally coordinated actions are accompanied by between - brain oscillatory couplings .
Are the similarities in the temporal properties of the individuals ’ actions due to a causal role of the couplings ?
Hard to say , but at least the research will be nice to hear .

Click 's Ian Hardy investigates the latest developments in data storage .
A hard drive that stored your entire music collection and hundreds of 1.3 megapixel photos on an 80 - yes 80 - gigabyte drive .
Computer power gets greener with these now 2TB hard drives
It sounded good in 2000 .
But now , almost a decade later , Western Digital have become the capacity leader and released a 2TB hard drive .
It is from their GreenPower line and uses 33 % less juice and is quieter and cooler than most other hard drives .
Dale Pistilli of Western Digital said the new drives would also generate less heat when operating .
" Heat is not the best friend of hard drives .
That is one of the things that puts the most strain on the system . "
But if a 2TB hard drive is impressive , then just imagine a card .
Card capacity
The new Secure Digital Extended Capacity ( SDXC ) cards only exist as mock - ups at present , but the initial capacity will likely be 32GB with a transfer speed of 104MB per second .
As capacity grows on drives and cards , consumers fear losing more and more data in one go
The 2TB number is a theoretical maximum that may not be achieved for years .
And of course hardware manufacturers will have to produce devices capable of recognizing the updated format .
James Taylor , of the SD Association said : " I would think within 12 to 18 months you 'll start seeing the first SDXC card products .
" We estimate that the first products will be digital stills cameras and video cameras . "
SD cards now dominate consumer electronic devices .
It is all about cramming more bytes into less space .
Micro SD cards have been around for several years and you may think this tiny card , which was designed for small gadgets like a phone , would only be able to hold a couple of gigabytes of data .
But the new Micro SDHC holds 16GB .
Devices like the iPod Touch and iPhone , with permanent installations of flash memory , are now commonplace .
Solid state drives boot up faster than hard drives and need less power .
In 2007 , 32 GB cards cost $ 600 ( £ 421 ) .
But prices have dropped since .
Doreet Loren of Sandisk said : " Today we can find 120 GB for $ 250 ( £ 175 ) .
That 's actually a much more attractive price than we 've seen before .
" We 're beginning to be in the ballpark of what 's actually acceptable for replacing the hard disc drive . "
Losing data
But as capacity grows on drives and cards , consumers fear losing more and more data in one go , with entire music , video and photo collections evaporating from the same drive .
The cost of date storage has been falling dramatically in recent years
That is one reason why multi-drive machines and network - attached servers are becoming more popular with consumers .
Traditionally difficult to set up , the latest versions like , the 4TB Sharespace and MyBook , have pre-configured RAID technology that automatically backs - up data .
The Drobo is ready out of the box and copies data across four discs simultaneously for maximum safety .
If one fails , it can be replaced in a few seconds with no loss of files .
But as consumers get used to managing terabytes of data , they quickly realise moving it around can now take days .
USB 2 and Firewire 800 suddenly feel sluggish .
But the answer may be on the way .
The answer could lie with USB 3 as John ONeill of Symwave said : " This will enable consumers to do back - ups and transfer files at 10 times the speed of existing technology " .
So what is the bad news ?
Well you will need a new PC with additional hardware and software for one and the tantalizing data transfer speeds of 5GB per second that are often quoted are ... yes you guessed it ... theoretical .

When does this recession become a depression ?
Is it when US GDP is greater than - 10 % ?
This slowdown commenced in Dec. 2007 , 15 - months and no let up as job losses intensify .
Year - to - date nearly three million people have lost their jobs in US , pushing the unemployment rate to a 26 - year high of 8.1 % .
We have become so blasÃ ƒÂ© with expected dismal data , next monthÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s NFP will probably achieve that psychological - 1 m loss , at the moment just another record to be broken !
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 15 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
The greenback has this morning got the thumbs up .
NFP on Friday was in line with expectation and the USD $ still managed to sell off , this morning the market realizes that the worst is yet to come from other G7 members , which has given investors the green light to sell their own currencies .
Ireland has been downgraded to negative watch by Fitch coupled with a very Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœdovishÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ ECB President Trichet , who has not ruled out further rate cuts , and was studying additional non-standard measures will pressurize the EUR .
With the UK government confirming its 75 % stake in Lloyds does not help equity confidence , the house of cards more to follow mentality has spooked this morning Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s markets .
A couple of US Republican senators said yesterday that the US government should allow Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœbig banksÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ to go under if they are not performing up to standard .
This news has added to the negative sentiment so far this morning .
The US$ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.25 % , GBP - 0.85 % , CHF - 0.16 % and JPY - 0.33 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.23 % and AUD - 0.49 % .
Investors seek sanctuary in the safer heaven USD and JPY over riskier assets such as commodity currencies .
This has pushed the loonie lower and in pole position to make a challenge at its yearly lows .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s only a matter of time before we record new lows in this cycle for the currency .
Already last week , the BOC slashed borrowing costs by 50 bp to 0.5 % and indicated further easing which has not helped the currency Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s cause .
In their communiquÃ ƒÂ© the BOC sent a strong signal that it may well not be done cutting rates and that it is moving toward outright quantitative easing .
This is a huge shift in tone from the last communiquÃƒÂ© where they placed emphasis on how different Canada is compared to the problems being witnessed elsewhere in the world .
Traders are looking for better levels to sell the CAD $ in the short term .
Economic data last week put the AUD$ , a higher yielding currency on the back foot .
Plunging global indices has investors strapping on risk aversion strategies and shying away from commodity currencies ( 0.6366 ) .
Weaker domestic data will once again put pressure on the RBA to resume interest - rate cuts .
Last week in a surprise despite an unexpected soft GDP number , Governor Stevens kept O/N rates on hold at 3.25 % .
Traders continue to look to sell into rallies at the moment .
Crude is higher O/N ( $ 45.75 up +27 c ) .
A weaker greenback aided the black - stuff on Friday .
Crude managed to print a 5 - week high as the USD weakened vs. EUR and by default supporting the appeal of commodities as an alternative investment .
This was due to the weaker than expected revisions to the US NFP numbers last week .
Some analysts do not expect this + 4 % increase to be sustainable despite the market anticipating that OPEC will cut production further at this weekendÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s meeting .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s widely believed that the greenback will find support once the expected weak data from Europe will begin again .
If OPEC does decide to reduce production targets this month , the technical charts indicate that prices may rise to $ 55 a barrel .
However , the world is awash with the black - stuff , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the storage problems that are causing concerns .
This will lead to prices remaining under pressure in the longer term .
Last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s surprising EIA report showed an unexpected decline in US crude , the initial support cannot be sustainable as demand destruction remains .
Crude oil supplies fell - 757 k barrels to +350.6 m vs. an expected rise of +1 m barrels .
Refineries operated at 83.1 % of capacity , up + 1.8 % from the last report .
Meanwhile gas inventories rose + 168 k barrels to +215.5 m vs. an expected decline of - 800 k .
Stockpiles of distillate fuels ( heating oil and diesel ) , climbed + 1.66 m barrels to +143.3 m .
Analysts had expected a +1 m decline .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s interesting to note that US gas consumption averaged +9 m barrels a day over the past month , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s an increase of +2.2 % .
To date , OPEC has cut output by - 2.7 % last month as producers try to stem price declines .
Gold is breaking out of its negative price run by advancing as investors buy the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as falling stock markets boost its demand ( $ 938 ) .
The Nikkei closed 7,086 down - 87 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 3,624 down - 42 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 3,491 down - 39 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year Treasury yields eased 14 bp last week and settled on Friday at 2.88 % .
They are little changed in the O/N session .
Treasuries have rallied aggressively , especially in the long end as investors speculated that the Fed may buy government securities after the BOE last week said it would buy sovereign and corporate debt .
Despite a $ 63 b funding announcement for 3Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s , 10 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s and 30 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s for this week , equity markets are dragging prices higher as global indices fail to find that much needed traction .

An ancient enemy is approaching Earth and it's up to you , the caretaker of the planet , to activate the defenses !
Mr Clegg wants strict limits placed on second - home claims
The Lib Dem leader has urged his fellow party leaders to back his plans for reforming MPs ' second - homes allowances .
Nick Clegg 's proposals would see the allowance replaced with expenses for only basic utility bills , council tax and either rent or mortgage interest .
He also suggests measures to stop MPs making a profit from any part of a mortgage funded by the taxpayer .
Mr Clegg and David Cameron have rejected the PM 's plan for a flat - rate fee based on attendance at Westminster .
Mr Clegg has set out his revised proposals in a letter to the Tory leader and Gordon Brown .
Public anger
The moves towards reform follow criticism of MPs ' and ministers ' use of second - homes allowances , worth up to £ 24,000 a year to MPs whose constituencies are outside inner London .
Sir Christopher Kelly , chairman of the Committee on Public Standards , has begun an in - depth investigation into reforming the system , with the findings due by the end of the year .
Any reforms must be durable , transparent , reduce the cost of our politics and not merely constitute an interim fix that falls apart under public scrutiny
Nick Clegg
Lib Dem leader
But all the major parties want to reach agreement on an interim measure because of the scale of public anger at some MPs ' allowance claims .
In his letter , Mr Clegg said he had dropped one of his original reform demands to try to reach cross-party consensus quickly .
He had argued MPs should be stopped from buying second homes altogether , but his proposal was rejected by Mr Brown and Mr Cameron last week .
Now Mr Clegg suggests
MPs should instead be prevented from making any financial gains from any part of a mortgage paid for by the taxpayer .
In addition , the taxpayer should get a share of any capital appreciation in the value of the property , proportionate to the amount funded out of public funds , he argues .
Transparency Outlining his plan to Mr Brown , Mr Clegg wrote : " If it is an interest - only mortgage , the taxpayer would get 100 % of the capital gain ; if it is a capital and interest mortgage , the taxpayer would get the capital gain in proportion to the share of total mortgage costs paid . "
He said this would meet the objective of allowing home ownership to continue - insisted on by Mr Brown and Mr Cameron - but would still mean MPs would not profit from using taxpayers ' money to make investments in the property market .
But while Mr Clegg said he was prepared to alter his proposals in this way to secure agreement , he still rejected the idea of daily allowances .
" Such a system - in almost any form - means taxpayers will have almost no idea what their money is being spent on by MPs , " he wrote .
" Any reforms must be durable , transparent , reduce the cost of our politics and not merely constitute an interim fix that falls apart under public scrutiny . "
Despite lacking support from the other parties for a daily allowance , Downing Street has said the government still plans to table a vote on expenses reform next week .
Tory plans
The Conservative Party has published its own plans for reform , calling for the second homes allowance to be replaced by a transparent Parliamentary allowance from 1 July .
In a similar way to the Lib Dem proposals , this could be used to pay only for rent , utility bills , council tax and mortgage interest - subject to a new cap .
All claims would have to published , with receipts , within 28 days , with no MP living within 20 miles of London eligible for the new allowance .
Sir Christopher 's inquiry , set up by Mr Brown , was brought forward after newspaper revelations about the use of second - home expenses .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and work minister Tony McNulty are being investigated over their claims - but both say they acted within the rules .

Similarities between different groups of people are far greater than the differences ( Image : Danny Lehman / Corbis )
AS A SPECIES , we possess remarkably little genetic variation , yet we tend to overlook this homogeneity and focus instead on differences between groups and individuals .
At its darkest , this tendency generates xenophobia and racism , but it also has a more benign manifestation – a fascination with the exotic .
Nowhere is our love affair with otherness more romanticised than in our attitudes towards the cultures of east and west .
Artists and travellers have long marvelled that on opposite sides of the globe , the world ’s most ancient civilisations have developed distinct forms of language , writing , art , literature , music , cuisine and fashion .
As advances in communications , transport and the internet shrink the modern world , some of these distinctions are breaking down .
But one difference is getting more attention than ever : the notion that easterners and westerners have distinct world views .
Psychologists have conducted a wealth of experiments that seem to support popular notions that easterners have a holistic world view , rooted in philosophical and religious traditions such as Taoism and Confucianism , while westerners tend to think more analytically , as befits their philosophical heritage of reductionism , utilitarianism and so on .
However , the most recent research suggests that these popular stereotypes are far too simplistic .
It is becoming apparent that we are all capable of thinking both holistically and analytically – and we are starting to understand what makes individuals flip between the two modes of thought .
One of the pioneers of this research is Richard Nisbett from the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor .
In his book The Geography of Thought , …
Sometimes , I just ca n’t believe what I read … I mean , who thinks this stuff up ?
Has your doctor talked to you about Vavelta yet ?
Valvelta is a wrinkle treatment available in the UK that is derived from the foreskins of babies .
That ’s right : THE FORESKINS OF BABY PENISES .
At birth , we chose not to circumcise our son , but not all boys are so lucky .
What should doctors do with all those leftover foreskins from circumcisions ?
Treat the aging population ’s wrinkles , of course !
According to Scientific American , Vavelta uses fibroblasts , cells that produce the skin - firming protein collagen and make elastin .
The source of the fibrolasts : baby foreskins .
The fibroblasts in Vavelta are isolated from the foreskins taken from baby boys , given several months to grow and multiply in the lab , and then packaged into treatment vials that are shipped to a select group of U.K. physicians .
Each vial costs approximately 750 pounds , or $ 1,000 ] , according to the company spokesperson .
Once delivered into the skin , the fibroblasts begin producing collagen , hyaluronic acid and elastin ( which build and reinforce it ) orthey make enzymes called metalloproteinases to break down excessive amounts of proteins that accumulate in scar tissue , according to Paul Kemp , Intercytex ’s chief scientific officer .
Some doctors warn the foreskins could carry viruses , besides the um , ethical considerations .
Glad my son ’s foreskin is still where it belongs on his penis and not injected into some old woman ’s face looking for the fountain of youth .
" But if we can head it off before it happens and take individuals like this . . . off the streets , it 's definitely a positive thing , " Vanore said .

ANN ARBOR — More people live behind bars in the United States than in any other country , but the American prison system punishes more than just its inmates ?
it also takes a toll on the health of friends and loved ones left behind .
In the first known study of its kind , University of Michigan researchers found that people with a family member or friend in prison or jail suffer worse physical and mental health and more stress and depressive symptoms than those without a loved one behind bars .
Moreover , these symptoms worsen the closer the relationship to the person incarcerated .
The study results could help explain health disparities between minorities and whites , says Daniel Kruger , research professor at the U - M School of Public Health and lead researcher on the study .
African Americans are more likely to know someone in prison and to feel closer to the person incarcerated than whites do , Kruger says .
“ It ’s like a double whammy , ” he said .
Forty - nine percent of African Americans in the study report having a friend or relative in prison during the past five years , compared to just 20 percent of whites .
According to the study , those who knew someone in prison had 40 percent more days where poor physical health interfered with their usual activities , including work , and 54 percent more days where poor mental or emotional health interfered with these activities .
Others have examined the health effects of incarceration on inmates and a few studies have investigated the health of children whose mothers are in prison , but those studies focused on people already in the system , says Kruger .
“ We actually took a representative sample of people in the community and asked them whether they had a friend or relative incarcerated in the last five years , ” Kruger said .
“ We also included a powerful array of known health predictors as control variables . ”
For instance , Kruger and colleagues considered whether a person smoked tobacco , drank alcohol heavily , was overweight or obese , or had adequate nutrition and physical exercise .
The study consisted of 1,288 adults from Flint , Mich. , an urban area with high unemployment and crime rates , and surrounding areas of Genesee County .
In the study , 67 percent of respondents were white and 26 percent were African American .
“ Our study demonstrates that incarceration is not only enormously expensive economically , it also has public health costs and these should be taken into consideration , ” Kruger said .
“ In the last 30 years or so , we have seen a more and more punitive system , one where judges no longer have discretion for sentencing . ”
Moving toward a rehabilitation model may benefit both the offending individuals and society , he says .
“ The vast majority of people incarcerated are nonviolent drug offenders , ” Kruger said .
“ We should shift oversight of substance use and abuse to the health care sector . ”
One out of every 100 adults in the United States is incarcerated and more than three times as many African Americans and Latinos live in jails or prisons than college dorms , Kruger says .
This particular study looked only at African Americans , not Latinos , because there is not a large population of Latinos in Flint and Genesee County .
The paper , “ The Association of Incarceration with Community Health and Racial Health Disparities , ” is in the April issue of Progress in Community Health Partnerships .
The University of Michigan School of Public Health has been working to promote health and prevent disease since 1941 and is consistently ranked among the top five public health schools in the nation .
Whether making new discoveries in the lab or researching and educating in the field , SPH faculty , students and alumni are deployed around the globe to promote and protect our health .

The plan was developed amid a widening investigation into American clients of UBS but will apply to clients of other banks .
Under the plan , the I.R.S. will cut a penalty for not filing a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Account , known as an Fbar  something offshore tax evaders have not done , to avoid detection by the I.R.S .
The current penalty is up to 50 percent of the highest annual balance of each account for each of the last three years  an amount that can quickly wipe out an investor and still leave him owing taxes and interest .
While the number of Americans coming forward this year to disclose hidden assets has doubled , the I.R.S. said , it is still not enough .
Now , the I.R.S. will reduce that penalty to 5 to 20 percent , depending in part on whether the wealth was inherited .
It will also levy the penalty just once , on the highest balance in the accounts over the last six years .
Still , with many accounts holding securities that have plunged in value because of faltering stock markets , the new lowered penalty will still have some sting .
In an effort to cut costs and use taxpayer money more efficiently , the government of the UK intends to increase its adoption of open source software .
A report issued Wednesday by the Chief Information Officer Council outlines the benefits of using open source in government IT and establishes a roadmap for improving procurement policies so that they are more conducive to open source adoption .
In the report , digital engagement minister Tom Watson says that the collaborative development model and the high potential for code reuse inherent in open source software deliver real value .
Since the UK government 's initial push for internal open source adoption in 2004 , Linux and open source technology have become a critical part of the government 's IT infrastructure .
" Open Source has been one of the most significant cultural developments in IT and beyond over the last two decades : it has shown that individuals , working together over the Internet , can create products that rival and sometimes beat those of giant corporations , " he wrote in the report .
" It has shown how giant corporations themselves , and Governments , can become more innovative , more agile and more cost - effective by building on the fruits of community work ; and from its IT base the Open Source movement has given leadership to new thinking about intellectual property rights and the availability of information for reuse by others . "
The UK government 's current policy , which was authored in 2004 , is to " seek to use Open Source where it [ gives ] the best value for money to the taxpayer in delivering public services . "
This put open source on equal footing with proprietary technology in the government procurement process and replaced anachronistic policies that emphasized commercial solutions .
The government is now updating that policy and taking it a step further with new standards .
According to the new policy , the procurement process will now favor open source solutions over proprietary ones in cases where other relevant factors are equal .
The policy requires the negative impact of vendor lock - in to be considered when proprietary technologies are evaluated and it requires the deployment , transition , and maintenance costs to be considered carefully when open source solutions are evaluated .
" Where there is no significant overall cost difference between open and non-open source products , open source will be selected on the basis of its additional inherent flexibility , " the policy says .
" The Government will , wherever possible , avoid becoming locked in to proprietary software .
In particular it will take exit , rebid and rebuild costs into account in procurement decisions and will require those proposing proprietary software to specify how exit would be achieved . "
Further ,
The government will also categorically require compliance with open standards in the products that it purchases , regardless of whether the products are open source or proprietary .
To facilitate the development of open standards and encourage interoperability , the government will actively support the development of open standards and specifications .
The policies are pragmatic and beneficial to the government as a consumer of IT products and services .
They will leave plenty of latitude for choosing the best possible solution — open , proprietary , or a mix of the two — on the basis of value .
They emphasize the inherent flexibility advantages of open source software while also acknowledging the potential for hidden costs .
Beyond the scope of the distinction between proprietary and open solutions , the report also affirms the need to encourage a procurement culture that focuses on open standards , broad reuse , and long - term sustainability .
The budgetary constraints imposed by the current economic downturn give governments a big reason to look at open source solutions which have the potential to reduce costs and increase flexibility .
We have seen similar moves recently from major governments around the world .
Governments in Asia and South America are already enthusiastically embracing open source technology .
Europe and North America are beginning to move in that direction , too .
The government of Canada also recently began the process of investigating the advantages of emphasizing open source software in its own procurement policies .
The UK seems to be moving to join this trend , but the lack of a timeline in the policy 's action plan has led some open source vendors to question whether the government is really committed to rolling out its new rules .

Sarah Bryant was the first female British soldier killed in Afghanistan The UK 's operation in Afghanistan is " worthless " and akin to the start of the Vietnam war , former SAS commander Maj Sebastian Morley has said .
Speaking to the Daily Telegraph , he said the government had " blood on its hands " over the " unnecessary " deaths of four soldiers .
BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said many on the ground felt the campaign has been " under - resourced " .
But the MoD insisted the security challenge was " manageable " .
The former SAS commander resigned after Cpl Sarah Bryant and three of her colleagues died when their Snatch Land Rover hit an anti-tank mine in Helmand province in June 2008 .
Cpl Bryant was the first female soldier to die in Afghanistan .
We go out on operations , have a punch - up with the Taleban and then go back to camp for tea .
We are not holding the ground
Maj Sebastian Morley Maj Morley , 40 , said he was compelled to stand down after Quentin Davies , the Minister for Defence Equipment and Support , told an " unacceptable lie " in the wake of the deaths .
Mr Davies had said commanders had a choice of vehicles , although he has subsequently said he had not meant to cause any offence .
Speaking for the first time since his resignation , Maj Morley launched a scathing attack on the state of the military campaign as a whole .
" This is the equivalent to the start of the Vietnam conflict , there is much more to come .
" We hold tiny areas of ground in Helmand and we are kidding ourselves if we think our influence goes beyond 500 metres of our security bases .
" We go out on operations , have a punch - up with the Taleban and then go back to camp for tea .
We are not holding the ground . "
The security challenge is manageable by the available forces and the overriding mood of the local population is one of optimism and hope .
MoD spokesman
Q&A : Snatch Land Rovers SAS commander quits ' over kit '
And , addressing the use of Snatch Land Rovers , which he deemed to be unsafe and prompted his decision to stand down , he said : " I had to resign .
" I had warned ( the MoD ) time and time again that there were going to be needless deaths if we were not given the right equipment , and they ignored this advice .
There is blood on their hands .
" There was no other vehicle to use .
The simple truth is that the protection on these vehicles is inadequate and this led to the unnecessary deaths . "
The BBC's Caroline Wyatt said the ex-commander sounded " profoundly disillusioned " by his experiences " , adding that there were an " incredibly diverse " range of views on the progress of the campaign in Afghanistan .
However , she said : " It is a campaign that many people on the ground say has been under resourced [ and ] under funded on all sides . "
Our correspondent pointed to the US ' decision to deploy a further 17,000 military personnel to Afghanistan as evidence that the current situation in the country is problematic and there is a desire for a new strategy .
' Making progress '
A spokesman for the MoD acknowledged that the Snatch was not suitable for high - risk environments , but was " mission critical " for certain operations .
He added that new technology and state - of - the art armoured vehicles were continuing to reach Afghanistan , and the anticipated arrival of additional US troops meant the fight would be taken to the Taleban with greater vigour than ever .
" It is true that in an area the size of Helmand there is a limit to how much ground we can hold , " the spokesman said .
" But that does not mean we are not making progress .
We are .
" The security challenge is manageable by the available forces and the overriding mood of the local population is one of optimism and hope . "
He added : " Quentin Davies has already made clear that any offence caused by remarks he made on the issue was entirely inadvertent . "

Ever since AMD announced its plan to split itself into two separate companies , there have been legal questions surrounding the move .
AMD 's x86 cross-licensing agreement with Intel has always required that Sunnyvale maintain a certain corporate structure in order to continue to manufacture x86 - compatible microprocessors .
When it unveiled its plans to spin off The Foundry Company ( now Globalfoundries ) , AMD confidently maintained that its plan avoided any licensing entanglements or issues Intel might seek to raise .
AMD has filed a form 8 - K with the SEC , advising the agency of a cross- licensing dispute between itself and Intel .
In discussions with Ars , however , AMD has also insisted that neither it nor Globalfoundries actually requires the cross-licensing agreement in order to design or manufacture x86 - compatible microprocessors .
That 's a surprising claim that runs against the general understanding of what the AMD / Intel cross-licensing agreement allows or contains .
Has Intel 's ownership / stranglehold on the right to manufacture x86 processors been broadly misconstrued for years ?
The official record
In its 8 - K filing , AMD states that it has received Intel 's allegation of a material breach ; in speaking with AMD 's Senior Vice President of Counsel , Harry Wolin , Ars learned that Intel is asserting that Globalfoundries fails to qualify as a subsidiary of AMD based on a redacted portion of the cross-license agreement .
AMD notes that it has begun the " escalating procedure for resolving disputes . " �
AMD does not believe it has breached the cross-licensing agreement , and the company considers Intel 's allegations of a breach to be in bad faith .
If Intel 's filing does turn out to be in bad faith , then AMD claims that this gives them " the right to terminate Intel 's rights and licenses ... while retaining the Company 's [ AMD's ] rights and licenses under the Cross License Agreement . "
It 's standard operating procedure in any patent infringement lawsuit to claim that your opponent 's patents are invalid / inapplicable , but the x86 agreement contains a bit of victori spolia .
In the event a material breach is upheld , the breaching party loses all rights to the nonbreaching party 's patents but the inverse is not true .
AMD 's official response , as delivered by AMD PR spokesperson Michael Silverman , claims that Intel 's actions are nothing more than a desperate attempt by the larger company to redirect attention from its own actions .
" Intel 's action is an attempt to distract the world from the global antitrust scrutiny it faces , " Silverman said .
" Should this matter proceed to litigation , we will prove that Intel fabricated this claim to interfere with our commercial relationships and thus has violated the cross-license . "
Intel 's own official statement is fairly terse , but confirms that the CPU giant has notified AMD of its belief that the latter has breached the x86 cross-licensing agreement , and that Globalfoundries is not a subsidiary as defined within the agreement .
The Intel statement also alleges that " the structure of the deal between AMD and ATIC breaches a confidential portion of that agreement . "
Intel goes on to state that it has requested that AMD make the relevant redacted portion of the agreement public ( presumably that portion dealing with ATIC ) and that AMD has thus far declined to do so .
" AMD cannot unilaterally extend Intel ’s licensing rights to a third
party without Intel ’s consent , ” said Bruce Sewell , senior vice
president and general counsel for Intel .
" We have attempted to address
our concerns with AMD without success since October .
We are willing to
find a resolution but at the same time we have an obligation to our
stockholders to protect the billions of dollars we ’ve invested in
intellectual property . "
We put the question of why AMD has kept its agreement with ATIC confidential to Silverman .
" AMD would be happy to make the entire agreement public if Intel drops its insistence on secrecy concerning its exclusionary business practices under the guise of confidentiality it has imposed on evidence in the US civil antitrust case , " Silverman told Ars .
" There is no commercial reason to have those documents under seal ; it is simply a means for Intel to try to conceal its illegal behavior . "
So what about those x86 patents ?
In our conversation with the company , AMD made a strong distinction between a technology license agreement , in which one company furnishes another with a vital ingredient or special sauce necessary to the function of a product , and a patent license agreement , in which two companies agree not to sue each other for intellectual property ( IP ) infringement .
AMD 's point here is rather simple : AMD neither needs nor receives any technological help from Intel when designing x86 processors .
In the event that the cross-license agreement between the two companies were to be canceled , there 's nothing stopping AMD from continuing to build its current products or designing future ones .
From AMD 's perspective , the distinction between patent licensing and technology agreements is nontrivial ; Sunnyvale is alleging that part of the reason Intel is alleging a material breach is to spread FUD within the media , the market , and potential AMD / Globalfoundries partners .
In the event that the two companies cannot agreeably mediate the problems within the next 60 days , one or both of them will almost certainly file suit against the other .
AMD believes it has a strong position if the situation turns into a patent slugfest .
While it 's true that Intel holds the x86 patent , AMD noted to Ars that it has a number of patents of its own , including some related to the functionality of integrated memory controllers , the x86 - 64 instruction set , and x86 multicore configurations .
The company also hinted that it may hold patents regarding the creation of an integrated CPU +GPU product on a single die — the so - called " Fusion " parts that now appear on the roadmaps of both companies .
AMD believes that any legal actions Intel might initiate as a result of this dispute would probably be sorted out in a theoretical settlement of AMD 's court case against Intel ( currently scheduled to begin in early 2010 ) .
Intel , for its part , is n't talking legal strategy or patent war chests ;
Intel spokesperson Chuck Mulloy told Ars that " the next step is mediation as outlined in the 2001 agreement .
We hope to find a way to resolve this matter . "
“ Our time has come ! ” said Jóhanna Sigurdardóttir , the 66 year - old newly elected Prime Minister of Iceland , who just happens to be the world ’s first openly gay national elected leader .
Sigurdardóttir served as PM for the last three months in an interim capacity after Iceland ’s government collapsed in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis , which bankrupted the small island nation , which had built its economy up in recent years as a freewheeling banking haven .
Her election over the weekend is not just a victory for gays and lesbians , but also for women– she is the nation ’s first female prime minister and Icelandic newspapers are proudly pointing out that with this election , which sent more women to the Althing than ever before , the nation now ranks 4th in the world for female participation in government .
But what challenges face the world ’s first openly gay elected leader ?
A former airline attendant who became interested in politics by way of unions , presiding on boards of various airline related trade unions before being elected to the Althing in 1978 as a Social Democrat .
Much like in the U.S. , Iceland has spent the last 40 years becoming increasingly conservative politically and so Sigurdardóttir found herself in the opposition party again and again .
In 1994 she ran to be the leader of the party and lost , leading her to say her equivalent of “ Change is coming ! ” , “ Minn tími mun koma ! ” ( “ My time will come ! ” ) .
At the same time , Sigurdardóttir was discovering her own sexuality later in life .
After raising two sons with her husband , the couple divorced and Sigurdardóttir began a relationship with Icelandic journalist and playwright Jónína Leósdóttir .
In 2002 , they were joined in a civil union .
Ingo Sigfusson of Iceland ’s public broadcaster , RUV told the BBC that when it comes to the Prime Minister ’s sexuality :
“ It ’s by no means a big deal .
It ’s been reported , but it ’s not something the public is focusing on ..
On the one hand , Iceland is a fairly liberal , tolerant country when it comes to homosexuality .
On the other hand , she ’s never been particularly public about her private life , even though her partner is listed on the parliament ’s website .
… Whom the new prime minister crawls into bed with at night seems to be fairly far down the list of priorities for people . ”
After the economic collapse and the subsequent resignation of the government , the Social Democrats chose Sigurdardóttir to serve as interim - PM because she was so popular with the public , which to American ears , may sound incredible , but even in conservative corners , Iceland prides itself on a progressive social outlook .
In fact , many Icelanders calls her “ Saint Johanna . ”
She ’s going to need that popularity now as she guides her country through the worst financial crisis it ’s ever experienced .
She must find a way to keep her own leftist coalition of Social Democrats , Left - Greens and Independents together while convincing the European Union that it ought to bring Iceland in the fold , which Sigurdardóttir believes is critical if Iceland is to stabilize .
It wo n’t be an easy sell to Icelanders , however .
Beyond the sense of Viking - inspired independence , Icelanders are wary of how EU membership could impact local fishing regulations and as citizens realize that the new - new - Iceland will look a lot like the old Iceland in terms of industries , fishing is once again big business .
If Iceland were to join the EU , they would have to give up their territorial fishing rights .
Furthermore , Sigurdardóttir must find a way to make the economy grow again– or at least to find a way to stop the bleeding .
Iceland ’s economy is expected to contract by 10 % this year and 1/3 of the annual budget must go to the International Monetary Fund to begin repaying the $ 2.1 billion dollar loan it gave the nation earlier this year to keep the country from collapsing .
Perhaps , when looking at all the challenges Iceland is facing , it ’s not surprise that the sexuality of the new Prime Minister is n’t only not a big deal , but a point of pride .
In so many way , Iceland sees itself regressing back into its own recent past , but in electing an openly - gay woman to serve as their leader , they are showing the world that Iceland can still look to the future .

What is a jailbreak ?
Jailbreaking is the process required to install applications in your iPhone or iPod touch .
It is a very easy procedure .
It 's also safe :
There are no risks in this operation * , as you can easily use iTunes to restore your iPhone or iPod touch to the default factory settings .
When you do that , the iPhone will be like new .

Why jailbreak your iPhone or iPod touch from Apple 's iron fist ?
You should jailbreak your iPhone or iPod if you want to install really cool and useful applications that are not in the iTunes App Store .
Many of these apps are a complete must for any iPhone user but are not allowed by Apple in their iTunes App Store .
This is what you can do with a phone that has been jailbroken :
• Use your iPhone as a 3G modem with your laptop .
• Record video using Cycorder .
• Unlock your iPhone installing a simple program , so you can use a pre-paid card when you go out on vacation instead of paying outrageous roaming charges .
• Follow speech turn - by - turn directions in a GPS program .
• Copy and paste ( yes , copy and paste ) .
• Play Nintendo Entertainment System games and other emulated classic cames ( like Monkey Island ! )

In other words : Do it .
* WARNING *
Of course , the usual do this at your own risk and we are not responsible caveats still apply , but this process is really fool proof thanks to Apple 's iTunes factory reset .
If you are looking to unlock your iPhone now or in the future , DON'T USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS or you wo n't be able to unlock it .
You will need a different process , which we will explain in another How To .

Opening the backdoor ( Mac Users only )
The first thing you need to do to install free apps in your iPhone or iPod is putting it into DFU mode , or Device Firmware Update mode .
Do n't worry , this is n't anything weird :
It 's what your device goes through every time you update the operating system in it .
With this step , you will be making the iPhone go into this state .
Advertisement
This is the only long part of this tutorial because — since the 10.5.6 update — Apple has made it difficult to easily connect your Mac to a manually DFU 'ed iPhone or iPod .
This can be solved by replacing some USB drivers from a previous version of Mac OS X .
If you have 10.5.6 installed , follow these instructions :
Step 1 .
To do this , you need to get yourself a free Apple Developer Connection account .
Since you are using iTunes with your device , you are already almost there : Just log in with your Apple ID from here .
The form will ask you to answer a couple of questions ( just answer whatever you want ) , and you 'll be done as soon as you click the Accept button .
Advertisement
Step 2 .
Now you need to download and install the drivers .
Go to this page and look for this file :
IOUSBFamily - 315.4-log.dmg " for Mac OS X10.5.5 Build 9F33
Once it 's downloaded , disconnect ALL USB peripherals except for your Apple keyboard and Apple mouse and install the package included in the disk image .
Advertisement
Once you restart after the installation , you will be ready to run QuickPwn , the program that will allow you to install the applications .
Important :
Once you complete the jailbreaking process , you have to restore the previous USB drivers .
Go to to this page and download IOUSBFamily - 327.4.0-log.dmg " for Mac OS X 10.5.6 Build 9G55 , then repeat the same operation .
Once you restart , Mac OS X 10.5.6 will be restored to its original state .

Freeing your iPhone or iPod touch ( all users )
Here 's the easiest part : Running QuickPwn .
QuickPwn is a program that will easily " jailbreak " your iPhone or iPod touch .
Jailbreak , as the name says , just means breaking Apple 's limitations on accessing your device , allowing you put anything you want in it .
This means installing any application you want , and not only the ones that Apple allows you to install .

Step 1 . Download QuickPwn for Mac OS
X or Windows from any of the following links :

Step 2 . Run QuickPwn and pick the kind of device you have : iPhone , iPhone 3G , or iPod Touch .
Step 3 . Follow the instructions on the screen .
QuickPwn is completely automated :
• Firstly , it will download all the necessary components from Apple on its own .
• Then the software will build a custom iPhone operating system , which includes Installer and Cydia , the two programs that will allow you to install the iPhone applications outside of the iTunes Apps Store microsystem .

• When QuickPwn asks you to enter your system password , do it .
It 's not malicious .
It just needs this to work .
• Finally , follow the precisely timed instructions on the screen to put your device on DFU ( Device Firmware Update ) mode .
Quick
Pwn will do the rest .
If something does n't work , do n't worry .
Start the process again .
If your device gets a bit nutty , restore it to default factory settings using iTunes , and you will be back to square one , no harm done .

Step 4 .
Be patient as your iPhone restarts .
Once it 's done , you are done too .
It 's fun time .
Installing the applications
This is where the fun starts .
You will notice two new icons in your iPhone or iPod touch 's springboard :
One says " Installer " and the other says " Cydia " .
These are the two competing systems for installation of software .
It does n't really matter what you use to install your software .
Most applications can be installed from both — there are exceptions , like xGPS , which can only be installed on Cydia — and both allow you to browse and install software from a a variety of sources .

• Browsing the catalogs .
Whatever system you choose , installing applications is as easy as going through the available catalogs and picking the application you want .
• Manually adding applications .
There will be times in which you will discover applications on the web which are not in the default catalogs in Cydia or Installer .
Fortunately , you can add these by just entering the URL provided by the developer in the web page , a process that is referred to as " Adding a source " .
Here 's how to do it :
In Cydia
• Click on " Manage . "
• Click on " Sources . "
• Click on " Edit " and then " Add . "
• Enter the address in the dialog field .
• Click on " Add source . "
Advertisement
In Installer
• Click on " Sources . "
• Click on " Edit " and then " Add . "
• Enter the address in the field .
• Click " Done " and get back to sources by clicking on " Sources . "

Click to viewAnd that 's it .
Now you can install any application you want using either program .
Have fun !
With no less than three major magazines this month covering Iceland , we turned to writer Jonas Moody — an American who has lived on the island for the past seven years — to help us parse some of the more interesting reportage .
Since Iceland ’s financial collapse , it seems like every media outlet on the face of the earth has trekked out here .
Much of the coverage accurately reflects our terrible situation , like Ian Parker ’s recent piece in The New Yorker .
But with only 320,000 people on this frozen rock in the middle of the Atlantic , a journalist might be left wanting for more drama , sob stories , or quirky anecdotes .
And that ’s when journalism can start toeing a farcical line .
Take , for instance , Michael Lewis ’s recent Vanity Fair piece , “ Wall Street on the Tundra . ”
Lewis is a legend of financial writing , and he also happens to be quite entertaining .
In that respect , the article does n’t disappoint :
His is a wild account of a backwards Nordic island populated by “ lumpy ” and “ inbred ” people who might force you to shower in scalding water or , worse , blow up a Range Rover .
If you did n’t know any better , you ’d think we were a sitcom waiting to happen .
Unfortunately , none of this is exactly true .
If you want to get the story right , the article ’s more colorful details deserve a reality check .
Some standouts :
1 . “ People are hoarding food and cash and blowing up their new Range Rovers for the insurance . ”
The national diet of sheep heads and cod certainly has gotten more expensive , but no one is hoarding food .
Likewise , there has been no run on the banks .
Besides , the nation puts 99 percent of retail transactions on plastic anyway — from parking meters to hot - dog vendors .
Consumers would n’t know what to do with hoarded cash , nor would the teenagers running the registers .
2. Lewis describes “ unsettling explosions ” outside his hotel room , which he later infers are the result of Range Rover owners who are so desperate to get out from under their car loans that they “ set it on fire and collect the insurance : Boom ! ”
To Lewis ’s credit , there was a news story some time ago about a string of mysterious car fires — but how a well - timed fireball will make one ’s inflated car loan disappear remains a mystery .
We ’re still lacking that essential step that gets one from “ loud bang ” to “ Range Rovers exploding . ”
But needless to say , car bombs are not yet a fixture in the Reykjavík soundscape .
3 . Iceland ’s geothermic water is so hot that when municipal work is being done on the cold - water pipes , sometimes people are “ boiled alive ” in the shower .
Granted , the warm water stinks like bad eggs and there ’s an endless supply of it .
But it ’s not like the Icelanders run it directly from the volcanoes .
Moreover , Reykjavík ’s water - utility company says that even if the cold - water pipes are turned off , it ’s impossible for the water coming out of a shower to ever exceed 70°C .
4. Most Icelanders look “ mousy - haired and lumpy . ”
What is this guy ’s problem ?
5 . “ Icelanders are among the most inbred human beings on earth — geneticists often use them for research . ”
Now this is insulting .
Icelanders ’ DNA shows their roots to be a healthy mix between Nordic Y chromosomes and X chromosomes from the British Isles .
The reason genetic - research company deCODE uses Icelandic genes for its research is not because the codes are so homogeneous , but because the population has kept excellent genealogical records dating back thousands of years .
6 . “ There are only about 9 surnames in Iceland . ”
There are closer to 1,700 recognized surnames in the national registry .
7 . “ If they fill out a form , they can start their own cult and receive a subsidy . ”
Okay , fine :
If a religious group is registered with the Icelandic state , it can apply for funding based on the size of its congregation .
But the group has to convince a committee — including a university theologist and sociologist — that it is an established organization with cultural or historical roots .
So they ’re not just handing out money at the door to every phony cult .
8 . The nation has to deal with “ elves — in whom some large number of Icelanders , steeped long and thoroughly in their rich folkloric culture , sincerely believe . ”
Alcoa , an aluminum - smelting multinational with operations outside of Reykjavík , had to “ defer to a government expert to scour the enclosed plant site and certify that no elves were on or under it . ”
Right .
I ’ve heard the elf thing mentioned in tired travel articles ( normally wedged between paragraphs on the beauty of waterfalls and tips for eating ram testicles ) , but I personally know no one on this island who believes in elves .
Not one .
As for Alcoa , their rep believes Lewis is likely referring to a law regarding environmental - impact assessments .
The assessment includes an archaeological survey to ensure no important artifacts or ruins are destroyed , and the site ’s history is also surveyed to see if it was ever named in any Icelandic folklore .
And yes , some of that folklore involves elves .
But if you ’re going to introduce the notion that some kind of Ministry of Elf Inspection exists within the ranks of the Icelandic government , you might as well also note that we take the Hogwart ’s Express to the office every day .
Editor ’s Note : Vanity Fair has responded to this article in the comments ( page four ) .
WhiteHouse.gov is once again asking the public to pose questions directly to President Obama via its ‘ Open For Questions ‘ service .
The topic of this week ’s forum is the national economy , and not surprisingly , many of you have already put forward questions to the President regarding the taxation and regulation of cannabis .
For example , the most popular question in the category “ Budget ” is : “ With over 1 out of 30 Americans controlled by the penal system , why not legalize , control , and tax marijuana to change the failed war on drugs into a money making , money saving boost to the economy ? ”
Similarly , under the topic “ Financial Stability , ” most asked question is : “ Would you support the bill currently going through the California legislature to legalize and tax marijuana , boosting the economy and reducing drug cartel related violence ? ”
Marijuana - related questions also top the “ Green Jobs and Energy ” category , and are among the top vote - getters on the site overall .
According to website , President Obama will “ answer some of the most popular submissions live at WhiteHouse.gov ” on Thursday morning .
That means that we only have a few more hours left to contact the White House .
Please take a moment right now to log on the WhiteHouse .
gov / OpenForQuestions and vote for the questions above , as well as others pertaining to the need to regulate cannabis .
Let the President know that millions of American voters believe that the time has come to tax and regulate marijuana .
Help us send The White House a message our elected leaders can’t ignore .

The Debian development community has officially released version 5.0 of the venerable open source Linux distribution .
The new version , which is codenamed Lenny , includes updated software , security enhancements , and improved hardware support .
Debian is known for its broad architecture support , lengthy development cycles , and strong ideological commitment to software freedom .
Debian provides the foundation for many popular derivatives , including Ubuntu and Knoppix .
The Debian project has attracted an enormous community of free software enthusiasts and has become one of the largest community - driven distributions in existence .
Despite its declining relevance on the desktop , it is an essential part of the Linux software ecosystem and continues to serve an important function for its downstream partners .
Debian 5 , which has been under development for almost two years , includes over 23,000 software packages and is supported on 12 architectures including x86 , AMD64 , Sparc , PowerPC , and MIPS .
Version 5 introduces a new ARM port that is designed to take advantage of modern ARM processors .
" The Debian project 's key strengths are its volunteer base , its dedication to the Debian Social Contract , and its commitment to provide the best operating system possible , " wrote Debian spokesperson Alexander Reichle - Schmehl in an announcement on the Debian mailing list .
" Debian 5.0 is another important step in that direction . "
The Debian project maintains three separate streams of packages .
The official releases consist of the " stable " package set , but users who want the latest software often use the " testing " or " unstable " streams which are maintained through a rolling release model .
Official releases , which occur roughly every two or three years , are created by freezing the packages in the testing stream and ironing out the bugs so that they meet the requisite level of robustness .
Reliability is considered a very high priority for official Debian releases , so the most current software is generally not included .
Debian 5 ships with version 2.6.26 of the Linux kernel , GNOME 2.22 , XOrg 7.3 , OpenOffice.org 2.4.1 , GIMP 2.4.7 , KDE 3.5.10 , and Iceweasel ( Firefox with alternate branding ) 3.0.6 .
Several of these components posed challenges for the Debian community .
GNOME 2.22 , which was released in March 2008 , was a transitional release with several technical weaknesses .
GNOME 's new virtual filesystem layer was still under heavy development and was not fully integrated until GNOME 2.24 .
To address this issue , the Debian developers have reverted to gnome - vfs , which is the desktop 's previous virtual filesystem layer .
The KDE project 's transition from version 3 to version 4 also created some thorny issues for Debian .
KDE 4.2 , which is the first solidly usable release in the KDE 4 series , unfortunately arrived too late for inclusion in Debian 5 .
Instead , it ships with KDE 3.5.10 , which is the last update in the KDE 3.5.x series .
Although Debian 's emphasis on stability at the expense of recency often works against it on the desktop , it makes a very good server distro .
As companies gain greater internal Linux expertise , they are increasingly turning towards non-commercial Linux distributions in order to cut support costs .
This has had a positive impact on Debian adoption in enterprise computing environments .
Debian 5 adds some nice security improvements that will be beneficial for sever installs .
I tested Debian 5.0 by installing the desktop package set from the lightweight " netinst " CD image .
The graphical installation wizard walks the user through the process of configuring and installing the system .
The default desktop installation provides a complete GNOME desktop environment , the OpenOffice.org suite , and several additional applications such as Inkscape , Pidgin , and IceWeasel .
Unlike Ubuntu , Debian does n't strive to deliver a plug - and - play user experience -- many popular proprietary and encumbered components are omitted in conformance with Debian 's high standards for software freedom .
Proprietary binary drivers are not offered automatically , for example , and it ships with the open source Gnash implementation of Flash instead of Adobe 's proprietary version .
Some concessions are still made for practicality , however , such as the decision to tolerate the presence of binary blobs in the 5.0 release .
For the average Linux user who wants the latest desktop software , greater ease of use , and a more refined experience , Ubuntu is probably a better choice .
For users who want a ( mostly ) unbreakable server platform , it 's a pretty great option .
All things considered , this is a pretty good Debian release .
It seems to live up to the distro's long - standing tradition of delivering solid reliability , and it introduces some nice improvements that will be appreciated by Debian aficionados .
Check out the official release notes for more details .

Pupils can turn up at lunchtime at Darton High School
Errant youngsters are also being allowed to take cups of ­coffee into classrooms and being allowed to turn up for lessons at lunchtime in a bid to get them to stay at school .
Education chiefs claim the moves will raise standards , but campaigners last night reacted with anger at the prospect of children dragging on fake cigarettes while sipping mugs of ­cappuccino at their desks .
The relaxed , flexitime - style ­initiative is just one of a series of measures being introduced at secondary schools in Barnsley , South Yorkshire .
Health officials worked with education staff to devise the scheme after research showed one in three children in Britain ’s most deprived areas smoke by the time they reach 14 .
Barnsley Primary Health Care Trust has dedicated “ indefinite ” taxpayers ’ funding for the nicotine replacement treatments .
President Barack Obama spoke out about the recent violence that has enveloped our neighbor to the south and has begun to spill over from Mexico into the United States .
He admitted that he has been weighing the possibility of moving National Guard troops to the border in an effort to contain the violence but ruled out immediate military action .
" We 're going to examine whether and if National Guard deployments would make sense and under what circumstances , " said President Obama , " I think it 's unacceptable if you 've got drug gangs crossing our borders and killing U.S. citizens . "
One thousand people have already died along the border in 2009 alone , and almost 6 thousand died in 2008 .
Phoenix , AZ has seen a huge uptick in violence , earning the dubious title of " kidnapping capital of America " while " rape trees " are being found in increasing numbers on the US side of the border .
Although the President grasps the gravity of the situation , he was very cautious about the prospect of military action , " We 've got a very big border with Mexico .
I 'm not interested in militarizing the border . "
Obama praised Mexican President Felipe Calderon 's efforts to crack down on the drug cartels , saying that Calderon has been " taking some extraordinary risks under extraordinary pressure to deal with the drug cartels and the corresponding violence that 's erupted along the borders . "
President Obama also touched upon the Merida Agreement made between Calderon and former President Bush , indicating that it will be updated and admitting to the fact that contraband is moving both North and South across the border .
" We expect to have a comprehensive approach , making sure we are dealing with the flow of drug money and guns south , because it 's really a two - way situation there .
The drugs are coming north , we 're sending funds and guns south , " President Obama said , " As a consequence , these cartels have gained extraordinary power .
Our expectation is to have a comprehensive policy in place in the next few months . "
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Royal Bank of Scotland Plc 93OT_p.L is set to unveil up to 20,000 job losses next week as part of tough cost - cutting targets , the Financial Times reported on Saturday .

Without citing a source , the newspaper said between 10,000 and 20,000 jobs out of a total workforce of about 215,000 could go .
It also said RBS was in talks with Treasury officials about the possibility of offering quasi-equity instruments worth billions of pounds as a fee under the government ’s planned insurance scheme designed to ring - fence potentially toxic assets .
Again without citing a source , the paper said talks were ongoing and the exact scale of the assets remained unclear .
The announcements are expected to coincide with RBS reporting its full - year results on February 26 , the FT added .
Neither the Treasury nor RBS would comment on the report of jobs losses or the planned insurance scheme .
RBS is on course to reveal a loss of up to 28 billion pounds next week for 2008 , the largest in British corporate history .
Its attempts to raise cash following its ill - fated purchase of ABN Amro has forced RBS to hire Morgan Stanley to explore the potential sale of its Asian banking units , sources earlier told Reuters .
The part - nationalised bank is likely to first explore options for its retail and commercial units , one source said on Friday , but it would be willing to consider an offer for the investment banking operations , if the price was right .
RBS acquired its Asian retail and commercial banking operations as a result of the ABN deal , which also enhanced significantly its investment banking presence in the region .
Both RBS and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the hiring .
Separately , RBS said on Friday it will report early findings of its strategic review next week .
hid the evidence
Pawel Kusznirewicz , Wasaga Beach , Ontario , is suing the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation for $ 45 million .
Not because he lost .
Because he won .
Kusznirewicz had played at the Innisfil casino with his wife on December 8 , sinking about $ 60 on a slot machine called the Buccaneer .
He made his last pull when the lights started flashing and sirens started wailing .
The video screen showed that he won $ 42.9 million .
The casino management said he did n't .
They said the machine had malfunctioned and said they were n't going to pay him one dime .
But to make up for the devastating loss of nearly $ 43 million , the manager gave him her business card for two free dinners in the casino restaurant .
But then she realized that seemed pretty stingy , so she upped it tofree dinners .
Yeah , four dinners .
That 's just as good .
Besides , they must be good meals , since each dinner is worth $ 10.725 million .
( $ 2 million drinks not included . )
Needless to say , Kusznirewicz was extremely upset ( maybe if they had given him six dinners , plus a free dessert ) , because there was no indication the machine was malfunctioning .
The staff could n't even show him any evidence that it was broken .
But if itbroken , then why did they leave it on ?
Was it working until it finally paid out ?
Or did the OLG puposely allow a broken machine to be kept in play , assuming it would n't pay out in the first place ?
Kusznirewicz said the OLG staff took some pictures of the machine , and thenshut it off .
Kusznirewicz 's lawsuit is for $ 45.9 million : the original $ 42.9 million , and then $ 1 million each for general damages , aggravated damages , and punitive damages .
If the OLG is smart , they 'll offer to settle for half of what Kusznirewicz is asking for .
But if Kusznirewicz is smarter , he 'll hold out for all of it .---

Increasing income tax for top-earners to 45 % would be " difficult to avoid " for any future Tory government , Shadow chancellor George Osborne has admitted .
The government plans to raise the top rate for people earning more than £ 150,000 from 2011 .
The Conservative Mayor of London Boris Johnson said on Friday that the move would stifle British enterprise .
But Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4 's
Today programme that he had never - and could not - rule out tax rises by his party .
" If you look at the proposal to increase the rate of tax on people earning over £ 150,000 to the new 45 % rate , that 's going to be difficult to avoid . "
His comments came after party leader David Cameron said in a speech on Thursday that the rich would have to pay their " fair share " to rescue the economy .
It is a deterrent to enterprise
Boris Johnson
Government borrowing ' to swell '
Mr Osborne said his party would propose changes to the tax system so that companies relied on equity rather than debt and to encourage the public to save more .
He criticised Labour 's management of the national finances and said the Conservatives would rein in public spending .
Mr Johnson had warned that " clobbering the rich " would be bad for business and that City institutions would suffer .
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions ? , he said : " It sends out a signal to people who create wealth , people who are energetic ... can generate new industries or drive large enterprises of one kind or another ... that we want to take more of their proceeds away than before .
" It is a deterrent to enterprise . "
Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable has said high earners will simply avoid the high rate by declaring income as capital gains , taxed at 18 % .
He has called for a shake - up to make the tax system fairer .

Here across the northeast tip of the United States , where we pride ourselves in like - it - or - stick - it Yankee independence , individuals are toiling to extend marriage equality to the homosexual community .
This week , somewhat shockingly , they achieved success in Vermont .
Now we will see if Maine and New Hampshire can squash the serpent of fear as well .
Here across the northeast tip of the United States , where we pride ourselves in like - it - or - stick - it Yankee independence , individuals are toiling to extend marriage equality to the homosexual community .
This week , somewhat shockingly , they achieved success in Vermont .
Now we will see if Maine and New Hampshire can squash the serpent of fear as well .
If I had n't already chosen a side in this debate , the comments I 've heard in recent weeks from opponents of the three bills would have been enough to make me an entrenched defender of the proposals .
When the New Hampshire House of Representatives voted last month to allow gay people to get married , John H. Sununu — the former governor and chief of staff under President Bush the Elder — could only muster the tired retort that Democrats were trying to " impose their San Francisco agenda " on the Granite State .
Apparently that was his sole argument .
A Maine woman was quoted as saying she opposed a similar measure in her state because gay relationships are not typically long - term , and she did n't think gays should raise children because " the vast number of pedophile situations are homosexual . "
Then she said : " I do n't want to hurt them , I just do n't agree with them on this issue . "
That comment struck me .
There are , of course , well - meaning and decent people on either side of this debate , but just as you do n't have to burn a cross in your black neighbor 's yard to be a racist , there 's more to gay bashing than merely belting a homosexual in the face .
If you inflame animosity and ignorance toward homosexuals , that 's a tactic of gay bashing .
If you promote negative stereotypes of homosexuality , that 's gay bashing .
And if you seek out ways to relegate homosexuals to a class beneath the general population , that 's a form of gay bashing as well .
How can we claim we do n't wish any harm ?
We are all striving to create what our Constitution calls " a more perfect union . "
That 's the goal we pursue for American society and it's what we hope to achieve in our personal lives .
Now we are denying fellow citizens the right to engage in either pursuit .
In doing so we make ourselves a weaker people .
Like it or not , when one of us is diminished , we are all diminished .
We 've apparently forgotten already the folly of persecution that scars our short history ; the tragic consequences of distrust among those who make up the American fabric .
American Indians , blacks , Jews , the Irish , Italians , Asians , Hispanics and Muslims have all suffered abuse for our fear of whatever makes them different , to the detriment of us all .
One reader recently likened the furor over gay marriage to fears over miscegenation in this country , noting there was a time when her current marriage would have been against the law in some states .
Over time we 've surpassed these fears — a good thing , because if such laws were pervasive in this country we would never have had a President Obama or , perhaps even more tragically , no Halle Berry .
This past Monday , Republican Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont vetoed a marriage equality bill that had passed both houses of his state 's Legislature .
The very next day , to the surprise of many , the House managed to override the veto with a 100 - 49 vote — the minimum necessary for passage .
The Senate vote was a more decisive 23 - 5 .
Now Vermont is the fourth state in the country to permit gay marriage , but the first to due so through the political process .
Connecticut , Massachusetts and Iowa all sanctioned the act through the courts .
Marriage equality bills are now being considered by the legislatures of Maine and New Hampshire as well .
And once again , the specter of a gubernatorial veto looms over the process .
Govs. John Baldacci and John Lynch — both Democrats — have previously said they oppose gay marriage , even though they support civil unions .
Both men have always seemed to me decent and fair - minded , so my question to them is this :
By what rationale would you refuse brother citizens — who pay their taxes , follow the law and contribute to our community — the same pursuit of happiness in which you have engaged ?
And I do n't want to hear the tired old excuse that the long - understood definition of marriage consists of a man and a woman ; there was a time when " We the people " supposedly meant wealthy white male landowners .
No , I have to think the primary reason these public servants would even contemplate discrimination of their constituents is fear of the voters — who in turn are driven by their own fear of what has come to be known as " otherness . "
This fear is rooted in ignorance , and thankfully there are remedies : information and experience .
The more we familiarize ourselves with that which we do not know , the more comfortable we become with the foreign .
But a lawmaker perpetuating the persecution of a minority in order to satiate the majority is textbook cowardice .
Our leaders , you see , are supposed to know better .
A New Hampshire woman named Jean told me recently that when her 15 - year - old son died after being hit by a truck , her own mother told Jean she was being punished for her relationship with her partner , Jan .
( I 've often wondered why gays are " punished " when they lose loved ones or suffer misfortune , while heterosexual God-fearing folks are " tested " or are simply subject to " God 's will . " )
Jan was fired from her job as a pre-school teacher after moving in with Jean , due to fear that she posed a danger to the children and fellow teachers .
They provided respite care for a young girl until a social worker decided she was at risk with the women and placed her with a straight family — where , Jean says , the girl was raped within a week .
Meanwhile , Jan and Jean have been together for 22 years and have between them five children , nine grandchildren and one great - grandchild .
These are not evil people .
They do n't want to marry their partners so they can adopt and then rape children .
They want to marry because that 's what people do to symbolize the extent of their commitment to the person they love .
It 's outrageous that there are those among us who insist these couples are unworthy of entering into such a union , while a couple of drunken heterosexuals can tie the knot in Vegas before an Elvis impersonator .
And for the record , I would entrust my baby daughter with a gay couple long before I would consider most of the boy - girl alliances I 've encountered .
Opponents say this is n't the right time to deal with the issue of marriage equality , given the state of the economy , unemployment and so on .
But as always , you have to wonder if the matter would take on a higher priority if these individuals were themselves the targets of discrimination .
If , say , everyone over the age of 40 was prohibited from entering into marriage , do n't you think lawmakers would tackle the subject with greater urgency ?
I 've become more invested in this debate over the past year and I have no doubt it stems from what you might call " straight guilt . "
Less than 16 months ago , my wife and I got married within weeks of deciding to do so .
Just this week , my brother almost impetuously married his long - time , live - in girlfriend .
We were both allowed to pursue more perfect unions and are now married to the loves of our lives .
But knowing that others are being denied this same pursuit of happiness , achieved with almost ridiculous ease ( once we won over the girl ) , is a source of shame .
It would be selfish , irresponsible and cruel to allow this discrimination to stand .
The bill in New Hampshire has been passed on to the state Senate following approval in the House ; a public hearing on the Maine bill is taking place in Augusta on April 24 .
Neither governor , as of this writing , has made his position known .
Now is the time to let your voice be heard .
Now is the time for a long - overdue injustice to be corrected .
D. Allan Kerr would have to become a revolutionary if middle - aged men were prohibited from marrying much cuter younger women .

In these times of economic implosion , it seems there is one industry that the government is actually keen on crushing .
The home secretary , Jacqui Smith , recently unveiled a proposal for new legislation aimed at bringing the sex industry to its knees ( metaphorically speaking ) .
If we tackle the demand , Smith proclaimed , then supply will diminish .
In other words , Smith wants to penalise punters .
Under the proposal , anyone who buys sex or other erotic services from someone who is " controlled for another person 's gain " could be fined and receive a criminal record .
Ignorance of the circumstances would be no defence .
Harriet Harman , the minister for women , believes the proposed legislation will help stamp out sex trafficking , which she has described as a " modern - day slave trade " .
Yet if speakers at a panel debate this week on sex trafficking held at London 's Institute of Contemporary Arts are to be believed , most sex workers – including migrant ones – do not see themselves as slaves , and few want to be " saved " by the likes of Smith and Harman .
Scaring away potential punters will only rob those who work within the sex industry of their livelihood .
( And this includes everything from charging for sex to pole - dancing , providing attentive dinner company and selling erotic lingerie , literature or DVDs . )
Laura María Agustín , anthropologist and author of the controversial Sex at the Margins : Migration , Labour Markets and the Rescue Industry , told the ICA audience that politicians like Smith and Harman are promulgating abolitionism as a benevolent , feminist project .
But , Agustín says , " this is state feminism which has nothing to do with gender equality .
It 's about the state identifying a proper way for its citizens to behave and defining millions of women as victims . "
Anyone who does not comply with the political elite 's officially sanctioned lifestyle is seen as deviant .
In relation to sex , non-conformists become defined either as victims or perpetrators , as abused or abusers .
Earlier this month , on International Sex Workers Rights day , I attended an event in Manhattan organised by the New York - based Sex Workers Outreach Project ( Swop ) .
There , I met sex workers and activists who challenged the idea that they are by definition exploited or abused .
A transgender woman called Savannah announced that she was proud to be a call girl .
She told me : " I 've worked as a streetwalker , escort , model , dominatrix , in dungeons ... "
Being a call girl is easier , she said , because it means she can avoid police harassment .
For Savannah , the main threat is not from punters , but from the authorities .
She and everyone else I spoke to acknowledged that some within the sex industry experience assault and can find themselves in vulnerable situations .
At the ICA event , Catherine Stephens , who has worked in the sex industry for 10 years , also acknowledged this , but she believes decriminalisation is the best way of ensuring sex workers avoid harm .
It would be strange to romanticise sex work as something exotic or empowering .
But we would also do well to go beyond puritanical rescue missions such as that proposed by Smith and Harman and acknowledge that for many , working within the sex industry is simply an economic decision .
After all , for a majority of people , salary is a prime factor in determining what job we pursue .
Moreover , some apparently enjoy working within the sex industry .
According to Savannah , " some are proud to be sex workers and chose to do it just like others chose to become physicians and are proud of being that . "
Georgina Perry , service manager for Open Doors , an NHS initiative that delivers outreach and clinical support to sex workers in east London , has also met women in vulnerable positions and women who have paid to be brought to the UK .
These migrants would likely be defined as " trafficked " by the government and various institutions and organisations that work to stamp out " people smuggling " .
In Perry 's experience , such women happily accept some of Open Doors ' services , like free condoms and vocational training advice , but they do not want to be " rescued " , thanks very much .
They have debts and student loans to pay off , families to support and savings accounts to maintain .
They just want to be left alone to get on with their work .
Perry , on her part , is not interested in " forcibly empowering anyone " .
She said much of the debate around the sex industry is infused with moral panic and pointed out that when women are presented as victims , they elicit sympathy ; when they assert their agency , however , they are viewed as a threat to the moral fabric .
Even Jon Birch , inspector at the Metropolitan police clubs and vice unit , acknowledged at the ICA event that not all individuals employed within the sex industry have been coerced into it .
He said the vice unit does not aim specifically to target migrant sex workers .
Yet this seems disingenuous considering that , according to its website , the vice unit places emphasis on " rescuing trafficked and coerced victims " .
It is curious that a term that is impossible to define or quantify , that is often described as a " hidden " or " covert " activity , motivates so much legislation , policy and activism .
Individuals who have been defined as " trafficked " or " enslaved " have worked in everything from mining to agriculture , in housekeeping , elderly care and , indeed , in the sex industry .
Of course kidnapping – whether within or across national borders – should be clamped down upon .
The problem is that today the term trafficking is being applied to more and more forms of migration – and this is making life difficult and miserable for those who must , or who choose to , move across borders for work .
Foreigners who wish to visit or work in the UK have very few legal options available , and so they end up paying strangers to take them on long and risky journeys across the world .
When they come over here , they are forced to take jobs in the shadow economy where they are , indeed , vulnerable to exploitation .
Yet anti-traffickers rarely reach the sensible conclusion that Britain's and Europe 's stringent immigration laws should be revised to allow people to come here to work and contribute to our economies , send remittances to their home countries and go back there when they choose to .
Instead , anti-trafficking campaigners see it as their duty to rescue victimised individuals who may have been trafficked , and to care for them .
This does nothing to challenge immigration laws that force some people into the hands of dodgy employers , but it does a lot to paint immigrants as victims who need to be monitored ever more closely .

In the Maldives , Reefscapers developed a new versatile artificial reef system , the “ Coral Trays ” .
Broken or threatened corals are harvested from the donor areas , usually threatened by coastal developments and fragments prepared before being attached on the Coral Trays .
These new structures prevent predation and sedimentation , and promote survival and growth .
Their light weight enables an easy deployment using a simple whaler as well as to change their location at will .
This could be useful in case of prolonged high sea surface temperatures events .
The shapes and sizes of the structures mostly depends on the objectives and different designs and transplantation processes have been adapted to the species present in the Maldives .
Transplantation is done by snorkelling or diving depending on the depth .
After 6 to 12 months , the newly established reef is able to produce the fragments for further generations of transplants .
After about a year , the growth enables the pruning of 3 to 10 times the initial stock .
The reef created is thereafter self sustainable .
In most environments , the Coral trays substratum efficiency insures an essential survival enabling significant coral propagation as well as small and large scale research .

Today I would like to speak about REEFSCAPERS which is a very interesting project currently developing in Maldives thanks mainly to two french guys Thomas Le Berre and Cedric Guignard .
Cedric sent me some really nice pictures to explain me what this is all about and now I 'm going to try to eplain to you the amazing job of the Coral Growers or Coral Propagators or Reef Creators or whatever you would like to call them !
To tell it simple REEFSCAPERS deal with the propagation of corals a project that has a lot of possible environmental and economic benefits forHowever Coral Propagation is a very controversial subject as a result of little success of too many projects , nevertheless REEFSCAPERS apply a recently developed coral propagation technique that has been significantly succesful .
So let 's start from the results looking at the following amazing sequences .
What you are going to see are photo - sequences realized during a time span of some months in which you can easily see the spectacular growth of the corals .
Amazing ... is n't it ?
Let 's go into more depth about the coral propagation technique used by REEFSCAPERS
These are the famous " Coral Trays " ready to be installed on the sea bed and became the substrate and support of the new coral colony :
The Coral Trays are prepared before the installation : and then it's the time to " transplant " the corals directly upon the tray :
Now it 's a matter of time and the Coral will progressively build up a reef gathering all the species that live in this kind of habitat .
In the following pictures you can see various stages of development : I hope to have introduced to you the amazing activity that REEFSCAPERS is carrying on .
Obviously this is just a very small portrait of a much wider reality .
REEFSCAPERS is a project aimed to involve scientific research as well as tourism and environmental activity just to tell some aspects .
If you 're interested in the REEFSCAPERS project , in their philosophy and businesses and want to have more info the better thing you can do is to visit their nice website : Moreover their website is also a wonderful source of amazing pictures as you may imagine from people that works in Maldivian Sea .
You will find nice pictures of growing corals but also great shots of the reef fauna from colorful fishes to the sea turtles .
I fell in love with the following picture , it 's just perfect for this blog ...:
HarperStudio has signed a seven - figure , 10 - book deal with Gary Vaynerchuk , a 33 - year - old Belarusian - born wine retailer from New Jersey , who , except for a talk show appearance here and there , is basically unknown in mainstream media circles .

What began as a daily video blog about wine has become a self - help , business - advice juggernaut , with " Garyvee " as chief engineer .

Flannery : A Life of Flannery O’Connor , by Brad Gooch .
Little , Brown and Company , February 2009 . $ 30
Thirty years ago , a young Brad Gooch got in touch with Flannery O’Connor ’s old friend Sally Fitzgerald , who had just edited a posthumous collection of O’Connor ’s letters , The Habit of Being .
Gooch — at the time , the author of a single chapbook of poetry — proposed to write a biography of O’Connor , and wondered if this would interfere with Fitzgerald ’s own plans in that direction .
The answer was yes , though Fitzgerald was kind enough to add : “ Should I ever feel the need of an assistant , I will certainly think of you and your proposal . ”
Time passed .
Finally , in 2003 , Gooch — by now the author of an acclaimed biography of Frank O’Hara , City Poet , and several other books — was casting about for another project , when it occurred to him that Fitzgerald had died three years before , at eighty - three , without ever publishing her biography .
One possible reason was suggested , ominously , by the elusive subject herself : “ As for biographies , ” O’Connor had written , “ there wo n’t be any biographies of me because , for only one reason , lives spent between the house and the chicken yard do not make exciting copy . ”
Undaunted by this caveat , Gooch has seen fit to use it as the epigraph of his biography , from which the reader may infer one of three basic possibilities : ( 1 ) Since what mattered most to O’Connor ( and all good writers , but especially O’Connor ) was her work , Gooch intends to focus on that ; ( 2 ) Gooch has discovered fascinating , lurid aspects of O’Connor ’s life that belie her statement that nothing , essentially , ever happened to her ; ( 3 ) Gooch accepts that O’Connor ’s life was rather dull , but will focus on it anyway ( that is , instead of her work ) because , well , he admires O’Connor , and she deserves a decent biography .
The answer appears to be ( 3 ) , oddly enough , though Gooch has done an honorable job trying to vivify a life that was , indeed , “ spent between the house and the chicken yard ” — at least from the age of twenty - six , when O’Connor was diagnosed with lupus and went home to live with her mother on a farm near Milledgeville , Georgia .
Her daily routine ?
“ Like all good farm folk , ” she reported , “ we get up in the morning as soon as the first chicken cackles . ”
A devout Catholic , O’Connor would then read her morning prayers from A Short Breviary , drink coffee , and attend seven o’clock mass with her mother ; the rest of the morning — for two or three hours , as long as her uncertain store of energy would permit —
O’Connor wrote fiction , inviolably , whereupon her afternoons were spent wearily communing with guests or her beloved peacocks .
Thus O’Connor described her life in a letter from 1961 , three years before her death at age thirty - nine , though as Gooch points out , “ she could just as easily have written that report during her first few months on the farm , or any time since . ”
As that statement suggests , Gooch does n’t lack humor toward his task , thank God , and seems to grasp that his position is rather like that of the photographers and journalists who visited O’Connor during her lifetime because she was , after all , a writer of genius .
She would answer their questions guardedly , in an all but impenetrable Deep South accent , and show off her peacocks ( “ She wanted them to upstage her ” ) .
Gooch himself seems grateful for those peacocks and other fowl :
He opens with a prologue about the way O’Connor , age five , had appeared in a Pathé newsreel because she taught a chicken to walk backwards ; the episode imparts something of her iconoclasm , but is also , quite simply , one of the few noteworthy things that ever happened to her .
And without birds or some other winsome diversion , things had a way of getting sticky .
“ An interviewer ’s nightmare , ” as Gooch describes her , O’Connor once appeared on a television show called Galley Proof , wincing at the host ’s cigarette smoke and answering questions with a kind of irascible reticence :
“ When asked about the genesis of Wise Blood , she replied , ‘ Well I thought I had better get to working on a novel , so I got to work and wrote one . ’”
Next question .
O’Connor ’s origins explain her demeanor , if not her genius .
An adoring father gave her the confidence to find her own stubborn , ironical way in life , such that her loneliness became more a matter of choice than the unavoidable lot of a “ pigeon - toed , only child with a receding chin and a you - leave - me - alone - or - I ’ll - bite - you complex . ”
And perhaps her tendency to bite was somewhat due to her mother , the formidably genteel Regina , who might have liked a daughter who mixed better in decent company .
That lupus returned O’Connor to her mother ’s care for the remainder of her life was “ both a godsend and a challenge , ” as Gooch puts it .
The basic tableau of their life — gabby , solicitous mother and sullen misfit child — may have been trying for both on a daily basis , but as fodder for O’Connor ’s writing ( fictional and epistolary ) it was priceless .
“ Regina is getting very literary , ” she wrote a friend , around the time that her first novel , Wise Blood , was bringing a bit of cultural buzz to Milledgeville .
“ ‘ Who is this Kafka ? ’ she says .
‘ People ask me . ’
A German Jew , I says , I think .
He wrote a book about a man that turns into a roach .
‘ Well , I ca n’t tell people that , ’ she says . ”
Regina was hardly alone in her bewilderment .
Townsfolk who had known “ Mary Flannery ” as a lifelong oddball were nonetheless taken aback by Wise Blood : Katherine Scott — the author ’s freshman composition teacher at Georgia State College for Women — sent the novel flapping across the room when she read about Mrs .
Watts the prostitute ( “ the friendliest bed in town ” ) , while a local doctor more temperately observed , “ I enjoyed [ the book ] , but I know one thing .
She do n’t know a damn thing about a whore house . ”
That was probably true , and readers ( like me ) who hope to find revelations or even well - founded gossip about something resembling a sex life will be disappointed .
Some thought O’Connor was indifferent to the subject — except as sin , perhaps , in the abstract — and certainly it was in her interest to cultivate indifference ; but once , when a friend remarked that she would have liked to borrow some of O’Connor ’s creativity , the latter replied , “ I ’d exchange it for your ability to attract men . ”
Her one physical encounter with the opposite sex , it seems , was an awkward kiss from a textbook salesman named Erik Langkjaer , who found himself kissing teeth instead of lips : “ So I had a feeling of kissing a skeleton , ” he recalled , “ and in that sense it was a shocking experience . ”
Doubtless this was uncertainty rather than reluctance on O’Connor ’s part , given that she subsequently indulged in a bit of oblique , peacock - related wooing of the young man : “ Did I tell you that I call my baby peachicken Brother in public and Erik in private ? ”
At length , alas , Langkjaer informed her of his engagement to another woman , and O’Connor consoled herself by writing one of her best stories , “ Good Country People , ” about a raffish Bible salesman who seduces an ungainly young woman so he can abscond with her wooden leg .
An inscrutable irony served O’Connor ’s purpose both in life and art , as a means of detaching herself from uncomfortable matters , including the fools she preferred not to suffer .
She would have no truck , for instance , with the fornication and pretentious shoptalk of the Yaddo artists ’ colony , affecting a wistful desire to chat with “ an insurance salesman , dog - catcher , bricklayer — anybody who is n’t talking about Form or sleeping pills . ”
As for chatting about race relations — and Southern writers were apt to be canvassed on that point — she liked to keep people guessing .
“ Momma and me got a nigger that drives us around , ” she would announce , deadpan , or else regale a friend with her vast repertoire of racial jokes , especially if the friend happened to be a Northern liberal .
As one acquaintance conceded , O’Connor was “ a cultural racist ” who was annoyed by the sort of Yankee piety that impelled , say , the white journalist John Howard Griffin ( of Black Like Me fame ) to darken his skin and travel the South .
“ If I had been one of them white ladies Griffin sat down by on the bus , ” O’Connor quipped , “ I would have got up PDQ , preferring to sit by a genuine Negro . ”
And while she regarded blacks as fellow “ children of God ” who would ultimately “ converge ” with whites , both socially and spiritually , she was n’t about to trouble the water in Milledgeville by meeting with James Baldwin ( “ Might as well expect a mule to fly as me to see James Baldwin in Georgia ” ) , and she took a dim view of folks who objected to the word “ nigger ” in her stories :
“ The people I was writing about would never use any other word , ” she accurately observed .
One can hardly stress enough that work was what mattered to O’Connor , whether as art for art ’s sake , or the conversion of heathens , or the salvation of her own immortal soul .
Taken to Lourdes by loved ones who hoped to arrest her lupus , O’Connor grudgingly allowed herself to be immersed in the waters because she needed divine help with The Violent Bear It Away ( “ I prayed there for the novel I was working on , not for my bones which I care about less ” ) .
Her writerly seriousness was such that she was even willing to endure the lifelong mentorship of Caroline Gordon , a fellow Catholic who wrote long , hectoring letters invoking the aesthetics of Henry James , Flaubert , Yeats , et al. , and caviled in person over the use of “ seems ” versus “ as if . ”
“ When [ Gordon ] is doing something like that she is most nearly herself , ” said her apprentice with cheerful submission .
A born stylist , O’Connor was probably more in need of friendship than advice .
Her main challenge as a writer — or so one would think — was finding story material in a life that was mostly about religion , lupus , peacocks , and a problematic relationship with her mother .
As it happened , though , she was rarely at a loss , reaping all sorts of données from the Farmer ’s Market Bulletin or the weekly Union - Recorder , whose item about a promotional stunt ( “ Shake Hands with Live Gorilla ” ) would provide a key element of Wise Blood .
Chekhov explained his creative process by snatching up an ashtray — any pearl would do to make a story — and one suspects it was something like that for O’Connor , too : “ I did n’t know he was going to steal that wooden leg until ten or twelve lines before he did it , ” she explained with respect to that Bible salesman in ‘ Good Country People , ’ “ but when I found out that this was what was going to happen , I realized that it was inevitable . ”
With such a capacious imagination , such a singular sense of the macabre , it seems almost a shame that O’Connor considered it her bounden duty to write , always , from a Catholic perspective ( “ Do not make the absurd attempt to sever in yourself the artist and the Christian ” was a line she marked heavily in her copy of Jacques Maritain ’s Art and Scholasticism ) .
I would submit that her stories are most successful insofar as they remain ambiguous — that is to say , not too overtly religious .
I ca n’t remember how old I was when I first read “ A Good Man Is Hard to Find , ” but it did n’t remotely occur to me that the author was Catholic .
And really one need n’t formulate a theme at all in this case ( apart from something vague about the consequences of nihilism ) :
One marvels at the sheer virtuosity — the sustained sense of foreboding , the exact visual details verging on the grotesque ( “ the grandmother raised her head like a parched old turkey hen crying for water ” ) , the flawless diction ( “ It ’s no real pleasure in life ” ) .
For a would - be writer , the story bears constant rereading as a lesson in craft :
Nothing can be added or detracted without diminishing the effect — the gradual curdling of comedy into horror that would cause O’Connor ’s audiences , when she read the story aloud , to lapse into stunned silence after the first tentative giggles .
Less successful are the more explicit allegories such as “ The Artificial Nigger ” — with its little sermon at the end , lest one miss the point .
“ To the hard of hearing you shout , ” O’Connor famously declared , “ and for the almost - blind you draw large and startling figures . ”
Given my druthers as an agnostic reader , I ’d prefer squinting to being shouted at .
Gooch does a good job connecting the dots between O’Connor ’s work and life , and his occasional aperçus in this regard ( “ she , too , had lost ‘ a wooden part of her soul ’ in the encounter with Erik [ Langkjaer ] … [ which ] may have constituted a kind of grace ” ) suggest a lively grasp of her artistic intentions ; all the stranger , then , to find so little in the way of extended critical discussion .
Perhaps Gooch figured that plot - summary would suffice , more or less , given the abundant attention that O’Connor ’s work has received elsewhere , and yet this seems like writing about Churchill and giving his politics short shrift .
We are left with O’Connor ’s life , such as it was , along with a lot of incidental detail proving that Gooch is an industrious if not very discriminating researcher .
If he mentions O’Connor ’s high school , rest assured he will also mention that its “ up - to - date layout included twenty - three classrooms , two lecture halls , seven science labs , an auditorium , cafeteria , gym , armory , shooting gallery . ”
Really ?
A shooting gallery ?
Such ozone is so relentless that one begins to groan whenever the setting changes .
The summer of 1944 : “ The D - day invasion had taken place with 155,000 Allied troops landing on the beaches of Normandy , opening a wedge in the Nazi domination of continental Europe . ”
Or ( my favorite ) : “ Flannery was oblivious to most of the changes that were making New York City the ‘ first city ’ of the postwar world : its population , during the administration of Mayor William O’Dwyer , approaching the 1950 census figure of 7,891,957 ; construction beginning along the East River of the UN Secretariat , the world ’s first glass - walled skyscraper . ”
If this were , say , a biography of Truman Capote , I wonder if Gooch would feel the need to inform us so assiduously about matters to which his subject was , after all , “ oblivious . ”
Which is not to say one should n’t research matters incidental to one ’s subject , only that such research belongs mostly in the subtext , as a way of seeing things in the round .
In this respect the biographer should strive to be “ like God in the universe , ” as Flaubert would have it , “ present everywhere and visible nowhere , ” while the reader ( ideally ) senses a kind of negative capability at work , whereby even paradoxical information seems somehow inevitable .
At any rate it ’s the reader ’s part to google the population of New York circa 1950 , if she or he is so inclined .
That said , however , I hasten to add that Gooch can be quite seamless in relating episodes that are inherently dramatic — that need n’t , in other words , be inflated with Google gas .
For example , when he writes about what happened at Yaddo in the spring of 1949 : Robert Lowell ( in the grip of religious mania , on the brink of a colossal breakdown ) demanded the dismissal of Yaddo ’s director , Elizabeth Ames , on the grounds that she harbored communists .
This witch hunt had always struck me as merely despicable , but Gooch puts it in perspective : “ [ M ] ore conservative Southern Agrarians , ” he writes , “ and modernists such as Eliot and Lowell — with sympathies for religion , and a visceral response to Communist atheism — still distrusted these reformed ‘ fellow travelers . ’ ”
So Lowell ’s fanaticism was at least sincere , and coincided nicely with that of Flannery O’Connor , who was only a little more temperate about things than the bipolar poet .
Returning to Georgia afterward , she berated her old history professor ( “ Why did n’t you teach me about Communism ? ” ) and wrote to a friend that the iniquities of Yaddo had “ confirmed ” her belief that the devil “ [ had ] a family . ”
This while Lowell decompressed in a padded cell .
In this case Gooch tells us almost everything we need to know , and little we do n’t ; still , I was left wanting at least some slight , Flaubertian hint as to his own point of view .
Elizabeth Ames a member of the devil ’s family ?
I mean to say , what ?
Religion seems to have distorted O’Connor ’s vision like a pair of coke - bottle glasses : useful ( up to a point ) in “ draw[ing ] large and startling figures , ” perhaps something of a hindrance in everyday life .
Without the catharsis of art , anyway , she might have been something of a monster , rather than the shy , lucid person who was content to let peacocks upstage her .
“ When I look at my birds I often think of Yaddo and how well a few of them would go with the place , ” she wrote Mrs. Ames in 1958 , sweetly declining an invitation to return .
Probably her work had gone well that day .
Social Security is back in the limelight where once again its problems will no doubt be ignored .
Please consider Recession Puts a Major Strain On Social Security Trust Fund .
The U.S. recession is wreaking havoc on yet another front : the Social Security trust fund .
With unemployment rising , the payroll tax revenue that finances Social Security benefits for nearly 51 million retirees and other recipients is falling , according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office .
As a result , the trust fund 's annual surplus is forecast to all but vanish next year -- nearly a decade ahead of schedule -- and deprive the government of billions of dollars it had been counting on to help balance the nation 's books .
The Treasury Department has for decades borrowed money from the Social Security trust fund to finance government operations .
If it is no longer able to do so , it could be forced to borrow an additional $ 700 billion over the next decade from China , Japan and other investors .
And at some point , perhaps as early as 2017 , according to the CBO , the Treasury would have to start repaying the billions it has borrowed from the trust fund over the past 25 years , driving the nation further into debt or forcing Congress to raise taxes .
My Comment
" It suggests we better get working on Social Security and stop burying our heads in the sand , " said Sen. Judd Gregg ( N.H. ) , the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee .
" The Social Security trust fund , though technically in balance , is going to put huge pressures on taxpayers very soon . "
My Comment
Many liberal analysts reject the notion that Social Security needs fixing , arguing that the system is projected to fully support payments to beneficiaries through 2041 -- so long as the Treasury repays its debts .
My Comment
The trust fund has long taken in more in revenue from payroll taxes and other sources than it pays out in benefits .
Last August , the CBO predicted that surplus would exceed $ 80 billion this year and next , then rise to around $ 90 billion before slowly evaporating by 2020 .
But the rapidly deteriorating economy -- particularly the loss of more than 4 million jobs -- has driven those numbers much lower much faster , with the surplus expected to hit $ 16 billion this year and only $ 3 billion next year , then vanish entirely by 2017 .
In his budget , Obama predicted that the trust fund surplus would hit $ 30 billion this year , according to Mark Lassiter , a spokesman for the Social Security Administration .
But that number , too , is far less than the $ 80 billion the trustees had forecast for 2009 .
In addition to declining revenues , Lassiter said the system is likely to incur higher expenses due to big jumps in new retirement and disability claims .
Both are expected to rise by at least 12 percent this year compared with 2008 .
My Comment

Obama 's $ 9.3 Trillion Budget Deficit
President Barack Obama 's budget would produce $ 9.3 trillion in deficits over the next decade , more than four times the deficits of Republican George W. Bush 's presidency , congressional auditors said Friday .
The new Congressional Budget Office figures offered a far more dire outlook for Obama 's budget than the new administration predicted just last month — a deficit $ 2.3 trillion worse .
It 's a prospect even the president 's own budget director called unsustainable .
The dismal deficit figures , if they prove to be accurate , inevitably raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies controlling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends or else pare back his agenda .
By CBO 's calculation , Obama 's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $ 1 trillion a year of red ink over 2010 - 2019 .
Worst of all , CBO says the deficit under Obama 's policies would never go below 4 percent of the size of the economy , figures that economists agree are unsustainable .
By the end of the decade , the deficit would exceed 5 percent of gross domestic product , a dangerously high level .
Most disturbing to Obama allies like Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad , D - N.D. , are the longer term projections , which climb above $ 1 trillion again by the end of the next decade and approach 6 percent of GDP by 2019 .
The worsening economy is responsible for the even deeper fiscal mess inherited by Obama .
As an illustration , CBO says the deficit for the current budget year , which began Oct. 1 , will top $ 1.8 trillion , $ 93 billion more than foreseen by the White House .
That would equal 13 percent of GDP , a level not seen since World War II .
Trust Fund Projections
Finally , why does everyone continue the charade of calling Social Security a " trust fund " when it 's clearly not a fund and there cannot possibly be any trust in it ?

Univ. of Chicago Uses Wit to Counter Westboro Baptist Protest
By Marcus Gilmer in News on Mar 10 , 2009 6:40 PM
The infamous Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka , Kansas hit up the Hyde Park campus of the University of Chicago yesterday , one of three protests the church had planned at the University .
According to a report last month by Chi Town Daily News :
The group is targeting several so - called evils at its March 9 protests in Chicago .
Among them , according to the church 's Website : that Theodore Jennings , the founder of the Chicago Theological Seminary , believes Jesus was a homosexual .
And at the University of Chicago itself , the group will argue its contention that President Obama is the Antichrist and misinformed students when he taught at the law school .
Of course , what the WBC protesters did n't count on was a clever counter - protest by students , staff , and faculty of the school , who easily out - numbered the WBC protesters .
But it was n't just about mocking the WBC 'ers .
The U of C participants brought the event an almost festive atmosphere , serving food and raising over $ 500 for the Broadway Youth Center , as well as collecting signatures on petitions urging the overturning of California 's controversial Prop 8 .
Additional pictures of everything that went down can be found here .

“ The era of a perfect Internet computer for $ 99 is coming this year , ” said Jen - Hsun Huang , the chief executive of Nvidia , a maker of PC graphics chips that is trying to adapt to the new technological order .
“ The primary computer that we know of today is the basic PC , and it ’s dying to be reinvented . ”
An unexpected group of companies has emerged to help drive this transformation  firms like Qualcomm , Freescale Semiconductor and Samsung Electronics , which make cheap , power - saving chips used in cellphones and are now applying that expertise to PCs .
As in any revolution , the current rulers of the kingdom  Intel and Microsoft , which make the chips and software that run most PCs  face an unprecedented challenge to their dominance .
Microsoft is particularly vulnerable , since many of the new netbooks use Linux software instead of Windows .
“ A broad shift in the consumer market toward low - cost PCs would clearly put pressure on the revenues of nearly every player in the value chain , from component suppliers to retailers , ” wrote A. M. Sacconaghi , a securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company , in a report last month .
“ However , we believe the impact would be especially negative for Intel and Microsoft , who today enjoy near monopoly positions in their respective markets . ”
So far , netbooks have appealed to a relatively small audience .
Some of the devices feel more like toys or overgrown phones than full - featured computers .
Still , they are the big success story in the PC industry , with sales predicted to double this year , even as overall PC sales fall 12 percent , according to the research firm Gartner .
By the end of 2009 , netbooks could account for close to 10 percent of the PC market , an astonishing rise in a short span .

Controversial Slovak police video
Posted
Apr 8 - A controversial video emerges showing what is alleged to be Slovakian police telling Roma children to slap each other and strip .
It was about the beginning of 1942 when I was a prisoner of war of the Japanese , when I was ordered to go on a working party which eventually finished up in the Sankakan in British North Borneo .
Two thousand odd of us were in this work party and it was n't long before we noticed the absence of information as to the international situation , what was happening in the outside world , and the whole camp had a real craving to get news by whatever means .
Escape parties were being organised , but none of these were very successful .
The next thing people turned to was a means of getting some radio news , and this is where the building of a radio set became an urgent requirement .
The main thing , of course , was that we did n't have any components and although we had some contacts outside which later on were helpful in the building of this receiver , it limited our requirement to a regenerative receiver as from a super heterodyne receiver and the decision to do that was borne out by the results .
The high frequency spectrum during that time of the war was fairly quiet in that part of the world and the BBC , we hoped , would be able to be received .
This was aided by the fact that the Japanese in their wisdom called a friend of mine out one evening to repair their radio set and he took the opportunity , of course , to switch over to the short wave bands , with headphones while doing that , and picked up the BBC successfully .
That day was memorable because it was the day that the BBC broadcast the death of the Duke of Kent in an aircraft crash .
That was the only news we had of the outside world for something like six months .
The plan was made to begin building the radio , so until we could build components , there was nothing much we could do .
A look at the circuit diagram of a regenerative receiver indicates a number of capacitors - about two or three are required - low capacitors to make the oscillating part of the system work , and in fact from memory we needed in the grid circuit at least one " .01 microfarad " capacitor and there was no chance we could get this anywhere , or any other components .
So we hit upon the idea of taking some tin foil or aluminum foil from the lining of the tea chest from which the Japanese supplied with the rice rations , then by the well known equations for calculating capacity and the relationship of the surface area and spacing of the plates , we built a capacitor or , at least , I built a capacitor which according to calculations should have been about " .01 microfarad . "
If I could put an aside here , I built a replica of this capacitor some years ago , and it went out to Simpson barracks where we had some friends in the testing laboratory , and with great excitement the Warrant Officer concerned said , " We will see how good your calculations were " ; so he put it on his equipment which was accurate to many decimal points and read on his display unit , " .009 microfarad " , so we thought we were pretty good .
I said " Touché " to him because he did n't think we could do it .
I made two or three of these , and I still had one of them that would work if I built the receiver again , which I have been thinking about doing , except there is always something else , like a lot of other projects which one has as one gets older .
The resistors were another problem .
We found out that we could use the impurities in some of the tree wood and the bark , particularly cinnamon bark which was available by getting through the wire only about 2 feet and we could normally pinch that while the Japanese sentry was moving around .
We used a piece of string with the material rubbed on it from the burning of the cinnamon bark with some impurities in it ( we did n't have a chemical analysis ) ; we were n't very fussed because most grid - leak resistors were about a megohm or thereabouts and we had no means or any way we could measure a megohm , so it was largely a trial and error thing to see if it would work .
We made a number of these bits of string and tied them round different things to dry them out to get the thing going .
Eventually about an inch , three quarters of an inch to an inch , was about the right order of things to get about a megohm resistance .
They were the two main things .
Now the things we could n't provide , could n't do .
We had to make coils ; they were largely trial and error , one could calculate the inductance of these if one had access to some means of measuring the wire gauge and the space between them .
So that was largely a trial and error business .
The two biggest components , or two biggest requirements , were we needed some headphones and we needed a valve , and I thought that the rest could be made locally with a bit of luck .
On the question of the headpiece an outside contact smuggled in one headphone , which was better than no headphone , and a valve - no valve holder but one can't have everything in this life .
The other trouble was the power supply .
The Japanese main around the camp which provided the power was 110 volts roughly according to the power station meter which we could n't help but see , because we delivered the wood there while the power station was running ; I switched over when no one was looking and the frequency was about 60 Hz , not 50 Hz as we thought , not that this worried us anyway but to know that it was manageable .
So two problems remained for the power supply .
The first one was the A - battery or low voltage supply necessary for the filament of the valve .
We started with a couple of dry cells , but these did n't last very long and we had to make something then .
Through being friendly with the pharmacist with the party , we got some potassium bichromate and made up a bichromate cell , which is probably well known in the text books but not of very practical use .
It 's fairly hungry for zinc and it needs some sulfuric acid which one can't throw around or hide easily , but it served for some time and was quite successful but , in the end , had the operation lasted very long , we would have been in trouble for that .
Two of these cells provided about 3 volts to 4 volts , and 6 volts was a bit too much because each cell was running at a bit over 2 volts , about 2.2 volts .
The biggest problem was a rectifier to rectify the AC into DC without dropping it to a low voltage , because remember in those days we needed high voltages for the B supply , or anode supply , but in these days we bring everything down to small DC voltages ; we needed to get them up as high as we could .
That was a partial failure in that using aluminum foil again and oxidising one piece of it , or length of it folded over , with some weak acid and then using the two electrodes , one of clear aluminum and one of a zinc salt and aluminum , we could make a rectifier .
We would n't be so audacious as to call it a rectifier now , because it had a reverse voltage of something like 30 or 40 volts , which was n't exactly ideal , but for DC we had no option .
The result was that I made a bridge rectifier but the only problem was that after 15 minutes the electrolyte began to boil , so it was really passing current in both directions but a little bit more one way than the other .
So a single cell , an extra rectifier cell , was the only way I could close this down a bit , and some smoothing .
This we achieved with part of a fish plate from the railway line which was being used at the aerodrome to move the dirt from one place to another by man-power , about six men on these , and the odd fish plate used to disappear anyway for various reasons .
I dropped one off at the power station and asked the Chinese under my breath if he could cut it into three little sections which he did , he did n't want to know why .
Then again using some palm oil and some bee wire which was in fairly plentiful supply , which we stole - it was a bit risky because the Japanese were cultivating a couple of beehives outside the wire and of course this wire used to disappear for various things unrelated to radio - and we put the palm oil along the wire stretched out and rubbed this palm oil on it , thickening it with a little bit of flour and then heating it ; the flour bound the palm oil together and formed a fairly good insulation over the wire .
Good , but lucky , and with a lot of traveling .
I should come back to the capacitors on that , because we had to insulate the layers of those which we did by putting a layer of newspaper ( a few people had newspaper and various things , for other reasons than newspaper of course , but then we had no other toilet requisites in the party ) and by soaking this in some coconut oil we could insulate each layer after we wound it , and with a piece of this bee wire - we had something like fifty feet of it - wound round this part of the fish plate , we made a fairly good choke coil .
And then a bigger capacitor , which was no trouble , having had success with the small one , to just wrap as much tin foil as we could round another sheet of newspaper which finished up about 18 inches long by about three quarters of an inch in diameter .
We did n't even try to measure the capacitance of it , because we could n't do anything about it anyway , except put more wire on .
And that in effect was a fairly good rectifier , a very dangerous one because we had the 110 all right but we had a bit over that by the time we had rectified it , and we do n't know because we had no means of measuring it .
Finally , the valve ; we joined the valve by winding the clean little bee wire around it and then plugging it with any insulating material we could get to make it stick , - no valve holder , of course .
So eventually we produced a receiver of sorts , except it would n't oscillate .
We tried building more , another choke coil , and this went on for ages ; there was no possibility we could get this valve to oscillate .
I think it 's recommended according to a friend of mine who had an amateur license , he thought that about 120 volts was the best we could get and there was no way we could get that by trying to smooth this any more .
So the only avenue open was to bribe one Chinese working at the power station who was very much our way , and of course in those days was a nationalist Chinese .
The capital of China in those days was Chungking , and I told him we could get him some overseas news from Chungking if he would slowly wind his field coil power up on the generator every night starting at about 9 o'clock bit by bit , and get it up to about 130 on his meter .
He understood , and after that I said half an hour to drop it again , very quietly and slowly because it may affect the lights " .... and you no speak about that because you get chopped , you know , and we will give you Chungking news .... "
This was duly done and for about six months we had reliable communication .
The first trial on air had too much hum , and we had to modify a few things two or three times in attempts to get it right , and in the end we had a workable situation which was worth exploring .
Capacitors right , choke coils right , one head phone , we had some old rag so we tied it round the head and tied it on , or string , or whatever we could get .
With the hope of recording something we took some paper , which was n't in plentiful supply , but the odd piece of paper we could get .
Running notches down the left hand side , about a quarter to a half inch apart down the paper , and bending it over so that these little pieces stuck up in the air , and in the pitch darkness one could then put the headphones over one 's head with eyes looking out for possible interruption by the Japanese - we had some lookouts , or cockatoos as the Australians called them , around the place to warn us at the oncoming of the Japanese - and with great trepidation we heard Big Ben chiming one night .
Of course only one of us heard it but we were so full of enthusiasm .
It was the BBC all right ; it was quite a clear signal but it was somebody talking about growing hops in Kent .
This broadcast went on for something like three quarters of an hour without any interruption , but ultimately the signal faded out and I was very annoyed .
I was asked the next morning by my senior officer what was the news , and I said " we 've got good news ; I can't talk here , come this way . "
So he came along and said " what 's this news you 're talking about . "
I said I did n't actually hear any news , and he became very annoyed with me and said what the hell did I mean , and I said " if the British primary producing experts are capable and able to spare the time to talk about growing hops in Kent , Britain must still be alive and floating with their thumbs up , and as far as I 'm concerned that 's the best news I could hear ! "
That 's the outline and maybe there are some questions I have n't covered properly .
BJ : The first question I would like to ask you is :
What did you have in the way of tools , if any , and how did you connect the components of the wireless without , presumably , a soldering iron ?
RGW : No soldering iron , no solder of course , and no other system really available but to twist and wrap with some coconut oil paper , or cardboard or something , and very gently lift it .
It was on a platen of wood we obtained somewhere ; it was about a foot by a foot or something , so we just mounted the components on that .
A meat skewer on the capacitor - oh , we had a capacitor too , a capacitor , a valve and a headphone , which were external to camp components we had .
We did n't have any tools at all , except someone obtained the use of a sledge hammer - for what purpose I do n't know because one of those would not be needed to escape ; other than cutting up the soft iron of the fish plate which was about the only reason we needed anything , the rest were just twisted wires .
We just wanted to get one usable because we did n't know whether it might be blown up or captured ; we were n't worried , the main thing was initially a short term aim ( as well as a long term aim ) that it might last .
Fortunately , it lasted for over a year - sixteen months until the arrests took place , but that 's another story .
BJ : Can I just ask you - the components for the low voltage battery cells that you produced , where did you get all the components from ?
RGW : Well , zinc was n't hard , there was some sheet zinc lying on the aerodrome and we pinched quite a bit of that because that would be eaten away during the use of the cells for the low voltage .
I do n't know what would have happened if that ran out .
I think someone produced two lantern cells which did for a while , but it was mainly on this home - made cell system , which was n't efficient but nowhere near as inefficient as the rectifier was .
We must have been consuming ...
Ah Ping said he had to turn up a lot of power to keep the lights what they wanted .
We were dispersing such an amount of power in this four test tube rectifier for the high tension .
A variable capacitor was another component we had to bring in .
We could n't make a variable capacitor , it was impossible .
We had to take two plates off the one we had to get a high enough frequency .
Yes , I can't remember why we did n't go up a bit in inductance ; it was largely a trial and error business really .
Except that in a regenerative receiver you had some idea when you were near a station because the receiver was so sensitive as all regenerative receivers are .
It had a piece of meat skewer type wood which I had a hole drilled in by a pen-knife , and we glued this in with some of our glue or something , into the capacitor shaft so that we could tune it by holding a little stick across it , fixing it at about six inches because one could n't get one 's hands any closer to the set because it was in a state of very near oscillation where the maximum sensitivity is , just before it bursts into oscillation .
With a fairly clear HF band , it was n't long before we knew roughly , by putting a couple of marks on the stick , where it was .
We knew that the Voice of America was due for a transmission and I do n't think we ever knew the frequencies because the BBC did n't announce frequencies , they just came on the air and broadcast .
BJ : What did you use for an aerial ?
RGW : A clothes line .
All the huts had a clothes line of some sort so we just took a thin wire from that and wrapped it round the edge , knowing that a normal sentry would n't take any notice of it , and we just dragged that across the side of the hut and brought it in , and the people with our permission would put their loin cloths out and hang them over this when they washed them so it looked as if it was being used .
The toilet in the sleeping block was a hole in the ground and it was verboten to be used by anybody except to put our radio set in when it was n't in use ; everybody respected our wishes in that regard !
I think the best thrill was , well two or three thrills , which were momentous I suppose and of great excitement , almost excitement of crying with excitement , and the first was I think when we heard a full news bulletin of something like 400 aircraft over Dresden or somewhere , pounding the place to pieces ; we were very pleased about all this .
But from the land point of view , from the beginning of ' 42 I think , I can't remember , but sometime just before the Battle of Alamein , and we heard some of the troop movements in preparation for that .
The bulletins in those days were fairly long and gave a lot of detail .
Unfortunately the first lot of rectifiers blew up about 2 days after this so we were out of business for something like 5 or 6 weeks .
Of course , the rumours started to flood in as to what was happening , what was n't happening , the war would be over in 5 minutes and all these mainly optimistic things ; but there were a few super - pessimists who said we would never get off the island , and would die there , and that sort of thing .
But the thrill , I think , was when reception was restored again and we had to do another little bit of fine tuning because everything you changed seemed to affect something else ; the whole thing was very sensitive and would n't have stood up to present day quality assurance bump tests !
So back there on the first night we missed the BBC for some reason , and the next thing was the Voice of America which had a headline which ran something like this :
" The war is over in North Africa , Rommel is knocked to pieces , he 's out of the Middle East and the Middle East is finished , the future for this and that ............. "
That was the end of the American news in about three sentences !
No other detail , so I said we would go back at about 12.30 , and hope that Ah Ping had n't pulled the voltage down too far , to see what we could hear .
Again , the BBC was a little low but it suddenly came quite bright and lifted in volume , and Big Ben chimed again and there was a voice in the wilderness calling .
It was a lovely sensation to hear Big Ben playing in those days , and every time I hear it now I become excited .
The announcement , initially in a most depressing vein , described all about the 8th Army 's movements , and it was here that it did this , and this regiment drew up and did that , on and on this went for something like 15 to 20 minutes , and we tried not to follow it because we had our eyes on too many other things , look - outs and so on .
But a lovely flow of English and if you had a tracing board you could have traced out exactly where everything was in situ , but of course that was n't the aim of our exercise which was to get news .
At the finish of the news the polite sentence said " It must be considered now that as all resistance in North Africa has been overcome the Allies victory must be " assured " or something like that .
And that was all he said , but he took a few minutes to describe everything that happened , so you had a clear picture .
But the Americans seemed to be creating for a public that just wanted the headlines , three headlines and that was all ; no other interest in anything else .
That was one of the happy moments of the system .
We had the problem , of course , of writing the news because naturally a lot of people wanted to know it and a lot of people could be told it without its origin .
This is why we used the piece of paper we took with us ( Gordon Waite and the other officer who used to share some of the work ) , and as soon as we heard about 30 bombers over Dresden or something , you just put 30 BD , or B for Berlin , and feel the paper down when you felt it coming to the end , and pick up the next little bit of bend and write along that in the pitch dark , hoping that you 've got something in the morning .
Surprising how legible it was , just triggered a couple of words like that .
Unfortunately , I was in deep custodianship with the Kempitai when the Atom Bombs were dropped and I did n't hear that news on the BBC ; it was relayed to me .
We did n't keep these things , of course .
Getting off the technical side now , the radio set did n't betray itself .
Some criticism could be levelled at us I suppose .
We trusted too many people ; we had no intelligence training then , of course , or anything like that and we were inclined to trust every Asian we met who smiled at us and who said he was one of us .
Anyway , while this was going on at the aerodrome and once the troops heard , we had to tell the troops the good news of course .
We said we had heard from an unknown source that the war is getting better , or something like that - we had to give them a sanitised version .
It was probably all they wanted but , naturally , two or three senior officers wanted to know as much as they could because they may be the ones who would have to take some decisions one day about it .
Unknown to us an Indian - I do n't like saying this and I 'm not being racist , it could have been any nationality - blackmailed a Chinese who was helping us on the aerodrome picking up bits of iron for us and various other things .
He blackmailed him but the Chinese would n't talk , so the Kempitai arrested the Chinese and put him on a rack ; he mentioned in the course of his cries for help - which was not a nice thing to think about but I do n't blame him - he mentioned Captain Matthews and a couple of other people ; I think I would have done the same thing at that stage .
The Japanese then decided to make a raid on the camp , which they did , and I was then charged and taken away by the Captain ; he wanted the receiver and I gave it to him in the end after a lot of leading him round the camp with his soldiers .
I could almost laugh at some of the things that happened .
He must have told them he was looking for a radio set ; a Jap soldier came running up to him with a piece of metal which looked like a piece of horse harness or something ; the Captain almost kicked him and told him what to do .
So in the end I decided that I could n't talk to anybody before the rest of the troops on this parade ground , and I felt so conspicuous .
He walked back and said " Are you going to tell me because we want the wireless set ? " , so I said " Yes , I 've just thought where it might be " .
So I went across and told him where the hole was , and they dug the hole up and , of course , there was the transmitter .
He said " Ah , you 've been sensible at last " , so he took the transmitter and they took it away .
From that day on , I was worried about this because I knew the receiver was OK and the troops would be happy about that ; they would still be able to get news .
And then he took me up to the platform where he stood and addressed everyone .
All he said in English was " You all look at this man , you will never see him again " and led me off .
I had a sort of a dying wish , going in on the vehicle to Sandakan to be interrogated , that somehow or other this set could be preserved and , of course unknown to me , it was .
They continued using it but not until after about a week or so - their nerves were a bit shaken .
But they used it for some months afterwards until the big moves came and it was a successful source of morale lifter .
During the trial , that was when the shock came to me when this transmitter was brought out by the prosecution as evidence that we had been using a receiver , but the Court accepted it .
It was never mentioned after that because had it been , I do n't think either of us would have been alive , because we had planned to get some crystals from the Philippines and try and fit them in this set then we could call them on CW and give them some news about ourselves .
But we did get some news by other means , via an agent taking a sandalwood vessel across , that the British and Australian authorities knew where we were , and it was proved at the end of the war that they knew exactly where to come for us .
They had guerrilla parties in behind the lines , but they could n't contact us and they had to watch some of our people just die virtually , because they were there and there would have been trouble otherwise .
BJ : Could I just take you back and ask you to fill in a few details about the transmitter .
You talked a lot about the construction of the receiver and I would be very interested to know where the transmitter fitted in to this ; were you developing that alongside ? "
RGW : " No , the receiver first ; we had that , and then we started the transmitter as a rather low priority of course , but one it would be nice to have .
I had finished the two 6L6 G's to make a push - pull amplifier that was the RF output to be , and the oscillator , and we had the capacitor but were missing a few more components and that was about where we were .
In other words , in the course of events , had he been an expert with some sort of knowledge of electrical engineering , we would never have got away with two 6L6's sitting up on a block of wood with a few capacitors and things hanging on them , but obviously the Court Martial officers were normal , without disrespect to Infantry Officers , and they had no knowledge of telecommunications .
BJ : Again , the valves you used in the receiver were ...?

Bartz plans to streamline Yahoo 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Get ready for yet another Yahoo Inc. reshuffle .
Carol Bartz , named chief executive last month , is planning to revamp the beleaguered Sunnyvale Web portal in an effort to speed up decision making and help reverse its slowing growth .
The shakeup , which could come as early as this week , is expected to create a new , more streamlined organizational chart .
No major layoffs are planned , according to an executive familiar with the matter .
However , as part of the upcoming reorganization , Bartz , 60 , a former CEO of business softwaremaker Autodesk , is expected to replace some Yahoo executives .
Who will be leaving , and when , was unclear .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
A Yahoo spokesman declined to comment on what he called " rumors and speculation . "
On Monday , Neeraj Khemlani , who led Yahoo's news , tech and weather properties , said he would be joining Hearst Corp. , owner of The Chronicle , as vice president and special assistant to the chief executive for digital media .
He said that his departure was unrelated to any Yahoo reorganization and that Bartz " really understands how to reposition the company , which needs a little bit of help , but has all the core assets that it needs to succeed . "
Yahoo's management has undergone a series of upheavals over the past 20 months , including a raft of departures and shifting responsibilities amid a failed $ 47.5 billion takeover bid by Microsoft Corp .
But the changes have n't prompted the turnaround that many investors were hoping for .
Derek Brown , an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald , said that Yahoo's future success depends on fixing its internal problems .
Only then will it be able to tackle the formidable challenge of Google Inc. , whose success in search has cemented its position at the top of the Internet food chain .
Brown criticized Bartz 's predecessor , Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang , for failing to make significant changes during his brief 17 - month tenure , which started with him promising that there would be no sacred cows .
He has higher hopes for Bartz , who he said seems to be more willing to do what 's necessary to speed up " decision - making that was significantly slower than the marketplace demanded . "
" One thing that seems reassuring on the outside is that you have a relatively new set of eyes assessing the situation more objectively , " Brown said .
During her first six weeks on the job , Bartz has voiced thinly veiled criticism of Yahoo's past executives , describing the company " as one with enormous assets that frankly could use a little management . "
She also said that Yahoo needed fundamental change to speed decision making and to develop a clearer strategy .
Yahoo has steadily lost market share in search to Google , prompting some investors to ask whether Yahoo should get out of the search business and partner with Microsoft instead .
The failure to compete has hurt Yahoo particularly hard amid the deteriorating economy because search ads have performed better than other kinds of online advertising , particularly banner ads , a category that Yahoo leads .
Postmortem : Square Enix's The World Ends With You
By Takeshi Arakawa , Tomohiro Hasegawa , Tatsuya Kando
[ In this rare postmortem , originally published in Gamasutra 's sister Game Developer magazine , the creators behind acclaimed DS title The World Ends With You at Square Enix and Jupiter describe exactly what went right -- and wrong -- while making the innovative touch - screen title . ]
The World Ends With
You was our team 's first game for the Nintendo DS -- a platform that we felt had limitless possibilities .
The three of us who were primarily responsible for the game had previously worked as artists for the Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series , but had never directed a game before .
The game wound up taking two years to develop , which is a considerable amount of time for a portable game , and was a continual trial - and - error process throughout .
We feel that the resulting project was eclectic and ambitious , but not different just for the sake of being different .
What Went Right
1. Getting to go wild with original IP and gameplay concepts .
The project began with constant brainstorming and idea - sharing between the three of us .
As this was our first game as directors , a healthy dose of paranoia prompted daily brainstorming meetings .
These sessions established a strong sense of camaraderie and led for better overall communication , allowing us to constantly meet our deadlines without any serious delays .
From the beginning we were determined to create an original IP -- something that was n't another Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts .
This led us to choose the Shibuya district in Tokyo as the game 's setting .
At first we thought the Shibuya locale would be a turnoff to overseas players , but the district 's uniqueness adds a certain reality and depth that we could n't have recreated in a fantasy setting , and it lets players identify more with their in - game counterparts , who are fighting for their lives in the " real world . "
It turns out we were successful -- even a year after the game 's Japanese release , hardcore fans are still organizing tours of the real Shibuya to compare it to the game world .
2 . A story created by committee ( and free of those pesky RPG plot holes ) !
Like all other aspects of development , story development was done by committee .
Each director was given his own writing team , which brainstormed over the general story background , plot , and other elements .
Because the over arching story has the player trapped in Shibuya , the story needed an air of mystery about it , so the team was determined to avoid any plot holes .
One contradiction in a story like ours could bring down the house of cards , so the team worked carefully to keep the storyline locked down .
The game 's designers took part in the writing process as well , ensuring that as many eyes as possible went over the plot , searching for holes and offering input from every conceivable angle .
After the final story was in place , we had our Q/ A department go over everything as a final failsafe .
To our surprise ( and horror ) , they tracked down several inconsistencies we had managed to miss during our multiple checks .
Their diligence reminded us of how critical it is to view the game from the player 's perspective -- and these extensive preliminary story checks are becoming a standard at the company .
3 . Implementing a player - controlled risk vs. reward system .
Many agree that the standard JRPG formula of walking around the field and grinding ( or running away from monsters that are n't worth your time ) can get monotonous and build up player stress .
Another issue on the development side is that tuning combat difficulty takes excessive amounts of time , and there 's no guarantee that a designer 's ideal difficulty is the same as the player's .
Our solution was the " Active Encounter " system , where players can choose how many enemies they wish to fight and when .
This removes mandatory battles with " trash mobs , " and allows the player to control the risks and rewards of battle .
Harder battles yield better loot and more experience points .
This let players of varying skill levels enjoy the game beginning to end -- at the cost of some game balance .
4. Going full - bore 2D .
Modern settings are rare for Square Enix titles , so we had to make sure our art style would stand out from other titles -- and to keep the entire game in 2D .
Most games go for the 3D approach , but we felt we could n't fully express ourselves on the DS if we went the polygonal route .
2D graphics can really " pop " on the DS 's small screen , and we wanted to have lots of wildly shifting and morphing monsters .
The game 's " Noise " creatures have colorful tattoos that dynamically change shape and attack the player .
We also made an effort to make the backgrounds as faithful to the real city as possible .
The entire staff went on location to Shibuya and walked its streets constantly , taking note of interesting areas where battles could go down , and what specific landmarks to highlight .
Background artists spent extensive time on location , making sure not just to trace what was there , but more actively capture the overall look and style of the city .
( See accompanying photolog , below . )
5 . Working closely with our middleware provider to cram a full vocal soundtrack into the game .
From the very beginning , we wanted to include a variety of musical genres that fit the mood of walking around Shibuya .
Given the limitations of DS game cards , we initially had n't even thought of using vocal tracks , but we wound up implementing CRI 's Kyuseishu Sound Streamer .
This middleware had only been used for voice compression in the past , and this was the first time anyone had used it for music .
We were blown away when we heard the first vocal track coming out of the DS , and realized we'd be able to include a full digital soundtrack .
We removed the pre-rendered movies and replaced them with Flash - style sequences , which freed up cartridge space to include over 30 songs .
In the end , about 1/4th of the game ROM consists of compressed music data .
This was an example of how trying something new really paid off .

What Went Wrong
1 . Time management and development culture clash .
The game was developed by Square Enix in Tokyo and Jupiter in Kyoto .
While we originally commissioned Jupiter as the developer , we wound up with more creative crossover than we thought .
The Square - side directors got involved in the gameplay design elements , while Jupiter went beyond the call of duty and assisted with the game planning .
The cooperative endeavor resulted in a fantastic product , but it came at a price .
Square and Jupiter have very different development cultures , but it took us a while to realize it .
We assumed all companies ' development processes were the same -- that our way was the standard .
Once we met up and reached a consensus on how to do things , work proceeded much more smoothly .
Geographically , we were very distant as well -- it takes about two hours to get between Tokyo and Kyoto via bullet train .
It was critical that we met in person , but this ended up costing us time , and it hurt the schedule at every step .
We had weekly telephone conferences , but it was hard for us to " read " each other over the line .
Sadly , we were unable to do video conferencing , which I believe would have resulted in a more open , jam - session sort of feel .
2. Story creation scheduling .
Even though we were happy with how the story turned out , the process started going smoothly only halfway through the project .
When we started , we were plagued by confused direction and constant rewrites by the scenario staff .
Changing plot elements mid-project is risky business , and we were making tweaks to the scenario all the way up until just before master submission !
We were able to pull it off because the game did n't contain a lot of voice -- if it had been voice - heavy , we would have had to lock down the scenario far earlier .
Although it 's obvious that the scenario should be put together early on in the development process , it also takes time to create something that 's truly interesting .
Maintaining this balance is extremely important .
3 . Overloading the player with new concepts and game systems .
We made three big mistakes with some of the gameplay concepts we implemented .
The first issue was how the player could " scan " the thoughts of NPCs .
We should have integrated this into the story more , because it never really related to solving puzzles .
I can't say the whole system was unnecessary , but it could have been integrated much better .
If there is a sequel , this is something we 'll need to work on .
Another stumbling block was the special attacks in the dual - screen battles .
To activate the special attack , you play a card - based minigame on the top screen .
We wanted to drop the system in lieu of a gauge that fills up as the player uses normal attacks .
We were hoping to fix it for the North American release , but we ended up not having enough time and went with the same system ( with reduced difficulty ) .
The last issue was partially fixed for the North American version .
Anyone playing the Japanese version was forced to wade through pages of tutorials .
With all the new systems , the players had a lot to learn , and " the wall of text " was hard for people to absorb all at once .
I think the chaotic state of all these new systems confused the heck out of Japanese gamers .
In the North American version , we trimmed down the text as much as possible , and made the tutorials skippable .
4. Dual - screen battles , or " What 's going on here ? "
The original concept of dual - screen battles came from creative producer Tetsuya Nomura , but it was easier said than done .
Fighting battles on the lower screen using the touch panel was our original concept , and turned out as well as we expected .
But our biggest headache stemmed from the battles in the upper screen .
We threw a number of ideas at the wall to see what stuck , like command - based battles or even music games .
At first , we were determined that the player would have to fight on both screens at once , but after trying out a few systems we realized the error of our ways .
Why did we have to make the user do anything in the upper screen at all ?
Once we left our creative egos at the door and looked at things through the player 's eyes , we realized what was wrong .
We had to make the user want to fight on both screens , but still provide the automatic combat if they elected to avoid it .
This sped things up and we arrived at the battle system we have today , where the player can simply let the battle progress in the upper screen by itself , or actively fight using the control pad .
I regret that we had n't come up with this solution earlier .
5. Animation quantity and quality .
The biggest problem with going fully 2D is the animation costs , and heavy amounts of animation were required for our battle sequences .
To reduce our workload , we created a polygon - based template for the main character Neku and some of the larger monsters .
We rendered out some simple animated models , and rotoscoped the 2D pixel art on top of it .
The tattoos on the " Noise " monsters were another headache , since the sprites moved and shifted with each frame of animation .
It took a while for the whole team to agree on how each tattoo should change and lock down the data set .
Additionally , with so many people on staff , we had difficulties maintaining a quality standard for the animation .
We naturally wanted everything to look cool and modern , but " cool " is subjective , so strong direction was a necessity -- so , as the animation director , Tatsuya Kando had to take a trip to Kyoto to visit Jupiter every week to check on how things were going .
The World Ends With
You directors from left to right : Tomohiro Hasegawa ( co-director ) , Tatsuya Kando ( director ) , and Takeshi Arakawa ( planning director ) .
Lessons Learned
The main challenges in our project were trying out new ways of expressing ourselves , and maintaining quality while keeping an eye on costs -- an always daunting task .
Given the opportunity to do it again , we'd be able to work faster while keeping a high standard of quality .
The hardest aspect is determining the staff 's skill level and planning for it to allow for accurate time and cost estimates .

It will be fixed .
Back in October we wowed you with 20 Excellent Ajax Effects You Should Know .
The post went on to become one of the most popular ever published at Nettuts +.
This time around we have twenty more equally excellent Ajax effects for you to know and love .
1. Image Menu
The Image Menu is a simple piece of JavaScript that uses images to make a horizontal image menu .
When you hover over the links , the image expands and shows the rest of the image .
It 's compatible with nearly all modern browsers ( no word on IE 8 ) .
2. ImageFlow
ImageFlow is an unobtrusive and " user friendly " JavaScript image gallery script .
It features an elegant scroll - bar to browse through the images , and all of the images sit on top of a reflection , creating a Mac - like coverflow effect .
3. Instant.js
If you 're looking to add some interesting backgrounds , rotations and other effects to images , Instant.js might be just what you 're looking for .
The JavaScript degrades gracefully , so browsers who do n't have JavaScript enabled wo n't notice a difference .
4. Glassbox
We 've all heard of Lightboxes and even Greyboxes , but how about GlassBoxes ?
GlassBox is an interface library that relies Scriptaculous and Prototype .
The nifty library will add lucent borders and other flash - like effects .
It 's easy to use , skinnable and even has dynamic content loading .
5. Search Field CSS /JS
Auto - completing search fields are highly valuable when it comes user interaction .
Sometimes the searcher does n't know quite what he 's looking for , so anything that helps the user find exactly what he wants is a huge benefit .
CSSGlobe has a very nice tutorial on how to enhance your site 's searchfield ( unobtrusively , no less ) with a bit of CSS and Ajax .
6. Protoload
Loading images and fields are important to modern web applications that use Ajax .
Protoload gives some built in options to help show the user what 's going on while she 's waiting .
The script gives many options like color overlays for loading elements , custom text , and many other options .
7. jwysiwyg
jwysiwyg is a simple , powerful and extremely lightweight JavaScript jQuery WYSIWYG plugin .
The plugin has many of the standard features of WYSIWYG editors , and is only 7 kb in total size .
8. jquery.biggerlink 2
Bigger link 2 is really a simple plugin that makes bigger , clickable links easier .
It even allows you to embed links inside of linked elements , if that makes sense .
( Check out the demos for more clarity . )
Bigger Link 2 runs on the popular jQuery JavaScript framework .
9. jQuery Tag Suggestion
Tag suggestions are a popular usage of Ajax in modern web applications .
Much like auto - completing search boxes , the jQuery Tag Suggestion plugin is an easy to use plugin that gives any application that uses tagging a way to quickly find the proper tag .
A simple yet effective boost in the user experience .
10 . Facebox
Facebox is a unique lightbox script that mimics the lightbox style of Facebook 's modal windows .
Built on jQuery , Facebox looks and feels almost exactly like Facebook 's interface , and it 's simple to install as well .
11 . Humanized Messages
Humanized Messages is a nifty jQuery plugin that does as the name implies : it creates a friendly messages for the user .
The JavaScript plugin does this by creating a translucent message over the screen , and gently fades away over time .
12 . LightWindow v2.0
LightWindow is yet another Lightbox plugin , but it adds some functionality that plugins of it's type seem to leave out .
For starters , the plugin allows for rending and using multmedia within the lightboxes .
Movies , images , even entire galleries can be shown within the LightWindow .
Perfect for unobtrusively showcasing multimedia .
13 . Unobtrusive Table Actions
Table data is often hard to display effectively , especially when you want to allow sorting of the rows and columns .
The Unobtrusive Table Actions is a JavaScript that allows for different effects to be placed on table data .
Highlighting rows , columns , sorting data , and much more can be done with the aide of this little script .
14 . jQuery checkbox
j Query checkbox adds a little flair to checkbox fields in forms .
It adds a toggle button very similar to that of the iPhone interface , giving a very distinctive on or off .
It 's great for usability , and the dynamic skin can be turned on or off , on the fly .
15 . iCarousel
Carousels are a great way to rotate content such as images or news stories .
The iCarousel plugin fits the bill as a simple , tiny script that gives all sorts of configuration options and usages .
News tickers , photo carousels or even an ad carousel .
16 . MochaUI
MochaUI is another UI library for the JavaScript framework MooTools .
MochaUI essentially builds an entire user interface for Web sites , forms and widgets .
It includes a file browser , window resizer , paneled layouts , tabbed layouts , and much more .
17 . jTip
jTip is a simple concept , yet very effective for improving hovertip functionality .
Based on jQuery , jTip simply adds an elegant hoverbox to pre-configured links on a page , all with the help of some Ajax .
18 . Uni-Form
Forms have long been the troublespot for many web developers over the years , and technologies like Ajax have greatly helped the user experience .
With Ajax , you can process forms in real - time , validate them and send responses without requiring a reload of the page .
Uni-Form is a little Ajax script that is a plug - in - play concept that tries to standardize form markup with XHTML and modularize the form , so that individual elements can be easily added or removed .
19 . Validation Hints
Validation Hints is a simple script that aides in form validation .
It makes sure that password and username fields are the specified length , and can even validate against regular expressions .
Small and handy .
20 . Control Tabs
Control Tabs , ( part of the robust LivePipe UI ) , is a sweet script that gives many different ways to configure tabs on a page .
You can use the standard tabbed interface , or even use something like images to show tabs as well .
Control Tabs is a robust script , and even has an API that you can use to fine - tune your tabbed interfaces .
It seems to have taken forever ( the seasons have changed , and changed and changed again ) , but this long presidential campaign is finally coming to an end .
In January , with snow blanketing the trail in Iowa and New Hampshire , I wrote of the Barack Obama phenomenon : “ Shake hands with tomorrow .
It ’s here . ”
I did n’t mean that Senator Obama would win the election .
He still seemed like a long shot to me .
But it was clear that the message , style and strategy of his campaign pointed to a new direction for American politics , and that a new generation of voters  younger , smarter , more diverse , more open - minded  was anxious to follow his lead .
I remember talking with a voter named Debra Gable , who had driven from central Vermont to attend an Obama rally in Derry , N.H. “ I dislike politics , ” she told me , “ because we focus on our differences even though we have so many more commonalities .
That ’s what I think I ’m hearing from Obama , so I want to see how he is in person . ”
Ms. Gable had not made up her mind , and the other candidate she was seriously considering  in a Republican field that was still wide open  was John McCain .
Its All Gone Pete Tong is a comedy following the tragic life of legendary Frankie Wilde .
The story takes us through Frankie 's life from one of the best DJ 's alive , through subsequent battle with a hearing disorder , culminating in his mysterious disappearance from the scene .
A genius in his own right , he clawed his way to the top of the DJ ranks , now living the opulent life of a superstar , he resides in his trophy villa in Ibiza with his trophy wife .
This is when tragedy hits .
Due to a hearing disorder he is rapidly going deaf with only one functioning ear to complete the new Ibiza season .

Undated handout photo of Trooper Karine Blais who was killed in Afghanistan April 13 , 2009 .
Blais , 21 , is the second Canadian female soldier to die in Afghanistan when the light armoured vehicle she was patrolling in struck an improvised explosive device .

KABUL —
As Canada 's latest soldier to die in Afghanistan began her final trip home , a family in a small town in eastern Quebec was deep in grief Tuesday after learning of the loss of their daughter .
The parents of Trooper Karine Blais , 21 , who died Monday in a roadside bomb explosion northwest of Kandahar City , said they were devastated by their daughter 's death .
" We are extremely saddened .
. . .
It leaves a void that is too big , " the family said in a statement released Tuesday .
" Despite the terrible news of her sudden loss , Karine had met her goal .
She wanted to be a part of this adventure and she was proud to serve in Afghanistan , " the statement said .
Blais had only been in the war - ravaged country two weeks when she became the second Canadian woman killed in action in Afghanistan .
Her vehicle struck an explosive device while on a routine patrol on a well - travelled secondary road northwest of Kandahar City during which no " combat indicators , " had been seen , said her commander , Lt. - Col .
Jocelyn Paul .
Two of Blais 's comrades from B Squadron , 12th Armoured Regiment , which is attached to the Van Doo battle group , were " going to be all right " after suffering what Paul described as serious injuries .
The first Canadian woman to die in battle in Afghanistan was Capt.
Nichola Goddard of Calgary .
A forward artillery observer with the Manitoba - based Royal Canadian Horse Artillery , Goddard posthumously received the Meritorious Service Medal after she was killed by a rocket - propelled grenade in May 2006 in a firefight with the Taliban .
That incident occurred about 40 kilometres west of where Blais became the 117th Canadian to die in Afghanistan .
Blais 's family said she was a dedicated to her regiment and adored her work .
" You are our sunshine and you will be forever in our hearts , " they wrote .
Mario Blais , the godfather of Trooper Blais , said her death has touched the entire community of Les Mechins , in Quebec 's Gaspe region .
" She was a woman who enjoyed life , " he said .
Blais had been recruited at school and enlisted with a sense of adventure , he said , but ultimately wanted to return to civilian life .
" She just wanted to do this one mission and start her own business , " possibly as an auto mechanic , he said .
Mario Blais said the family has been receiving words of sympathy from across the community of 1,300 , where the soldier was well - known for her work at a convenience store .
Donald Grenier , the mayor of the community , said the loss is possibly his town 's first military death since the Second World War .
" Today everybody is deeply touched , it 's hard to explain losing someone so young at the service of the population , fighting for our rights , " he said .
" A youngster in a municipality such as ours is something precious .
It is very difficult on all of us . "
Grenier described Blais as a dynamic young woman whose life was cut short after " being at the wrong place at the wrong time . "
Tributes also poured in on a Facebook page created to honour Blais 's memory .
According to a report at IPS News :
Pakistan ’s Dharti Development Society , a non-governmental organization .
. . plans to establish a vulture restaurant in the mountainous Karonjhar area in Sindh province .
No , not restaurants that serve vulture meat .
Nor another version of Trader Vic’s , with its werewolves .
But a restaurant that serves vultures .
You can stop trying to picture them perched at a table waiting for their fresh - kill .
It ’s open - air , of course : a feeding station .
Why cater to — or just plain cater — vultures ?
Suddenly carcasses are n’t good enough for them ?
Would that an eccentric heiress of the likes that serves her dog gourmet dinners in a platinum bowl had bequeathed the restaurant to the raptors .
But the story is more than just fodder for FARK .
Over the last decade , censuses reveal that numbers are down in seven Asian vulture species .
Two , the White - backed and the Long - billed , are endangered .
It seems that many of the carcasses they home in on with their keen sense of smell are contaminated .
Stop right there .
Anyone who knows anything about vultures is well aware that their systems are swimming in substances which kill the disease - producing bacteria that breed in the carcasses on which they feed .
Their ensuing feces is as clean as if it were processed by a sewage plant .
If not disposed of by vultures , the carcasses may become hosts to anthrax and botulism which might infect animals desperate enough to eat old , putrid remains .
Then how does a body built to neutralize poison become poisoned ?
There ’s poison and then there ’s poison — as in naturally occurring versus manmade .
Vultures are as vulnerable as any bird to insecticides or pesticides .
But , in the case of vultures in Asia , neither of those is the culprit .
In years past , veterinary diclofenac , a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , was used to treat sick or dying farm animals to keep them productive .
Turned out if was causing a type of gout that coats vultures ’ internal organs with a chalky white paste of uric acid .
By 2006 diclofenac was banned , but environmentalists fear that it ’s still in use .
Enforcement is weak and lobbying to restore it to the marketplace ( by at least one drug company ) is strenuous .
Vultures are n’t likely to win a place in the public ’s heart .
Their benefits to the environment are little known while their reputation precedes them .
You know , circling over the cowboy dying of thirst ( which is an urban , or desert , myth .
They smell only rotting bodies , not impending death — as is said of some dogs or cats . )
Also , even though our national symbol is a bald eagle , vultures — their heads shorn of feathers to expedite thrusting them into entrails — are a little too bald .
But perhaps for just that reason — rubbing our faces in just how base nature is — the common American turkey vulture is one of my two favorite creatures , along with carrion rival the hyena .
In recent years , they ’ve moved into metropolitan New York , where I live .
Since we ’re not blanketed with them as the Southeast seems to be at times , each sighting is an event .
But that ’s not because I see them feeding — or indulging in other charming habits , such as vomiting when threatened or urinating on their own legs .
In suburban New York , they ’ve ceded road kill to crows and apparently subsist on animals that expire in the woods , where they dine unseen by humans .
What makes spotting them exhilarating is , of course , their mastery of flight .
Along with the albatross and frigate bird , they ’re the world ’s great fliers .
Rather than get bogged down in composing an ode to the vulture in flight , we ’ll defer to the Vulture Society :
Vultures launch themselves from their perches only after the morning air has warmed .
Then , they circle upward , searching for pockets of rising warm air , or thermals .
Once they have secured a thermal , they allow it to carry them upward in rising circles .
When they reach the top of the thermal , they dive across the sky at speeds near 60 miles per hour , losing altitude until they reach another thermal .
All this is done without the necessity to flap .
In fact , the turkey vulture can glide for over 6 hours at a time without flapping a wing !
In other words :
It migrates across the continents with minimal energy output .
It may seem like such an awe - inspiring skill is wasted on the vulture ( though it ’s not as dim as its small head suggests ) .
But were we granted the gift of near - effortless flight , you can be sure that we ’d have long since found ways to weaponize the skill and turn ourselves into human predator drones .
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the economy has continued to contract , though the pace of contraction appears to be somewhat slower .
Household spending has shown signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses , lower housing wealth , and tight credit .
Weak sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories , fixed investment , and staffing .
Although the economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting , partly reflecting some easing of financial market conditions , economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time .
Nonetheless , the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions , fiscal and monetary stimulus , and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability .
In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad , the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued .
Moreover , the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term .
In these circumstances , the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability .
The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period .
As previously announced , to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets , the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $ 1.25 trillion of agency mortgage - backed securities and up to $ 200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year .
In addition , the Federal Reserve will buy up to $ 300 billion of Treasury securities by autumn .
The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets .
The Federal Reserve is facilitating the extension of credit to households and businesses and supporting the functioning of financial markets through a range of liquidity programs .
The Committee will continue to carefully monitor the size and composition of the Federal Reserve 's balance sheet in light of financial and economic developments .

The world should prepare for a possible swine flu pandemic , especially in developing nations which could be hit particularly hard by the virus , the World Health Organisation warned today .
The apparently new strain of the H1N1 flu , which seemingly originated in Mexico , has now been confirmed in seven countries , including the UK , New Zealand and Israel , with suspected outbreaks investigated in a number of others .
It has shown an apparent ability to transfer from person to person , making its rapid global threat " a very serious possibility " , said the WHO 's deputy head , Keiji Fukuda .
" Countries should take the opportunity to prepare for a pandemic , " Fukuda told reporters in Geneva , while stressing that a pandemic was not yet inevitable .
Special efforts should be made towards less rich nations which " really get hit disproportionately hard " by pandemics , he said .
Fukuda confirmed the WHO was investigating whether human - to - human transmission had been identified in a group of New York City school students who are believed to have passed the virus among themselves after returning from a trip to Mexico .
Such apparent cross-infection was the reason why the organisation 's emergency committee last night raised its pandemic threat level to phase four out of a possible six , meaning a pandemic was possible , Fukuda said .
" We think that the virus showed the ability to transfer from person to person - this was an important step , " Fukuda said .
Any evidence of " sustained human - to - human transmission in a number of different countries " would see the alert raised to five , he said .
The vast majority of about 2,000 cases have been identified in Mexico , with 51 in the US and 15 combined in the UK , Canada , New Zealand , Spain and Israel .
Eight more countries , including France , Germany and Denmark and South Korea , are investigating possible outbreaks .
A Scottish couple , who had been on honeymoon in Cancún , Mexico , remain in hospital but their condition is improving , the Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said .
" I am pleased to say they are continuing to improve .
They 're doing well , " she said .
All the 150 - plus deaths from the swine flu have been recorded in Mexico , with patients in other countries experiencing far less severe symptoms .
Fukuda , however , cautioned against the idea that the outbreak could be a " mild pandemic " , noting that the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak which killed tens of millions of people worldwide came in a series of increasingly lethal waves .
" I think we have to be mindful and respectful of the fact that influenza moves in ways we cannot predict , " he said .
In the UK , the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to Mexico as major tour operators including Thomas Cook and Airtours cancelled flights to the country and sent out empty planes to repatriate holidaymakers .
A spokesman for NHS Direct said the advice line had received almost 1,400 calls about suspected swine flu cases .
In the past 24 hours , it has referred 238 callers who had travelled to infected areas and were showing potential symptoms of the virus to their GPs .
The Wiltshire primary care trust said seven people from the county were being tested for suspected swine flu at a Health Protection Agency facility in Bristol , with results expected later today .
Gordon Brown , who later today will join a meeting of the government 's Cobra emergency committee , chaired by the health secretary , Alan Johnson , called for concerted global action to combat the virus .
" Swine flu is an international problem now .
It is across two continents , " the prime minister said during a visit to Poland .
The European commission is to hold a meeting with representatives from the pharmaceutical industry tomorrow to discuss how a vaccine might be produced , the EU health commissioner , Androulla Vasiliou , said in Brussels .
It could take between four and six months to produce a vaccine , although anti-flu drugs already available appear to be at least partly effective in treating symptoms .
The 11 cases in New Zealand , among students and teachers from a single school who reported fevers and other flu symptoms on return from a visit to Mexico , are the first in the Asia - Pacific region .
South Korea is also investigating a probable case .
Spain , meanwhile , confirmed a second case .
Officials in China , where some cases of bird flu and another virulent respiratory infection , Sars , were initially covered up in recent years , say the country has not yet confirmed any cases but have promised full transparency .
Two people were also confirmed as having contracted the virus in Israel , a 26 - year - old who has recovered fully and a 47 - year - old man who returned from Mexico two days ago .
Health officials in Ireland said six people in the country were now being tested for possible exposure to the virus , which is a combination of pig , bird and human flu strains to which humans may have no natural immunity .
Symptoms include a high fever and headache , coughing , joint ache and , in some cases , vomiting and diarrhoea .
The deaths in Mexico have tended to be among people in their 30s or 40s rather than the very young or old , as is the case with usual flu strains .
UK ministers say the country is well prepared for a possible pandemic , with Johnson telling MPs the country had a stock of 33 m courses of anti-flu drugs .
If the situation deteriorates , plans are in place for the government to warn the entire population to set up a support network of friends and relatives so they can be quickly quarantined at home if they are thought to have symptoms .
The friends would collect medicine on their behalf .
In Mexico , where officials in the capital , Mexico City , today ordered all restaurants to close , the country 's health secretary , José Angel Córdova , has said he expects more people to die .
Córdova admitted that the health authorities lacked the staff to check on all suspected cases .
Some foreign health officials fear such difficulties may be contributing to the disease 's spread .
He stressed it was not confirmed the outbreak had begun in Mexico and indicated it could have first emerged in the US , where health officials believe the virus was spotted in late March .
Peru and Guatemala reported the first suspected infections in other parts of Latin America , where health officials fear swine flu has already spread but has so far gone undetected .
The Colorado House passed the bill which would eliminate the death penalty by 1 vote .
The Denver Post reports on the dramatic moment :
In the hushed state House chamber , all eyes Tuesday stared up at the vote board , which showed lawmakers deadlocked 32 - 32 on whether to repeal the death penalty in Colorado .
All but Rep. Edward Vigil ’s eyes , that is .
The Fort Garland Democrat sat at his desk with a hand held to his forehead , contemplating his suddenly crucial decision .
Heads swiveled in his direction .
Whispers filled the silence .
Seconds passed .
After nearly a minute , Vigil pushed a green button and , in doing so , pushed House Bill 1274 on to the state Senate in a dramatic 33 - 32 victory for death - penalty foes at the Capitol .
“ Hopefully this will make us a better society in Colorado by not having a death penalty , ” Vigil said afterward , “ though I have my reservations . ”
The bill would eliminate the death penalty as a sentencing option going forward and would use the projected cost savings to fund a cold - case unit in the Colorado Bureau of Investigation .
Only 1 Republican voted in favor of repealing the death penalty on pro life grounds : Rep. Don Marostica of Loveland .
As evident from the article , Coloradans are very divided on the question of the death penalty , despite the fact that only 1 person has been executed in Colorado since 1976 .
How the vote will go down in the Senate and whether or not former prosecutor Gov. Bill Ritter ( D ) will sign the bill into law is anyone ’s guess .
It ’s my hope that Colorado will ultimately make the right decision and follow New Mexico ’s lead .
In The Fallacy of High - Level Languages , Scott James Remnant argues that the advantages of languages such as Python , Perl , and C# over C are negligible -- and that they make programmers of those languages somewhat untrustworthy :
I trust code written in C far more than I do any higher level language .
No , that 's probably not fair .
I trust C programmers far more than I do programmers of other languages .
If you tell me I have the option of choosing a program or library written in C over one written in Python or C# , I 'll take the C one every time .
Having contributed to a couple of high - level languages by writing C code to implement said high - level languages , I can't agree .
I 'm not here to praise C. I 'm here to bury it .
C has some tremendous disadvantages over high - level languages :
Manual memory management .
Yes , you should be able to match all of your malloc ( ) and free ( ) calls by reasoning about your program statically , but go write your own virtual machine which runs arbitrary programs with arbitrary memory requirements and see how well that works .
Not every program is that complex , but not every program is that simple .
and calls by reasoning about your program statically , but go write your own virtual machine which runs arbitrary programs with arbitrary memory requirements and see how well that works .
Not every program is that complex , but not every program is that simple .
Cross - platform fun .
Want your code to run on multiple platforms ?
Want to work around compiler and standard library and linker bugs on multiple platforms ?
Ever wonder why sometimes memcpy ( ) gives you odd behavior when building with GCC with optimizations ( and no , the source and destination do n't overlap unless something has gone very , very wrong with what malloc ( )
gives you odd behavior when building with GCC with optimizations ( and no , the source and destination do n't overlap unless something has gone very , very wrong with what Poor abstraction possibilities .
Yes , C has first - class functions ( if you can remember the syntax for declaring the type of a function pointer -- I never can ) , but if you want new programming ideas such as closures , partial application , or continuations , you have to fake them yourself .
Do n't even mention allomorphism or a type system which encodes richer semantics than " How many bits is this on a PDP - 11 ? " .
Verbosity .
( Okay , I should say more . )
Implement a bare - bones grep - workalike in Perl and in C sometime .
Compare the two .
( It 's do { print if /\Q $ pat\E / } while <> in Perl . )
Now compare the rest of the boilerplate code -- and do n't forget all of the code to handle errors in C .
If , as much of the programming world seems to believe , the error rate per line of code is stable when comparing languages , perhaps there 's a sweet spot at which a more expressive language will have far fewer bugs than a less expressive language .
Put another way , I wo n't even feign surprise if you tell me that a Perl or Python program has a fifth of the bugs of an an equivalent Java program or a tenth of the bugs of an equivalent C program .
Library support .
As of this writing , search .cpan.org reports 66,704 available modules in 17,342 distributions .
If even half of those are remotely useful , there are tens of thousands of libraries one install Foo away from any full Perl installation .
There may be that many available C libraries somewhere , but show me a cross- platform installer which works with a globally mirrored hosting service with ratings , documentation , reviews , and a comprehensive and growing testing service .
I could go on -- projects such as HP's Dynamo and the Self programming language have demonstrated that runtime profiling and optimizations can improve performance over static compilation in many cases .
As well , changes to the memory management of Mozilla Firefox 3.0 show that low - level memory manipulation can actively harm performance ( arena - based allocation such as you might find in a system with an intelligent GC -- or even Perl 5 -- is much less susceptible to fragmentation ) .
I suspect that many people reading this have already made up their own minds , however .
All I can tell you is my experience .
I 've never spent a couple of days optimizing a regular expression in Perl , and I 've spent many days measuring and optimizing performance in C -- not to mention countless hours using gdb , Valgrind , and KCachegrind .
Do n't misunderstand me ; I 'm grateful for those tools .
Yet I 'll be more grateful for the day when I never have to use those tools again .
I made this program during forum discussion for accessing configuration relative to module directory , not main program 's position ( which can be accessed by sys.argv [ 0 ] 's directoryname ) .
As the thread is closed I post my proves as code snippet .

LOS ANGELES , March 9 ( Reuters ) -
Its image is mostly that of rich California housewives , multimillion - dollar beach mansions and Disneyland , but Orange County has been hit so hard by recession that some of its food banks say they are swamped and struggling to feed the hungry .
In fact food banks in Orange County , which has been portrayed as an oceanfront playground for the wealthy on such TV shows as “ The O.C. ” and “ The Real Housewives of Orange County , ” were reporting demand had increased 40 to 60 percent since June of 2008 .
“ Our donations have not in any way , shape or form kept pace with the skyrocketing need in Orange County , ” Orange County Food Bank Director Mark Lowry said .
“ I ’ve been here for over 20 years and while we ’ve seen challenging times , I ’ve never seen such a dramatic increase in need . ”
Lowry said the demand has become so “ overwhelming ” that he has been forced to stop donating to any new organizations .
“ A week and a half ago we just said ‘ enough . ’
We simply do n’t have enough resources at the moment to meet the needs of the community , ” he said .
Officials say the spike in those going hungry is one more symptom of the worst economic slump since the early 1980s , which is hitting parts of California ’s third - most populous county hard despite a median income of more than $ 70,000 .
“ Demand has skyrocketed so quickly , ” Monica Horner , development manager of Second Harvest Food Bank , told Reuters in an interview .
“ I ’ve been here for eight years and I ’ve been talking to my colleagues and this is the most widespread , rapid increase we ’ve seen . ”
“ It ’s considered to be one of most affluent places but we ’ve always had a hunger issue here , it ’s just been very well hidden .
The scary part is that it can happen to anyone now , ” Horner said .
“ People are being laid off , seniors relying on retirement are finding that slashed . ”
Horner said that her food bank , which serves some 400 member agencies across the county including shelters , rescue missions , church pantries and homes for abused women and children , has so far been able to keep up .
The Orange County Register newspaper reported that the Catholic Charities center in Santa Ana has already served almost as many people as it did all of last fiscal year and was forced to cut its hours from five days a week to three .

A Jordanian man confessed to stabbing to death his pregnant sister and mutilating her body to protect the family honor , said Jordanian authorities on Sunday .
Prosecutor Mohammed al - Tarawneh said the man turned himself into police and has been charged with murder .
The 28 - year - old married woman was five months pregnant and stabbed repeatedly in the face , neck , abdomen and back as well as being hacked up with a meat cleaver , according to government pathologist Awad al - Tarawneh .
Police familiar with the case said the woman had moved back in with her family after an argument with her husband six months earlier .
The brother believed that she had then started seeing other men .
The names of those involved have not been released .
The incident , the ninth such case this year and the second this month , took place in the village of Basira , in the conservative Bedouin heartland of southern Jordan .
Strict tribal and religious values are enforced in these villages , including the belief that women carry the family 's honor .
Around two dozen women are killed each year in these conservative areas of Jordan by male relatives who typically accuse them of besmirching the family honor through adultery or having sex outside of marriage .
International human rights organisations have condemned honor killings in Jordan and appealed to King Abdullah II to put an end to the practice .
But attempts to introduce harsher sentences have been blocked in Jordan 's parliament , where the predominantly conservative Bedouin lawmakers argue that tougher penalties would lead to adultery .
Some members of government have also urged judges to consider honor killings equal to other homicides and punishable by up to 15 years in prison .
But many in the judiciary still hand down lenient punishments of half of that or less .

Happy St. Patrick ’s Day !
So , there was n’t going to be a comic today , as my time ( and brain ) has been maxed lately due to work and freelance , but Vee has once again whipped out the funny and wrote today ’s strip .
She really does n’t give herself enough credit for how freakin funny she is .
I do n’t know what I would do with out her .
Thanks , honey !
Now , let ’s all go have a Guiness .

What Orwell feared were those who would ban books .
What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book , for there would be no one who wanted to read one .
Orwell feared those who would deprive us information .
Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism .
Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us .
Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance .
Orwell feared we would become a captive culture .
Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture , preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies , the orgy porgy , and the centrifugal bumblepuppy .
– Neil Postman
You have to be aware of passive aggressive types .
They tend to assert that a condition is true , and then if you do n’t go along with it , condemn you for reacting against “ what everyone else knows ” or a social common standard .
Bums capitalize on passive aggression quite a bit .
See a young man with a girl ?
Watch the bum : he ’s going to hit up the young man — not the girl — because the young man has a choice : either give the bum money , and look like a Good Guy , or turn him down and introduce the doubt that he may be possibly heartless .
So over comes the cash .
Check out passive aggression here — the writer is capitalizing on the known urban versus rural conflict :
When Barack Obama ended the Bush stem - cell policy last week , there were no such overheated theatrics .
No oversold prime - time address .
No hysteria from politicians , the news media or the public .
The family - values dinosaurs that once stalked the earth â€ ” Falwell , Robertson , Dobson and Reed â€ ” are now either dead , retired or disgraced .
Their less - famous successors pumped out their pro forma e-mail blasts , but to little avail .
The Republican National Committee said nothing whatsoever about Obamaâ€™s reversal of Bush stem - cell policy .
Americans have less and less patience for the intrusive and divisive moral scolds who thrived in the bubbles of the Clinton and Bush years .
Culture wars are a luxury the country â€ ” the G.O.P. included â€ ” can no longer afford .
In our own hard times , the former moral â€œmajorityâ€ has been downsized to more of a minority than ever .
Polling shows that nearly 60 percent of Americans agree with ending Bush restrictions on stem - cell research ( a Washington Post / ABC News survey in January ) ; that 55 percent endorse either gay civil unions or same - sex marriage ( Newsweek , December 2008 ) ; and that 75 percent believe openly gay Americans should serve in the military ( Post / ABC , July 2008 ) .

This man is a slick manipulator .
He knows that every person on earth prefers the illusion of personal autonomy , and so they resent any attempts to control them outside of the most basic parts of the social contract : no murder , rape , pedophilia , and so on .
Unfortunately , that sort of logic places us between worlds .
We ’re obligated to the collective that is civilization , but acting as if we ’re free agents outside of a civilization .
That means that huge costs for our reckless behavior , and the social resources to save us , get passed on as “ socialized costs ” that we collectively pay .
This means the smart become obligated to the dumb .
Rural people tend to have conservative logic , and that ’s a lowercase -c conservative .
If your science does n’t understand it 100 % , do n’t jack with it .
Stick to traditional moral values because those produce healthy generations .
Do n’t be afraid to kill your enemies , even if they call you names and say you ’ll be unpopular .
People need guns in the home in case lunatics show up .
And the big taboo : not everyone can figure out how to run a farm , and some people are just born bad , like some piglets in a litter are just born weak and angry .
Drowning time .
That sort of logic shocks people in cities .
They do n’t do anything with their hands ; their labor consists of moving around symbols in order to make other people do things .
Their wealth is paper wealth , which is why they suffer the hardest numerical losses during a recession .
But they do n’t understand the process by which we get steaks on the table , and they do n’t want to know .
Because they thrive by moving symbols around , they also thrive by being polite : pacifying others , complimenting them , getting along with them at all costs , and so on .
Urban people are a nation of salespeople .
Let ’s look at another vision of this same conflict :
Mr. Rogers , whose previous political involvement amounted to little more than writing a check to a favored candidate â€ ” has suddenly become a leader in a secessionist movement bent on cleaving California in two .
â€ œThose Hollywood types donâ€™t have any idea whatâ€™s going on out here on the farms , â€ said Mr. Rogers .
Frustrated by what they call uninformed urban voters dictating faulty farm policy , Mr. Rogers and the other members of the movement have proposed splitting off 13 counties on the stateâ€™s coast , leaving the remaining 45 , mostly inland , counties as the â€œrealâ€ California .
The reason , they say , is that people in those coastal counties , which include San Francisco and Los Angeles , simply do not understand what life is like in areas where the sea breezes do not reach .
â€œThey think fish are more important than people , that pigs are treated mean and chickens should run loose , â€ said Mr. Rogers , who said he hitched a ride in 1940 to Visalia from Oklahoma to escape the Dust Bowl , with his wife and baby son in tow .
â€ œCity people just donâ€™t know what it takes to get food on their table .
â€

The point that ’s important here : there ’s two economies at work , and two cultures have grown up around them .
In the city , there ’s a salesperson economy and culture .
In the country , there ’s a producer economy and culture .
While in the city people can bundle together in groups and use the weight of their opinion , and passive aggression , to force others to act , in the country it requires people to engage with the problem head on and come up with some sort of solution , even if it ’s not socially acceptable or polite .
Of course , not every person in the city is fooled , but the human illusion that we all have free will and kinglike pick our ideologies is just that , an illusion — we pick ideologies like we pick clothing , to cover up our weaknesses and adorn ourselves , for the most part .
We can frame this conflict to include both the city folks who agree with the country folks and the suburban folks I have not mentioned .
People in the suburbs generally are more successful than other groups , and have made the commitment to sacrificing things like being near downtown and its shopping / ” culture ” in order to raise kids in a safe place .
( That ’s the case for nice suburbs .
There are many suburbs in sprawling cities like LA that are just repositories for those with no other direction . )
If we include these groups , we rapidly see the approach of a divide between the responsible and irresponsible .
Responsible people have the producer mentality ; irresponsible people are used to angling for what they need by getting it from other people , usually by convincing them with a shell game of symbols .
Irresponsible people solve problems by clumping together like dough and using their collective weight to force other people to give them things … and if that causes socialized costs down the line , well , they ’re not thinking about that .
Here ’s an instance of this kind of thinking :
Emboldened by a new leftist constitution , Bolivia President Evo Morales on Saturday handed over ownership of farmland seized by the state from wealthy estate holders to poor indigenous people .
Morales handed out around 94,000 acres of lands recently confiscated from five big ranches in Bolivia ’s wealthy eastern lowlands , a stronghold of his conservative political opponents .
The ranchers have been accused of employing workers in conditions of semi-slavery .
“ Private property will always be respected but we want people who are not interested in equality to change their thinking and focus more on country than currency , ” said Morales , flanked by military and police personnel .

When I lived among the surly urban poor of Los Angeles , I learned one thing that I have seen confirmed time and again about poverty : its origin is in cluelessness , disorganization and lack of impulse control , not oppression .
A friend of mine in Austin who grew up in a trailer park because his parents were alcoholic pointed this out to me , saying that despite his liberal beliefs , he knew why the poor were poor : “ Everyone in that trailer park belonged there . ”
They were unable to stop drinking or taking drugs , having children or flaking out on work .
They were chronically disorganized , so that when they got that job , the car had been taken apart for the fuel pump to be used to clean the kitchen sink that they meant to unclog last week but just had n’t gotten around to it .
In his eyes , the place was hell .
I ’ve since heard the same from many friends , whose parents followed the baby boomers to their doom but did n’t realize it was a scam and pull out in time to become bankers .
I ’ve seen the same in impoverished places on three continents .
Ask yourself : if the poor are poor , why do they always seem to have $ 5 for cigarettes , $ 5 for the lottery , $ 5 for alcohol and $ 25 to watch the sports event or rock concert du jour ?
Why do you see people wearing $ 200 tracksuits and $ 200 shoes walking around the ghetto ?
To be poor , you need to be irresponsible .
Spend that $ 400 now on flashy things instead of on building infrastructure ; spend $ 40 per day on cigs , lottery and booze instead of infrastructure ; even more , with what you have , junk it and do n’t care for it , and do n’t keep it organized , so that whenever opportunity does come you ’re unable to take advantage of it .
The single mother of six children said when she saw the pitch for the adorable puppies last summer on the popular classified ad site Kijiji she was excited to welcome the brother and sister dogs named Nelly and Kelly into her home .
St. Amand says she sent upwards of $ 2,000 for the dogs she is yet to see except for photos sent to her by email .
St. Amand is on welfare , and along with her children ages two to 11 , shares her home with her boyfriend and six pets – including two mixed breed dogs .
Money in St. Amand ’s household is so scarce she was going to have to pawn two small rings to come up with the gas money to have a relative take her to the airport to get the dogs .
Canada East
( I ca n’t tell what ’s more appalling — that she performed the ultimate act of stupidity in sending her welfare money to get these dogs , the way she lives as a six - child welfare mom with a boyfriend on welfare and four dogs , or that she was willing to admit this to the world via the press .
If this family dies in a fire , we can all agree that the gene pool will be clearer . )
The poor in Bolivia live in near - slavery conditions because when given wealth , they squander it .
They will squander this gift too .
And instead of concentrating power in the hands of people who could get responsible , their president is now declaring dominion of the irresponsible over the responsible .
( This is the ultimate state of Crowdism : when the irresponsible , produced by the wealth created by the responsible , band together to take that wealth from the responsible , and thus kill the goose that laid the golden egg and plunge themselves into a third - world military junta dark ages . )
And yet another example :
A former busker , Aubrey Meyer , thought up what is increasingly regarded as the long - term solution to global warming â€ “ and , through relentless campaigning , he has managed to get his idea adopted as policy by many governments , especially in developing countries .
Dubbed “ contraction and convergence ” , it starts from the principle that everyone on Earth is entitled to emit the same amount of carbon dioxide .
It then determines the level of emissions low enough to avoid dangerous climate change .
The total amount put into the atmosphere worldwide each year must then be made to “ contract ” until it reaches this point .
Simultaneously , the totals of individual countries have to “ converge ” , so that each emits the same amount for every one of its citizens ; rich countries would have to reduce their totals very heavily , while some poor countries could actually be able to increase theirs .
Most experts agree that it is the fairest framework .
Persuading Americans to agree to emit the same amount as Ethiopians is another matter .
Felling forests , especially in the tropics , is the second biggest cause of carbon dioxide emissions after burning fossil fuels , accounting for a fifth of the world ’s total .
But people and governments have no incentive to leave them standing when they can make money by selling the timber , or farming the cleared land .
Now international negotiators are beginning to work out how the world as a whole could compensate them for setting aside the chainsaw .
In practice , of course , the money would end up coming from rich countries .
The Independent
The passive aggression assumption here : technology does not require wastefulness .
We can limit the waste and pollution generated by technology , but on a practical level , there will be CO2 emissions no matter what we do .
Curiously , while the first world can measure its CO2 emissions , the third world cannot , so we do not have figures for slash and burn agriculture , torching garbage , running primitive equipment without catalytic converters , etc. — even though the third world outnumbers the first world nine to one , and so if they produce one ninth the emissions , they ’re on par for the problem .
The right distrusts global warming because all of the solutions end up being like this : penalize the first world , and thus give a giant free gift of money , power and technology to the third world , even though their greater numbers means they ’ll be a climate wrecking ball unlike anything before .
Never mind that the most atrocious uses of power in the first world involve the activities preferred by the working classes and lower middle classes , like fast food restaurants , big engines , cheap consumer products , disposable goods , and so on .
The wealthy do n’t screw around with those things .
They appeal to those for whom “ good deal ” is like a light to a moth ; they ca n’t think past the next two weeks , so always buy the cheaper gadget and then throw it out , even if the gadget that cost twice as much would have lasted ten times as long .
This is why the smartest people among us are turning to whole or organic ideologies that include knowledge of the inherent hierarchies among humanity .
They ’re allying some goofy ideas together in order to do it so that we get the concept of whole .
Whole means every factor at once , not one factor — who has money and who does n’t — at a time .
That ’s why , for example , many environmentalists are embracing alternative medicine :
Environmentalism is , or should be , a movement led by scientific findings .
I see the role of environmentalists as being to explore and explain the implications of what the science â€ “ whether on climate change , habitat loss , biodiversity , fisheries , pollution or resource depletion â€ ” is saying , and how this should translate into public policy .
We should try at all times to be rigorous .
And we should kill our darlings â€ “ our enthusiasm for solar panels , for example , or our rigid opposition to nuclear power â€ ” if the facts demand it .
This does n’t mean that we have to be motivated by the science .
My environmentalism arises from both a deep love of the natural world and a strong sense of the injustices done to vulnerable people : it ’s an emotional impulse , in other words .
The Guardian
He ’s not listening to Prince Charles .
The Prince of Wales is pointing out that modernism , or the assumption of linear rationalism , is the root of our problem .
If we ’re going to get environmental , he thinks , in order for us to succeed we must fix our thinking first .
So — alternative medicine — why ?
It embraces a simple concept : holism .
Where modern medicine tries to find a symptom and hammer it , alternative medicine tries to put the whole system in balance .
And that ’s Prince Charles ’s message : put the system in balance , in harmony , as a whole .
Do not just hammer a problem and ignore the consequences .
Do not be blind to context , or to reasons for things like poverty versus wealth .
Take in all factors at once and come up with a balance solution .
Yes , it ’s intellectually harder — but it ’s a longer - term fix to the ongoing human problem of modernism as described by Huxley : overwhelmed with too much information , we pick an ethic of convenience that leads to a celebration of the trivial , including ourselves as individuals with no cause for said celebration .
Here is why :
“ He sold his boat for me . ”
These are my six words .
He sold his boat and it was a lifetime ago , ancient history now .
And it was a little boat .
But it was a big act of love that I did n’t recognize for a long , long time .
For the boat was just a boat in my eyes .
But in my husband ’s ?
He could tell you the horsepower and the color of the seats and how many people it held and how much he paid for it and how much he got for it – because it was his youth , his plumage , a speedboat that he hitched to the back of his shiny GTO .
It turned heads .
It made girls notice him .
He was 19 and he liked that .
He was 24 and I was 23 and we had an 8 - month - old whose bedroom had been our family room .
I said , “ We need more space . ”
And he said , “ I ’ll sell my boat . ”
And that was that .
He never moaned about giving up something he loved , and I never said , “ Don ’t ” or “ Are you sure ? ”
Everyone who is married or living together or just going together started off sweet - talking .
What do you need ?
How can I help ?
I can do that .
No problem !
Flowers for no reason .
Poems .
Chicken soup when you ’re sick .
Ice cream just because .
Phone calls that are more than traffic reports .
It ’s all sunshine and roses .
Until it is n’t .
That ’s when it ’s important to remember the beginning .
“ He sold his boat for me . ”
This was my beginning .
The Boston Herald
That ’s holism in action : realizing what is more important than immediate needs , transcending the individual and reaching for a greater future state , even if it is not recognized right away .
Not demanding the money of others .
Not farming out your selfishness as a socialized cost to the rest of society .
Not calling folks ignorant for wanting to keep traditional values .
Not living by selling people short - term illusions and pleasing symbols ; instead , embracing reality good and bad alike , and as a painter with a canvas and paint , making a beautiful future of it .

New Game Dungeon !
This took way , way longer than it was supposed to .
The original plan was to have this be under 20 minutes released last month .
Instead , the game hit me pretty hard so I just did n’t want to leave so much out .
Anyway , it ’s finally done and I ’m pretty happy with it , though I ’m really going to have to go back to shorter episodes for a while .
I think I figured out the source of some of my problems in the game since I made it , but not all of them .
On another note , I discovered a bug in Premiere hours ago , where it simply interpreted FRAPS footage improperly .
It actually caused stalled frames and the timing to change .
This came as a bit of a shock as I did n’t notice it until very late in the process .
Re-encoding into another lossless codec solved the problem , but I was n’t going to do that for 1.5TB of footage ( the gameplay was recorded losslessly ) without delaying the video another day at least .
I solved the most egregious problems , but it ’s possible there are some small problems left in there that I missed .
I can release one of the problematic clips for testing if people are interested , though I should see if I can chop it without re-encoding as it ’s about 30 GB on its own .
For anyone critical of fraps , feel free to recommend software for recording DirectX 5 - 8 content with hardware antialiasing enabled ( it may not behave how you think ) .
Freeman ’s Mind next !
Should come much faster !
The genetic toolkit that animals use to build fins and limbs is the same genetic toolkit that controls the development of part of the gill skeleton in sharks , according to research published in PNAS by Andrew Gillis and Neil Shubin of the University of Chicago , and Randall Dahn of Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory .
The research builds on the breakthrough discovery of the fossil Tiktaalik , a " fish with legs , " by Neil Shubin and his colleagues in 2006 .
" This is another example of how evolution uses common developmental programs to pattern different anatomical structures , " said Shubin , who is the senior author on the PNAS paper and Professor and Associate Dean of Organismal and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago .
" In this case , shared developmental mechanisms pattern the skeletons of vertebrate gill arches and paired fins .
" The shark arch gill skeleton ( left ) shows primitive gill rays that arefound only in sharks and other cartilaginous fishes .
The gills ofother fishes ( right ) are also arched but lack gill rays .
This primitivefeature of sharks allowed the researchers to link thedevelopmental genetic program for fins and limbs to the moreprimitive one for gill rays .
Image by J. Andrew Gillis , University of Chicago " In fact , the skeleton of any appendage off the body of an animal is probably patterned by the developmental genetic program that we have traced back to formation of gills in sharks , " said Andrew Gillis , lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy at the University of Chicago .
" We have pushed back the evolutionary origin of the developmental genetic program that patterns fins and limbs .
" This new finding is consistent with an old theory , often discounted in science textbooks , that fins and ( later ) limbs evolved from the gills of an extinct vertebrate , Gillis added .
" A dearth of fossils prevents us from definitely concluding that fins evolved from gills .
Nevertheless , this research shows that the genetic architecture of gills , fins and limbs is the same .
"
The research also showed for the first time that the gill arch skeleton of embryonic skates ( a living relative of sharks that has gill rays ) responds to treatment with the vitamin A derivative retinoic acid in the same way a limb or fin skeleton does : by making a mirror image duplicate of the structure as the embryo develops .
According to the researchers , the genetic circuitry that patterns paired appendages ( arms , legs and fins ) has a deep evolutionary origin that actually predates the origin of paired appendages themselves .
" These findings suggest that when paired appendages appeared , the mechanism used to pattern the skeleton was co-opted from the gills , " Gillis said .
" Perhaps we should think of shark gills as another type of vertebrate appendage — one that 's patterned in essentially the same way as fins and limbs .
"
The deep structural , functional , and regulatory similarities between paired appendages and developing gill rays , as well as the antiquity of gills relative to paired appendages , suggest that the signaling network that is induced by retinoic acid had a patterning function in gills before the origin of vertebrate appendages , the research concludes .
And this function has been retained in the gill rays of living cartilaginous fishes .

Obama apologizes for remark
After comparing his bowling to the Special Olympics on " The Tonight Show " Thursday , President Obama called Special Olympics Chairman Tim Shriver to apologize before the program even aired .
“ He expressed his disappointment and he apologized , in a way that was very moving , ” Shriver said on ABC's “ Good Morning America . ”
“ It ’s important to see that words hurt , and words do matter .
And these words that in some respect can be seen as humiliating or a put - down of people with special needs do cause pain , and they do result in stereotypes . "

Obama told Shriver he wants to have some Special Olympics competitors over to the White House for basketball or bowling .
Shriver is the son of Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver , President Kennedy 's sister .
The president had been making an attempt at self - deprecating humor in his appearance on Jay Leno 's show by saying that a recent 129 he scored in the White House bowling alley had been " like Special Olympics , or something . "
He and his staff quickly recognized the mistake and moved to limit the damage .
While Obama called Shriver , White House Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton told reporters flying back to Washington with Obama on Air Force
One that the president had “ made an offhand remark making fun of his own bowling that was in no way intended to disparage the Special Olympics . ”
“ He thinks that the Special Olympics are a wonderful program that gives an opportunity to shine to people with disabilities from around the world , ” Burton said .
Aside from the regrettable appearance of a president even implicitly poking fun at the disabled , Obama ’s comments came on the same day that he had appeared with California First Lady Maria Shriver , an early supporter and the sister of Tim Shriver .
Eunice Kennedy Shriver founded the athletic competition for the disabled in 1968 .
Even before the Special Olympics remark , the idea of a light - hearted late - night turn was something of a risk for a president in the midst of a recession .
And Obama had taken some criticism for it already .
But he shrugged it just a few hours before he taped the show .

“ Now , there are those who say these plans are too ambitious , ” Obama said , referring to his agenda during an town hall event .
‘ In fact , somebody was saying the other – today , I think – that I should n't be on Leno .
I can't handle that and the economy at the same time . ”
Obama used much of his appearance on the comedy show to discuss the economy but sought to get in some light - hearted quips toward the end of the taping .
He said he had been working on his bowling game just below his new residence and recently rolled a 129 .
“ That ’s very good , Mr. President , ” cracked host Jay Leno .
" It 's like — it was like Special Olympics , or something , " the president replied .
Obama ’s bowling skills , or lack thereof , have been a running joke since he fared poorly during an impromptu game at a Pennsylvania bowling alley during the Democratic primary last year .
Obama 's line on Leno was reminiscent of a crack at Nancy Reagan he let slip last year .
" I did n't want to get into a Nancy Reagan thing about , you know , doing any seances , " he said at a press conference days after being elected last November , a reference to the former First Lady 's consultation with an astrologer during her time in the White House .
Obama called the elderly Reagan after his comment and apologized about what an aide described as " a careless and off - handed remark . "

Carlos Cruz has a strategy for surviving the worst global recession in 60 years : pay less in taxes and pass the savings along to customers .
“ I ’m declaring half as much as I used to , ” said Cruz , 29 , who runs a painting business in Madrid .
“ Prices have fallen by 30 percent and customers will choose you for a difference of as little as 50 euros ( $ 67.70 ) , ” said Cruz , an Ecuadorian who has lived in Spain since 2001 .
[ efoods ]
The production of goods and services that are lawful , though not declared , may grow the most as a proportion of total output since 2000 , according to Friedrich Schneider , a professor at Austria ’s Johannes Kepler University of Linz .
The shift , measured by tax analysts and economists using surveys , money - supply data and anecdotal evidence , is caused by businesses going off the books to cut costs and workers taking informal jobs to survive rising unemployment .
It offers a buffer against the ravages of the crisis and may help explain why the slowdown has n’t prompted more social unrest .

Right before going to bed last night , jessE , linked me this song .
She knew I would like it because I love songs remixed .
But I have never heard a RAP song remixed into 8 - bit before .
Shot then , has done an incredible job of creating an 8 - bit medley of the following songs :
Jay - Z – Dirt Off Your Shoulders
T.I – What You Know
Chamillionaire – Ridin ’
Ludacris – What ’s Ya Fantasy
Bonecrusher – Neva Scared
Kanye – Overnight Celebrity
Ludacris – Move Bitch
Lil’ Jon – Get Low
Kanye – Gold Digger

This song was by tugboat and you can use this link to download other things he ’s done .
Well done sir .
Well done .
Mind that age !
This blog post is 11 years old !
Most likely , its content is outdated .
Especially if it 's technical .
I 've now written my first Git hook .
For the people who do n't know what Git is you have either lived under a rock for the past few years or your not into computer programming at all .
The hook is a post - commit hook and what it does is that it sends the last commit message up to a twitter account I called " friedcode " .
I guess it 's not entirely useful but for you who want to be loud about your work and the progress you make I guess it can make sense .
Or if you 're a team and you want to get a brief overview of what your team mates are up to .
For me , it was mostly an experiment to try Git hooks and pytwitter .
Here 's how I did it :
Go into the .git directory and edit the file ' post - commit ' :
$ cd myproject $ cd . git / hooks $ jed post - commit
Here 's the script I wrote which contains some horrible python one - liners simply because my sed / awk - fu is n't good enough :
# : Nothing last_message = `git log -- pretty=oneline - n1` last_message = ` echo $ last_message | python - c " import sys;sys.stdout.write ( \ ' '.join(sys.stdin.read ( ) .strip ( ) .split ( ) [ 1 : ] ) ) " ` repo_name = `git info | head - n1` repo_name = ` echo $ repo_name | python - c " import \ sys ; sys .
stdout .
write ( sys .
stdin . read ( ) . strip ( ) . split ( '/' ) [ - 1 ] ) " ` echo " ( $ repo_name ) $ last_message " | Update_friedcode .
py
To enable the hook what you have to do is simply make it executable and you 're done :
$ chmod + x post - commit
Then I needed the pytwitter script called Update_friedcode.py which I 've put in '~ / bin ' :
#!/usr/bin/env python import sys " " " To use : $ echo " I ate too much " | ./Update_friedcode.py " " " U = ' friedcode ' P = < something something > import pytwitter client = pytwitter .
pytwitter ( username = U , password = P ) status_update = sys .
stdin . read ( ) . strip ( ) [ : 140 ] client .
statuses_update ( status = status_update )

Open Source Uru Live
Shorah fans of Cyan ,
As you may be aware , Cyan ’s situation has not improved on the “ resources ” front .
We continue to work on small projects ( including Myst for the iPhone / iPod Touch ) , and it looks like we will only be able to concentrate on projects that are fully funded for the foreseeable future .
However , all of us at Cyan and everybody that has ever worked on the creation and building of the dream called Uru Live ( a.k.a .
Mudpie , Untìl Uru , Myst Online : Uru Live and MORE ) can not just let it die !
( My definitions : ” Uru Live ” is the original dream of the virtual world .
And ” Myst Online ” is the current implementation of Uru Live . )
So , Cyan has decided to give make Myst Online available to the fans by releasing the source code for the servers , client and tools for Myst Online as an open source project .
We will also host a data server with the data for Myst Online .
MORE is still possible but only with the help from fans .
This is a bit scary for Cyan because this is an area that we have never gone before , to let a product freely roam in the wild .
But we ’ve poured so much into Uru Live , and it has touched so many , that we could not just let it whither and die .
We still have hopes that someday we will be able to provide new content for Uru Live and / or work on the next Uru Live .
This is also a bit scary for the fans .
We realize that this could turn Uru Live into the “ wild west ” and lead to many fractured and diverse Myst Online servers .
But it is our hope that with the help of dedicated core fans ( if you are reading this , it probably means you ) that a safe and secure Myst Online server set ( many servers from around the world working together as one ) can be created that will let people explore and live in Uru Live .
We also are pretty sure that releasing Myst Online will result in some pleasant surprises for us .
Our fans have always been so innovative , creative , and resourceful !
This release will probably be accomplished in stages , but we hope to get things ready for the first stage very quickly .
More details to surely follow .
MORE Uru Live status — strange times
Sorry for the long silence , things have been quickly shifting in these strange times .
Even though the development of MORE Uru Live has been progressing ( the new account system is nearly done ! ) , I ’m sorry to say that outside events have caused us to put this project on indefinite hold .
The MORE project was not funded directly but was riding on the coat tails of other projects .
Unfortunately and very suddenly , a major revenue stream to Cyan was disrupted .
The current Wall Street problems have had a significant , although indirect , effect .
We have no alternative than to put this project on hold .
The ultimate future of MORE Uru Live will be determined over the coming months .
If or when moneys become available we will reassess the roadmap at that time .
Currently , Cyan is redirecting its priorities to focus only on fully funded projects .
Of which , Myst for the iPhone / iPod Touch is one of and that project is progressing very well .
From all of us at Cyan , thank you for all your support .
Myst Online : Restoration Experiment
Shorah ,
We ’ve got some good news .
GameTap and Cyan Worlds have reached an agreement that would return the rights of Myst Online to Cyan Worlds !
We ’re very excited , but at the same time , there are some hurdles to overcome .
Cyan Worlds is currently operating at a reduced capacity .
We ’re not in a position where we have plenty of resources and people to bring Myst Online back fast and furiously .
But we ’ve got a plan , and we ’d like to run it past you — our fans and supporters .
Please realize that this roadmap is tentative and dynamic — but it ’s a starting point .
There ’s no guarantee that we can accomplish all of these milestones , but they are something to discuss , adjust , and shoot for .
We also need to mention that the roadmap below will most likely involve some minimal subscriber fees — something along the lines of $ 25 ( US ) for six months .
( That number is subject to change . )
We are not trying to make any money on this at this stage — but we do need to cover some of the costs .
( Additional fees may apply for future Cyan content , front - end shard ownership , etc. )
You should know that the roadmap does not involve any new content from Cyan at this time .
The plan is to start to move the content creation — the “ Art ” — to you .
In addition the guilds themselves will start to exercise some authority in writing , monitoring , approving , communicating , etc .
For now , please watch and participate in the Myst Online : Uru Live forums .
This will be a good place to find updates — as well as through the Guild of Messengers and their affiliates .
Also , consider joining one of the Guilds .
And because we felt like we all needed a little levity to combat the crazy whiplash of the continuing death and resurrection of Myst Online , we ’ve decided to temporarily name the resurrection plan —
Myst Online : Restoration Experiment ( MORE ) as in “ We want MORE ! ”
Thanks again for so much support !
The MORE team
Roadmap
MORE servers will be restarted .
These will be run by Cyan and run on machines that are either owned or leased by Cyan .
The software and game assets will be as it was when Myst Online was shutdown on the GameTap servers .
However , all accounts and avatars from the GameTap servers will not be available and will have to be re-created .
There will be some restructuring of MystOnline.com to accommodate the new direction of MORE .
Including the forums and the policies running the forum .
Release of the 3ds Max Plasma plugins for creating MORE content .
Release of the source for the plugin ( only ) to the Guild of Writers .
This will allow for the easier creation of fan created tools as well as being able to use what Cyan used for creating Myst Online content .
The Guild of Maintainers ( in conjunction with the Guild of Writers ) will act as an agent in approving fan created content creation for MORE .
Create methods and processes for testing fan created MORE content .
How this will work has not been determined but is crucial for fan created content .
Then a process will be created to bring Guild of Maintainers final approved and tested content forward to main server for all users to enjoy .
Release binaries for a few front end servers to be run on fan run servers ( front end shards ) .
These fan run servers will have to be registered with the Cyan server and will help alleviate bandwidth issues .
These front end processes will be limited to game servers and file servers .
All authentication and avatar databases would still be handled by Cyan servers .
This way a user needs only one account with all their avatars , no matter what front end shard they connect to .
As a matter of fact , accessing the front end shards will be seamless for the user , and they may never know ( or care ) which one they are running on .
Create processes and release binary updates to the front end shards so that shard owners can host specific age game instances ( such as a particular Neighborhood ) and be able to control the states of that instance .
End users will not have to do anything special other than link to that age and they will be routed to the shard that is hosting it .
This will allow the front end shard owners to provide unique experiences on the age instance that they host .
( By the way , the states the front end shard owner ’s change will only affect the instance of the age they are hosting and will not affect other age ’s states , even if it is the same age . )
( Pie in the sky milestone ! )
Cyan Worlds will create new content and storyline .
This may be done solely by Cyan or in conjunction with the Guilds .
Press Conference
To answer the inevitable deluge of questions arising from this roadmap , Cyan will conduct a press conference on IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) starting around Thursday July 3 , 2008 at 9 AM Pacific Daylight Time ( Noon Eastern ) .
( For a list of international cities and times , please see timeanddate.com . )
If you are not familiar with IRC , the Guild of Messengers has put up a gateway to make your experience easy and pleasant .
Visit rel.to/IRC
and click the “ #cyanchat ” entry , and after a moment , you will be prompted for your name .
Enter your nickname and press “ Connect ” , and that is all you need to do .
No pre-registration or account is needed .
If you are a veteran at IRC , all of the information that you ’ll need to join the press conference is listed on the rel.to / IRC page .
Note : Conversation that you observe from a user named “ CC ” is being channeled into #cyanchat by a relay connected to CyanChat , Cyan ’s own chat room .
For relayed chat , the name in brackets following “ CC ” is the identify of the speaker .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The weakness in U.S. labor markets has gathered extraordinary momentum , wiping away millions of jobs over the past four months alone , the Labor Department reported Friday .
The U.S. economy lost 651,000 jobs in February , the fourth month in a row where job losses were near or above 600,000 .
The unemployment rate soared to 8.1 % in February , the highest rate in over 25 years .
The economy has lost 4.4 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007 , with more than half coming in the last four months .
Read full report .
" This is what falling off a cliff looks like , " said Lawrence Mishel , president of the Economic Policy Institute .
President Barack Obama called the losses " astounding " and said the figures proved that Washington " did the right thing " by passing the historic $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan last month .
Obama spoke at a police trainee graduation ceremony in Columbus , Ohio , where the class of recruits had been threatened with layoffs until the stimulus provided the funds to keep them in uniform .
House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio said the job report proved that Washington had done too much .
" Even as Americans ' job prospects grow dimmer , their savings evaporate , and their budgets tighten , Washington Democrats seem more determined than ever to continue pursuing tax hikes and pork - barrel spending increases that are only proving to make matters worse , " he said .
The stock market moved higher in opening trading on relief that the report was not worse .
Treasurys fell pushing yields up for the same reason , traders said .
Read Bond Report .
Job losses in February were close to expectations , while the unemployment rate was above forecasts of 8.0 % .
See Economic Calendar .
Previous estimates for payrolls were revised lower by a total of 161,000 .
Payrolls fell by 655,000 in January and by 681,000 in December .
The job losses in December were the biggest monthly decline in jobs since October 1949 , when half a million steelworkers went on strike for higher pay .
The consensus of private forecasters is for the unemployment rate to get close to 9 % next year , with some forecasters looking for a 10 % rate .
The Federal Reserve does n't expect the unemployment rate to fall below 7 % until 2011 .
The report raised doubt about expectations that the economy would recover sometime this year .
" Combing the details of the employment report offers little hope of improvement any time soon , " wrote Richard Moody , chief economist at Mission Residential , in a note to clients .
Job losses were widespread across industries .
Only education and health services reported job gains .
According to the survey of business establishments , 660,000 jobs were lost in the private - sector in February .
Goods - producing industries shed 276,000 jobs , while services lost 375,000 .
Construction employment fell by 104,000 in February and the industry has shed 904.000 jobs since the recession began .
A leading indicator of labor market conditions - temporary - help services -- saw 78,000 jobs lost in February .
Other large job losses in February occurred in transportation , financial services , and retail and wholesale trade .
A separate survey of households showed that employment fell by 351,000 in February .
Unemployment rose by 851,000 to 12.4 million .
Unemployment has risen by 6.9 million since the recession began .
An alternative measure of unemployment that includes discouraged jobseekers and those whose hours have been cut back to part - time rose to a record 14.8 % .
Those data go back only to 1994 .
The unemployment rate for African Americans rose to 13.4 % in February , the highest rate since December 1993 .
Teenage unemployment rose to 21.6 % .
Average hourly earnings rose by 3 cents , or 0.2 % , to $ 18.47 an hour .
Average wages have risen 3.6 % in the past year .
The average workweek held steady at 33.3 hours for the third straight month .
The index for hours worked fell by 0.7 % , consistent with gross domestic product falling at a 7 % pace this quarter , said economists for Goldman Sachs .
Hours in the factory sector dropped by 2 % over the month .
The number of workers experiencing long spells of joblessness , defined by the government as 27 weeks without work , has risen to 2.9 million in February , up 1.6 million since the start of the recession .
The number of persons working part time who would prefer to be working full time jumped 787,000 in February to 8.6 million .
This category has risen by nearly 4 million since the recession began .
About 2.1 million other workers are classified as only marginally attached to the labor force .
I ’ve been picking up word that Republicans on the Hill genuinely think Norm Coleman is going to get the results of the November elections tossed and have a revote .
And if not genuinely , that they ’ve all convinced themselves to say they believe it .
As I told one friend who passed word on to me about this , the Coleman people must be smoking some powerful weed .
Because nothing that has happened in the trial gives the remotest indication that anything like that will happen .
Indeed , there ’s simply no basis in Minnesota law for throwing out the results of an election .
To be clear , I think it ’s highly unlikely that the Court will come down with a judgment that will make it possible to Coleman to reclaim his seat .
There ’s just no indication of that .
But while that ’s very unlikely , actually throwing out the results entirely is n’t even on the menu of options the judges have before them .
Now , here ’s one thing to consider .
Are the Republicans trying to lay the groundwork for filibustering any effort to seat Franken , even after the state of Minnesota tells Norm it ’s over and he has to go home ?
Keep an eye out for it .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : network - bytestring 0.1.2
I am pleased to announce a new release of network - bytestring , a Haskell library for fast socket I/O using ByteStrings .
New in this release is support for scatter / gather I/O ( also known as vectored I /O ) .
Scatter / gather I/ O provides more efficient I/ O by using one system call to send several separate pieces of data and by avoiding unnecessary copying .
I would like to thank Brian Lewis , Bryan O'Sullivan , and Thomas Schilling for contributing patches for this release .
Get it : cabal install network - bytestring And on Hackage : http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/network-bytestring
Windows hackers needed : I 've made sure that the library builds on Windows but since I do n't use Windows myself I have n't implemented scatter / gather I/O support for Windows .
It should be straightforward to add and I 'd be happy to review the patches .
Cheers , Johan

It is possible that one of the victims of the United States ' torture policy is a young , devout Mormon woman from Arizona called Alyssa Peterson .
She was a soldier who not only saw the rough interrogation methods that the US military used on Iraqi prisoners , but was deeply troubled by them .
Some weeks after formally protesting about them to her superiors , and asking to be reassigned , she took her gun and killed herself .
The cause of her death was kept secret for two years , and the mystery of what Peterson witnessed , and the content of the notes she made , still goes on .
It was in September 2003 at Tal - Afar air base , northern Iraq , that Specialist Peterson , serving with a military intelligence section of the 101st Airborne , came across interrogation methods very different from the ones she had known in training .
An Arab - speaker , Peterson was assigned to work as an interpreter at interrogation sessions in a unit known as " The Cage " .
After only two nights , she refused to take further part in the sessions and was reassigned .
Then , on 15 September , she shot herself with her service rifle .
A notebook recording her thoughts was found by her body .
Its contents were blanked out in the subsequent official report .
Her family , in Flagstaff , Arizona , were told she had died from a " non-hostile weapons discharge " .
It was only after an Arizona reporter , Kevin Elston , investigated , that the army revealed Peterson had killed herself .
They refused to say what interrogation she objected to , and maintain that all documents relating to methods used at Tal - Afar have been destroyed .

But , at Mosul , also in northern Iraq , a former US soldier , Kayla Williams , later told the broadcasterCNN : " There were prisoners that were burned with lit cigarettes .
They stripped prisoners naked then removed their blindfolds so that I was the first thing they saw .
And then we were supposed to mock them and degrade their manhood . "
She , too , objected .
Williams had once met Peterson , and conceded the interpreter had personal problems .
The official army report into her death , obtained in 2007 by the Arizona Daily Sun , said that she had once been reprimanded for " showing empathy " to detainees .
It said her superiors had given her suicide prevention training .
Her body was buried , with military honours , in Flagstaff , Arizona .
One of scores of messages on a memorial website reads : " Alyssa Peterson was a shining example to all , a true hero and patriot for displaying empathy and her opposition to torture . "
General Motors today warned it would go bust within 30 days unless the US treasury gives it a further multi-billion dollar loan .
The dramatic warning from America 's biggest car group came after its auditor , Deloitte , raised substantial doubts about its ability to continue operations as a going concern .
These alarm signals were contained in GM 's 480 - page annual report for 2008 to the US Securities and Exchange Commission , America 's financial regulator .
They further underline the parlous state of the global car industry .
GM has so far received $ 13.4bn ( £ 9.5 bn ) in treasury loans and a further $ 1.6bn in other government loans .
Today , effectively holding a gun to the government 's head , it said it could default on this $ 15 bn if it did not receive a further cash injection .
It is seeking a total of $ 30bn from the Obama administration after racking up $ 82bn of losses in the last three years , including $ 31 bn last year .
The group , once the world 's biggest carmaker , said it needed $ 3.5 bn cash in 2009 and a further $ 2.3 bn to 2014 to stay alive .
The plan it has submitted to Tim Geithner , the US treasury secretary , envisages 47,000 job losses – 26,000 outside the US .
" If we are not successful in obtaining the additional funding necessary to execute our restructuring plan ... we would be required to take additional actions to continue operations , " its SEC filing said .
But the report added : " However , there can be no assurance that these actions , such as further reductions in productive capacity , hourly and salaried headcount , employee compensation and benefits or capital expenditure and engineering spending would be sufficient to prevent the need for us to potentially seek relief through a filing under the bankruptcy laws in the US and other jurisdictions . "
GM cautioned that if the treasury did not approve its viability plan and lend it more money " we would be unable to repay amounts outstanding under the treasury loan facility or other indebtedness as they become due which would cause us to default " .
It could then breach its banking covenants and declare itself bankrupt – with no guarantee even then it could secure financing to continue operations under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection laws .
But the group headed by Rick Wagoner said it had secured waivers from its creditors for an outstanding $ 6.125 bn so far , following the auditors ' statement , in the event that the Treasury helped it out again .
" We believe that only the US government can provide such financing , directly or indirectly , through guarantees , " it added .
GM Europe , meanwhile , poured cold water on reports that it was seeking between £ 440 m and £ 750 m from the British government as part of the € 3.3 bn rescue plan submitted to the German government last week .
Vauxhall , its UK unit , with plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton , contributes around a quarter of GME's European business , prompting what industry sources called the entirely speculative calculations .
" We have not got to that stage yet , " the sources said .
" When the German government has finished reviewing the plan we will submit it to Lord Mandelson [ the business secretary ] and that will be next week at the earliest . "
It is understood that Vauxhall could apply for a share of the £ 2.1 bn loan facility for the British auto industry approved by the European Investment Bank , the EU 's main lending arm .
Mandelson has indicated he is willing to support Vauxhall and its two plants , both of which have been excluded from the three GME is seeking to close in Europe .
For months rumors have circulated that Sublime — the SoCal ska-punk band who found fame after the 1996 death of frontman Bradley Nowell — would reunite with a new singer .
Saturday night at a Nevada Mexican restaurant those rumors became fact when former drummer Bud Gaugh and bassist Eric Wilson were joined by a singer named Rome for a brief set of Sublime classics , including “ Wrong ” and “ What I Got . ”
The trio , who followed Del Mar ( Gaugh ’s other band ) , also played a new original song .
Low - quality YouTube footage and Del Mar ’s MySpace page confirm what occurred at Cantina Los Tres Hombres : “ So , Del Mar played the gig at Cantina last night … it was packed and amazing .
What really fucking killed it was SUBLIME reuniting and playing with new singer , Rome .
Sublime does n’t have any firm tour plans or anything YET , but we ’ll keep you posted on their progress . ”
But unlike the boys onstage , many fans are n’t exactly excited about the “ reunion . ”
On a message board at PunkDisasters.com one fan wrote , “ Sorry , but it ’s not Sublime without Brad Nowell . ”
Another quipped , “ That ’s like saying Nirvana reunited last night . ”
( CNN ) -- Associates of convicted Wall Street swindler Bernard Madoff knew he was scamming his clients but joined in anyway because of the big money they could make , a securities investigator testified in a sworn affidavit for a Connecticut court .
Bernard Madoff pleaded guilty in March to 11 charges related to his $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme .
The testimony by investigator Edward H. Seidle on Tuesday came as a Connecticut judge froze the funds of Madoff and several of his business associates as part of a lawsuit filed for members of a city 's retirement fund who say they invested with companies linked to Madoff .
In his affidavit , Seidle said Madoff 's associates -- specifically the so - called " feeder funds " that handled money for Fairfield , Connecticut 's retirement plan -- should have known that he was cheating his clients .
" It is my opinion ... that [ the funds and their principals ] were all aware that Bernard L. Madoff was engaging in illegal conduct in connection with his purported money management operations and intentionally chose to participate and support Madoff 's illegal conduct in order to reap enormous illicit financial benefits , " he stated .
He named feeder funds Tremont Properties , Maxam Capital , their principals and their affiliates in the affidavit .
Madoff , 70 , pleaded guilty in March to 11 federal counts , including fraud , money laundering and perjury , and faces up to 120 years in prison .
He is to be sentenced in June .
Those prevented from liquidating any assets by Superior Court Judge Arthur Hiller 's order include Madoff 's wife , his sons and his brother , Peter .
Similar freezes have been ordered by judges in other suits by the roughly 4,000 alleged victims of Madoff's $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme .
Seidle said the people who ran the funds appear to have intentionally ignored red flags about how Madoff worked that anyone with their level of expertise would have noticed .
He noted that , for years , fund managers with similar levels of training and experience had been suspicious of the amount of money Madoff had been able to earn and had avoided working with him .
Madoff paid fees to the firms far above normal and demanded an unusual amount of secrecy , Seidle said .

Suspending seismic work may help the whales recover
Conservation campaigners are hailing a victory for the critically endangered western gray whale .
The groups have won agreement from some oil and gas companies in Russian waters to end seismic work , giving the whales a chance to breed undisturbed .
The cessation comes in response to research showing how oil exploration can alter the behaviour of gray whales .
However , a number of firms have refused to stop exploration work planned for the breeding season .
Feeding season
WWF and Pacific Environment conservation groups praised the Sakhalin Energy consortium for its decision to abandon underwater seismic work scheduled to take place off Sakhalin Island in 2009 .
" The results seen today demonstrate that collaborative science based initiatives like this panel process can succeed - even on issues as complex as oil and gas development , " said Aleksey Knizhnikov from WWF - Russia in a statement .
Sakhalin Energy 's decision came following the presentation of research revealing how seismic work disrupts the lifecycle of the gray whale .
The whales are known to only feed in summer and their main feeding area is in the Piltun Bay which lies at the north eastern part of Sakhalin shelf .
Research reveals that the noise from oil and gas exploration has driven the whales into deeper waters making it hard for their calves to feed and thrive .
The western gray whale is known to be one of the world 's most endangered creatures .
Only 35 of the 130 animals remaining are thought to be breeding females .
The whale is listed as " critically endangered " by Russia and is on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature 's Red List of Threatened Species .
The suspension of seismic work by Sakhalin Energy , which is backed by Shell and Gasprom , might mean the whales can move in - shore , feed and breed .
However , campaigners pointed out that other oil and gas firms working in the region , including BP , Exxon and Rosneft , were still planning to carry out seismic work in 2009 .
Lua is a small , portable , and fast scripting language designed for embedding in other software .
Being designed for embedding , it has a simple but powerful API which makes it easy to communicate both ways : from C into Lua and from Lua into C .
In this post , I ’ll describe the process of writing a small module adding support for OpenSSL ’s hashing functions to Lua .
Hashing data with OpenSSL
Generating hashes of data is an relatively simple problem to address in a library : is has a small , simple interface which can be implemented using any of a large number of hashing libraries .
Rather than locate , evaluate and include one of the many open source or public domain hashing libraries , I ’ve decided to wrap the hashing functions from OpenSSL .
This provides a number of benefits :
It ’s reasonably well trusted ( and I do n’t have to try to vet it ) .
It ’s installed pretty much everywhere ( so I do n’t need to include it with my code ) .
It ’s API is simple , consistent , and flexible .
We ’ll see later that it makes my code powerful and lends it an elegant interface .
Before I can write a Lua wrapper for the OpenSSL functions , I ’ll need to know how they work .
The man pages help immeasurably , especially as they contain code demonstrating how to hash data using OpenSSL .
Following the example in that man page , a first cut of my code will look like this :
Easy !
Variable arguments are a pain in the arse in C , so I ’ve omitted them from the code above but it ’d be great if the Lua module will accept any number of input values and hash them all .
Thanks to the great OpenSSL API , doing so is just a matter of calling EVP_DigestUpdate ( ) in a loop over each of the input values .
It could n’t be simpler !
Calling C code from Lua
Now that I can hash values with the OpenSSL functions , it ’s time to think about calling that code from Lua .
Lua has a fairly simple API for implementing module in C :
functions take a single argument – the state of the Lua interpreter
they can manipulate that state , including pushing or poping values off the argument stack
and then return an integer – the number of items they push onto the stack as return values .
As simple example may help illustrate .
The following function inspects the stack to see how many parameters it was invoked with , and returns a message state such .
Unlike the stacks used in many other systems , the Lua stack is indexed ( you can access any item by its index , rather than only the top item ) and these indexes start from 1 ( instead of the traditional 0 ) .
As a consequence , the index of the top of the stack is the number of items on it .
Using just few more functions from the API , I can modify the OpenSSL code above to be called from Lua .
All it requires is a change of signature , a call to lua_tolstring ( ) to get the algorithm name , a call to lua_gettop ( ) to get the number of inputs , a loop calling lua_tolstring ( ) to get each of them in turn and feed them to the hashing code , and a call to lua_pushstring ( ) to push the return value onto the stack .
The revised code looks like this :
With the function itself written , registering it so that it can be called by Lua code is simple too .
Each C module ( whether compiled into Lua or loaded as a shared object library ) has a luaopen_ *( ) function that is responsible for initialising the library and registering the resources it provides .
There are utility functions to automatically register entire modules based on arrays of function pointers , but I ’ve only got one function and there ’s no point cramming it into a table , so I ’ll go it alone .
Again , it ’s really easy :
An elegant API
This is all very well and good , but the API is pretty poor as it stands : a single function which takes a string ( denoting the actual function to compute ) and a bunch of inputs .
It ’s pretty cool that we can support all these functions with a single piece of code , but it ’d be even better if our single piece of code implementing many functions looked like the many functions to the callers .
Rather than hash ( " md5 " , v1 , v2 , v3 ) , we should be writing md5( v1,v2,v3 ) .
Happily , this too is a cinch !
Tables and meta-tables
You may or may not be familiar with tables – Lua ’s single complex data - structure .
Tables are a combination of arrays ( sequential , integer indexed , etc. ) with dictionaries / hashes ( matching arbitrary keys with a value ) .
Lua uses tables for pretty much everything including environments ( wherein variables are stored ) and modules ( like our library ) .
If that was all there was to tables , then they would n’t be such a big thing .
Thankfully it is not .
In addition to their workaday nature as Lua ’s catch all storage thingy , the semantics of tables can be modified using meta - tables full of functions which implement aspects of their table ’s semantics .
Using meta - tables I can override the default behaviour of , say , looking up a value my module table and return a brand new object instead .
An object that did n’t even exist until you asked for it .
Using this facility along with closures and anonymous functions I can hide my hash_hash ( ) function above in a meta - table .
It ’s as simple as modifying hash_hash ( ) to take the algorithm name from its closure ( rather than the first parameter ) and adding a new wrapper function to create these closures on request .
It is this wrapper function that will go in the meta - table to give us a shiny new API .
Creating the closure
The first task is to create a closure of hash_hash ( ) along with the algorithm name .
Bearing in mind that this function is going to be called as the index operation , it will need to take two parameters : the table and the key .
Given that it ’ll only be called for my module table , I ’ll just ignore the table argument .
This code just reads the key from the stack as a string and pushes it back onto the stack ( this may not be necessary , I ’m not sure ) .
Then it pushes a closure of this one value with hash_hash ( ) onto the stack .
Modifying hash_hash ( ) to use this closure value is just as ease .
I just need to modify the lua_tostring ( ) call that gets the algorithm name to get the first value from the closure instead of the first argument on the stack :
and modify the for loop to start at first argument instead of the second :
Now I ’m ready to build and install the meta - table for my module and my powerful new API will be complete .
Hiding behind a meta-table
Binding this all up as an API is a little involved .
As everything needs to pass through the stack , it ’s easiest to create the various objects in order and avoid having to shuffle them around .
In code order :
Create the module table ; Create the meta-table ; Add a reference to hash_index ( ) in the meta- table ; Join the table and the meta-table ; and Assign the table to the global variable “ hash ” .
This is n’t much longer in code .
The body of luaopen_hash ( ) now looks like :
A few notes might help make the above a little clearer .
The stack can be accessed with negative indices which count from the top rather than the bottom ( i.e. - 1 is the top , - 2 is second from the top , etc. ) and there are a number of magical indices that access such things as the globals table ( like LUA_GLOBALSINDEX ) .
With these changes made , my code now has an API that ’s actually pretty great : a single table that , by the magic of meta - tables , looks - up the appropriate function as requested by the caller .
It exposes a lot of functionality ( six different functions on my machine ) but is implemented which only a fraction of the code a traditional approach would need ( about a sixth of it ) .
“ Where do we go from here ? ”
The code I ’ve described in this post is very simple but provides a powerful , elegant interface that belies that simplicity .
The complete code for the module developed in this article is available as lhash .c .
Note , though , that I make no warranty as to its correctness or its fitness or suitability for any purpose .
Useful though it is , there are many ways it could be improved .
Perhaps the most important is improved error handling .
As it stands , my code delays error detection and handling ’ til the latest possible moment : right as it ’s about to perform the hashing operation .
It ’s entirely reasonable ( given Lua ’s first class functions ) that a user might get a reference to a hash function and not call it until much later in the program .
It would be nice if , instead of happily returning a closure , code like
would fail immediately , rather than waiting until the program tries to call f .
To make it so , I need only to make to the code is to copy and paste the algorithm lookup and test and – for good measure – move the OpenSSL initialization call into the library open function .
See the revised lhash2.c for these changes .
To make this even more useful , I ’d like to find out how to set the function name in the call stack without registering it ( and thus allowing the users to call it directly ) .
It ’s also not particularly self - documenting .
Tables in Lua are iterable just like similar structures in other languages .
It ’d be nice if callers could iterate over the table and get a list of the valid keys , just as they can with most other modules .
While generating a new closure every time the user wants one is cheap , it would be nice to add memoization so that hash_index ( ) does n’t need to create a new closure if it ’s already created one for the requested algorithm .
This would also ensure that references to the same hash algorithm are identical which is not currently the case ( alas hash.md5 != hash.md5 ) .
Finally , allowing the user to hash values other than strings and numbers .
Alas , this would be rather more complex what with having to serialize tables for hashing ( a difficult task without a stable sort and in the possible presence of arbitrary opaque values from other C extensions ) .
When that lot ’s done , it ’ll be time to move on to the rest of OpenSSL …

A French appeals court has thrown out France Telecom 's attempt to restore its exclusive rights to the iPhone , upholding a December ruling handed down by competition regulators .
France Telecom 's wireless carrier Orange signed a five - year deal with Apple to carry the iPhone 3G , leading rival mobile phone service provider Bouygues Telecom to file a complaint last September joined by its fellow competitors .
On Dec. 17 the Competition Council sided with Bouygues , saying the deal risked " serious and immediate damage " to competition because of its " excessive " length and that all future iPhone agreements would be capped at a maximum of 3 months .
Both Apple and Orange appealed .
However , the appeals court has denied the two partners in today 's ruling , available in this French - language PDF .
France Telecom told Reuters it plans to file another appeal with the Cour de Cassation , the highest court in France .
Bouygues Telecom , which is the No. 3 mobile operator in the European country , welcomed the ruling and indicated company officials are already engaged in negotiations with Apple to sell iPhones linked to its own network .
" With this decision , Bouygues Telecome will soon offer the iPhone as soon as the conditions for distribution ( are ) finalized with Apple , " the company said in a press release translated from its original French .
" This decision is a significant step forward for consumers who can now choose freely . "
France 's No. 2 operator , Vivendi- owned SFR , and Britain 's Vodafone also embraced the news .
Analysts cited in the Reuters report estimate losses of 200 million euros ( or $ 260.7 million ) in sales for France Telecom as a result of the decision .
Hi everyone , the last time you heard from me , I talked about the huge milestone that PlayStation 2 achieved – reaching 50 million units sold in North America .
Today I ’m excited to talk about another milestone in PlayStation 2 ’s lifespan .
For the first time ever , PlayStation 2 will be offered at a price point under $ 100 ( that ’s $ 99.99 MSRP , to be exact ) , starting April 1 !
Why is this so significant ?
Well most importantly , this new price means that more people than ever will be able to join in on the fun that so many of you PlayStation 2 owners have been enjoying for years , which means new families will become part of the platform ’s record - breaking install base .
With this new price , we intend to introduce a new generation of consumers – some of whom were n’t even alive when the system was first introduced in 2000 – to the immense entertainment value offered by PlayStation 2 .
In the gaming industry , the typical lifecycle for a console is around five years , but because we build each of our platforms for a large and diverse consumer base , we design our platforms differently .
With the original PlayStation and now PlayStation 2 , we ’ve proven that consumers can rely on our platforms for their gaming and entertainment needs for at least a decade .
This speaks to the technology and features that were packed into PlayStation 2 from the beginning , as well as to the ongoing support the platform enjoys from the publishing and retail communities and , well , all of you fans .
PlayStation 2 ’s unmatched gaming library will grow to nearly 1,900 titles from both our first - party studios and publishing partners this year , with a particular focus on the social and sports genres that are so popular with the emerging family demographic .
This will include games such as MLB ’09 , Ghostbusters : The Video Game , Guitar Hero Metallica and MotorStorm : Arctic Edge … not to mention the 250 titles that have achieved “ Greatest Hits ” status .
With all of that content , PlayStation 2 is a great option for families looking for ways to share their entertainment experiences together ; they can rock out to Rock Band , test their trivia knowledge with Buzz ! , or simply use the PlayStation 2 as their DVD or CD player .
So to everyone who ’s enjoyed PlayStation 2 over the years , thanks for your continued support .
And to those who will now be joining the PlayStation family , welcome !
They 're so controversial that , last week , the villagers of Broughton , England formed a human chain to stop a Google camera car from taking pictures of their houses .
They 're so controversial that , last week , the villagers of Broughton , England formed a human chain to stop a Google camera car from taking pictures of their houses .
Canada 's privacy commissioner is looking into the possibility that Google 's camera - equipped vehicles are violating Canada 's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act .
But this weekend , a fleet of Google Street View camera cars passed through Sault Ste. Marie , Ontario without even a whisper of reported protest .
" Hi Dave .
Thought you might be interested in who was in Sault Ste. Marie Saturday morning , " writes the faithful SooToday.com reader who snapped this photograph .
" I spotted six of these vehicles travelling together north on Great Northern Road , " our reader reports .
" I followed them as far as the Searchmont highway .
They continued north on 17 .
Only one of the cars had the Google logo on the door . "
" I saw the same cars , Friday evening 6:15 or so , travelling east into the city on Wellington right beside the Mac's at the corner of Wellington and Pine , " advises another reader , Carol Bumbacco .
" Only the first car had an identifying magnetic stick - on ' Google Maps . '
And , only two of the cars had their photographic , tracking devices in a vertical position on top of their cars .
" The other two were collapsed , laid down on top of the car roofs .
The interesting thing was , each driver had a computer in the front passenger seat , full screen .
I could see it .
Also , wireless headsets .
" The lead driver was talking when I stopped beside her on Wellington , at the corner of Pine .
They were driving Chev Cobalts , darker blues , " Bumbacco told us .
The street - level images , showing individual addresses , will eventually be posted on Google Maps .
Mashable , a popular news blog about social networking sites , has documented images of topless women sunbathing , men entering adult entertainment establishments and even apparent crimes - in - progress on Google Street View .

Google argues that it takes privacy concerns seriously .
" Street View only contains imagery from public roads , which is no different than what you might see driving down the street , " the company says on its Google Maps website .
" Imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world .
We are committed to respecting local laws and norms in each country in which we launch Street View .
" Blurring technology and operational controls like image removal are among the ways in which we ensure that an individual 's privacy is respected .
We make it easy for users to ask to have photographs of themselves , their children , their cars or their houses completely removed from the product , even where the images have already been blurred . "
To address privacy concerns , the company says it will use automated technology to blur faces that appear in Canadian Street View images .
Unlike the image taken by our reader , Google also intends to automatically blur licence plates here to protect the privacy of motorists .
Google announced late in March that it would be sending its controversial cars to film streetscapes in 11 Canadian cities : Calgary , Edmonton , Halifax , Montreal , Ottawa , Quebec City , Saint John , Saskatoon , Toronto , Vancouver and Winnipeg .

U.S. television coverage of the recent three - week conflict in the Gaza Strip failed to tell both sides of the story , according to a number of media analysts .
The most recent conflict between the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) and the Palestinian faction Hamas garnered some media attention , with an unusually large spike in coverage , but that level sank as the fighting dragged on .
During both the first and second weeks of the attack , including a massive aerial attack and a full - scale ground invasion of the tiny , densely - populated Gaza Strip , the conflict was the top story on the nightly newscasts of the three major U.S. networks ( ABC , CBS and NBC ) , where it got 55 minutes of total airtime .
But the first two weeks of fighting were " an aberration in terms of coverage by American broadcast networks , " said Andrew Tyndall , of the Tyndall Report , which monitors the weekday nightly newscasts from the three major U.S. broadcast networks .
" It ’s very rare for a foreign story to have that kind of status for two weeks . "
U.S. foreign news coverage has been on the decline .
In 2008 attention to international news was at its lowest since the Tyndall Report was first published in 1988 .
After the initial abnormal spike , however , coverage of Gaza fell significantly .
In the week of Jan. 12 , the last full week of fighting , the conflict was discussed for a total of 20 minutes by the three networks .
The amount of play a news story gets on television is particularly important because of the centrality of the medium in U.S. news .
In 2008 , some 70 percent of the public relied on television as a main source of national and international news , according to the latest survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press .
Network news has long been criticized as being too " soft " , providing more " infotainment " than actual news .
However , an estimated 23 million U.S. residents watch the 22 minutes of evening news that each of the networks broadcast on an average weekday evening .
Since the network news audience is 10 times larger than that of cable news networks , such as CNN , Fox News and MSNBC , it is no surprise that the views presented in the newscasts are often reflected in public opinion .
According to a recent survey released by CNN / Opinion Research Corporation , 60 percent of those questioned say they sympathize with Israelis in the Gaza conflict , with 17 percent backing the Palestinians .
Tyndall points out that while the number of sound bites of the conflict broadcast from the two sides was about equal , the use of quotes from official sources was not .
For every quotation by a Palestinian official , the three networks quoted 10 Israelis .
" Interviews with Israeli spokesmen and ambassadors were not juxtaposed with the voices of Palestinian leaders , " said Habib Battah , a freelance journalist writing for Al - Jazeera English .
In addition to disproportionate official representation , the grave disparity in casualties between the two sides was usually played down or not mentioned at all by newscasters .
Nearly 1,300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed in the conflict , which ended tentatively with separate ceasefires on Jan. 18 .
" When the number of deaths did appear [ in television news broadcasts ]  sometimes as a graphic at the bottom of the screen  it was identified as the number of ‘ people killed ’ rather than being attributed specifically to Palestinians , " said Battah .
The recent IDF incursion signaled the end of a tenuous Egypt - brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas , which has ruled the Gaza strip since 2006 .
In June , Hamas agreed to end attacks from Gaza on Israel .
In return , Israel agreed to halt raids inside Gaza and ease its blockade of the territory .
On Nov. 4 , Israel launched an air strike just inside Gaza ’s borders .
When Hamas responded , Israel retaliated to that attack .
The incident is regarded by some analysts , including a private Israeli intelligence group with apparent ties to its official counterpart , as the beginning of the end for the ceasefire .
The 22 - day war has garnered much attention from human rights groups .
Israel has been accused of illegally using white phosphorus shells , which cause extreme burns to the skin , near civilians .
It has denied this , saying an investigation found no evidence to support this claim .
Given the U.S. ’s long history of supporting Israel , the slanted media attention does not surprise many close followers of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
" The coverage is what you would expect , " said Peter Hart , activism director at Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) .
" There is a lot of pressure from pro-Israeli groups on media outlets . "
" The root of the problem is not the media , " said Dan Hallin , professor and chair of the Department of Communication at the University of California , San Diego .
" The problem is that politicians of both parties avoid any serious discussion of the issue .
The media reflect that silence .
It would be good if they tried to open up a little more space for debate , but this is not a role the media play by themselves very often . "
With so much reaction from both sides , journalists are finding it difficult to cover the conflict impartially .
Ethan Bronner , in a piece for the New York Times , writes , " Every time I write an article about the conflict that does not mirror [ the story line of Israel as the victim ]  if , for example , I focus on Palestinian suffering or alleged Israeli misdeeds or quote a human rights group like Amnesty International 
I have proven myself to be a secret sharer with the views of the enemy . "
" Every time I fail to allude to [ the other side of ] that story  when , for example , I examine Israel ’s goals in its Gaza war without implicitly condemning it as a massacre , or write about Israel in ways that do not call into question its legitimacy 
I have revealed my affiliation and can no longer be trusted as a reporter . "
George J. Mitchell , the new U.S. envoy to the Middle East , met with Israeli leaders on Wednesday .
He told the Los Angeles Times that the United States would " sustain an active commitment for reaching the goal of two states living side by side in peace and security . "
Leaving no questions about where the U.S. stood on this issue , he said , " The United States is committed to Israel ’s security and to its right to defend itself against legitimate threats . "
The mother of the New Jersey girl whose death inspired Megan 's Law is criticizing prosecutors who charge teenagers with child porn for distributing nude photos of themselves .
Maureen Kanka said Thursday that the prosecutors are harming the children more than helping them .
Her comments came as authorities in Passaic County charged a 14 - year - old girl with child pornography for posting nude photos of herself on MySpace.com .
If she is convicted , she would have to register with the state as a sex offender under Megan 's Law .
The laws generally require governments to alert neighbors of convicted sexual predators in their midst .
Kanka said the girl needs help , not legal trouble .
The girl 's name has been kept confidential because she 's a minor , but she allegedly posted 30 naked photos of herself on the social networking site .
Prompted by a tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , authorities investigated the case for a month before zeroing in on the suspect , who said she posted the pictures for her boyfriend ’s pleasure .
Anyone who was online “ friends ” with the girl through the site or knew her name could see the pictures .
The teen was charged with one count each of possession and distribution of child pornography .
Police remanded her into her mother ’s custody .
A sheriff ’s department spokesman told NorthJersey.com that more arrests in the case are possible .
* Illustration : Gretchen Smelter * " Obama sucks . "
When Barack Obama relaunched Whitehouse.gov in January , a cry went up from his supporters .
Obama had promised to take the democratized , wikified mojo of his campaign Web site — with its open - to - all discussion threads — to Pennsylvania Avenue .
But when the Whitehouse.gov blog went live with no way for the public to post comments on it , critics began carping .
The challenge Obama faces in allowing conversation at the digital White House is obvious : trolls .
Discussion - thread veterans will tell you that politics attracts more vicious , raging , insult - hurling trolls than almost any other topic .
So how can Obama truly liberate the White House site without having it go irretrievably toxic ?
How could we actually have a nationwide political discussion area ?
By tapping into new techniques for troll taming .
The world 's top discussion moderators have developed successful tools for keeping online miscreants from disrupting conversation .
All are rooted in one psychological insight :
If you simply ban trolls — kicking them off your board — you nurture their curdled sense of being an oppressed truth - speaker .
Instead , the moderators rely on making the comments less prominent .
Patient Zero here is Slashdot , the tech site that pioneered one elegant way to police trolls : crowdsourcing .
Slashdot has an automated system that randomly picks a handful of readers and gives them , for a day or so , the power to describe others ' comments with terms like " funny " or " off topic . "
Those descriptions are translated into a score from - 1 to 5 .
Readers can set their filters so they see only comments with high ratings — and trollery effectively vanishes .
One academic study found that the majority of Slashdot readers filter out comments rated 2 or lower .
Indeed , the concept of crowd - voting has worked so well that sites as high - traffic as the The New York Times now use it .
Here 's another hack : selective invisibility .
It was invented by Disqus , a company whose discussion software handles the threads at 90,000 blogs worldwide ( including mine ) .
In this paradigm , if a comment gets a lot of negative ratings , it goes invisible .
No one can see it — except , crucially , the person who posted it .
" So the troll just thinks that everyone has learned to ignore him , and he gets discouraged and goes away , " chuckles Disqus cofounder Daniel Ha .
My personal favorite innovation is disemvoweling , a technique pioneered by Teresa Nielsen Hayden , who moderates the discussion threads at the geek - culture blog Boing Boing .
Whenever Nielsen Hayden encounters a nasty post — an ad hominem attack , for example — she leaves it up but removes all the vowels : y r fckng sshl , for example .
The result is incoherent enough that it 's neutered , yet coherent enough that no one can cry censorship .
The comment has n't vanished .
Best of all , because disemvoweling is visible , it trains the community .
" You 're teaching the other commenters what the lines are by showing them comments that have stepped over the line , " Nielsen Hayden says .
Now , most veteran moderators will tell you that automated systems and crowdsourcing go only so far .
Most told me that if you 've got a high - volume site with political content — like Whitehouse.gov — you'll also need to moderate postings by hand , hiring staff to look over each comment and delete the truly crazy hate - speech ones .
The Huffington Post employs up to 25 people at a time to comb through its 35,000 comments a day .
If the White House were to use humans to filter posts , it could get into some dicey political situations .
If it were to outright ban them , it could draw First Amendment lawsuits .
So the genius of modern troll - taming techniques — leaving trollery intact , but mitigating its impact — neatly fits the bill .
Moderation software could grow even more sophisticated at the task , perhaps incorporating collaborative filtering tools that recommend the best posts based on your likes and dislikes .
Mr. President , bring on the trolls .
The commentosphere is ready for them .

Das Bundeskabinett hat heute morgen den " Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Bekämpfung der Kinderpornographie im Internet " verabschiedet .
Die wesentlichen inhaltlichen Aspekte und Neuerungen konnte man schon gestern anhand der geleakten Fassung u.a. bei heise und Thomas Stadler nachlesen .
Update : Eine gute Analyse gibt es heute auch bei Focus .
Die Kritik richtet sich derzeit vor allem auf drei Aspekte :
Die Bundesregierung geht von falschen Tatsachen bezüglich eines Massenmarkte für Kinderpornografie und der Verbreitungswege aus .
Die Sperren sind unwirksam und daher zunächst reine Symbolpolitik zu Beginn der Wahlkampfsaison .
Mittelfristig ist aber mit einer Verschärfung der technischen Zugangserschwernisse zu rechnen , etwa durch DPI - Filter und ähnliches .
Daher ist dies der Einstieg in eine Zensur - Infrastruktur .
Die Sperrlisten werden vom BKA zusammengestellt , das damit Ermittler , Ankläger und Richter in einem ist – ohne demokratische oder gerichtliche Kontrolle .
Zudem soll es die Zugriffe auf die gesperrten Seiten bei den Providern abfragen dürfen .
Justizministerin (!)
Brigitte Zypries hat in der Pressekonferenz gleich noch die Unschuldsvermutung abgeschafft für Leute , die aus Versehen oder als Opfer einer gezielten Falle ( Rickrolling , anyone ? ) auf die Stopp - Seiten geraten :
" Eine Strafbarkeit liege schon in dem Moment vor , wenn nicht nachgewiesen werden könne , dass es sich um ein Versehen oder eine automatische Weiterleitung gehandelt habe . "
Reaktionen
Spreeblick protestiert mit einem Online - Streik .
Tragt euch ein !
Kai Biermann kommentiert in der ZEIT : " Keine Allmacht für das BKA ! "
Heise zitiert unter anderen Kritikern den Informationsrechtler Prof. Dr. Thomas Hoeren von der Uni Münster : Er
sprach gegenüber heise online von einer " Sauerei " , dass es nun doch um die Aufzeichnung von IP - Adressen gehe .
Noch vor einer
Woche habe das Bundesfamilienministerium das Gegenteil versichert .
Die Erfassung personenbezogener Daten bezeichnete der Rechtsprofessor als " schweren Eingriff ins Fernmeldegeheimnis " , dem nicht durch ein reines " Zitieren " der entsprechenden Normen zur Einschränkung von Grundrechten Genüge getan werden könne .
Der AK gegen Internetsperren und Zensur ( AK Zensur ) hat eine Pressemitteilung veröffentlicht :
AK Zensur fordert : Täter verfolgen statt Grundrechte beugen Der Arbeitskreis gegen Internet - Sperren und Zensur ( AK Zensur ) erklärt zum Gesetzentwurf der Bundesregierung zu Internet - Sperren : Der Bundesregierung geht es bei dem Gesetzentwurf zu den geplanten Internetsperren nicht um die effektive Bekämpfung der Kinderpornographie .
Sie betreibt Wahlkampf auf Kosten missbrauchter Kinder , schützt die Täter , vernachlässigt die Strafverfolgung und initiiert eine grundgesetzwidrige Internet - Zensur - Infrastruktur unter Kontrolle des BKA .
Es ist nur eine Frage der Zeit , bis auf der Sperrliste auch weitere missliebige Internet - Inhalte stehen .
Der Gesetzenwurf sieht auch eine Sperrung von Webseiten aus Deutschland und anderen europäischen Ländern vor .
Auch auf den bekannten Sperrlisten in Skandinavien stehen Webseiten aus Deutschland .
Diese sind der Bundesregierung und dem BKA seit Monaten bekannt .
Es wäre problemlos möglich , die Server abzuschalten und die Inhalte aus dem Netz zu entfernen , statt sie nur mit einer relativ leicht umgehbaren Sperre zu belegen .
Warum wurden die Server bisher nicht abgeschaltet , warum wird die Strafverfolgung unterlassen ?
Die Begründung des Gesetzesentwurfs geht von falschen Voraussetzungen aus : Es gibt keine Hinweise darauf , dass Kinderpornographie im Internet ein kommerzieller Massenmarkt ist .
Kinderpornographie im Internet zeichnet sich nicht durch offene Verfügbarkeit aus .
Nahezu alle der in ausländischen Sperrlisten verzeichneten Server stehen in Ländern , in denen Strafverfolgung durchaus möglich wäre .
Viele davon auch in Deutschland und anderen EU - Staaten .
Die neuen Sperr - Regelungen werden im Telemediengesetz hinzugefügt und nicht in einem eigenen Gesetz behandelt .
So können sie leicht auf weitere Inhalte ausgedehnt werden .
Die geheime Sperrliste des BKA unterliegt keiner rechtsstaatlichen Kontrolle – die Gewaltenteilung scheint aufgehoben : das BKA wird zu Ermittler , Ankläger und Richter in einem .
Es wird zu einer unkontrollierbaren Zensur - Behörde .
Entgegen der Ankündigung von vergangenem Freitag sollen Daten von Nutzern , die auf die Stopp - Seiten gelangen , gespeichert werden .
Dies ist nicht nur datenschutzrechtlich bedenklich , [ 4 ] sondern bietet Kriminellen auch ganz neue Möglichkeiten , um Unschuldige in den Verdacht des Konsums kinderpornographischer Darstellungen zu bringen .
Die Bundesregierung will Kindesmissbrauch ausblenden anstatt ganz aus dem Internet zu nehmen .
Der AK Zensur fordert hingegen die Täter mit den bestehenden Rechtsmitteln zu verfolgen , die auch in der überwiegenden Mehrheit der Quelländer vorhanden sind .
So bekämpft man das Übel nachhaltig an der Wurzel und kann auf eine grundrechtswidrige Placebo - Lösung verzichten .
Der Schleswig-Holsteinische Landesdatenschutzbeauftragte
Thilo Weichert protestiert gegen die Speicherung der Zugriffe auf gesperrte Seiten :
Die nun bekannt gewordenen Planungen haben ( … ) eine völlig neue Überwachungsdimension :
Mit dem Speichern der Zugriffsversuche würde eine Vorverlagerung der Verdachtsgewinnung zur Bekämpfung der Kinderpornografie erfolgen , die Zigtausende von absolut unschuldigen Menschen zu Verdächtigen machen würde : Allein der Umstand , dass eine Internetadresse angeklickt wird , wird zum Ermittlungsansatz wegen Kinderpornografie genommen .
Damit würde sich jeder Internetnutzer schon der Gefahr einer Strafverfolgung aussetzen , wenn er eine ihm noch nicht bekannte Adresse aufruft , da er nicht wissen kann , ob diese Adresse selbst gelistet ist oder ob diese auf eine gelistete Adresse automatisch weiterleitet .
Die Süddeutsche hat übrigens einen interessanten Artikel über den Konflikt zwischen Brigitte Zypries und Ursula von der Leyen .

US government short $ 1.2 trillion to pay its own retirees ' healthcare John Byrne
Published : Monday February 16 , 2009

There may yet be more bailouts in sight .
Next time it might not be the banks -- it might be your retirement , and there might not be enough money left .
While it 's relatively well - known that Social Security is short as much as $ 50 trillion needed to pay the benefits of future retirees , the shortfall needed to pay civil servants ' retiree benefits -- split between the federal government and US states -- is a whopping $ 1.7 trillion , according to an estimate released Monday .
State and local governments have set aside " virtually no money " to fund medical benefits for retired state and federal employees , USA Today revealed .
The estimate has gotten almost no attention , but the unfunded toll continues to climb .
While the US government can spend money it does n't have in an effort to jumpstart the economy , many cities and states have laws requiring them to balance their budgets , meaning the only way they could meet retirement benefit mandates is to raise taxes or cut benefits and services , or both .
Such unfunded medical benefits includes those of city , state and town employees ; teachers ; principals ; superintendents ; librarians ; administrative assistants ; custodians ; school district staff ; judges ; public attorneys ; retired military personnel ; federal employees ; park rangers ; and water district personnel .
On the federal side , the cost totals around $ 1.2 trillion -- which includes retirement benefits for the Pentagon and for the federal government , the report says .
On the states ' side , the cost is harder to estimate but is at least $ 500 billion , according to the report .
Despite a $ 787 billion stimulus package , little money has been allocated to long - term benefits .
In the 1980s , the federal government and other employers of civil servants exchanged pay raises for future medical benefits , the report notes .
But that tradeoff may end up costing the states and government more .
The paper says states are :
* " Cutting health benefits .
Most governments have the legal authority to reduce or end retiree health coverage  unlike pensions , which can not be cut under most states ' laws .
When Rhode Island trimmed retiree medical benefits in October , 1,291 workers  9 percent of the state 's workforce  retired to keep the more generous old health plan . "
* " Saving money .
Alaska , Minnesota , Pennsylvania and Utah are among states that set aside some money last year to prepare for future medical costs . "
Hawaii , meanwhile , plans to slash medical benefits for state and county employees .
One plan eyes cutting benefits until a retiree reaches Medicare age , 10 years from when the plan originally kicked in -- at 55 .
" That throws everyone 's financial planning off , and at this late stage for someone who is 50 , 55 years old , what do you do ? " one critic said .
" What options are you left with , because medical care is not free . "

Spectacular columns are spewing out of the sea about 6 miles from the southwest coast off the main Tongan island of Tongatapu .
Kenny Meyers , right , an iPhone user from Seattle , is not thrilled with AT&T 's network performance in Austin during South by Southwest .
His co-worker Nick Finck says AT&T " should have figured the scalability " for the crush of iPhone users at SXSW .
Photo : Jim Merithew / Wired.comAUSTIN , Texas — AT&T 's 3G coverage map for Austin may look rock solid , but turns out there was n't enough connectivity goodness to sate the hordes of iPhone - wielding geeks who descended on this artsy Texas town for the South by Southwest conference this weekend .
Was the Verizon and Sprint crowd , usually consigned to the kid 's table at these hip mob scenes , having the last laugh ?
Attendees with their beloved iPhone 3G handsets hoping to hook up with friends , find the next party or access Twitter to announce their location are encountering dropped calls , unavailable service or molasses - slow web access from the mobile service provider .
Tens of thousands of conference - goers in town for the interactive and film segments of the annual festival have put a noticeable strain on both AT&T's 3G and Edge networks .
" It works like ass , " said Kenny Meyers , a 25 - year - old web developer from Seattle who works for Blue Flavor .
" That 's because everyone and their mother has [ an iPhone ] now . "
Tech - centered events flooded with geeks , like South by Southwest Interactive taking place here this weekend , put a heavy load on communication infrastructures in general .
But AT&T 's shortcoming in downtown Austin presents a particularly painful problem for iPhone users , who are locked in to their multiyear contracts with the carrier , which has an exclusive deal with Apple for the popular gadget .
Scott Beale , geek blogger and founder of San Francisco web hosting company Laughing Squid , who 's visiting Austin for the conference , was so fed up with the lousy service that he left the hopping Digg.com party Saturday night to find an area where he could make calls and send tweets .
" I literally said , ' I 'm going to leave this party and walk until I get coverage , ' " he said .
Much as in years past , Twitter has been extremely popular among
SXSWers .
This year , Twitter is mature enough that nearly everyone at the conference is using the service , and it has proved to be an invaluable tool for coordinating social activities .
Also making its debut this week at SXSW is the new location - aware iPhone app
Foursquare , which announces a user 's location and encourages friends to find them .
All that wonderful tech is moot when your iPhone can't get a signal .
" We have all these great tools at our disposal , but we can't use them , " Beale said .
Update : Mark Siegel , a spokesman for AT&T 's wireless business , told Wired.com on Sunday that the carrier is " very sorry " if anyone experienced any difficulty using its service at SXSW , and said the company is seeking a solution .
" Wireless service depends on a number of issues , " Siegel said , " including proximity to cellular sites , the number of people contending for resources in a given area , the strength of the signal in the area and a number of other factors . "
Seigel said AT&T and other providers often bring in cell - sites on wheels , or COWs , to shore up local service around major events like the Super Bowl and the presidential inauguration .
He said AT&T is definitely going to look into improving the service around SXSW in the future , but could not say if the service would be beefed up before this year 's conference is over .
Anecdotal reports on the streets of Austin and from frustrated Twitter users indicate the problem is widespread for iPhone users .
People using devices on other wireless networks reported that their service was good during SXSW .
Ironically , Wi-Fi connectivity , which is usually scarce or unusably slow at big conferences like SXSW , has been close to perfect at the
Austin Convention Center , the show 's primary venue .
" The SXSW wireless is working well , " said Blue Flavor 's Meyers , who noted that AT&T 's service works well after the day 's parties slow down .
" At 3 in the morning , it works fine , " he said .
Ben Bacon says his iPhone has been on " E , " for Edge , ever since he got to SXSW .
Photo : Jim Merithew / Wired.comBen Bacon , marketing manager for Level 3 Communications , said he 's been kicked down to AT&T 's slower Edge network rather than the 3G service .
" Ever since I landed in Austin , it says ' E ' [ for Edge ] , ' " he said of his degraded service .
" I wish it was a little faster , " said Bacon , 32 , who lives in Broomfield , Colorado .
" I wish it was 4 or 5G . "

When I was going to college in Vancouver in 1989 my mother came to visit me .
While she was staying with me we decided to go to Dr. Sun Yat Sen Chinese Garden which had recently opened in Vancouver .
It was built using the traditional techniques used during the Ming period in China .
While were there admiring and learning about the construction we spotted a low shrub like tree with an enormous bizarre seedpod hanging from it .
The seedpod had split open and the brilliant vermilion seeds were exposed and some of them were hanging down on sticky threads .
We asked what kind of plant it was and were told it was a Magnolia .
Magnolias which are very common in this area .
Many spectacular Magnolias blooming at this time of the year owe their parentage in part to the Magnolia kobus ( Kobushi Magnolia ) and there is a spectacular Kobus Magnolia at Dominion Brook Park which I eagerly look forward to seeing in bloom each year , and the time is now !
When I was in School at that time we spent a lot of time at Park & Tilford Garden where we did our practicum and has a large collection of other Magnolias .
There I was able to study many Magnolia species but not the Kobus Magnolia .
I stumbled upon the one I am writng about because I frequently go to visit local parks searching for wonderful plant specimens to photograph .
The location of this Magnolia kobus is hard to miss when it is flower .
It ’s located next to the sunken garden which is across from the main pond .
Magnolias are fascinating as they look like they come from a different age and they do , they are older than most plants that inhabit the earth .
They are thought to have evolved in the Tertiary period 2 to 65 million years ago .
They are a more primitive plant as their flowers attest to .
Magnolias are unusual in that they have tepals which are neither petals or sepals ( confused yet ? ) , but look just like petals .
The flower stamens and pistols are arranged in rings which encircle the stigmatic column where the seed is produced .
Magnolias evolved over millions of years when there were only beetles to do the pollination .
Beetle pollinated flowers are generally very large , white pink or red in color and have copious amounts of pollen which is a rich food source for them .
They usually do not have nectar or fragrance ( some Magnolias including kobus have a light scent ) .
The thick unusual seedpod carpals are designed to protect the embryonic seeds from the beetles .
Kobus or Kobushi Magnolia is a common tree throughout Japan and is found locally on the island of Cheju - do ( Quelpart Island ) on the southern coast of South Korea .
This Magnolia was introduced in to North America first in 1861 by Dr. George Hall of Rhode Island .
Other seeds where later sent to Arnold Arboretum in 1876 which had been collected from trees in Sapporo by William Clark .
Magnolia kobus was finally brought to England in 1879 by Charles Maries , the famous plant explorer .
The seed he brought back were grown at the world renowned Veitch ’s Nursery .
The different seed sources has lead to the variability in the species in cultivation which I have seen here in Victoria .
Magnolia kobus are are probably the most spectacular of hardy all hardy trees with their fantastic blossoms .
Thiss is a good tree to select for home gardens as it is smaller than many other Magnolias .
It is particularly hardy for Magnolias and is known to withstand temperatures of - 30 c ( - 25 f ) for short period , but is safer to plant no lower than zone 5 .
Kobus Magnolia are also more tolerant of different types of soil , only suffering when planted in thin dry soils .
It is best if they have deep , moisture retentive soils which are humusy .
These are forest trees which prefer part shade but can grow in full sun .
You have to be patient for the first bloom as these trees are usually 12 or 15 before they first bloom .
One thing you have to keep in mind with all Magnolias is they have very brittle roots and do not like being moved so much care must be taken in the process of choosing a site and planting .
Later the fragile roots can be damaged by careless cultivation under the tree .

Until We meet Again ….
LA GLORIA , Mexico ( CNN ) --
Tucked away in this small mountain village in Mexico , off a dusty road flanked by pig farms , is where the earliest case of swine flu -- a virus spreading globally -- was confirmed .
Five - year - old Edgar Hernandez , known as " patient zero , " survived the earliest documented case of swine flu .
Meet the child known as " patient zero " by his doctors -- 5 - year - old Edgar Hernandez , who survived the earliest documented case of swine flu in an outbreak that , officials say , has now spread across four continents .
His family lives in the 3,000 - population village of La Gloria in the state of Veracruz , where a flu outbreak was reported on April 2 .
State officials arrived and tested dozens of people .
Lab tests confirmed that Edgar was the only patient in Veracruz to test positive for the swine flu virus ; the others had contracted a common flu .
Health officials had returned to Edgar 's sample only after cases of the new flu strain were spotted around the country .
Watch Dr. Gupta meet little Edgar »
" In this case , there 's a patient who turned out to be positive for the swine - flu virus , with the exception that at that time in no region of the world it had been established as an etiological , epidemic cause , " said Mexico Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova .
Edgar has managed to bounce back from his symptoms and playfully credits ice cream for helping him feel better .
His mother blamed a huge pig farm in the neighborhood for the virus .
Officials have conducted tests at the farm owned by U.S. company Smithfield Foods , and those tests came back negative .
Swine influenza , or flu , is a contagious respiratory disease that affects pigs .
When the flu spreads person to person , instead of from animals to humans , it can continue to mutate , making it harder to treat or fight , because people have no natural immunity .
Symptoms include fever , runny nose , sore throat , nausea , vomiting and diarrhea .
Learn more about swine flu and how to treat it »
Common seasonal flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people every year worldwide , far more than the current outbreak of swine flu .
But there is no vaccine for this new disease , and little natural immunity , an expert said .
" I think the reason to be concerned is ... we had a vaccine for regular flu , " said Dr. Carlos del Rio of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta , Georgia .
" This is a totally new virus .
...
You have a virus to which there 's no pre-vaccination , there 's no prior immunity .
And , therefore , the mortality rate may be higher than other influenza viruses . "
Watch why swine flu is a " sloppy virus " »
Researchers do not know how the virus is jumping relatively easily from person to person , or why it 's affecting what should be society 's healthiest demographic .
Meanwhile , in hard - hit Mexico City , the government closed universities , postponed sporting events , asked restaurants to serve only take - out food , and canceled church services in an effort to try to stem the spread of the virus .
Worried residents continue to flood in night and day at hospitals , only to be turned away by armed guards .
Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta inside a Mexico City hospital »
Two of the most common antiviral drugs , Tamiflu and Relenza -- which are effective against swine flu -- are in short supply in Mexico 's capital .
It also has become impossible to find protective surgical masks , which the government had handed out to one out of every five residents .
" I was looking for a mask at my local pharmacy , but they sold out , " supermarket worker Rafael Martinez said as he rode the subway .
" I know it 's a risk , but I can't find one . "
CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in La Gloria , Mexico , contributed to this report .

Consensus at the November meeting of the National Academy of Public Administration about government funding for services provided by nonprofits was rather bleak .
State budget improvements in some states do not mean that state governments have recovered .
In 2014 , total spending for all 50 states fell below its peak in 2008 .
This is partially due to the ongoing cuts in federal discretionary spending , a trajectory that is likely to continue unless the Budget Control Act is amended .
One speaker opined that if the Budget Control Act and its arbitrary , across - the - board cuts policy known as “ sequestration ” remain in effect , non-defense domestic discretionary spending will drop below the lowest level in the modern era .
Much of the funding for the services that nonprofits provide in communities comes from discretionary grants from the federal government to state and local governments , which in turn contract or grant with nonprofits .
Are there health benefits which should convince you to circumcise your child ?
Just ask the public health authorities .
None of them recommends routine child circumcision .
( For comparison , consider that public health institutions strongly advocate the routine vaccination of children . )
Many years ago , when it was thought important to prevent masturbation , American health authorities began to advocate child circumcision .
There is no longer any national or international public health authority in the western world which advocates the routine circumcision of children , either male or female .
The American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) is the highest child health authority in the United States .
On 1 March 1999 the AAP released its long - awaited recommendations on circumcision .
The AAP News Release Video stated , “ The AAP does not recommend the policy of routine newborn circumcision … ”
Institution Advocates Circumcision American Medical Association No American Cancer Society No Center for Disease Control No National Institute of Health No American Academy of Pediatrics No Pediatric Urologists Association No Amer. College of Obst. & Gyn .
No other countries Canadian Pediatric Society No Canadian Medical Association No European Medical Societies ( any ) No
All of these public health authorities take seriously their responsibility to protect your child ’s health .
None of them advise you to circumcise your child .
Especially in America , there is still a class of doctors who profit from this surgery and strongly recommend that you subject your child to it .
Their influence has given many American parents the impression that child circumcision is in the same category of recommended medical procedures as child vaccination .
Parents have to look at the issue carefully to see this is not the case .
When your doctor tries to sell you surgery that is not recommended by ANY public health authority , you should be suspicious .
Needless to say , this caution goes double for needless surgery on your children .
Next , the historical basis of circumcision in America .

LA PAZ , Bolivia ( CNN ) -- A 3 - year - old Bolivian girl whose parents thought was dead and were preparing to bury remained in a coma but was improving Friday , while her mother and stepfather were being held on abuse charges , a hospital official said .
The girl is suffering from a head injury , contusions throughout her body and burns on her face , said Jose Carlos Camacho , director of Hospital Universitario Japones in Santa Cruz .
" She is improving , " Camacho told CNN on Friday .
" Yesterday she was able to take liquids orally .
She is waking up but remains critical . "
The girl 's parents thought she was dead and held a six - hour wake Monday when a neighbor noticed she showed signs of life and took her to a medical center , the Santa Cruz , Bolivia , newspaper El Deber said on its Web site .
The girl 's stepfather , Gumercindo Ali Mamani , 20 , and mother , Lucia Chana , 22 , appeared in court Tuesday and were ordered held on abuse charges , the newspaper said .
Their 3 - month - old son was placed in protective custody .
The severity of the girl 's coma is rated about 14 or 15 on a 15 - point scale , in which 15 is the best , Camacho said .
A patient is usually placed on life - support machinery at 8 on the scale , said Camacho , who is also a surgeon .
The girl suffered a subdural hematoma , a traumatic injury in which blood pools between two protective layers of the brain , but did not require surgery , Camacho said .
A subdural hematoma can result from a blow to the head or from shaking .
Doctors expect the girl to remain in intensive care for about another week before she can be moved to intermediate care .
According to El Deber , the stepfather asked for forgiveness but the mother only said that the girl was often restless .

Family doctor ' sat female patient on his knee and told her cuddles were better than medicine '
Claims : Dr Paul Hirschowitz is said to have sat a female patient on his lap and told her : ' Something happens to a man when a woman sits on his knee '
A family doctor pulled a patient on to his lap and told her : ' Something happens to a man when a woman sits on his knee ' , a hearing was told .
Dr Paul Hirschowitz is also said to have stroked the woman 's face and told her cuddles were better than medicine .
The former Israeli army doctor is accused of sexually - motivated behaviour towards three female patients .
But yesterday he failed to turn up to a disciplinary hearing of the General Medical Council which could decide to strike him off .
The panel heard that Dr Hirschowitz , 51 , was working as a GP at the Norwood House Surgery in Scarborough .
Bernadette Baxter , representing the GMC , said three female patients became concerned about the intimacy he showed during consultations .
The woman he pulled onto his lap was being treated for depression , but the incident happened after the mother of two went to him simply seeking a reference for a house move .
The hearing was told she was ' confused ' by what had happened and wrote to the doctor about it .
Her letter was opened by a member of staff at the surgery , however .
Baxter said that during a consultation with Patient A he sat very close to her and told her she was a very ' attractive ' woman .
Patient A said she had gone to see the doctor because she was pregnant , was suffering from morning sickness and wanted an abortion .
' He started to explain what would happen when I went to the hospital which I did n't ask him to do .
' He said I was a good looking girl and he understood why I was n't having the baby .
I got up to walk out of the room , he was rubbing himself down there .
' He did it twice , when he was sitting and then when he was standing he did it again , he shouted ' Hey ' to get me to turn around .
' I was in a state of shock , it was like he could n't control himself .
He said I had a nice a**e .
I told my partner straight away .
He was waiting for me outside the door because I had been so long .
It was just totally wrong - it was just wrong . '
A third woman known as Patient B and who suspected she was pregnant was given an examination of her abdomen , back and legs and offered an internal examination when it was not indicated she needed one in advance .
Patient C told the hearing Dr Hirschowitz had become more like a friend than a doctor during their consultations .
He stroked her hand and face on a number of occasions and would end every visit with a cuddle , she claimed .
She said : ' He opened his arms and scooped me in .
He would say ' cuddles are better than medicine , it will keep you stronger ' .
The woman , who was suffering from depression , visited his surgery in March 2007 to ask him to write a reference for a house move .
At the end of the consultation he grabbed the mother - of - two and pulled her towards him .
She said : ' I went to stand up and he pulled me down into his lap .
I was sprawled across his knee , which was a bit weird .
It felt all wrong .
Then he put his hands round me in a bear hug . '
He then told her : ' Something happens to a man when a woman sits on his knee . '
After the consultation Patient C was confused and decided to write a letter to the doctor before delivering it to the surgery .
Patient C wrote to Dr Hirschowitz : ' Hi Paul , I hope you are well .
Gosh !
What was Wednesday like ?
We both crossed the patient / doctor line .
' I have never sat on a doctor 's knee before and I am sure you have never had an adult patient sit on your knee before .
You are a fine and handsome man .
' I know you are a married man but please let 's try to make sense of this .
We could meet for a coffee sometime this week ? '
Patient C said she had no romantic feelings for Dr Hirschowitz , but was flattered by the attention after a number of abusive relationships .
But the doctor 's behaviour was discovered out when the letter was inadvertently opened by a member of staff at the surgery .
Hirschowitz denies misconduct .
The hearing continues .
AMD and Seagate have jointly demonstrated the first SATA3 hard drive in public , and are promising compatible chipsets and shipping hard drives by the end of 2009 .
SATA3 will maintain full compatibility with SATA and SATA2 — all current motherboards and drive cables should flawlessly support SATA3 drives , though you 'll need a SATA3 - compatible chipset in order to take advantage of the new standard 's 6 Gbps throughput .
In the past , the raw throughput gained by moving from one hard drive standard to another has been relatively unimportant .
An announcement that theoretical drive bandwidth had doubled from 1.5 Gbps ( SATA ) to 3 Gbps ( SATA2 ) makes for great copy , but anyone familiar with the mechanics of a hard drive knows that standard HDD throughput typically could n't saturate SATA , much less SATA2 .
The real benefit of new drive standards has typically come from those features that take second billing — thinner cables , smaller connectors , hot swappability , Native Command Queuing ( NCQ ) , and improved power management .
The advent of SSDs , however , changes everything .
Unlike mechanical drives , solid state drives are capable of saturating current transfer standards under certain conditions .
This time , doubling throughput could have a noticeable impact on just how fast the drive can move data from point A to point B. Expect this to become a major marketing point once SATA3 connectors and drives become available — with the economy in recession , motherboard and SSD / HDD manufacturers are going to seize on anything they can possibly find to push new product out the door .
SATA3 might not particularly matter for a modern hard drive , but that 's not going to stop an OEM from pretending that it does .
Seagate and AMD demonstrated SATA3 vs. SATA2 using two Seagate Barracuda 7200.12 and AMD prototype SATA3 controllers .
Test results showed the current SATA2 drive at 2.5 Gbps and the SATA3 drive at 5.5 GBps .
Keep in mind that these test results almost certainly do not reflect ( or attempt to reflect ) real - world usage conditions .
The 7200.12 series carries up to 32 MB of onboard cache — if the test data is streamed directly out of cache , than yes , the difference between the two standards will come into play .
AMD and Seagate , of course , are n't highlighting that fact .
" AMD strives to deliver platform technology that our technology partners can use to create high - performance desktop and laptop PCs , " said Leslie Sobon , vice president of Product Marketing , AMD .
" The new SATA 6 Gb / second technology not only incorporates the best features of previous SATA generations but also includes new enhancements .
This innovation enables AMD to continue to evolve its technology platforms and to develop low - cost designs that our technology partners can use to improve their own PC and laptop products . "
The new enhancements Sobon refers to include improved NCQ performance and better power management / efficiency .
The two companies declined to provide any numbers for either feature .
SATA3 could be the standard that allows future SSDs to hit new performance highs as well as equalize internal and external transfer speeds .
USB has long been the dominant external data transfer standard — with FireWire all but deprecated and USB3 presumably carrying the high CPU usage of the USB standard series forward , eSATA ( 3 ) could emerge as the external connection of choice .

To keep myself very productive and to make full use of my laptop , I bought some laptop gadgets and peripherals that not only help me to do more work , but to do it more efficiently , more fun and with less worries in my mind .
Among these accessories are some necessities such as a keyboard cover , to protect it from dust and stains , and a sturdier laptop bag ( since the one that came with it is a bit frail ) .
I have also bought some accessories that help improve its portability and usability , including an extra battery that has more life than the stock battery , and a portable printer that allows me to print documents on the go .
You may also want to check out the new Sony VAIO VGN - T350P – it has the world ’s first ‘ Cellular Modem Built In ’ – access the internet thru your cell phone .
It has an Integrated EDGE , Wi-Fi , and Bluetooth for the ultimate in wireless networking .
Global Connectivity – Yes , you definitely need this one to connect your laptop across the globe .
What ’s the use of having a laptop if internet or connectivity needs confines you to a desk ?
Do go in for a wireless connection , with Wi-Fi locators and equally enhanced wireless Wi -Fi routers .
First , we need to know that the meaning of the depth of discharge which is the most common term related to laptop battery life .
The depth of discharge refers to how far the battery has been discharged before it is recharged .
Some people keep using their laptops with their power supply .
In such situation , there is no the depth of discharge .
On the other hand , some people will sometimes use their batteries until they are completely drained out .
Both of these ways are not completely correct .
You ’d better take the battery out of the laptop when you make the power supply connected .
But remember to take the battery to charge and use in a certain time and do n’t leave the battery lying there for a long time .
If your groomsmen are all tech - savvy , you can limit your choice of gifting ideas to some tech items .
You can give your groomsmen cute and trendy iPod or laptop accessories , iTunes coupons , gadgets , electronic organizers , and the like .
Moreover , if you are going to travel with more than one laptop , you should make labels that which cable that match with which laptop , and you should put the labels on them .
At last , you can easily find the cables that you need .
You can also do this by storing the string in a Ziploc plastic bag before you mark them .
A major factor when choosing wireless ones is compatibility .
If your laptop offers wireless technology like Bluetooth , the best option would be buying Bluetooth laptop speakers .
These portable speakers connect to the Bluetooth emitter of your laptop , and they are usually plug and play .
Most Bluetooth laptop speakers can work with other Bluetooth devices like mp3 or mp4 players .
It ’s a good idea to check the manufacturer ’s description to see what laptops or other electronic devices they are compatible with .
Why not treat your sporty groomsmen to a basketball game or a football game ?
Game tickets make excellent gifts .
You can also order some customized key chains that feature their favorite team or players .
Another groomsmen gift idea for sporty people is some are sports collectibles – miniature bobble heads of the sports ( players ) they like , shot glasses , mugs , t- shirts , basket and many other gifts .
The proposed anti-filesharing legislation in New Zealand has got more than its fair share of press recently but unfortunately for the music industry , most of it has been bad .
However , the head of New Zealand 's answer to the RIAA says everyone has it wrong , insisting Section 92A is a " reasonable " response .
Last year , the New Zealand government passed ‘ 3 - strike ’ legislation which was designed to have alleged copyright infringers disconnected from the Internet .
In February a code of practice was drafted by the music industry and ISPs which attempted to lay out how the ISPs would go about disconnecting people .
Considering that the legislation received almost universal opposition from anyone not in the music business , it came as no surprise that the parties involved could n’t come to an agreement .
Prime Minister John
Key announced that the law would be delayed while a solution is found , noting that they may have to change the law in order to reach one .
But according to Campbell Smith , CEO of RIANZ ( New Zealand ’s answer to the RIAA ) everyone complaining about the legislation is wrong and the music industry is right .
Writing in The New Zealand Herald , Smith says that despite the ‘ fact ’ that the industry has “ transformed its business models ” , unlicensed music on the Internet is proving a disincentive to those looking to sell music online .
Smith says that the music industry has been working hard to find “ proportionate and reasonable solutions ” to tackle illicit file - sharing .
Noting that in some countries labels take legal action against those uploading music , Smith says that Section 92A “ is a better solution for everyone , ” although do n’t be surprised if that “ everyone ” is limited to those in the music industry .
Smith says that after looking long and hard for a solution to the ‘ problem ’ , the industry realized that ISPs are in a “ unique position to help us protect creative content online , ” and feels that it ’s the government ’s responsibility to force these negotiations on the ISPs , despite the fact that the ISPs are n’t happy about it at all .
Seems everyone has a responsibility to the music industry – like it or not .
Turning to what he describes as “ sensational propaganda ” surrounding Section 92A in the press recently , Smith says that if the law was half as bad as is being reported , he would vote against it himself .
Now that would be a sensation .
Going on to the tracking mechanics , he explained that the process of catching an infringer is simple .
The labels will log on to public file - sharing ‘ sites ’ and log the IP addresses of people uploading large amounts of copyright infringing material and report them to their ISP .
Further details of how the entire system would operate can be found here .
From a BitTorrent perspective , it will not be as easy to track people sharing vast amounts of music as it is with applications such as LimeWire , since there is no ‘ shared folder ’ .
It ’s doubtful that the labels will be as selective as they are suggesting , though .
Many of the infringement notices being sent out in the UK right now are for just one track and if the labels are pinning all of their hopes on this new system , expect there to be lots and lots of them in New Zealand too .
Smith says that consumers need to be reassured that what is being done is “ efficient and proportionate ” but it ’s difficult to see why any ‘ consumer ’ should appreciate the fact that privately owned businesses should have a veto over their continued Internet access , or feel that such action is “ proportionate ” .
Content creators do have the right to protect their work , as much is written in law , but threats and disconnections are n’t going to work .
Not only are the public annoyed at the actions of the music industry , but ISPs are being dragged into this ‘ war ’ too .
Expect things to get even more messy .
A few years down the road , you may be able to get that scratch out of your car ’s bumper simply by parking in a sunny spot .
Researchers have created a polyurethane coating that heals itself when exposed to ultraviolet light .
" This new material will have a lot of practical applications , " said study co-author Marek Urban , a chemist at the University of Southern Mississippi .
“ It could coat anything that can be scratched — electronics , aircraft , cars , you name it . "
Self - healing coatings could minimize upkeep and repair on a variety of products , saving consumers money and reducing waste .
“ Your car would last for a long time , and it would look new for a long time , ” Urban said .
The new compound is not the first man-made self - healing material .
In 2001 , researchers at the University of Illinois embedded tiny liquid - filled capsules in a polymer coating .
When the coating cracked , the capsules ruptured , spilling healing agents into the damaged area and repairing it .
One of the Illinois scientists , Scott White , founded a company based on this technology in 2005 .
Autonomic Materials , Inc. could have self - healing coatings on the market in the next couple of months , according to a recent article in the MIT Technology Review .
Other researchers have devised different methods .
In 2002 , scientists from UCLA and USC created a compound that heals itself quickly when exposed to high temperatures .
The new coating is similar in that it requires an external stimulus to work .
But the stimulus — UV radiation — should not be difficult to introduce .
A few minutes in the sun would do the trick .
“ It ’s a new healing chemistry for polyurethane , ” said Nancy Sottos , a materials scientist at the University of Illinois who was not involved in the new study .
Urban and co-author Biswajit Ghosh , also of the University of Southern Mississippi , created the compound by mixing chitosan — a derivative of chitin , the main component of arthropod exoskeletons — into polyurethane .
They made tiny nicks in the new material , then exposed it to UV light about as intense as that given off by the sun .
The radiation set off a series of reactions , causing damaged molecules to link up with each other again .
The cuts healed in about 30 minutes .
This repair process , described Thursday in the journal Science , is not moisture - sensitive , meaning it should work in all climates .
And making the new coating wo n’t break the bank , according to Urban .
“ It ’s very economical , ” he said .
“ You can get chitosan for almost nothing . ”
The mending reactions do n’t seem to work a second time , so each part of the coating can repair itself only once .
But Urban does n’t see this as much of a drawback in the real world .
“ Even if you try to hit the same spot , within a couple of microns , statistically the chances of it happening are very small , ” he said .

The Dems who bucked Obama
Nearly all of the 11 Democrats who voted against the economic stimulus package Wednesday had an incentive other than the plan ’s hefty price tag : Nine of them hold districts carried by John McCain in 2008 .
While none cited that fact when explaining why they bucked President Barack Obama and House Democratic leaders , there is little doubt that the conservative nature of their seats colored their votes .
“ The speaker has said many times that the members are representative of their district , ” said Brendan Daly , a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
“ Many of the districts are more conservative , and they campaigned on fiscal responsibility , and we understand that . ”

The congressional district voting analysis was compiled by the Swing State Project , a Democratic blog .
While the data are unofficial , they track closely with past presidential performance results in those districts .
Among the 11 are four freshmen from Republican - oriented districts who narrowly won election in 2008 .
One of them , Rep. Frank Kratovil ( D - Md. ) , is already facing the prospect of a rematch with a GOP opponent he defeated by less than 1 percent .
“ We need to make some tough choices about where we can and ca n’t afford to be spending taxpayer money , ” Kratovil said after the vote , “ and I ’m not convinced that this package focused enough of its spending on the programs most likely to have a short - term economic impact . ”
Kratovil ’s vote came as little surprise to Maryland Democrats , who note that he holds a seat that had been in GOP hands for 16 years .
“ I do know that he has a very unique challenge on his hands , ” said Maryland Democratic Party Executive Director Quincey Gamble .
Gamble said retaining the seat would require that Kratovil keep close tabs on the political pulse on the district and that he would ultimately legislate from the center on spending issues — something he promised on the campaign trail last fall .
Just two of the 11 Democratic no votes , Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski of Pennsylvania , represent seats that voted for Barack Obama .
For them , the discretionary spending was too much to swallow .
“ We face the most challenging economic crisis since the Great Depression , ” said Kanjorski in a statement , “ yet this bill merely throws money at the problem by expanding existing programs . ”
The day after his no vote , Cooper , a budget hawk and member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog coalition , expressed frustration over what he said was leadership ’s lack of outreach in the drafting of the bill .
“ They really do n’t care what Blue Dogs think , ” Cooper told Politico , noting that he stood before a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus on Monday and outlined his concerns .
“ There ’s huge frustration . ”
Cooper said he had spoken to other Democratic fiscal conservatives who said they wanted to vote no but felt they could n’t , though he declined to specify any by name .
“ We wish we could be more relevant in the discussion before they got more advanced , ” Cooper added .
Aides to other Democrats who voted against the bill also expressed frustration at the process but credited White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel for committing to adopt stricter pay - as - you go standards in a meeting with Blue Dogs last Tuesday — a move that locked up support from a vast majority of Blue Dogs .
Still , some Blue Dogs are smarting over the process , with one aide saying that party leadership used “ sales jobs ” to try to promote the package without seeking outside input .
The aide said the approach was less than effective for his boss , who is from a Republican –heavy district .
“ We do n’t exactly drink the Kool - Aid , you know what I mean ? ” this person said .
Aides to Pelosi say she is actively reaching out to Blue Dogs with an eye toward addressing their concerns about deficit reduction .
They note that in February , Obama is set to host a fiscal responsibility summit focusing on entitlement spending — a cause Cooper is expected to head up for the Blue Dogs .
Pelosi ’s side is also quick to point out that those who voted against the bill on Wednesday make up only 20 percent of the Blue Dog coalition .
Whatever reason the Democratic members had for opposing the bill , they awoke on Thursday with voicemail boxes jammed with requests from right - wing talk show hosts begging them to bash Obama .
It ’s a position he ’s not comfortable with , said Cooper , noting that he ’s a big Obama fan — just not a fan of the stimulus package .
“ [ Republicans ] just did n’t want to vote for anything a Democratic president was moving , ” Cooper said .
“ I try to be more discerning . ”

Brother Cesare Bonizzi is a Capuchin Monk who was born in 1946 in Italy .
He has always used music as a way of spiritual meditation , but one day he saw Metallica in concert and he was changed forever .
He formed a band called “ Fratello Metallo ” ( “ Metal Brother ” ) , a heavy metal band saying that “ Metal is the most energetic , vital , deep and true musical language that I know . ”
Like any good Metal God , he sings about booze , smoking and sex , but he also covers spirituality and God as well .
The band has developed quite a following , and have released several albums .
They have even played at the “ Gods of Metal ” festival in Italy with Iron Maiden .
Bonizzi performs in full Franciscan habit .
Although people often get a little excited when the mistake him making the “ metal devil horns ” in concert , he is actually extending his thumb along with the index and pinkie , which is actually the sign for “ love ” in sign language .

Tar and Feathers for AIG
Our Readers Who Comment want revenge on American International Group for paying bonuses to AIG executives .
Their fury comes in response to Brady Dennis ' report that the bailed - out insurance giant finally revealed where it sent the money .
Readers have detested bailouts from the time they was first mentioned back in the Bush Administration and their hostility has only grown as the economy continues to tank , taking with it jobs , housing values and retirement funds .
They 're not getting any help , so why should the bozos who wrote those insurance contracts be getting bonuses ?
Readers suggest tar and feathers , severe tax audits or a 99 percent tax rate for bonus recipients and wonder why , if we can help these misguided insurance executives , we can't help the auto industry .
We 'll start with ASKENNEDY , who wrote , " I believe this calls for the time honored tradition of tar and feathering . "
TalkingHead1 asked , " So , again , why is it legal for the feds to give $ 160 billion of American taxpayers to AIG in bailouts , but illegal for them to take away $ 160 million bonus from AIG ? "
TabLUnoLCSWfromUtah wrote , " ... for a company to enter into a written agreement that represents a poor business decision raises serious questions about the integrity of those ruthless business people who can use the legal system to rip off both the company they " work for " and the rest of us .
Somehow somebody needs to be responsible and lose in such " legally " questionable deals ... "
hc2254 said , " What 's the worst that could happen ?
Millions of millionaires lose their faux wealth ?
Millions of thousandaires have to work for their money rather than rely on that racetrack called the stock market ?
We have to burn this house down to save it . "
profco wrote , " Retention bonuses to keep " top talent " ?
Where exactly do all these AIG executives think they are going to find jobs in the financial sector these days ?
Let them leave AIG bcause they do n't get their bonuses -- and find out what the real world is like . "
pjc8300892 suggested that " Everyone who got a bonus should go under the IRS microscope to see how much of that bonus the tax payers can recover . "
And laSerenissima2003 added " ... Perhaps bonuses paid by companies receiving bailout funds should be taxed at a rate of 99 % ? "
Beprudent noted that many American millions " ... flowed to the bank accounts of large international financial institutions that are the national champions of other nations " and wondered " Has any consideration been given by the Obama Administration to seeking , by moral suasion , contributions to help with the AIG bill ?... "
lowercaselarry wrote , " Geithner and Summers are buffoons .
Their pathetic attempts to justify AIG 's actions deserve ridicule .
There may be contractural obligations on the part of AIG , but there is certainly no obligation for the Treasury to pour money into AIG willy - nilly . "
JoeSixPack1 asked , " ... Can I trust this Administration in the White House ?
If the Obama folks truly believe what AIG is doing on the bonus payout is wrong , they should find a way stop them .
Otherwise , the Obama is either incompetent or in bed with the crooks . "
Keenobserver wrote , " ... Many taxpayers have lost their jobs , retirement , and individual wealth from the actions of AIG .
So far , AIG ( the responsible party ) does n't think that their employees should lose their jobs or their bonuses .
Think again ! "
JulesJames said , " Honor every bonus contract .
Then terminate any AIG employee who accepts the bonus ... "
arjay1 , noting that retaining quality employees is one of the reasons given for paying bonuses , wrote , " ... If they are the same employees who were there in 2007 and 2008 , what difference does it make whether they are retained or not ?
The[y ] got their paychecks by selling insurance on something that did n't have related assets or actual value . "
goodcake4u wrote , " There are thousands of American citizens who are going homeless right now while these rats are taking bonuses for destroying the economy .
Something is not right and if it is not corrected perhaps we should help them correct it . "
sjones77 offered the one comment I could find at this hour that seemed to defend AIG : " I do n't understand the consternation with how AIG has been spending the bailout money ( except for the millions in bonus payouts ) .
It sounds like it used the money to pay off its bad debts .
Is n't that exatly what it was supposed to do ? "
But AverageJane asked , " Can anybody tell me why Wall Street gets 100s of billions in bailouts while the big 3 automakers have to go on bended knee for asstistance ?... "
And woody2471 wrote , " ' We are a country of laws .
There are contracts , ' Summers said yesterday .
' The government cannot just abrogate contracts ....'
Unless , of course , it is a contract with the United Auto Workers . "
We 'll close with swatkins1 , who wrote , " Sounds like AIG wiped the bad assets from its books .
So ...... When does my stock portfolio and my house value start to go back up ? "

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- American International Group revealed on Sunday details of $ 105 billion of government funds that it paid to U.S. and international banks including Goldman Sachs , Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale .
The cash paid to AIG 's so - called counterparties was used to cover collateral payments , cancel derivatives contracts and meet obligations at its securities lending business .
Now majority - owned by the government , AIG AIG , - 1.23 % has received more than $ 170 billion in bailout funds to keep it in operation since mid-September , when it found itself on the verge of collapse .
Most of the leading U.S. and European banks were represented on the list of recipients of AIG payouts .
Goldman Sachs Group GS , - 1.14 % got the biggest single total , receiving $ 12.9 billion .
Bank of America Corp. BAC , - 1.32 % and brokerage subsidiary Merrill Lynch together received $ 12 billion , followed by Societe Generale ( 013080 ) , which took $ 11.9 billion , and Deutsche Bank ( DBK ) DB , - 1.89 % , on the receiving end of $ 11.8 billion .
Payments to municipalities totaled another $ 12.1 billion .
" AIG recognizes the importance of upholding a high degree of transparency with respect to the use of public funds , " the company said in a statement .
AIG had previously argued that disclosing the identity of counterparties could damage its business relationships or cause competitive harm , but it 's come under increasing pressure from lawmakers to provide details .
Counterparty payouts
AIG said that between Sept. 16 and Dec. 31 , it paid out $ 22.4 billion in collateral related to credit default swaps , or CDS .
Such swaps are essentially insurance policies on a company 's debt in case it were to default .
The largest recipient of these payouts was France 's Societe Generale , which received $ 4.1 billion , while Germany 's Deutsche Bank received $ 2.6 billion and Goldman Sachs took $ 2.5 billion .
Merrill Lynch and Bank of America got , between them , $ 2 billion .
Over the same period , the insurer paid $ 43.7 billion to securities lending counterparties .
Chief among these was U.K. - based Barclays PLC BCS , - 0.60 % , which received $ 7 billion .
Deutsche Bank got $ 6.4 billion , as did the combination of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch .
Another $ 27.1 billion went for payouts made to cancel some CDS contracts .
The top recipients of these monies were Societe Generale and Goldman Sachs , who received $ 6.9 billion and $ 5.6 billion , respectively .
See AIG 's disclosures in full .
The remainder of the $ 173 billion of taxpayer money that AIG has received has been used to repay debt , boost capital levels at some of its units and fund vehicles created to wind down its derivatives contracts .
AIG 's shares , once part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average , have fallen more than 99 % from their peak early in 2007 .
The announcement over bailout payments came as the company became embroiled in a row over bonus payments to employees at AIG Financial Products , the unit largely responsible for its near collapse last year .
The decision to pay around $ 450 million in bonuses elicited howls of protest in Washington .
President Barack Obama said on Monday that his administration will attempt to block the bonuses .
" This is n't just a matter of dollars and cents .
It 's about our fundamental values , " said Obama .

On Sunday Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , called on the government to examine whether the bonuses can be legally recovered .

El hombre encargado de buscar petróleo y gas en México , Carlos Morales Gil , aseguró que las empresas De Goyler & McNaughton , Netherland & Sewell y Ryder Scott certificaron un volumen original de reservas en el Paleocanal de Chicontepec por 139 mil millones de barriles de petróleo crudo equivalente .
El director de Pemex Exploración y Producción ( PEP ) explicó en entrevista con EL UNIVERSAL que son volúmenes de hidrocarburos certificados , “ no es un número que yo haya inventado ” .
Aclaró que de esa cantidad de hidrocarburos sólo podrán extraerse , con la tecnología disponible , alrededor de 18 mil millones de barriles en los próximos 30 años .
Pero ¿qué va a pasar con los restantes 118 mil millones de barriles ? , se le cuestionó .
“ Se van a quedar ahí , porque en este momento no existe ningún tipo de tecnología que nos permita extraer ese recurso ” , contestó .
Probablemente , añadió , con el paso del tiempo surja algún tecnólogo que nos ofrezca la posibilidad de “ exprimir ” al máximo Chicontepec .
Aunque los recursos certificados en los 29 campos que integran el activo requieren inversiones para ser desarrollados y adquieran la categoría de reservas económicamente explotables , en términos únicamente de volumen son equivalentes a la mitad de las reservas probadas de Arabia Saudita , a 78 % de las reservas de Canadá e iguales a las de Irán , primeros tres países con el mayor volumen de reservas petroleras del mundo y 3.8 veces mayor a Cantarell .
¿ Es real la posibilidad de poder extraer del activo 18 mil millones de barriles en 30 años ?
Definitivamente , dijo , y es “ un compromiso que asumo como director , es un compromiso de la organización , de PEP , que tenemos con la sociedad , con los dueños de ese petróleo que nos han dado la confianza , el mandato de ser quienes extraigamos ese recurso , dentro de la racionalidad técnica ” .
“ Confiamos que el yacimiento descubierto en 1926 se pueda desarrollar , porque sabíamos que ahí hay petróleo , y ahora sólo requerimos paciencia de la sociedad , del gobierno , tiempo de aprendizaje , trabajo y continuidad , no nos podemos desesperar ...
Teníamos información del enorme potencial , pero la certificación de De Goyler & McNaughton , Netherland & Sewell y Ryder Scott nos ayuda a determinar el volumen original de reservas de Chicontepec , que se define como la cantidad que se estima existe inicialmente en un yacimiento ” , dijo .
El programa de extracción de Pemex plantea concentrar recursos financieros y tecnológicos en la llamadas reservas probables de este yacimiento que cubre una extensión de 3 mil 875 kilómetros cuadrados en una zona que comparten los estados de Veracruz y Puebla y abarca 14 municipios .
De acuerdo con las certificaciones realizadas por las empresas especialistas contratadas por Pemex , las reservas de crudo que se esperan recuperar a través de pozos nuevos en áreas no perforadas , o donde se requiere una inversión relativamente grande , ascienden al primero de enero de 2008 a 6 mil 261 millones de barriles .
Las correspondientes a gas , en su equivalente a barriles , ascienden a 14 mil 335 millones .
Aseguró que el esquema contempla perforar poco más de 17 mil pozos en los 29 campos de Chicontepec , para un promedio de mil por año .
“ Lo que buscamos es prolongar el periodo de vida de los pozos y del mismo yacimiento ” .
Actualmente cada pozo puede ser productivo por cuatro 0 cinco años , “ pero intentamos con nuevas tecnologías alargar su vida ú til ” .
Nos hemos planteado , agregó , una producción por pozo de 100 barriles diarios ; “ si lo logramos , va a ser todo un éxito ” , toda vez que otra de las dificultades que presente Chicontepec es que no se trata de un gran yacimiento como Cantarell , sino de cientos , de miles de pequeñas cavernas que pueden estar separadas entre sí por metros o kilómetros , lo que nos obliga a la perforación masiva .
Además , aseguró que se ha logrado reducir significativamente el tiempo de perforación ; “ inicialmente lo estábamos haciendo en 60 días , hoy la empresa Schlumberger ha logrado bajarlo a 8 días , lo que nos permitirá en su momento reducir costos significativamente al igual que los costos de producción en este proyecto que actualmente oscilan entre 11.5 y 12.5 dólares por barril ” .
“ Queremos también prolongar el periodo de vida de Chicontepec , que originalmente está previsto para 2033 , aunque creo que con nuevos equipos , tecnologías , el aprendizaje necesario y paciencia podremos ver a un Chicontepec produciendo en el 2060 o 2080 , si es que el petróleo va a tener algún tipo de valor para los que vivan en esos años ” .
Adelantó que preparan el nuevo modelo de contratos que utilizarán en Chicontepec , que permiten incentivar a las empresas e incorporar nuevas tecnologías a lo largo del desarrollo del mismo .
My new home of western Maryland is a marked study in contrasts .
Maryland , as readers of this page already know , is considered to be a " progressive " state , a one - party entity ( Democratic ) in which the legislature can be counted upon at least once a year to pass yet another " tough new law " that further restricts our freedoms .
Whether it be inane gun trigger locks , the " click it or ticket " seatbelt statute , or " in our state , it is 0.8 " ( blood - alcohol levels for driving ) , one can count on the Maryland House of Delegates to let residents of the state know who is in charge around here .
My northern neighbor , Pennsylvania , is a little better but not much more so .
Both states have revenue - hungry governments that are always in search of new ways to pick someone ’s pockets , and there are constant reminders that Big Brother exists ostensibly to protect us from ourselves .
However , there is at least one group of people who manage to live what in essence is a stateless existence : the Amish .
While Lancaster County , Pennsylvania , is best known for its Amish contingent , an ultra-conservative Mennonite sect that eschews modern conveniences like electricity and automobiles , they also populate the westernmost county in Maryland as well as other Pennsylvania counties located on the Allegheny Plateau .
Those of us who live nearby must always look out for their black buggies when we are driving on roads in those areas .
While there is inevitable mingling of the Amish and their " English " neighbors ( as they like to call us ) , this is a group of people who as much as possible keep to their own .
I certainly do not classify them as unfriendly ; indeed , I enjoy visiting with them whenever I shop at a salvage store owned and operated by an Amish family .
There is much to admire about the Amish , even though few of us would wish to join their sect .
While I may not worship at the shrine of modern conveniences , I would also be loath to give them up for a house with no electricity and a horse and buggy for transportation .
( The Amish are also practical , as they own and use tractors and other mechanized equipment , including gas - powered weed eaters . )
Although one can debate the merits of living a quasi - nineteenth century existence , I would like to look at one aspect of the Amish , that being their relative statelessness .
Yes , they obey the laws of their states , but there are exceptions .
The Amish do not pay social security taxes , and their children are educated only up to eighth grade , usually in private Amish schools .
( Most likely , they are better educated leaving school after grade eight than many of their counterparts who slog through 12 years or more in government schools . )
They had to fight hard to win those exceptions , but when the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972 ruled that the State of Wisconsin could not force Amish students to go beyond eighth grade , that provided at least some cushion between them and government .
Furthermore , the Amish are pacifists , which means they do not serve in the U.S. Armed Forces , nor can they be conscripted into service .
Amish do not vote , which means that when one drives in their areas at election times , there are no ridiculous candidate signs in their yards .
( No , they do not place political bumper stickers on their horse - drawn buggies .
The only things they have are the state - required orange triangles in the rear . )
In fact , Amish do not talk politics at all .
None of my many conversations with them and their youngsters have been about politics or political personalities .
Instead , we speak of family and things we consider to be important .
To be frank , I would rather converse with the Amish I have met than with many of the pseudo intellectuals who seem to dominate media conversation these days .
They might not be aware of the state of French Marxism or the latest self - important inanities from Sen.
John McCain , but then I do n’t much care what European communists and American statists have to say either .
A myth that permeates our society today is the falsehood that " responsible citizenship " requires that one vote in elections and keep abreast of political news .
I know of no more responsible people than the Amish , and no people who are less politicized .
That does not mean they do not stand up for their rights ; a very conservative Amish sect in nearby Cambria County , Pennsylvania , has unsuccessfully fought to have a gray buggy triangle instead of the orange one the state requires .
As noted earlier , they have also used the courts to establish their own educational practices and the ability to stay out of the social security system .
In other words , they use the political system , but only to secure their rights , not to engage in wealth transfers and other shenanigans that characterize the modern American state .
There are those who believe that the Amish should be more subject to the state than they are .
No doubt , many educational bureaucrats and state social workers would relish the thought of taking Amish children from their homes in order that they may be " exposed " to wonderful things like AIDS " education " in government schools , D.A.R.E. , and MTV .
One of the myths of the Amish is that they have " made socialism work . "
While their strict Anabaptist version of Christianity is communitarian in nature , that does not make them socialists .
First , Amish own their own property and businesses and are expected to work hard to make a living .
Second , theirs is a religious , not socialistic community .
Families are expected to care for others when there is genuine need .
However , people within the sect who do not work or are less than diligent and honest in their dealings with others cannot expect the kind of welfare state " compassion " from their brethren that is available through government .
Christian community , in the view of the Amish , is something in which individuals are expected to contribute to the well being of others .
Furthermore , the Amish community is a voluntary society .
Each child , when he or she grows up , is given the choice of staying Amish or leaving to live among the " English . "
Most people stay , but some do leave and go onto other pursuits .
Whenever I see an Amish horse and buggy or see them working in their fields and gardens , I am reminded that it is possible for individuals to live their lives without the " help " of the state .
In this age of limitless government , it is good to see at least some people actually practicing a useful form of political anarchy .
The Best of William L. Anderson
In April 2004 we finally broke ground to rebuild .
I was working the excavator , while hubby shoveled up the debris .
The neighbors loved it , there she is High Powered Corporate Mucky Muck , in the seat of a backhoe , tearing down her house .
Why ?
Why did we have to do the work ourselves ?
Flood Insurance of course ,
The county condemned the house , but the insurance co , they only paid for replacing the bottom of the house .
and not the frame or foundation , just the wall board , carpet and the like .
So to rebuild our entire house , we got around $ 50,000 .
We HAD to do it ourselves .
Anyway , not the point of this diary .
The Point is May , May 2004 .
I hurt myself , running that excavator , hurt my right side .
Memorial Day weekend May 2004 .
I ended up in the emergency room of one of the INOVA Hospitals .
( I live in Maryland , but my job was in Northern VA , so I took an apartment close to work , yes I could afford both the house and the apartment )
My Daughter took me to the ER , I remember laying in the bed .
It is not a particularly busy hospital , so I was seen rather quickly , it was a Tuesday Morning .
First they did the x-ray , the ER Dr came to see me and asked permission to do a CT Scan .
When I pressured him for why , he blew it off as ; still Looking .
but he really was n't because a couple of hours later , he finally came by the room again and told me that I needed a pulmonary specialist .
But he refused to tell me much more .
I thought it was very odd .
I called the number they gave me as soon as we left , and was given an appointment the next day .
It never even occurred to me that this was odd .
So the next day I went to Northern Virginia Pulmonary and Critical Care . ( CRITICAL ) that I noticed .
My appointment was with Dr , Wxxx , young female , and pregnant .
She was not exactly kind .
She took the CT Scan they sent me home with , and the chest x-ray .
She went into the next room for a only a few minutes and when she came back we told me :
" There is good news and really bad news .
I will tell you the bad news first .
You have interstitial lung disease .
It is really bad news , because this disease has no cure and no treatment .
From what we know right now , from the time of diagnosis to the time of death is usually around 5 years . "
I could not breathe anymore , I did n't ask any questions , I simply could not think or breathe .
I was alone here , on the edge of an examination table , being told I was dying .
My mind was simply screaming at me .
But she went on :
" The good news ?
Is that it is most likely caused by a foreign agent , Asbestos , Chemicals , something like that , and your family can sue and win a great deal of money . "
I still could not breathe ; I did n't know what to ask .
What to say , what was next , I felt paralyzed .
So she instructed me to go to the nurse , and she would perform a 6 minute walking test to determine my lung capacity , or something .
So I walked for six minutes with this thing on , telling me and the nurse when I got to her end of the hall , my O2 levels .
I just remember being rather numb .
Walking and wanting my husband to be there , to help me .
To tell me she is lying , I only came on my lunch hour ; I needed someone to get me home .
But he was in Maryland .
The next few months were a whirlwind of biopsies , second , third fourth and yes fifth opinions .
Johns Hopkins , Specialist in four states , Christiana Care , GW Hospital , no one would change or alter the diagnosis at all .
Anger , fear , depression , wow , what a ride !
I almost died in GW Hospital from the open lung biopsy .
( not needed by the way ) Courses of useless treatments , designed to make me feel like we were trying .
Now my teeth are rotten from the drugs .
I get pneumonia every year from the damage done to my right lung in the biopsy , I am considerably weaker than I used to be
And from there , my life began to unravel .
Slowly at first , missing work , too many doctor 's appointments , too much down time .
I went from having all my leaves maxed out , to running out of both sick and vacation time .
My boss was great , he treated me with respect , so they transferred me to the Dick head that would get this sick woman out of Sr Management , and eventually get rid of me .
I made good money and had saved a considerable sum , so I have kept us alive and going for the past 2 years now .
I planned for and paid for my funeral , body disposal , and wake .
I did a will , and living will .
I have tried a couple of businesses , and tried to go back to work .
( No one will take me , at my level , everyone in the other companies , who do what I did ; all knew I was sick too . )
I house , to rent out , I bought a restaurant for my hubby to manage , hoping these investments would give us a little freedom and income .
And mostly for my husband , to have something when I go .
I have not been wildly successful .
The restaurant is on the brink of nonresistance every week , month , etc .
My savings have run out , and we are facing foreclosure , as are so many others .
These 5 years have gone quickly , too quickly .
Now my date with death in May 2009 .... Is Right around the corner .
Just one problem .............
Hey Dr Wxxx , F U C K Y O U
I am still here , and the party will be at my restaurant , next month , , , , , ,
You are cordially invited to the " I am still standing "
Party to be held at my restaurant , The Great Bluein Shady Side Maryland .
Come have a drink on me , have a dinner on me , you and your Partner there , Dr McXxx .
Stop on by .
I may be weak , slow , and poor as hell .
But you know what
I AM STILL ALIVE !
SO F U C K Y O U
( PLEASE EXCUSE THE PROFANITY , IT IS THE BEST EMOTION I CAN EXPRESS OVER THIS )
The Incident :
Consumer review websites serve two purposes : to inform consumers about the best values , and to give frustrated and semi-crazy customers a place to vent without making a scene and knocking over a magazine rack .
Everybody understands this .

Well , not everybody .
When car transportation company Auto Transport Direct saw customers talking trash about them on Transport Reviews , well , they could n't leave the complaints unanswered .
But , hey , that 's understandable , right ?
Reply to the negative comments , give your side , it 's all good .
The Freak - Out :
The employee in charge of conducting their response / flame war kind of took the whole thing personally .
So they went right for personal attacks against the reviewers , which is kind of a dick move , but also took the extra step of digging up and posting customers ' personal information ( real name and home town ) to just go that extra dick mile .

It was n't a dick accident , either .
After " April " left her anonymous review , Direct Express posted her info and taunted her : " Her choice of words in which to express herself should tell you plenty , which fortunately is now captured on the Internet with her full name and town . "
Take that , dissatisfied customer !
The Fall - Out :
Once again the heroes at The Consumerist jumped into the fray , posting the story and eliciting the expected outrage in their comments ( including one who dug up and posted the personal info on the business 's owner , including how much he paid in property taxes last year ) .
Before it could turn into a full - blown incident , the company edited every one of their snarky responses and pasted an apology on the front page of their site .

" While we find it frustrating that some people make disparaging comments on the Internet without putting their name to their words , we understand that the Internet works in that way and that we should respect people 's right to opine , vent and express themselves in any way they choose .
So there will be no more name and town stuff ...
We get it .
And we 're sorry . "
Toilet paper is a serious issue .
But the minute one starts talking about it , the giggles start .
So let me get my position out clearly first .
Three years ago I went to India and discovered botty nirvana .
While I was suffering from one of those inevitable bouts of Delhi belly , I was staying in a room with a spray attachment that allowed me to clean my anus – let 's call spades spades here , it is not my bottom – without having to touch it or use paper .
It saved me from piles and rash , and definitely avoided a lot of pain .
The first few times I checked whether I was clean with toilet paper but soon I realised that was unnecessary .
I was spotless every time in both senses of the word .
So when I got back to Britain , I found that fortunately I had a shower attachment that reached over to the toilet and I could perform the same task .
Result : large amounts of toilet paper saved , and a far cleaner and refreshed feeling that was far more hygienic .
As for the wetness , there is a choice – either dab off with a small amount of toilet paper or use a towel specially for the purpose .
Remember the towel is nothing more than drying off clean buttocks , pretty much the same as coming out of the shower , but obviously I change it regularly .
Of course in the Indian heat , a bit of dampness did not matter .
Enough of my personal hygiene .
Now for the wider points .
If everyone in the world used as much toilet paper as people in the UK , let alone Americans , there would not be a single tree left .
It is all very well talking about the sustainability of different brands , but in truth we should all be using water sprays .
They are increasingly being fitted in India , replacing the rather more difficult jug and left hand technique which requires rather more contact than most westerners can contemplate .
Of course , on the continent they have bidets whose purpose has always been a mystery for the British – but it suggests that they have a better understanding of cleaning their private parts than we do .
Indeed , you can never get properly clean by simply wiping , since you are , effectively , pushing the stuff into your skin .
Would anyone dream of cleaning their hands by simply wiping them on tissue paper ?
The ideal would be a toilet designed to spray and dry .
The brilliant hand air sprays developed by James Dyson , which dry your hands in 10 seconds , are rapidly taking over in public toilets in hotels and restaurants .
His next task should be to design the environmentally friendly loo with water and air spray built in .
I have heard they exist in Japan already .
The only downside might be that men will stay on the loo even longer to read their papers , enjoying a draught of hot air up their backsides .
Above all , though , we need to talk about this issue .
There are serious environmental considerations at issue .
The fact that it is so difficult even to mention this subject is down to our Victorian prudishness .
A few years ago , dog doo - doos were in the same unmentionable category but now owners have to get used to the idea of picking up the brown stuff , a far more yucky task than using water spray to clean one 's anus .
This should be the next area where massive environmental gains can be made with very little downside , except for Kimberley Clark and those irritating puppies that waste a forest of trees in every Andrex advert .
The Conficker worm .
With the global botnet programmed to accept new instructions beginning today , The New York Times called it an " unthinkable disaster " in the making .
CBS 's 60 Minutes said the worm could " disrupt the entire internet , " and The Guardian warned that it might be a " deadly threat . "
Threat Level was skeptical last week that Conficker would do anything more than send spam .
But since then we 've become aware of dramatic new evidence that reporting on a doomsday worm is good for page views .
So welcome to our Conficker War Room !
We 'll track this scourge throughout the day , so check back frequently for the latest updates .
The war room will live - blog the cyber apocalypse until the internet has melted into a smoldering pile of solder and CAT 5 cable , or Conficker - controlled androids burst down our doors and pry our keyboards from our hands .
11:45 EDT : The worm is obviously much sneakier than even the Times predicted .
With April 1 now well underway in the eastern U.S. , and completely over in New Zealand , Conficker has n't done anything ... that we know of .

It 's a crucial half - minute in which we 're shown a picture of some innocent - looking kids , then shocked by Lesley Stahl 's revelation that they 're a Russian " cyber gang " who are " hacking into our computers and taking our money . "
Did Conficker censor the web video to protect its young Russian masters ?
7:47 p.m. EDT ( Final update ) : Turns out CBS made the cut itself , because the Russian " cyber gang " is actually an innocent youth group in Finland , as suggested by the Finnish coat of arms on one member 's jacket .
In its web correction , CBS blames the security company that provided the photo .
I blame Conficker .
In a world where a single piece of malware can inflict the carnage we 've witnessed today , who would n't be suspicious of a bunch of kids frolicking in the snow ?
We 're through the looking glass here , people !
My thoughts on Empire : Total War are still a bit jumbled .
While I unjumble them ( in readiness for a Wot I Think ) I thought I ’d share a short battle narrative with you .
The following heavily illustrated After Action Report is a True and Accurate Account of the Bloody Battle of Bangalore , 1714 , the latest scrap from my current grand campaign .
The glorious Maratha Confederacy ( that ’s me ) has been distracted from its subjugation of the northern Mughals by an unprovoked attack by the cowardly Mysorians .
A couple of territories were lost before I was able to assemble a scratch expeditionary force in Hyderabad and march out to meet the new foe .
Just outside Bangalore my general - less rabble faced their first test …
On paper things do n’t look too promising .
Not only does the Mysorian force outnumber mine by around 500 , it ’s led by a man whose name would score 3784 in Scrabble .
The only faintly encouraging thing about the line - up is Bandyopadhyay ’s lack of cavalry .
Apart from a few mounted archers , his army is completely devoid of hoofed components
The venue turns out to be short on woodland and hillocks and long on farmland and gentle slopes .
Good cannon and cavalry country .
I ’m defending a hamlet located on rising ground on the western edge of the map .
At its centre is a garrisonable pavilion .
Using tactics honed in the foothills of the Himalayas , I deploy my musketmen in jagged lines , hoping the hovels in the village will help fragment any assault and funnel attackers into discrete killzones .
My one cannon battery is positioned on the right flank atop a useful knoll .
My one specialist melee unit – a squad of Hindu swordsmen – watches over them .
Tucked away behind trees and buildings on the left flank is my secret weapon , three precious clusters of lancers .
Holy Brahmin Bull !
There ’s fouzands of ’em !
As the Mysorian hordes materialise in the hazy distance and begin advancing on our position , I can almost hear the gasps of disbelief and muttered prayers of my men .
For the moment there is nothing they can do but watch , wait , and fill the gaps gouged in formations by the enemy ’s cannonballs .
With the enemy line perhaps 500 metres from mine , my lancers move out .
Trotting then galloping they charge down the left flank , and swing round behind the Mysorian line and run parallel to it .
Concerned formations swivel to engage them .
A few give chase .
Chaos reigns .
The attack is losing its shape .
Splendid .
As the lancers continue to harry , never quite engaging , some undistracted sections of the Mysorian army reach the outskirts of the village and start exchanging musket volleys with the defenders .
The battle proper has begun .
Bodies crumple into the dry grass , smoke swirls and drifts .
Thinned by vicious swarms of canister shot , the first enemy formation breaks and runs .
Keep it up lads !
At the other end of the battlefield my weary cavalry , almost by accident , find themselves , a short distance from the Mysorian artillery positions .
Lance tips are dipped and spurs are applied .
The hapless gunners stand little chance .
Recovering somewhat from its earlier disarray , Bandyopadhyay ’s forces have arrived in strength on my left .
In an effort to reduce the growing pressure on the pavilion defences I rush three reserve units into a flanking position .
The manoeuvre pays off .
Several enemy formations are caught in vicious crossfire and fall back .
After silencing the guns , the lancers have trotted back up the left side looking for a chance to charge the knot of mounted archers that includes Bandyopadhyay himself .
No opportunity presents itself so they make another spoiling ride across the front .
Lines forming up for a second attack are once again thrown into confusion .
An isolated band of bowmen on the right flank are swept into oblivion .
Two of my hastily committed reserve units are peasant militia – horny - handed farmhands with home - made matchlocks .
The ferocity of the fighting around the pavilion is too much for one of them .
My first rout of the battle .
Hopefully the panic wo n’t spread .
Over on the right , for the first time , my canister - spitting cannons are seriously threatened .
Two lines of enemy musketmen are a short dash away .
I spot the danger in the nick of time and unleash my hitherto unused Hindu swordsmen .
The turbaned maniacs charge down the slope , raised blades glinting in the sun .
After a minute or two of stabbing and slashing they crumble the first line , and , as they seem to be enjoying themselves so much , I order them to charge the second .
Wherever you look now there are white Mysorian flags fluttering .
Bandyopadhyay seems to be mustering what ’s left of his force for a final assault on the pavilion .
His own archers arc arrows onto the flat roof of the building .
Bargirs fire back at them from behind sawtooth crenelations .
Musketmen edge forward and are driven back by a hailstorm of lead .
Perhaps sensing the last chance of victory has slipped away , the Mysorian leader charges his own horsey formation into the corpse - strewn pavilion yard .
A musketball knocks him permanently from the saddle .
The economy is in its worst recession on record , and the government faces a sea of red ink - is New Zealand the sick man of the South Pacific ?
The economy is in its worst recession on record , and the government faces a sea of red ink - will New Zealand end up like Iceland ?
Once a darling of foreign investors because of high interest rates , New Zealand appears almost like Iceland , judging from our current account deficits over the last three decades .
After weathering the Asian economic crisis and drought in 1997 and 1998 , the $ 95 billion New Zealand economy enjoyed its strongest growth since the 1970s , thanks partly to soaring commodity prices and debt - fueled consumer spending .
Now the economy is shrinking as the once - hot housing market has stalled , skyrocketing fuel and food prices have turned consumers cautious and the credit crunch has hit .
Unlike Iceland 's banks , which were brought down by aggressive and highly leveraged growth , or European banks rescued by their governments , New Zealand 's banking industry shows no signs of stress yet .
The big Australian banks - National Australia Bank , Westpac Banking , Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Commonwealth Bank of Australia - dominate the market and have so far escaped the global meltdown .
Sue Trinh , a currency analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Sydney , said the likelihood of New Zealand 's becoming a customer of the International Monetary Fund was still low , given banks ' strong capital .
But she warned that the country showed many symptoms that usually lead developing countries to seek IMF help , and that will not ease investor perceptions of an imminent sovereign credit downgrade .
New Zealand " is one of the most heavily indebted developed economies , as measured by the net international investment position as a percentage of GDP , " Trinh said in a note to investors .
At the end of March last year , New Zealand 's national debt , as measured by a negative net international investment position , was 86 percent of GDP , second to Iceland in the group of countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development .
The country 's banks are rated AA by Standard & Poor 's and have funded a shortfall in savings with commercial paper issues , which have been renewed every few months .
They minimized risk by hedging their foreign exchange exposure in the futures market .
Meanwhile , Britain , the United States , Germany , Greece , Austria , Belgium and Ireland bailed out banks with taxpayer cash .
Because of its perilously low household savings , New Zealand has long lived on foreign borrowings to fund spending .
Household borrowing stood at 174.5 billion New Zealand dollars , or $ 87 billion , at the end of December , which was financed largely by the " big four " Australian banks .
About 40 percent of bank borrowing is due for renewal this year .
By the end of September , the annual current account deficit was 8.6 percent of gross domestic product , compared with the peak of 9.3 percent in the first quarter of 2006 .
The saving grace had been the strong fiscal position of successive governments , with budget surpluses and falling debt .
That is changing .
Market watchers expect large deficits as spending rises and tax revenues fall because of the deepening recession .
At the same time , borrowing rises to cover the shortfall , which has brought warnings from rating agencies .
" We are worried that international investors may lose confidence in New Zealand 's ability to meet its obligation .
That would present a risk at the sovereign level , " said Kyran Curry , an S&P credit analyst .
S&P has downgraded the outlook on New Zealand 's AA - plus foreign currency rating to negative from stable in January on concerns over its rising fiscal and external deficits .
But the economy 's former strength may be its future savior .
" Even though sizeable fiscal deficits are projected , New Zealand 's starting position is good , compared to other nations , " said Dean Spicer , ANZ 's head of debt capital markets , in a note .
Finance Minister Bill English told Reuters the economy and government finances have deteriorated since the Treasury 's forecasts in December .
He said the worst - case scenario of the deficit growing to 4.5 percent of GDP and government gross debt at 29 percent of GDP over the next three years had become more likely .

Dr. William Bell is the former lab partner of Walter Bishop and the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Massive Dynamic .
Due to his connections to Olivia Dunham , Walter and Massive Dynamic he is linked to many of the series ' events .

Original Timeline Edit
Prime Universe Edit
Background Information Edit
While attending Harvard in 1969 , young William met Walter Bishop .
Bishop at the time was a new Professor at Harvard and Bell was a student interested in his work .
Bell attended Walter 's MIT presentation on the possibilities of nonverbal communication by brainpower between humans ; this greatly intrigued him .
While entering Walter 's lab to express his interest in helping him , he met Walter in the middle of an experiment aimed at proving his thesis .
The experiment dealt with the transference of information between two mice .
The experiment went awry , resulting in Bell getting shocked and having a strange episode due to the high amount of LSD he absorbed during the shock .
After months of working on experiments well ahead of their time , Bell and Bishop were approached by a man named Richard Bradbury who was working for a private research facility located in Alaska .
The company had been monitoring the work of the two men and recruited them to come work for them .
They agreed and went to Alaska .
William soon discovered that scientists at the facility were performing experiments involving the heads of missing scientists .
Bishop and Bell later escape with Dr. Matheson using the teleportation device .
It is from this experience that the two men become reluctant to ever work for the government again .
Later Bishop and Bell were approached by the Air Force and hired to build a machine which transports William and Bishop to Germany during World War II .
The pair is picked up by the Gestapo and thrown in prison .
Walter convinces the guards to let them go so that he can meet Hans Freohelich , who turns out to be Walter 's father .
During Walter Bishop 's time in St. Claire's , he removed parts of Walter 's brain and hid them in three other people .
( " Grey Matters " )
In 1992 , the year after his lab partner and dear friend was institutionalized , William Bell founded Massive Dynamic , the company that propelled him to the forefront of modern science and made him one of the wealthiest men alive .
Bell possibly used the money and power gained through the success of his company to further preserve the ZFT manuscript and experiments .
At Massive Dynamic , he had played a key role in every aspect of the business , from R&D to marketing .
His personal vision continues to guide the firm 's progress , and his ongoing research constantly yields new innovations and product lines .
Because of this he appeared seven times in the Business Leaders Journal 's list of " America 's Most Inspiring Corporate Leaders " .
He was also a Fellow of the National Scientific Progress Council and the only two - time recipient of the Macro Genius Award .
Season One Edit
Season Two Edit
During Fringe Division 's early investigation of The Pattern , William Bell 's location was unknown to everyone including Nina Sharp .
In fact , he had been residing comfortably in the Alternate Universe for the past several months .
His base of operations , or at least the spot he chose for his meeting with Olivia Dunham , was an office at the top of the World Trade Center ( which in that reality was not destroyed ) , which he somehow transports Olivia Dunham to .
After returning to her universe , Olivia Dunham has trouble remembering what Bell told her .
After a few weeks , she remembers that he warned her of the storm in which the two universe would collide if she did n't stop Thomas Jerome Newton from being resurrected .
( " Momentum Deferred " )
He teams up with Olivia Dunham and Walter Bishop in the Alternate Universe .
He tells Walter how his crossing over in the 1980s began to destroy this world .
He later reveals that Walter himself asked him to remove his memories .
Bell cannot cross over again , as his atoms would split apart and no trace of him would remain in either universe .
Because of this , he sacrifices himself so the others can return home .
( " Over There : Part 2 " )
Season Three Edit
When Olivia visited Bell on the other side , he served her a glass of tea that contained soul magnets .
( " Stowaway " )
In his will , he gave Nina Sharp a bell that was described as a " memento of himself . "
Walter realized that the bell was more than its appearance in and rang it , expecting Nina to become embodied by Bell .
However , it was Olivia who had a reaction to the bell 's frequency . ( " Os " )
Broyles gives William 48 hours to find a new viable host for him and get out of Olivia 's body , but William takes his time as he knows that no harm is coming to Olivia .
However , not too long after , Olivia regains control of her body briefly , confused and in a trance before William takes back over .
William then explains that there is something more complicated than he expected .
( " Stowaway " )
Walter and Peter journey into Olivia 's consciousness and find William in order to recover Olivia before she is " lost " .
After Walter and Peter " die " within her mind , William aids Olivia in escaping until she is able to confront her own fears , enabling her to take back control of her body .
William tells Olivia to pass on the message " I knew the dog would n't hunt " to Walter .
He then departs from Olivia 's consciousness .
As Olivia wakes up , Astrid and Walter realize that William 's plan to transfer his own consciousness into a computer has failed .
Olivia relays William 's message to Walter , who explains that the message was a phrase William would use in earlier experiments when he knew that they would not be successful , and that his reason for suggesting it was because " William hates goodbyes " .
( " Lysergic Acid Diethylamide " )
Alternate Universe Edit
As explained by William at the end of Season 2 , the alternate version of William was killed as a young man in a car accident .
As a result , Massive Dynamic was never formed in the parallel world ; instead , there is only Bishop Dynamic .
( " Over There : Part 2 " )
Alternate Timeline Edit
Background Information Edit
It is thought that years ago Bell intentionally caused a car accident and committed suicide while he had a lymphatic cancer .
The truth only emerged later when he revealed that he administered Cortexiphan to slow down the growth of the cancer .
( " Brave New World : Part 2 " )
Season Four Edit
In the Alternate Timeline , William Bell was still alive .
Because Peter never existed , Bell never used his body as a power source to get the Fringe Team back to the Prime Universe , a seemingly heroic act that cost him his life .
David Robert Jones , also alive due to Peter 's erasure , answered to Bell , who instructed him on carrying out his endgame .
Together , the two began piecing together a plot involving a new breed of creatures that would populate a third universe .
The creation of this universe would spring out of the collapse of the two existing universes .
The plan utilized Olivia Dunham 's Cortexiphan abilities , which Bell intended to use to collapse both universes .
( " Brave New World : Part 1 " ) ( " Brave New World : Part 2 " )
Bell 's diabolical plot and his use of Olivia in it outraged Walter , who expressed how he had no compassion for Bell in 2036 .
( " Letters of Transit " ) Walter was taken aboard Bell 's " ark " , the SS Talos , as the Neogenesis plot was being unleashed .
His plan was stopped when Walter shot Olivia in the head , knowing he'd be able to rejuvenate her because of her Cortexiphan abilities .
After realizing his plan had been foiled , William rang a bell that was aboard his ship and evaporated into thin air .
( " Brave New World : Part 2 " )
2015 Edit
Bell regained contact with the Fringe Team .
He expressed a desire to fight the Observers .
He stored two beacons in his storage facility , which could only be accessed with his hand print .
However , Bell betrayed the Fringe Division and led the Observers to their location , forcing Walter to amber himself , Astrid , Peter , and Bell . ( " Five - Twenty - Ten " )
2036 Edit
In 2036 , Henrietta was able to track down the Fringe team .
She removed Peter , Astrid , and Walter from amber .
William Bell was left encased in the amber , but Walter managed to cut off his hand in order to gain access to the beacons that were so crucial to implementing his plan .
Bell and Simon Foster were discovered in amber by the Observers .
Foster was removed and dissected .
It is unknown what became of Bell . ( " Letters of Transit " )
Final Timeline Edit
Although not seen in the Final Timeline , William Bell would still be alive in the Observer - less world and never have occasion to be ambered , making the SS Talos his last known location during his Neogenesis plot .
Personality and Traits Edit
Original Timeline Edit
Dr. William Bell is the former lab partner of Walter Bishop and founder of Massive Dynamic .
His name is mentioned through the first season , which shows his connections with the main characters as well as both past and present events in the series .
With the wealth of his company Massive Dynamic in excess of $ 50 billion , William Bell is considered one of the richest men in the world .
Evidently , he also possesses great technical knowledge and experience , one example being Nina Sharp 's functional robotic arm which according to Nina was built by Bell himself .
He shared a laboratory with Walter Bishop , so it is likely that he also has a deep knowledge of the science of the border .
Walter says that Bell was the only other person who knew what their experiments were about .
( " Pilot " )
Walter vehemently defends Bell in " The Road Not Taken " , reminding everyone that Bell was many things , for example ambitious , selfish and temperamental , but not a fool .
Nina also defends him to Broyles and insists that he is not a terrorist and not the enemy .
Bell was suspected to be involved with the ZFT .
In a confession recorded video , Dr. Nicholas Boone revealed the founder of Massive Dynamic is the same man who finances the ZFT .
( " Midnight " )
Another member of the ZFT , David Robert Jones , showed an interest in meeting with William Bell .
( " There 's More Than One of Everything " )
Alternate Timeline Edit
Without Peter there to soften Walter , Bell grows angry and bitter .
He believes that the world dealt him and his best friend a bad hand , and that they should take their rightful place as " Gods " for a new world order .
Walter realizes that his friend has gone mad and that Olivia is the key to his final game .
In an last - ditch effort , Walter shoots and kills Olivia to prevent the collapse of the universes .
William is angered by the betrayal of his friend and disappears .
( " Brave New World : Part 2 " )
Trivia Edit
Dr. William Bell is one of the most enigmatic and shadowy characters in Fringe .
He starts off as an anti-hero and later becomes one of the main villains of the show .
Voice actor Leonard Nimoy has been heard on an old VHS tape before his first appearance on the show , but was not credited .
( " Bad Dreams " )
In an imaginary tale of Walter , William Bell is talking to Nina Sharp in a display device .
( " Brown Betty " )
For three episodes , Torv has played a third role aside from Olivia and her alternate counterpart , namely that of Olivia possessed by the mind of William Bell , who has been called " Bellivia " by reviewers .
She simulated a hoarse voice and mannerisms of Nimoy used for the representation of Bell . ( " Os " ) ( " Stowaway " )
Bell was initially presented in Fringe Comics as a replacement for Walter Bishop and then as his lab partner .
Bell 's obituary covers three columns of the newspaper .
It 's just four points long , but repeated three times to appear more grandiose .
Bell and Walter share the same first and last initials , W.B .
He is the only main antagonist whose ultimate fate is unknown .
David Robert Jones and Thomas Jerome Newton are dead and destroyed , Walternate is still alive as of 2036 , and Windmark was erased from existence by Walter 's sacrifice in the series finale .
The Islamic Center of Irvine is a beige stucco building that blends into the rows of office buildings surrounding it .
But last week , it became the most publicized mosque in California with disclosures that the FBI sent an informant there to spy and collect evidence of jihadist rhetoric and other allegedly extremist acts by a Tustin man who attended prayers there .
The revelations dismayed mosque members like Omar Turbi , 50 , and his 27 - year - old son who shares his name .
After Friday prayer service last week , while hundreds of others scurried back to work , the pair stood with their backs to a wall and mulled over the news .
“ It gives you a little bit of apprehension about who you trust , ” the elder Turbi said .
“ Makes you think twice about what you say ; what if people misunderstand you ? ”
Turbi ’s fears were echoed by other Muslims throughout Southern California last week .
Some say a climate of suspicion toward them , fueled by 9/11 and underscored by the latest disclosures of FBI surveillance , is inhibiting their freedoms of speech and faith .

According to Muslim leaders , some people are avoiding mosques , preferring to pray at home .
Others are reducing donations to avoid attracting government attention or paying in cash to avoid leaving records .
And some mosques have asked speakers to refrain from political messages in their sermons , such as criticism of U.S. foreign policy , said Hussam Ayloush , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations in Anaheim .
“ Some average Muslims interested only in praying are avoiding mosques for fear of somehow being monitored or profiled , ” Ayloush said .
“ Everybody is afraid , and it is leading to an infringement of the free practice of our religion . ”
The latest anxiety wave was triggered by an FBI agent ’s testimony last week that an informant was sent into several Orange County mosques and helped collect evidence against Ahmadullah Sais Niazi .
The Afghanistan - born Niazi , 34 , is scheduled for arraignment this month on charges of perjury , naturalization fraud and other acts related to lying about ties to Al Qaeda .
A man claiming to be that informant , Irvine resident Craig Monteilh , said last week in interviews and court documents that he served the FBI as a paid informant from July 2006 to October 2007 and used concealed audio and video equipment to record thousands of hours of conversations with Muslims in homes , restaurants and mosques in Irvine , Tustin , Mission Viejo and elsewhere .

But Ayloush and other Muslim leaders said that FBI scrutiny of the Muslim community -- and efforts to recruit informants -- began years ago .
The FBI declined to comment .
Both Ayloush and Shakeel Syed of the Islamic Shura Council of Southern California , an umbrella organization of 68 area mosques , said numerous Muslims have reported to them attempts by the FBI to recruit them as informers .
In virtually all cases , they said , the Muslims in question had immigration and other legal problems or were applying for green cards .
“ We will make your problems vanish if you cooperate , ” Syed said the FBI told Muslims .
Suspecting widespread surveillance of their community , several American Muslim organizations and their leaders filed a Freedom of Information Act request , followed in 2007 by a lawsuit against the federal government , demanding the release of all information collected on them .
Muslims have also complained of FBI interrogations about their charitable contributions , asking why were they donating and who was receiving their money .
At one Los Angeles - area mosque , nearly every donor was quizzed by the FBI , and the mosque subsequently experienced a steep decline in donations , Ayloush said .

Leaders at other mosques also say their contributions are down , although most attribute much of the decline to the recession .
The Islamic Center of Corona Norco , for instance , has experienced a decline in donations of 30 % to 50 % in the last three to four years , which board member Rafe Husain attributed both to the economy and what he called a climate of fear .
“ People feel tense and uncomfortable , ” Husain said .
“ I ’ve talked to some people who try to avoid mosque activity . ”
Since 9/11 , federal authorities have also shut down at least six of the Muslim community ’s major charitable organizations , accusing them of involvement in terrorist financing .
The actions have impeded Muslims from fulfilling the duties of their faith , Syed said , because charitable giving is not a voluntary act in Islam but a religious obligation .
The latest tensions have further frayed relations between the FBI and Muslims .
Since 9/11 , the two sides had worked to develop a partnership , forming a Multi-Cultural Advisory Committee to meet monthly .

But the FBI unilaterally broke off ties with the American - Islamic council a few weeks ago , issuing a cryptic statement that the agency would limit contact until “ certain issues ” were addressed by CAIR ’s national headquarters in Washington .
In protest , Syed ’s umbrella group of Southern California mosques suspended its contacts with the FBI .
The Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles remains active with the committee , saying it believes in engagement , but has asked for a meeting with the FBI , said the council ’s senior advisor , Maher Hathout .
“ People can not be suspects and partners at the same time , ” he said .
“ Unless the FBI ’s style changes , the partnership with the Muslim community will not be fruitful . ”

At the Irvine mosque , some seemed eager to offer assurances that there was nothing to fear from Muslims .
“ We are against any kind of terrorist acts by any person in the community , ” said Assad Manley , 52 , who has attended the Irvine mosque for three years .
“ If any of us hears anything dangerous we will inform the authorities . ”
Younus Mohammad , 50 , said many Muslims assumed they were under surveillance -- and that did not worry them .
“ We know they are coming , ” Mohammad said .
“ They will come any time they want , to listen or anything .
It ’s not something we need to hide . ”

Enlarge By Justin Sullivan , Getty Images Police officers and other men pray outside of the emergency room at Highland Hospital , in Oakland .
An Oakland policeman shot by a wanted parolee was pronounced brain - dead Sunday , one day after three fellow officers were killed in a running shootout that became one of the bloodiest ever for a local U.S. police department .
Officer John
Hege , 41 , was on life support and a final decision was still being made about donating his organs , Oakland Police Department spokesman Jeff Thomason said .
Suspect Lovelle Mixon , 26 , who was wanted on a parole violation , fired on Hege and another motorcycle officer , Sgt. Mark Dunakin , 40 , after they pulled his car over Saturday afternoon , police said .
Mixon was slain a few hours later in a gunfight with police that killed two more officers : Sgt. Ervin Romans , 43 , and Sgt. Daniel Sakai , 35 .
It was the most Oakland police officers mortally wounded in the line of duty on one day .
Kevin Morison , spokesman for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund , said it appeared to be the worst shooting involving officers of a single department in California in 39 years .
Police said Mixon ran off after he shot the motorcycle officers , police said .
It led to an intense manhunt by dozens of Oakland police , California Highway Patrol officers and Alameda County sheriff deputies .
Streets were roped off and an entire area of east Oakland closed to traffic .
Police said that several hours later , they got an anonymous tip that he was inside a nearby apartment building .
A SWAT team entered the building .
Mixon opened fire , and Romans and Sakai were killed .
Officers fired back , killing Mixon , Acting Police Chief Howard Jordan said .
Police said they did not know why the officers stopped Mixon 's car but said it apparently was a routine stop and that Mixon had an extensive criminal history .
Relations between the community and police became tense in Oakland after an unarmed 22 - year - old man was shot to death by a transit police officer Jan .
1 . On Saturday , about 20 people lingered at the scene of the first shooting , taunting police .
Including the three Oakland fatalities , eight law enforcement officers have been shot to death in the line of duty in the nation this year , compared with 11 over the same period last year , according to the Officers Memorial Fund .
The number of officers killed nationally declined sharply in 2008 , and fewer officers were killed by gunfire than any time since 1956 .
Experts attributed the decline to several factors , including increased police training , Morison said .

A bullshit lie detector company run by a charlatan has managed to semi-successfully censor a peer reviewed academic article .
And I do n't like it one bit .
But first , some background , and then we 'll get to the censorship stuff .
Five years ago I wrote a Language Log post entitled " BS conditional semantics and the Pinocchio effect " about the nonsense spouted by a lie detection company , Nemesysco .
I was disturbed by the marketing literature of the company , which suggested a 98 % success rate in detecting evil intent of airline passengers , and included crap like this :
The LVA uses a patented and unique technology to detect " Brain activity finger prints " using the voice as a " medium " to the brain and analyzes the complete emotional structure of your subject .
Using wide range spectrum analysis and micro-changes in the speech waveform itself ( not micro tremors ! ) we can learn about any anomaly in the brain activity , and furthermore , classify it accordingly .
Stress ( " fight or flight " paradigm ) is only a small part of this emotional structure
The 98 % figure , as I pointed out , and as Mark Liberman made even clearer in a follow up post , is meaningless .
There is no type of lie detector in existence whose performance can reasonably be compared to the performance of finger printing .
It is meaningless to talk about someone 's " complete emotional structure " , and there is no interesting sense in which any current technology can analyze it .
It is not the case that looking at speech will provide information about " any anomaly in the brain activity " : at most it will tell you about some anomalies .
Oh , the delicious irony , a lie detector company that engages in wanton deception .
So , ok , Nemesysco , as I said in my earlier post , is clearly trying to pull the wool over people 's eyes .
Disturbing , yes , but it does n't follow from the fact that its marketing is wildly misleading that the company 's technology is of no merit .
However , we now know that the company 's technology is , in fact , of no merit .
How do we know ?
Because two phoneticians , Anders Eriksson and Francisco Lacerda , studied the company 's technology , based largely on the original patent , and and provided a thorough analysis in a 2007 article Charlatanry in forensic speech science :
A problem to be taken seriously , which appeared in the International Journal of Speech Language and the Law ( IJSLL ) , vol 14.2 2007 , 169–193 , Equinox Publishing .
Eriksson and Lacerda conclude , regarding the original technology on which Nemesysco 's products are based , Layered Voice Analysis ( LVA ) , that :
Any qualified speech scientist with some computer background can see at a glance , by consulting the documents , that the methods on which the program is based have no scientific validity .
OK , now for the censorship stuff .
This is ugly .
But complicated .
As reported on the AAAS 's Science website , Nemesysco 's lawyers wrote to the publisher of IJSLL , and forced it to retract the Eriksson and Lacerda article , ceasing to distribute the article electronically .
( See Brouhaha Over Controversial Forensic Technology : Journal Caves to Legal Threat , cached version here )
Nemesysco's point seems to have been that the article was unnecessarily personal .
And here 's the complication : it was indeed not necessary for the article to revolve as much as it did around the character of the founder of Nemesysco , Amir Liberman ( still no relation ! ) .
The article clearly suggests Amir Liberman is a charlatan .
Now , I 'm convinced that Amir Liberman is in fact a charlatan .
And I also think that the article is well - researched , and makes no unsubstantiated claims .
Furthermore , and although this is unconventional in scientific journals , the article is greatly enhanced as regards its narrative structure by having a real live bad guy as the central character .
But I 'm not a lawyer , and can't evaluate whether any case against the journal would have had legal merit .
So , I 'm not going to debate the legal ins and outs .
You can read around the web ( e.g. on wikipedia ) and , if you understand such things , decide for yourself .
Whatever the legal issues , the possibility of such censorship is very disturbing .
The only thing about this affair that pleases me is that Nemesysco 's action has without doubt brought more attention to the article , not less : you can find the original article online here .
I imagine thousands of people have downloaded it .
If enough of us to do the same , Nemesysco 's censorship will obviously have failed to achieve its main objective .
Having been withdrawn by the publisher , the article has perhaps lost the ( anyway illusory ) aura of scholarly perfection that a published peer reviewed article carries .
But it wo n't have disappeared .
And maybe , as a result of all this attention , some potential purchaser of Nemesysco 's products , be it an insurance company or a government body , will think to ask a linguist before spending the money of customers , stockholders or taxpayers on bullshit that gives speech technology a bad name .
Or maybe , just maybe , companies like Nemesysco will be encouraged to stop bullshitting , and start presenting customers with enough information to perform a fair assessment of their products .
( Hat tip to Robin Cooper , and the Facebook group Support Francisco Lacerda and Anders Eriksson , from which I learned of the Nemesysco censorship . )

PRAGUE , Czech Republic , April 28 ( UPI ) -- Albania has formally applied to join the European Union , Prague Radio said Tuesday .
Prime Minister Sali Berisha submitted the application to Mirek Topolanek , prime minister of the Czech Republic , which now holds the rotating presidency of the EU .
Advertisement
Topolanek said Albania has achieved considerable progress but still needs to introduce numerous reforms to meet EU standards .
The European Commission and the Council of the EU must approve the application before an accession process opens .
Political observers in Prague believe it will take Albania , a small Balkan country with a population of 3.2 million , more than five years to become an EU member .
Of all the expanded investigative powers authorized by Congress since the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 , few have proved as controversial — or as consistent a source of embarrassment to federal law enforcement — as National Security Letters .
Though audits by the Inspector General have uncovered widespread improprieties in the use of the investigative tool which allows the FBI to demand certain telecommunications and financial records without the need for a court order , a 2007 effort to further constrain NSLs stalled in committee .
Now , with a new administration and a sturdier Democratic majority in place , Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) and Rep. Jeff Flake ( R - AZ ) on Monday reintroduced the National Security Letters Reform Act .
The bill would significantly tighten the rules for NSLs — which can currently be used to obtain records " relevant " to an investigation , whether or not they pertain to someone even suspected of wrongdoing — and the gag orders that typically accompany them .
NSLs are not new , but their scope and prevalence were greatly expanded by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2007 .
In 2000 , investigators issued some 8,500 NSL , according to a report by the Office of the Inspector General .
In 2006 — the last year for which figures were available , the number had risen to at least 49,425 , down from a peak of at least 56,507 — though no estimates are available for 2001 or 2002 , and sloppy record - keeping found by the OIG means all figures are lowbound .
The " overwhelming majority " of those are for phone or telecommunications records , and by 2006 , the bulk of those for which a target 's nationality was specified were issued in connection with investigations of US persons .
The FBI has n't coped terribly well with the increased volume : those OIG reports found an NSL process riddled with errors and policy violations — some of which appeared to have been flatly illegal .
Agents sent " exigent letters " claiming an emergency when none existed , claimed grand jury subpoenas were pending when they were n't , and in some instances obtained information to which the statute did not entitle them .
At hearings in 2007 , a visibly angry Rep. Dan Lungren ( R - CA ) , who had supported expanding NSL authority , said the OIG 's findings sounded more appropriate to " a report about a first - or second - grade class " than college - educated FBI agents .
Thus far , however FBI officials have successfully argued that they are aware of the problems and have already begun implementing reforms to prevent future errors .
Since Nadler and Flake last sought to supplement those internal efforts with more robust statutory checks , federal appellate courts have added to the list of rationales for congressional action .
Civil libertarians have attacked not only NSLs themselves , but the broad gag provisions typically attached to them , which prevent parties served with them from discussing the requests .
Congress sought to mollify critics by modifying the PATRIOT
Act in 2006 to permit NSL recipients to retain attorneys and challenge orders they regard as unreasonable .
But late last year , the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the law still gave FBI officials too much power to silence speech , with court oversight too anemic to satisfy the First Amendment .
The court was prepared to allow a mix of court reinterpretation and FBI policy to bring the review procedures up to constitutional muster , but also invited Congress to fix the defective provision .
The National Security Letters Reform
Act would do that , and a good deal more .
While it would still permit high - ranking FBI officials to issue NSLs with temporary gag orders attached , the Bureau would have to petition a judge in order to extend that order beyond an initial 30 days .
Instead of requiring NSL recipients to challenge such orders , showing there was " no reason " to think disclosure might harm public safety or the integrity of an investigation , the agency would have the burden of showing a court specific facts justifying each six - month extension of the gag .
Perhaps most significantly , however , the law would radically narrow the scope of National Security Letters , which can currently be used to obtain financial or telecommunications transaction records that an FBI agent asserts are " relevant " to an ongoing investigation .
Under the Nadler - Flake bill , NSLs would have to certify that the target to whom the information sought pertained was believed , on the basis of " specific and articulable facts , " to be a " foreign power or agent of a foreign power . "
The bill also establishes strict " minimization " requirements , mandating the destruction of any wrongly obtained information .
While intelligence agencies often rely on " minimization " to protect the privacy of US persons , this often means only that innocent information will be retained without being indexed in a log or database for the relevant case .
Anyone whose records are obtained via an NSL without adequate factual basis , or in violation of the statutory restrictions , is entitled to sue the person responsible for issuing the letter , to the tune of $ 50,000 .
Orson Scott Card is a barking fascist asshat .
Let me illustrate .
I always marveled at how some of my friends worshiped the writing of Orson Scott Card .
Maybe , I thought , it ’s because we ’re North Carolinians and he ’s from Greensboro .
From my perspective he was nothing special , at best , and has in the last couple of decades evolved into perhaps America ’s most overrated science fiction author .
Ender ’s Game was prescient in its way – in a world where weaponry is so technologized that war is a video game , of course kids can be uber - warriors .
But when the boy is made into some kind of equally uber moralist and philosopher ( or whatever the hell Speaker for the Dead was about )
I smelled the pungent aroma of self - indulgence that so often attends SF writers of a certain stripe .
The Alvin Maker series was even less bearable .
We were doing fine in Seventh Son , clipping through an interesting enough little story ( assuming you could get past the inexplicably patronizing treatment of Native American names ) and then – the damnedest what the fuck passage in all of known literature .
Those of you who have read the book will recall the scene I ’m talking about – the quilt sequence – and those of you who have n’t should read the book just to say you ’ve been there .
At this point it was clear that Card was too goddamned full of himself by half and that the only reason the rest of us existed was so he ’d have people to be more clever than .
Until today , however , I thought Card was merely a badly overrated writer .
Now , though , we ’ve learned that he favors criminalizing homosexuality and overthrowing any government that tolerates teh faggots .
Witness , if you would :
Laws against homosexual behavior should remain on the books … to be used when necessary to send a clear message that those who flagrantly violate society ’s regulation of sexual behavior cannot be permitted to remain as acceptable , equal citizens .
And :
How long before married people answer the dictators thus : Regardless of law , marriage has only one definition , and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy .
I will act to destroy that government and bring it down , so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage , and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn .
Biological imperatives trump laws .
American government cannot fight against marriage and hope to endure .
If the Constitution is defined in such a way as to destroy the privileged position of marriage , it is that insane Constitution , not marriage , that will die .
His words , not mine .
In a way this is validating for me .
I knew there was something a little wrong with the boy , but could n’t fully articulate what it was based on his masturbatory fictional style alone .
It will be interesting to see how his fans react .
I personally have some literary heroes with political skeletonry in their closet ( Eliot comes to mind ) and cognitive dissonance loves company …

Lahore , March 16 , 2009 -- Action in Solidarity with Asia and the Pacific -- We all are ecstatic about what happened in Lahore on the March 15 , 2009 .
This day will be remembered as one where the power of the state seemed helpless in front of the power of the street .
The most crucial moment during the day was the battle at the GPO that galvanised the entire city into action .
The scene of almost 150 people battling a repressive police and forcing it to retreat will remain in the collective memory of our nation for a very long time to come .
I happened to be part of that " GPO 150 " when the police started using tear gas .
Here is a short description of how we managed to reach the spot and how we were able to inflict defeat on the state apparatus .
Beating the checkpoints
We had left Zaman park where Aitzaz had been placed under house arrest .
Lahore gave the look of a deserted ghost town in the morning with the Mall Road completely blocked .
I was with the Labour Party Pakistan , Student Action Committee and civil society members .
We decided to walk towards the High Court in pairs so that the police would fail to notice us .
Some of us succeeded , while others , like Nauman Qaiser and Jalees Hazir , were arrested at the checkpoints .
We saw civil society activists Feryal Gauhar and Hina Jilani once we reached the GPO chowk .
I have been to many protests in the past but I have never seen anything like the passion visible in front of the High Court .
There was a consensus that if the Lahore High Court fell , the movement would fizzle out .
Everyone knew that the police would use the most brutal measures to suppress the will of the people and were mentally prepared for an epic battle .
As the police started shelling tear gas indiscriminately , many activists started falling unconscious .
All of us panicked and started fleeing the scene to evade arrest .
A man who must be in his 70s , started yelling to the fleeing crowd ( which included me , as I could no longer breathe ) that this was not a time to run but to fight .
Eventually , the baba ji fainted as well but he encouraged all of us to come back and continue the fight .
Two - hour battle
We resisted the police for over two hours , pushing them back many a times .
Express News reported that 250 to 300 tear - gas shells had been fired at the protesters .
Express News reporter Rabia Mehmood and AAG channel correspondent Mani almost fainted and had to be taken away from the scene .
Many were vomiting because of the chemicals in the tear gas , which were worse than anything I have witnessed .
However , this brought the best out of the Pakistani nation .
Some people were carrying salt and water for those getting injured in the fighting .
Others were helping carry people to the diagnostic centre in the High Court or on to Edhi ambulances .
I was about to faint a couple of times and was almost blinded by the gas before some random people gave me enough water and salt .
My friend Murtaza Khwaja ( who was taking part in a violent protest for the first time ) showed immense courage and we stayed on the front line throughout this epic battle .
The protesters were also fighting with a spontaneous strategy that proved to be very effective .
We had split into three groups .
One on the Mall Road , one towards the left of the GPO while one group stayed inside the High Court building .
When the police would charge protesters on one side , they would be pelted by stones from the other side .
This was the key to this street battle as the police was being hit by stones from three sides , which is why they could not takeover the High Court .
It did n't matter which political party or group one belonged to .
Everyone was looking out for each other and we all wanted to win .
By this time , a lot of lawyers , political activists and civil society members had gathered at the gates and those of us who had been there since almost 12 noon decided to leave as we felt dehydrated and could not breathe properly .
When we went into the courtyard where all the activists had gathered ( including Justice Tariq Mehmood , advocate Anwar Kamal , Hina Jila , Tehmina Daultana ) , we had no idea what this battle at the GPO really meant .
We were just looking for water and a place to sit .
In fact , I was a little disappointed that the numbers in front of the GPO had not been big and that the Long March could be a failure .
It is here that we received the news that this battle had gripped the entire country 's imagination .
The news channels were constantly talking about the police high - handedness and the resistance by many activists .
I even received a call from a friend in Karachi who said that he had read about the crazy fighting at the Lahore High Court .
The tide was definitely turning .
People control the city
After this , the people were in complete control of the city .
Thousands joined Nawaz Sharif 's caravan as he defied detention orders to lead the procession from his house in Model Town .
The High Court courtyard went ecstatic when we heard the news of the resignations of the IG , DIG , SP , DCO and deputy attorney general of Pakistan .
Crowds cheered wildly as some of these gentlemen joined us at the High Court .
The most memorable part of the evening for me was when Aitzaz Ahsan defiantly entered the High Court building despite orders for his house arrest and the police officers stood in line to salute him .
This meant a complete victory for the movement and from then onwards , it was just a matter of time before the government would be forced to accept our demands .
I feel that the way Taseer 's goons were defeated at the GPO showed the weakness of this state apparatus .
It represented the best of Pakistan .
On one side , it represented despair , state brutality and police repression .
On the other , it reflected hope , resistance , the passions and the dreams of many Pakistanis .
We had won not because of the generosity of the country 's leadership , but because of the countless sacrifices of lawyers and activists for the past two years with March 15 , 2009 , becoming the grand finale in Lahore .
Here , I want to thank those comrades who stood their ground at the GPO chowk and showed Pakistan why we should be fighting this system .
I will remember their support and courage for the rest of my life .
This is the courage , confidence and spirit of sacrifice that we need if we want to continue our fight against the capitalist system .
This has given us new confidence in our own ability to fight and in the revolutionary potential of our nation .
Despite this success , our post - colonial state is still full of problems and oppression and there will inevitably be more resistance .
In all of the future struggles , we shall remember and take with us the spirit of March 15 .

When legal therapies let them down , some teens turn to cannabis .
A new study , published in BioMed Central 's open access journal Substance Abuse , Treatment , Prevention and Policy suggests that around a third of teens who smoke cannabis on a regular basis use it as a medication , rather than as a means of getting high .
Joan Bottorff worked with a team of researchers from the University of British Columbia , funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , to conduct in - depth interviews with 63 cannabis - using adolescents .
Of these , 20 claimed that they used cannabis to relieve or manage health problems .
Bottorff said , " Marijuana is perceived by some teens to be the only available alternative for those experiencing difficult health problems when legitimate medical treatments have failed or when they lack access to appropriate health care " .
The most common complaints recorded were emotional problems ( including depression , anxiety and stress ) , sleep difficulties , problems with concentration and physical pain .
The teens ' experiences with the medical system were uniformly negative .
The authors said , " Youth who reported they had been prescribed drugs such as Ritalin , Prozac or sleeping pills , stopped using them because they did not like how these drugs made them feel or found them ineffective .
For these kids , the purpose of smoking marijuana was not specifically about getting high or stoned " .
The authors emphasize that the unmet medical needs of these teens are of key importance in these findings .
In contrast to the unpleasant side effects of prescribed medications and long , ineffective legal therapies , cannabis provided these adolescents with immediate relief for a variety of health concerns .
Of course , cannabis is n't completely harmless , but as one of the respondents noted , " It 's not good for you , but then again , neither is McDonald 's and a lot of other things " .

Today 's entry is a collection shared by photographer Peter Carr , from an event in Liverpool , England last year .
Said Peter : " As part of Liverpool 's Capital of Culture year , the French group La Machine were commissioned to create a large piece of street theatre , on the scale of their earlier work , the Sultan 's Elephant .
Many were expecting to see something using the iconic Liverbirds , the symbol of the city but instead we got a spider .
The total cost of the event was £ 1.8 million and caused some complaints about how the funds could better be used .
It also attracted protests from arachnophobe groups about how it would terrify some people .
Despite these complaints the event drew in over 200,000 people in the few days it was on and produced something wondrous that got everyone in the region talking . "

The banking system of Europe is at the edge of the abyss .
A brief story by The Telegraph revealed this last week .
The original was almost immediately deleted .
A new version was substituted .
You can see the original headline on Google :
European banks may need £ 16.3 trillion bail - out , EC document warns …
There are dozens of these links .
I read the story last week .
I saved the link .
But , lo and behold , when I clicked my saved link on Monday morning , the story did not mention a specific figure .
There was a reason for this .
The editors at The Telegraph had taken out the following paragraphs :
European Commission officials have estimated that impaired assets may amount to 44 pc of EU bank balance sheets .
The Commission estimates that so - called financial instruments in the trading book total £ 12.3 trillion ( 13.7 trillion euros ) , equivalent to about 33 pc of EU bank balance sheets .
In addition , so - called ‘ available for sale instruments ’ worth £ 4trillion ( 4.5 trillion euros ) , or 11 pc of balance sheets , are also added by the Commission to arrive at the headline figure of £ 16.3 trillion .
Fortunately , web sites around the globe have posted the deleted paragraphs .
Converted into dollars , £ 16.3 trillion are the equivalent of $ 25 trillion .
The original paragraphs can be found in several links in the Google list of headlines .
Why did the editors do this ?
A call from some government bureaucrat ?
Or the realization that the article might start a bank run ?
I think the latter .
In either case , it ’s scary .
The current article begins with a lie : “ Last updated : 6:34 GMT , 11 Feb 2009 . ”
WHAT THE EUROPEAN ESTABLISHMENT IS FACING NOWThe original February 11 story was a shocker .
The author claims to have seen a secret European Commission report .
The report estimates that losses ( write - downs ) by European banks will be in the range of $ 25 trillion .
If true , then to save the banking system , European governments will have to find an extra $ 25 trillion , fast .
There is only one source of such funding : the central banks , mainly the European Central Bank ( ECB ) .
For comparison ’s sake , consider the $ 700 billion banking bailout in the United States last fall .
Of this , only about half has been spent .
That was sufficient bailing wire and chewing gum to keep the American banking system going .
More will be needed , but so far , this has sufficed .
The Federal Reserve did a lot of asset swaps in 2008 — Treasury debt for toxic assets — and pumped in an extra trillion dollars or so .
But the system has held .
Adding these together — the increase in the monetary base and $ 350 billion in bailout money — the total is around $ 1.5 trillion .
Then think “ $ 25 trillion . ”
This is a sobering thought for some , and a reason to get unsober , fast , for others .
The European Central Bank will have to serve as the lender of last resort .
There are over a dozen national EC governments .
How will they coordinate their respective bailouts ?
Think of a dozen Barney Franks and a dozen Nancy Pelosis .
Think of a dozen Henry Paulsons .
Think of a dozen Gordon Browns .
Terrifying , is n’t it ?
Here is the story , as airbrushed by the editors .
“ Estimates of total expected asset write - downs suggest that the budgetary costs — actual and contingent — of asset relief could be very large both in absolute terms and relative to GDP in member states , ” the EC document , seen by The Daily Telegraph , cautioned .
Very large ?
That ’s it ?
Just very large ?
Twenty - five trillion dollars in losses are merely very large ?
That is twice the size of the gross domestic product of European Union .
It is not as though there is a lot of time to deal with this .
Bank runs can take place very fast .
What if Europeans try to pull out currency ?
There will not be enough currency .
So , they will move their assets to American or Japanese banks .
They will have to sell their domestic currencies to buy dollars and yen .
The euro will crater .
“ It is essential that government support through asset relief should not be on a scale that raises concern about over - indebtedness or financing problems . ”
Wait a minute .
If asset relief is not on this scale , then what will sustain a bankrupt European banking system ?
You are telling me that these banks are sitting on top of $ 25 trillion in losses , and this can be concealed ?
Does no one audit these banks ?
The secret 17 - page paper was discussed by finance ministers , including the Chancellor Alistair Darling on Tuesday .
National leaders and EU officials share fears that a second bank bail - out in Europe will raise government borrowing at a time when investors — particularly those who lend money to European governments — have growing doubts over the ability of countries such as Spain , Greece , Portugal , Ireland , Italy and Britain to pay it back .
National leaders apparently have a clear perception of the public ’s lack of faith in specific governments ’ ability to repay .
But that does not answer the crucial question : “ What are the depositors ’ fears regarding their individual banks ? ”
It ’s one thing for a government to be unable to pay back loans over the next two decades .
Of course they will not pay it back .
No national debt is ever paid back .
It is rolled over .
It ’s another thing to deal with bank runs .
The Commission figure is significant because of the role EU officials will play in devising rules to evaluate “ toxic ” bank assets later this month .
New moves to bail out banks will be discussed at an emergency EU summit at the end of February .
The EU is deeply worried at widening spreads on bonds sold by different European countries .
In line with the risk , and the weak performance of some EU economies compared to others , investors are demanding increasingly higher interest to lend to countries such as Italy instead of Germany .
Ministers and officials fear that the process could lead to vicious spiral that threatens to tear both the euro and the EU apart .
Ministers and officials have got the picture .
They are facing a breakdown of Europe ’s economy .
If the bailouts are insufficiently large in every nation to reduce depositors ’ fears regarding their banks , there will be a rush out of the euro and into dollars and yen .
If the bailouts are sufficiently large to stem the tide on bank fears , then there will be a rush by bond investors out of government bonds .
This will make the existing recession much worse .
If each country has widely different rates , the euro will break down .
The poorer countries will borrow at low rates from the European Central Bank .
The Germans will revolt .
They could demand an end to the ECB , which will have become a welfare agency for the Mediterranean governments .
That would end the euro .
That would end the attempt to create a new European order .
This thought brings to mind one of Johnny Mercer ’s masterpieces .
So you met someone who set you back on your heels — goody , goody You met someone and now you know how it feels — goody , goody
You gave him your heart too , just as I gave mine to you And he broke it in little pieces , now how do you do ?
You lie awake just singing the blues all night — goody , goodyAnd you think that love ’s a barrel of dynamiteHooray and hallelujah , you had it coming to y’aGoody goody for him , goody goody for meI hope you ’re satisfied , you rascal you , I hope you ’re satisfied ’ cause you got yours
But I digress .
“ Such considerations are particularly important in the current context of widening budget deficits , rising public debt levels and challenges in sovereign bond issuance , ” the EC paper warned .
These considerations are indeed important .
But solutions are a lot more important .
The report is 17 pages long .
The solutions — if any — will be a lot longer .
SO FAR , SO GOOD
So far , the euro has not collapsed .
It has fallen , but there is no rush for the exits .
Why not ?
These answers come to mind .
The story is not true : no such document .
The document is wrong : banks are not really that much in the hole .
The banks are in the hole , but public faith in their governments remains high .
The report is true , but it is not believed by currency speculators .
The report is true , but currency speculators believe that the governments and central banks can handle it without major shifts in currency values .
European bank stocks have fallen since the article was published , but they are not in free - fall .
In my view , the European public still has faith that the governments and the central banks will successfully intervene to restore commercial banks .
But if the original article was correct , that 44 % of bank balance sheets have disappeared , then the public is living in la-la land .
The entire structure of Europe ’s capital markets is at risk .
Or , I should say , what remains of the capital markets is at risk .
How are governments going to replenish lost capital ?
It ’s gone .
It ’s missing in action .
EASTERN EUROPE
Ambrose Evans - Pritchard has explained this in a Telegraph article published on February 15 .
If mishandled by the world policy establishment , this debacle is big enough to shatter the fragile banking systems of Western Europe and set off round two of our financial Gotterdammerung .
He was referring to loans to Eastern Europe .
He used Austrian banking as the example .
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) says bad debts will top 10 pc and may reach 20 pc .
The Vienna press said Bank Austria and its Italian owner Unicredit face a “ monetary Stalingrad ” in the East . . . .
Stephen Jen , currency chief at Morgan Stanley , said Eastern Europe has borrowed $ 1.7 trillion abroad , much on short - term maturities .
It must repay — or roll over — $ 400 bn this year , equal to a third of the region ’s GDP .
Good luck .
The credit window has slammed shut .
Not even Russia can easily cover the $ 500 bn dollar debts of its oligarchs while oil remains near $ 33 a barrel .
The budget is based on Urals crude at $ 95 .
Russia has bled 36 pc of its foreign reserves since August defending the rouble .
“ This is the largest run on a currency in history , ” said Mr Jen .
This reminds me of the bankruptcy of Long - Term Capital Management in 1998 .
That hedge fund had bought ruble - denominated assets on a leveraged basis : 30 to one .
When the Russian central bank failed to defend the ruble , LTCM went bust in a few days .
It had to be bailed out by $ 3.6 billion in loans from New York banks .
Today , the European banks are gutted , not a lone hedge fund .
Russia is going belly - up .
It will have to liquidate most or all of its reserves of Western currencies .
It has stopped buying U.S. Treasury debt .
It is selling .
In Poland , 60 pc of mortgages are in Swiss francs .
The zloty has just halved against the franc .
Hungary , the Balkans , the Baltics , and Ukraine are all suffering variants of this story .
As an act of collective folly — by lenders and borrowers — it matches America ’s sub - prime debacle .
There is a crucial difference , however .
European banks are on the hook for both .
US banks are not .
Almost all East bloc debts are owed to West Europe , especially Austrian , Swedish , Greek , Italian , and Belgian banks .
En plus , Europeans account for an astonishing 74pc of the entire $ 4.9 trillion portfolio of loans to emerging markets .
They are five times more exposed to this latest bust than American or Japanese banks , and they are 50 pc more leveraged ( IMF data ) .
This is the ringing of the bell .
The bell of the Great Depression of the 1930 ’s rang on Wall Street in October 1929 .
But that was not the cause of the Great Depression .
The causes were these : ( 1 ) monetary base expansion in the 1920s , ( 2 ) the cessation of this expansion in 1929 ; ( 3 ) the governments ’ raising of tariff and trade barriers in 1930 all over the West , and ( 4 ) the collapse of the Austria ’s Credit Anstalt Bank in 1931 .
In the USA , we saw the first two , 2000 — 2007 .
Central banks will inflate to keep any major bank from collapsing .
But the trend is ominous .
Russia and Eastern Europe are gonners .
European banks that lent to them are , too .
So is the purchasing power of the euro — and maybe even the actual euro .
I can see Germany cutting and running sometime before 2011 .
Evans - Pritchard pulls no punches .
This is a gutsy forecast .
Whether it takes months , or just weeks , the world is going to discover that Europe ’s financial system is sunk , and that there is no EU Federal Reserve yet ready to act as a lender of last resort or to flood the markets with emergency stimulus .
If he is correct about the inability of the ECB to imitate the Federal Reserve System , this means a collapse of the banks .
That means the collapse of Europe ’s economy .
“ This is much worse than the East Asia crisis in the 1990s , ” said Lars Christensen , at Danske Bank .
“ There are accidents waiting to happen across the region , but the EU institutions do n’t have any framework for dealing with this .
The day they decide not to save one of these one countries will be the trigger for a massive crisis with contagion spreading into the EU . ”
He ends with this : “ If one spark jumps across the eurozone line , we will have global systemic crisis within days .
Are the firemen ready ? ”
The capital markets do not indicate agreement with his assessment .
People still trust the banking system .
Generally , I trust capital markets rather than journalists .
But I think the report is too explosive to ignore .
I think the optimism of investors is greater than the optimism of European bankers , bureaucrats , and newspaper editors .
CONCLUSION
The West ’s economy really is at the edge of a leveraged disaster .
The politicians know only one answer : deficit spending .
The central bankers have only one significant tool : monetary inflation .
The speed of events is increasing .
The markets do n’t reflect this yet .
This gives time to a few people to get out .
But the vast majority can not get out .
There are too few escape hatches open .

Winston Churchill : “ An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile , hoping it will eat him last . ”
They like to call themselves “ realists , ” but their proper name is “ appeasers . ”
They follow in the hollow footsteps of Neville Chamberlain , who signed an agreement with Hitler , believing it signalled “ peace in our time . ”
But it only encouraged the Fuhrer to believe that there was no will in the West to resist the onslaught of Nazi terror , and thus hastened the onset of the Second World War .
As Churchill darkly told Chamberlain upon his return to London , “ You were given the choice between war and dishonor .
You chose dishonor and you will have war . ”
A group of today ’s appeasers sent a letter to President - elect Obama just before the Inauguration ( so that it was apparently drafted during the Gaza fighting ) , calling on him to negotiate with Hamas .
Others , such as the British Government , are undertaking negotiations with Hezbollah .
Vice President Joe Biden wants talks with the Taliban .
The pro-Israel Washington Institute wants to tone down the language we use , recommending we stop using phrases like “ war on terror , ” “ global insurgency , ” even “ the Muslim world . ”
The president himself wants talks with Iran , as do numerous columnists , such as the New York Times ’s Roger Cohen .
Secretary of State Clinton has dispatched diplomats to Damascus to talk to Bashar Assad .
The rationale for this surge in talks was provided in a recent issue of Newsweek , whose cover was in Islamic green , with a title in both Arabic and English : “ Radical Islam is a Fact .
Get Used to It . ”
The lead essay was produced by Fareed Zakaria , and called for a more “ sophisticated approach ” to the Islamic world .
Zakaria argued that many of the radical Islamist groups are not part of a unified global movement against the West , that they had “ local ” grievances , and that these grievances could be dealt with one by one , presumably leading the groups to make peace with us .
The top “ local grievance ” is invariably the Arab - Israeli conflict .
Thus , General Scowcroft , one of the artisans of the failed policies of the George H.W. Bush Administration ( the one that confessed failure to grasp “ the vision thing ” ) , and one of the signatories of the letter to Obama , blandly remarked “ I see no reason not to talk to Hamas . ”
“ The main gist , ” he intoned , “ is that you need to push hard on the Palestinian peace process .
Do n’t move it to the end of your agenda and say you have too much to do .
And the US needs to have a position , not just hold their coats while they sit down . ”
The full list of signatories :
– former national security advisers Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft ;
–former Republican senators Chuck Hagel and Nancy Kassebaum Baker ;
–former House International Relations Committee chairman Lee Hamilton ;
–former World Bank president James Wolfensohn ;
–former United Nations ambassador Thomas Pickering ;
– former US trade representative Carla Hills ;
–former White House special counsel , Theodore Sorensen ;
–US / Middle East Project President Henry Siegman ;
–current Obama economic adviser Paul Volcker .
All are old enough to remember that similar claims were made about Communism during the Cold War .
When President Reagan proclaimed that the Soviet Empire was destined to fail , brought the full array of American power to bear on the world Communist movement , and called upon the West to begin planning for the post - Soviet world , he was denounced as an unsophisticated and dangerous hawk .
Did n’t he understand , his critics asked , that there was an enormous variety of “ Communist ” movements and parties , and that many of them were quite independent of the Kremlin ?
From Katherine Graham of the Washington Post to the usual editorialists on the left , Reagan was urged to take it easy on the likes of the Italian , Spanish and French Communist Parties , the so - called “ Eurocommunists . ”
The very same Professor Brzezinski who today calls for talks with Hamas , then argued that “ Eurocommunism ” was a mortal threat to the Soviet Union , and said that the success of the Eurocommunists would wreck international Communism .
It was not so .
In the years that followed , despite their local grievances and despite distinct differences in tone , the Eurocommunists remained loyal Communists .
And when the Soviet Empire fell , they fell along with it .
So it will be with Hezbollah , Hamas and the Taliban .
Just as the Eurocommunists could not survive without the constant aid , guidance , and funding from the Kremlin , so the various terrorist groups cannot long survive without Iran and the dark side of the Pakistani Government and the Saudi Royal Family .
Instead of bringing American power to bear on the terror masters in Tehran , Damascus , Islamabad and Riyadh , the appeasers warn that anything we do will only make things worse , just as the Cold War appeasers said that Reagan would make things worse with the Soviet Union .
Martin Kramer noted that this case had been made quite emphatically by Ambassador Chas Freeman , the recently fallen nominee to head up the National Intelligence Council .
Freeman opposed adding Hamas and Hezbollah to the State Department ’s list of terrorist organizations , despite Hezbollah ’s attacks on Americans in the 1980s ( and , Martin should have added , the 1990s , as at Khobar Towers ) , and Hamas ’ suicide bombings of innocent Israelis .
“ By openly stating and taking action to make them — to declare that we are their enemy , we invite them to extend their operations in the United States or against Americans abroad . ”
In others words , appeasers like Freeman and the others advocate pre-emptive capitulation and appeasement in the hopes that the groups will only target innocents living in the Middle East .
One could not ask for a better example of Churchill ’s definition of an appeaser .
This idea is both morally bankrupt and strategically dangerous because it fails to recognize the long - term , worldwide ambition of these groups .
Zakaria writes as if radical Islam will destroy itself , if only we are patient and sophisticated .
In the end , time is on our side .
Bin Ladenism has already lost ground in almost every Muslim country .
Radical Islam will follow the same path .
Wherever it is tried — in Afghanistan , in Iraq , in parts of Nigeria and Pakistan — people weary of its charms very quickly .
The truth is that all Islamists , violent or not , lack answers to the problems of the modern world .
They do not have a world view that can satisfy the aspirations of modern men and women .
We do .
It is true that “ bin Ladenism ” has lost appeal , but that is primarily because it lost the war in Iraq , and has taken severe beatings in Lebanon and Gaza .
Nothing is more devastating to a messianic movement–and radical islam is precisely that –than defeat on the battlefield .
The jihadis claim that victory comes from God , thus the clear import of their defeat is that God is not on their side .
That is why their defeat in Iraq was so momentous , and why we must aim to defeat the jihadi regimes , above all those in Damascus and Tehran .
Zakaria is quite wrong to say that the radical jihadis “ lack answers to the problems of the modern world . ”
They do have answers , very appealing answers , not only to the problems of the modern world but to the most profound questions of human existence .
They are ancient answers , barbaric answers , but they have considerable appeal to many Muslims , especially if we stand back and permit them to extend their sway .
It is quite true , as Zakaria says , that most people would prefer to live in a more civilized manner , but the reason that the jihadis failed in Iraq and Afghanistan is because they were beaten by the greatest instrument of freedom in the modern world –the American military –not because the locals tired of living in a sharia state .
The overwhelming majority of Iranians detest their lives in the Islamic Republic , but the mullahs continue to rule because the West has lacked the will to defeat them and make it possible for the Iranian people to live in freedom .
The current appeasers have less excuse than the British Prime Minister , who thought he could forestall and perhaps even avoid a war with the Third Reich .
If they were really realists , the appeasers of today would recognize that we are already at war , and that , just as in the epic struggle against Nazism and Fascism , the only proper mission for the West is victory .
Instead , they seek dishonor , and the effect of their dishonorable campaign is to encourage our enemies , weaken our will , condemn the victims of radical Islam to death , torture , and misery , and hasten the day when we will be forced to fight on a much larger scale , perhaps even in our own land .
Churchill put it best the day he became Prime Minister :
Senators Who Snagged the Most Pork in This Year 's Spending
NEW YORK , March 5 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. market regulator is more than quadrupling the transaction fees it charges exchanges -- which in turn pass them on to investors -- in response to plunging stock prices .
The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that it would charge $ 25.70 per $ 1 million in securities sales , up from the current $ 5.60 , for transactions on exchanges and the private over - the - counter markets .
The new fees take effect in April .
The regulator said it needed to boost its take to reach the targeted collection amount of $ 1.02 billion in fiscal 2009 .
The current transaction fee is among the lowest the SEC has ever charged ; the new fees are closer to previous years .
The SEC regularly makes midyear fee adjustments if it calculates its target will not be met .
U.S. stock markets have fallen to multiyear lows in recent months .
Meanwhile , the SEC is probing an increasing number of high - profile and costly cases , including separate frauds allegedly committed by billionaires Bernard Madoff and Allen Stanford .
John Giesea , president and chief executive of the Securities Traders Association , said the increase was expected .
“ The emotional reaction is that this is not a shock to the system , ” he said .

A DUP politician who was accused of benefit fraud has been cleared of any wrongdoing after a judge threw out the case against him .
East Antrim MLA David Hilditch was accused of dishonestly failing to inform the Social Security Agency promptly about improvements to his condition which would affect his entitlement to Disability Living Allowance .
The former Mayor of Carrickfergus suffers from osteoarthritis — a degenerative bone and joint condition which limits his mobility — and had been receiving DLA , which is not means tested , for the condition .
However an investigation was launched into the politician , who sits on the Assembly body responsible for scrutinising social security payments , after it emerged he had taken part in a charity inter-parliamentary football tournament in London in 2007 .
During the hearing in Belfast yesterday the court was shown video evidence recorded by fraud investigators of Mr Hilditch walking without crutches on three separate occasions during a two - and - a - half - week period at the start of 2008 .
When asked by the prosecution if he could explain how he was able to move about unaided or in pain , the 46 - year - old replied : “ I see |myself in considerable pain in some of those shots .
It was a good day compared to some .
That 's the day I was |observed and I can't do anything about that . ”
The court also heard how the DUP MLA had contacted the Social Security Agency in February 2008 to inform them that he wanted to relinquish DLA before he knew he was being probed .
District Judge Ken Nixon dismissed the case , saying he was “ not satisfied that this complaint is made out ” .
Speaking after he was |acquitted , Mr Hilditch said he was “ very happy ” with the result , adding the past few months had “ taken its toll ” .

The world 's cheapest car , the Tata Nano , has gone on sale across India , with reports of customers queuing up to be the first to own one .
Tata Motors has opened bookings for the cars , which cost from 100,000 rupees ( $ 1,979 ; £ 1,366 ) each .
Deliveries of the vehicle will start in July , after production delays caused by a dispute over land at its Singur site .
Tata Motors says it is confident of strong demand for the Nano despite the global downturn in car sales .
The company is asking for a large chunk of the money to be paid before delivery , which is scheduled for July .
The booking fee , or deposit , required for the basic model is 95,000 rupees , rising to 140,000 for the luxury model which has a full price of 185,000 rupees .
In addition , applicants have had to pay up to 300 rupees for an application form .
In the first phase of production , 100,000 cars will be made .
They will be allocated to the first 100,000 customers picked at random from those who applied and paid deposits over the next three weeks .
' Milestone '
Tata Motors chairman Ratan Tata has described the 10 - foot ( three - metre ) long , five - seater car as a " milestone " .
He says he got the idea for the car from the common sight of Indian families perched precariously on motorbikes .
Tata hopes the low - cost of the car will encourage millions of Indians to trade up from their motorcycles .
Currently , there are about nine cars per 1,000 people in India .
How poverty passes from generation to generation is now becoming clearer .
The answer lies in the effect of stress on two particular parts of the brain
Panos
THAT the children of the poor underachieve in later life , and thus remain poor themselves , is one of the enduring problems of society .
Sociologists have studied and described it .
Socialists have tried to abolish it by dictatorship and central planning .
Liberals have preferred democracy and opportunity .
But nobody has truly understood what causes it .
Until , perhaps , now .
The crucial breakthrough was made three years ago , when Martha Farah of the University of Pennsylvania showed that the working memories of children who have been raised in poverty have smaller capacities than those of middle - class children .
Working memory is the ability to hold bits of information in the brain for current use — the digits of a phone number , for example .
It is crucial for comprehending languages , for reading and for solving problems .
Entry into the working memory is also a prerequisite for something to be learnt permanently as part of declarative memory — the stuff a person knows explicitly , like the dates of famous battles , rather than what he knows implicitly , like how to ride a bicycle .
Since Dr Farah 's discovery , Gary Evans and Michelle Schamberg of Cornell University have studied the phenomenon in more detail .
As they report in this week 's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , they have found that the reduced capacity of the memories of the poor is almost certainly the result of stress affecting the way that childish brains develop .
Dr Evans's and Dr Schamberg 's volunteers were 195 participants in a long - term sociological and medical study that Dr Evans is carrying out in New York state .
At the time , the participants were 17 years old .
All are white , and the numbers of men and women are about equal .
Stress in the city
To measure the amount of stress an individual had suffered over the course of his life , the two researchers used an index known as allostatic load .
This is a combination of the values of six variables : diastolic and systolic blood pressure ; the concentrations of three stress - related hormones ; and the body - mass index , a measure of obesity .
For all six , a higher value indicates a more stressful life ; and for all six , the values were higher , on average , in poor children than in those who were middle class .
Moreover , because Dr Evans 's wider study had followed the participants from birth , the two researchers were able to estimate what proportion of each child 's life had been spent in poverty .
That more precise figure , too , was correlated with the allostatic load .
The capacity of a 17 - year - old 's working memory was also correlated with allostatic load .
Those who had spent their whole lives in poverty could hold an average of 8.5 items in their memory at any time .
Those brought up in a middle - class family could manage 9.4 , and those whose economic and social experiences had been mixed were in the middle .
These two correlations do not by themselves prove that chronic stress damages the memory , but Dr Evans and Dr Schamberg then applied a statistical technique called hierarchical regression to the results .
They were able to use this to remove the effect of allostatic load on the relationship between poverty and memory discovered originally by Dr Farah .
When they did so , that relationship disappeared .
In other words , the diminution of memory in the poorer members of their study was entirely explained by stress , rather than by any more general aspect of poverty .
To confirm this result , the researchers also looked at characteristics such as each participant 's birthweight , his mother 's age when she gave birth , the mother 's level of education and her marital status , all of which differ , on average , between the poor and the middle classes .
None of these characteristics had any effect .
Nor did a mother 's own stress levels .
That stress , and stress alone , is responsible for damaging the working memories of poor children thus looks like a strong hypothesis .
It is also backed up by work done on both people and laboratory animals , which shows that stress changes the activity of neurotransmitters , the chemicals that carry signals from one nerve cell to another in the brain .
Stress also suppresses the generation of new nerve cells in the brain , and causes the “ remodelling ” of existing ones .
Most significantly of all , it shrinks the volume of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus .
These are the parts of the brain most closely associated with working memory .
Children with stressed lives , then , find it harder to learn .
Put pejoratively , they are stupider .
It is not surprising that they do less well at school , end up poor as adults and often visit the same circumstances on their own children .
Dr Evans's and Dr Schamberg 's study does not examine the nature of the stress that the children of the poor are exposed to , but it is now well established that poor adults live stressful lives , and not just for the obvious reason that poverty brings uncertainty about the future .
The main reason poor people are stressed is that they are at the bottom of the social heap as well as the financial one .
Sir Michael Marmot , of University College London , and his intellectual successors have shown repeatedly that people at the bottom of social hierarchies experience much more stress in their daily lives than those at the top — and suffer the consequences in their health .
Even quite young children are socially sensitive beings and aware of such things .
So , it may not be necessary to look any further than their place in the pecking order to explain what Dr Evans and Dr Schamberg have discovered in their research into the children of the poor .
The Bible says , “ the poor you will always have with you . ”
Dr Evans and Dr Schamberg may have provided an important part of the explanation why .
Mysteriously , about a week ago , Dan , the program manager designing most of the new features in FogBugz 7 , came to ask me what features I thought should go in the timesheet reporting plug -in .
The timesheet reporting plug - in ?
What ’s that ?
It sounded dangerously close to a feature that could be used by managers to see reports on developers ’ timesheets .
Like , something a weak manager would use to figure out who is the best developer on the team or to make sure everybody is pounding away at the code at a suitable pace .
We have a theory , here , that this is a bad idea .
Using timesheets as a performance metric can lead to only one thing : bad data in timesheets .
The first time your boss comes into your office and gives you grief because it looks like you only did 7 hours of work yesterday , you ’re going to make sure that never happens again .
And then , suddenly , behold , the timesheets show everyone working 12 hour days , and all the data in the timesheets becomes instantly bogus .
And EBS , our statistical technique for predicting ship dates , suddenly stops working , because you ’re feeding it data that is meant to get your boss to stop bugging you , not accurate data .
Now , this theory may be completely off the wall , but it is our theory , and until we hear something better , that ’s the one we ’re going with .
So our policy has been that if you want to get the timesheet data , well , yes , you can , we ’ll give you a way to get it in CSV format or XML format or something and then you can abuse it all you want … go ahead , hang yourself , but we ’re sure as heck not going to make it easy for you with a pretty report all tied up with a bow that you might click on by accident , as you browse around , because thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind .
Anyway , I said to Dan , “ What the heck ?
Who on earth approved that feature ? ” and walked down the hall to the FogBugz team to beg them not to do it .
Correction : I razor - scootered down the hall .
It ’s extremely undignified ; I ’m way too old for childish toys ; but jeez it ’s like a whole city block from my office to the FogBugz team ’s office , so , OK , it ’s pathetic , but razor scooting is the fastest way to get there .
I am not sure what the FogBugz team will decide … it ’s their call , not mine .
Apparently nice people email us and ask for that exact feature and offer to give us little green rectangular things that can be exchanged for other goods and services if we do the feature .
So it ’s a dilemma , and I ’m the one who knows the least about it , so I hope they wo n’t listen to me .
Well , secretly , I hope they will , but do n’t tell them that .
Sometimes they do and sometimes they do n’t .
But anyway … that ’s not the point of the story .
The point of the story is that today I was reviewing some video footage to see if there was anything worth including in the next documentary Lerone is making about software development .
And the footage I was reviewing was of a meeting several weeks ago to go over the final list of features for FogBugz 7 and make sure they all had the right priorities assigned to them .
And there , on the video , I had to watch myself listening to Babak explaining the timesheet reporting plug - in , and the record shows that I appeared to understand what was being said to me , and , I ’m afraid to admit , I appear to have given my tacit approval to the feature .
AHEM .
In short , I ’m turning into one of those crazy bosses that approves things , and then gets upset when you do them .
This keeps happening .
I must be driving people crazy .
In my defense , usually what happens is that the thing is described to me in general , vague terms and it sounds great , and I say , “ sounds great ! ” and then I see the thing a little bit closer , and it ’s awful , and by this time , I ’ve forgotten about the time I said it sounds great .
Just assume I have amnesia or something .
I ca n’t form new memories .
Did I tell you about the razor scooter yet ?
OH IT ’S FUN .
The solution , of course , is what I ’ve been saying all along .
STOP FRIGGIN ’ LISTENING TO ME .
I do n’t know what I ’m talking about .
If you work for me , you ’re welcome to get my advice , but you have to make your own decision because chances are you ’ve thought MUCH MORE about the issue than I have and in fact we probably hired you because you ’re smarter than I am .
Diabetes Epidemic and Complications
Recently I attended a wellness fair called “ 50 and Fabulous ” held in Fairfax , VA .
There were approximately 70 vendors .
There were a couple of diabetes organizations and many others like the optometrist and the hospital were passing out literature on diabetes .
So I wondered , how prevalent is diabetes ?
According to an article in Health News , Catherine Cowie of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , a part of the National Institutes of Health , says : “ We ’re facing a diabetes epidemic that shows no signs of abating , judging from the number of individuals with pre-diabetes . ”
Additionally , researchers say one - third of adults in the United States 65 and over have diabetes and another 30 % are pre-diabetic .

Look at this list of diabetic complications from the FDA :
Heart disease : Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people with diabetes .
Three out of four diabetes - related deaths are caused by heart and blood vessel ( cardiovascular ) disease .
People with diabetes are 2 - 4 times more likely to have heart disease than persons without diabetes .
Even people with type 2 diabetes who do not have heart disease have an increased risk of having a heart attack .
Blindness :
Over time , high blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels that feed the retina of the eye .
In nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR ) , an early stage of diabetic eye disease , the blood vessels may leak fluid .
This may cause the retina to swell and vision to blur , a condition called diabetic macular edema .
In advanced or proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) , abnormal new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina .
The abnormal blood vessels do n’t supply the retina with normal blood flow .
In addition , they may eventually pull on the retina and cause it to detach .
Kidney Failure :
Over time , high blood sugar levels can damage the kidneys .
Even when drugs and diet are able to control diabetes , the disease can lead to kidney disease ( diabetic nephropathy ) and kidney failure .
Healthy kidneys act like filters to clean the blood of waste products and extra fluid .
Damaged kidneys do not clean the blood well .
Instead , waste products and fluid build up in the blood .
Foot Ulcers : People with diabetes are at risk for foot injuries due to numbness caused by nerve damage ( diabetic neuropathy ) and low blood flow to the legs and feet .
The most serious injury is a foot ulcer .
Diabetic foot ulcers are at very high risk of becoming infected , and sometimes they can not be healed .
Non-healing foot ulcers are a frequent cause of amputation in people with diabetes .
Patients with foot ulcers may use wound dressings , skin substitutes , or other treatments to protect and heal their skin .
Wow !
Is n’t this list enough to send shivers through your spine ?
Some people prefer to stay on diabetes medication to control their blood sugar level , but most prefer to do it naturally through diet and lifestyle changes .
If you ’re in the latter category , what are you doing ?

Men in England and Wales aged between 20 and 24 are just as likely to be abused by their partners as women in the same age group .
Campaigners claim not enough is being done by the police , social services and the government to tackle the problem .
Read one victim 's story .
Mark from Buckinghamshire , not his real name , was a victim of abuse for nearly a decade .
He met his girlfriend in a bar .
" As the place was closing I heard this loud voice demanding another double Jack Daniels .
We chatted for a while and I walked her home .
Six weeks later she was pregnant with my first child , " he told Newsbeat .
Mark says the domestic violence started about three months into the relationship .
I 've been stabbed with scissors in my thumb and my wrist .
I 've had a marble chopping board smashed over my head which needed 12 stitches
Mark describes some of the abuse he received " Quite early on there was an incident where somebody had come to her flat , knocking on the window in the early hours of the morning .
It turned out to be her ex-partner .
" She was incredibly abusive to him .
I said to her , ' Listen .
If you 've got some things and issues to sort out with your ex , then that 's no problem .
I 'll leave .
You get on and do what you need to do .
I 'll speak to you tomorrow ' .
" As I went to leave her flat , she grabbed a carving knife and was waving it .
She was n't directly threatening me with it but it was in her hand .
" And she said , ' Do n't walk out on me .
Do n't walk away from me ' .
And alarm bells were ringing .
" Obviously I 'd only known her two weeks .
And with hindsight being as wonderful as it is I should have just kept walking . "
' Stabbed with scissors '
Mark says that early incident in their relationship escalated to much more serious abuse .
" I 've been stabbed with scissors in my thumb and my wrist .
I 've had a marble chopping board smashed over my head which needed 12 stitches , " he said .
Male domestic violence 6.4 % of men in England and Wales between the ages of 20 and 24 say they were victims of abuse in 2008 5.4 % of women in the same age group reported being victims of domestic violence
Two in 10 men have experienced domestic abuse since the age of 16 Three in 10 women have experienced the same abuse
One in six men will be abused by their partner in their lifetime " She would put cigarettes out on me .
She 'd send the kids into the back garden to play and then she 'd corner me in the front room and just attack me .
" She 'd be scratching my face , kicking , punching , spitting in my face .
That was a regular thing . "
Mark says the physical abuse was n't that hard to deal with , but the psychological manipulation was the worst part because he had no control over it .
" Some nights maybe she'd go out and go missing , turn her phone off , and then come back and say she 'd been with another man .
All that was going on . "
Have you been the victim of male domestic abuse ?
Mark has been asked lots of times why he did n't walk away from the relationship but says it 's not that easy to get out of an abusive relationship .
" You know that you 've got to leave but you have to go through a whole process to get to the point where you 've actually got the strength to walk out that door .
" Also when there are children involved , how difficult is it to walk out of the house with your kids there ?
It 's impossible . "
' Scarred for life '
Mark finally left his girlfriend after eight years .
His children are now being looked after by someone else .
He says leaving his kids was the hardest part of the process and why he waited so long to leave his abusive partner .
" I 'd packed a little rucksack secretly the night before .
I 'd phoned a friend the day before and said to him , ' Could he wait at the bottom of the road in his van ? '
" She often used to lock the doors and the windows of the house so I could n't get out .
She was worried about me leaving .
" She eventually fell asleep and I grabbed my rucksack and ran down the road with my heart pounding , jumped into my friend 's van .
" We drove along the seafront at half two in the morning .
I threw my keys and my phone in the sea .
That was my way of saying to myself , ' OK .
I 'm starting a new life ' .
" To be honest I wish I 'd done it years before .
But I stuck at it for the sake of the kids . "
" I do n't think I 'll ever recover .
I know I wo n't recover from what I went through .
I 've just learnt now how to live with it .
" But I 'll carry the scars for the rest of my life . "

Pyongyang defies international condemnation of plans to launch rocket it says will put communications satellite in orbit
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
North Korea today threatened to shoot down any US spy planes that encroached on its air space as it defied international pressure to abandon a planned missile launch .
Pyongyang has vowed to go ahead with the launch – possibly this weekend – of a rocket it says will put a communications satellite into orbit .
It said the North would destroy any US aircraft sent to spy on the launch site .
The US and Japan believe North Korea is using the launch to test a long - range Taepodong - 2 missile , and has warned of a robust diplomatic response if it goes ahead .
Both countries have said they are prepared to shoot down boosters or other debris from the rocket in the event that the test fails and debris falls towards a " danger zone " over northern Japan .
In typically strongly - worded language , North Korean state radio accused the US of sending RC - 135 surveillance aircraft to monitor the launch site at Musudan - ri , on its north - eastern coast .
" If the brigandish US imperialists dare to infiltrate spy planes into our airspace to interfere with our peaceful satellite launch preparations , our revolutionary armed forces will mercilessly shoot them down , " the South Korean unification ministry quoted the broadcaster as saying .
The broadcast did not say how North Korea would engage the spy planes , which are capable of flying at high altitude .
Yesterday , North Korea accused the US and South Korea of conducting 190 aerial spying missions near the site last month .
Gordon Brown joined calls for Pyongyang to cancel the test , while the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , warned the regime would face " consequences " if it went ahead .
Those warning have so far been ignored , with images taken above the launch site showing a rocket , with a bulb - shaped tip that experts say looks more like a satellite than a warhead , already in place .
But a satellite launch would still enable the regime to test its missile technology , in violation of a 2006 UN resolution , and could be met with even harsher sanctions .
The International Crisis Group , a Brussels - based thinktank specialising in conflict resolution , urged restraint and warned that an overreaction by the US and its allies could threaten stalled multi-party talks on the North 's nuclear weapons programme .
" In the worst case , it could risk a war with potentially devastating damage to South Korea , Japan and the world economy , " the group said in a report .
China , North Korea 's only major ally , is expected to use its security council veto to block any attempts to impose tougher sanctions .

Peter Schiff on U.S. Bond markets and his possible 2010 Senate campaign
I 've been watching his commentary on CNBC panels since late 2006 , but I still just can't get enough of Peter Schiff .
Here he is on Canada 's BNN sounding bearish about the state of the economy , U.S. bonds markets and fiscal stimulus plans :
Schiff 's getting plenty of airtime here at the Shotgun Blog and all over the business channels because of his unrelenting warnings over the past few years of a coming US housing bubble collapse and financial crisis , but he 's also attracting attention of another sort .
Schiff , you may recall , was an economic advisor for Texas Congressman 's Ron Paul 's campaign for the Repubican presidential nomination .
Although Paul did not fare very well in the primaries , he energized a large activist base and met with historically unprecedented levels of online fundraising .
Near the end of 2008 , I contacted the team behind a sleek new website , Schiff2010.com which was trying to draft Peter Schiff to run as a Republican Senate candidate in 2010 in his home state of Connecticut .
Connecticut 's senior Senator Chris Dodd , chairman of the Banking Committee , has been recently implicated in a scandal involving receiving favourable rates from Countywide Financial and has also come under criticism his proclamations on the soundness of and Fannie and Freddie Mac and his status as the number one recipient of donations from the government - sponsored ( now government owned ) mortgage companies .
Chad Pearce , one of the Schiff2010.com grassroots website 's organizers told me how the project to draft Schiff came about :
Last July , we spoke with Schiff at Freedom Fest in Las Vegas for quite awhile .
During conversation , we asked him about running for office and " what would you do if a grassroots movement tried to get you in office ? "
He said he would be interested and would respond positively if someone tried , and more or less , " at the very least I would take the publicity , " implying that he would enjoy it even against extreme odds .
We have also talked with people close to Peter at EuroPacific Capital ( we are young investors ) and they are very excited about the project .
The website has been bouncing around the blogosphere and social networking sites like Digg , while adding new content and building up a mailing list .
The " Peter Schiff for Senate 2010 " facebook page now has about 500 supporters .
In the first of his Wednesday weekly radio broadcasts of the New Year , Schiff commented at length on the website and the committee behind it , saying that while he was not planning to run for Senate , he could be convinced and would n't rule it out .
He wished the effort well in their organization and fundraising but expressed his doubts about the difficulties of running a successful campaign and the effectiveness of holding a seat in the US Senate :
I 'm not running for anything , but apparently there 's an effort to convince me to run or to draft me .
They are trying to put together an organization and raise funds -- and they 're hoping , in the field of dreams " if you build it they will come " -- and if they can create an organization and fund it that they might be able to convince me to run for Senate .
I have no idea whether or not I would make myself a candidate for Senate , even if they did put together an organization to raise some money , I do n't know .
But it 's not a hundred percent that I would n't do it .
I do n't even know if they could even be successful , I have no idea how much they could raise , or how much is needed to try to have a legitimate campaign for Senate .
But the problem for me in deciding whether or not I wanted to run for Senate would be " what could I accomplish if I won ? "
Although I think winning would be a lot tougher than running -- but you know running -- anybody can run .
But I do n't know what I would be able to do as a Senator .
I know Ron Paul is in Congress and has n't been able to accomplish much as far as legislation ; he 's accomplished a lot recently , I think , with his campaign and his message has resonated with a lot of people , and I think that 's great , particularly a lot of younger people , and I was surprised because you generally think that the young people are more left - leaning ; the old expression was if you 're not a socialist by the time you 're 22 , you do n't have a heart and if you 're not a conservative by the time you 're 28 , you do n't have a head .
But a lot of young people are gravitating to Ron Paul .
I know myself [ that ] a lot of people on college campuses know who I am , and a lot of them know who I am because of my affiliation with Ron Paul .
I know its more powerful as a Senator -- instead of being one out of four - hundred - and something , you 're one out of a hundred -- but still , even if I had a Senate seat , I 'm one percent of one half of the Congress .
So what can you actually do ?
I 'm not trying to discourage this grassroots movement .
I wish them well , you never know if they can organize and if they can raise some money .
Worst case scenario if I do n't run , maybe they can find a productive use for the money in other candidates who do run , but that 's what 's going on .
I had nothing to do with the website , I had no idea or intention to run for anything .
My main goal is to build up my brokerage firm , EuroPacific Capital , and to spread the word of freedom and capitalism every avenue that I can , just as an American and a patriot , to get the word out -- and also as a businessman to try to promote my company and what I 'm trying to do through my company , which is trying to protect the wealth and the savings of as many Americans who understand what 's going on and who want to take actions to preserve their wealth before its gone .
UPDATE : Here 's is a video clip with the audio of some of that response :

Thanks to Peter Schiff and his book , I saved my retirement accounts and several other investments from large double digit losses in 2008 .
I was in some mutual funds in financial services and in several index funds .
After reading his book inI started selling in 2007 .
I saved myself a lot of money .
He was not 100 % right about the US dollar but I do credit him with providing good defensive advice .

Senator Schiff .
Think about it , Peter !
Anyway , he'd have a bully pulpit .
People in Connecticut who would n't sign up for his EuroPac e-mail list would sign up to receive e-mails from him as a Senator .
Also , he would be invited to talk on non-financial TV shows .
It would definitely help him spread the message of freedom and capitalism .
In the Senate , he'd have the power of filibuster .
He might be able to , although I know they 're stubborn as hell , sway some other Senators to his side and vote like him .
I think he should do it .
I 'd definitely donate to his campaign if he ran .

I think the online Ron Paul community would explode with excitement and donations if Peter announced his running .

I could n't agree more .
I 'd even move to CT .
just to vote for him .
Run !

I think tj is right on the money ( figuratively and literally ) .
This is what the CFL is about and I think Schiff could do a lot of good , as well as having a fair shot at winning with Paul 's support behind him .
He has the exposure and reputation for being accurate and knowledgeable .
Even if the adversity looks imposing , this has to start somewhere .
If Obama and Co. are determined to go down the same disastrous path weve been on then the CFL and people like Sciff need to stand up as often as possible .

We NEED Peter Schiff to get rid of Chris Dodd and bring some reason into the Senate .

GENEVA , April 29 ( Reuters ) - World Health Organization director - general Dr. Margaret
Chan raised the pandemic threat awareness level to 5 out of 6 on Wednesday , meaning the world is at imminent risk of a pandemic from H1N1 swine flu .
“ I have decided to raise the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 4 to phase 5 , ” Chan told a news briefing .
After a debate pitting compassion for those suffering from the pain of cancer or HIV - AIDS against concerns about abuse and violence from expanded availability of a " gateway drug , " the Minnesota Senate gave tentative approval Wednesday to the use of marijuana for medical purposes in the state .
The 36 - 28 vote came despite questions about whether the measure fully defines who would be eligible and whether it provides proper safeguards against potential abuse .
Law enforcement has consistently opposed medical marijuana , but Sen .
Steve Murphy , DFL - Red Wing , chief author of the bill ( S.F. 97 ) , said during debate that the measure is a medical issue , not one for " our brothers and sisters in blue . "
The Senate has approved medical marijuana legislation in the past , but it has always stalled in the House .
Advocates believe they have enough votes to pass it there this year , but it seems less likely they have enough to override any possible veto from Gov. Tim Pawlenty , who has expressed reservations about the bill .
The bill could be heard on the House floor next week .
" I'm here to tell you there is potential opportunity for abuse here , and kids are watching to see what we in the Legislature are going to do , " said Sen .
Bill Ingebrigtsen , R - Alexandria , a former county sheriff .
Sen . Julianne Ortman , R - Chanhassen , said she was concerned that the supply of marijuana will lead to theft and violence .
" Sections of Minnesota with storefronts in big cities and small cities will have signs that say marijuana is accessible and for sale , " she said .
Thirteen states have passed medical marijuana laws .
The Senate 's vote was preliminary but is a good barometer of the outcome of an official vote , which is likely to come today .
Instapundit , Malkin , and Joe the Plumber discuss politics for PJTV .
There is so much to love about this , I do n’t know where to start , but certainly Joe the Plumber bemoaning the lack of spending cuts and general program cuts in the stimulus bill was a highlight .
It is almost as if he does n’t have the first damned clue what he is talking about .
A close runner - up would be Instapundit heralding Bush ’s MBA as evidence of his awesome managerial skills .
There was just so much to love , it is hard to narrow down the “ best ” parts .
I really do n’t understand how bipartisanship is ever going to work when one of the parties is insane .
Imagine trying to negotiate an agreement on dinner plans with your date , and you suggest Italian and she states her preference would be a meal of tire rims and anthrax .
If you can figure out a way to split the difference there and find a meal you will both enjoy , you can probably figure out how bipartisanship is going to work the next few years .

I 'm turning into my father .
My father was born in 1933 .
He was a paperboy in the days when paperboys stood on city corners and shouted " Extra ! "
In my father 's home , the newspaper still is king .
He has two delivered daily .
He reads every inch of both .
He does the crossword puzzles in both , too -- with a pencil .
( Note to people under 25 : A pencil is a small , yellow stick that leaves a mark when its tip is pressed against paper . )
My father knows that people can do crossword puzzles on their computers -- and cell phones or BlackBerrys -- but the idea is nutty to him .
Only an idiot would bring electronic equipment into the bathroom .
To be sure , my father has shunned the communications marvels of modern times .
He uses my mother 's cell phone -- but only to avoid long - distance charges .
He has never sent or received e-mail .
He never searches the Web .
He uses the White Pages or Yellow Pages .
( Note to people under 35 : The White and Yellow Pages are thick directories of people and businesses that are left at your door once a year . )
And there are two other things my father will never do : use Facebook or Twitter .
Facebook.com is a social - networking Web site where people post important updates for their electronic " friends , " such as detailed descriptions of what they had for breakfast .
Twitter.com is similar to Facebook , except the descriptions are brief ( 140 characters or less ) : " Ate oatmeal today .
Was good . "
There certainly are upsides to these technologies .
The Wall Street Journal reports that Twitter -- with its ability to rapid fire messages to millions -- can be a powerful communications tool .
Sure , celebrities use it to update fans on their latest banalities , but emergency organizations are also using it to alert people during disasters .
As for Facebook , it is surely helpful to stay - at - home parents who are isolated from other adults .
There is an upside to swapping personal information , even if it is over the Internet .
Facebook has helped me locate -- and be located by -- friends I have n't talked to for years .
Some 300 million are using the tool ; there is a good chance people from your past are using the site , too .
Which brings us to the downside .
Maybe there is a reason your old friends and old girlfriends are old friends and old girlfriends .
Maybe you 've already told them everything you had to say -- with the exception of what you just ate for breakfast .
I was at a party recently where I was accused of being " old " -- I 'm 46 -- because I have never " drunk texted " friends ( or old friends or girlfriends ) .
( Note to people over 50 : texting is when you press both thumbs against a miniature cell - phone keypad to bastardize the English language . )
My generation preferred to " drunk e- mail " old friends and girlfriends .
The generation before mine preferred to " drunk phone call . "
My father 's generation would " drunk walk to the person 's house and knock on the door . "
In any event , recent reports suggest that people are tiring of technology - enabled social networking .
Craig Kinsley , a professor of neuroscience at the University of Richmond , told the Associated Press why : humans crave contact and human interaction , but interaction over the Internet is without substance .
Which brings us to my father .
He has n't wasted a moment on superficial online communications .
He is doing just great in the real world of the White Pages , printed newspapers and books .
( Note to people under 25 : A book is a compact device in which words are printed on several pieces of paper ; the paper is glued to a spine . )
When my father wants to communicate , he approaches other human beings , usually my mother , and uses his voice .
Sometimes he uses facial expressions to emphasize a point .
I think he 's on to something .
Though I 'm beginning to use Twitter for useful and interesting updates -- and LinkedIn.com for business networking -- I do n't use Facebook much anymore .
I prefer to meet people for breakfast ( and see firsthand what they 're eating ) .
As I said , I 'm turning into my father .
Thank goodness .

JERUSALEM 
In a blunt and belligerent speech on his first day as Israel ’s new foreign minister , the hawkish nationalist Avigdor Lieberman declared Wednesday that “ those who wish for peace should prepare for war ” and that Israel was not obligated by understandings on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict reached at an American - sponsored peace conference in late 2007 .
“ Those who think that through concessions they will gain respect and peace are wrong , ” Mr. Lieberman said during a transfer ceremony at the Foreign Ministry .
“ It is the other way around ; it will lead to more wars . ”
His predecessor in the post of foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , a centrist , led Israel ’s negotiating team with the Palestinians in a year of intensive talks after the 2007 conference , held in Annapolis , Md .
The aim of the Annapolis process , as it became known , was to agree on the framework for a Palestinian state alongside Israel by the end of 2008 , a goal that was not achieved .
Rapid growth of cancer cells and their frequent divisions have their price : Cancer cells need considerably more energy than healthy cells .
Their metabolism runs at full speed and requires large amounts of micronutrients , particularly iron .
However , high levels of iron in the cell lead to the production of extremely harmful free radicals .
To protect itself from these , the cell inactivates free iron by binding it to what are called iron storage proteins .
Collaborating with physicians of the Dermatology Department of Mannheim University Hospitals , Dr. Karsten Gülow and Professor Dr. Peter Krammer , head of the Division of Immunogenetics at DKFZ , investigated Sézary 's disease ( also called Sézary syndrome ) , an extremely aggressive type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma .
The majority of currently available treatments are not really effective against this fatal type of cancer .
Using a molecular - biological trick , Gülow and colleagues succeeded in blocking the production of one of the iron storage proteins in lymphoma cells .
This leads to a rise in the level of free , non -bound iron in these cells .
The iron boosts the production of free oxygen radicals which cause oxidative stress and , thus , cause damage to the cancer cells and induce their death .
Healthy cells with their low iron level , however , survive the treatment unharmed .
The DKFZ researchers have already found evidence that this iron effect also works in other lymphomas .
They are now investigating whether selective release of iron may be a suitable approach for developing a novel cancer treatment .

The satirical puppet show Spitting Image used to have a rather cruel , but quite funny sketch where a pinstripe - suited , cigar - chewing Margaret Thatcher would stand shoulder to shoulder with to her male cabinet members in the House of Commons urinals .
Awkward pleasantries exchanged , she would zip up , leaving them able , once she had departed , to get on with the job in hand .
The suggestion was clear .
As a powerful woman , she was portrayed as more of an alpha male than any of the men in her cabinet .
Cruel , not the whole truth of course , but a striking image that caught something of her qualities at the time .
And a strong image of the paradoxes , pitfalls and projections faced by women finding success in the male dominated worlds of business and politics .
Psychologists have called this the queen bee syndrome – the way that many successful women feel compelled and conflicted , often at great personal cost , to act in traditionally masculine ways in order to get on in a largely male world .
" Play our game or get out , " is often the strong but totally implicit message in the typical boardroom .
In last week 's Observer , the business editor Ruth Sunderland explored the current economic crisis from a gendered perspective .
The mess , she suggests , was created by men and yet , she points out , it is these very same men who were gathered in Davos trying to clear it up .
Ms Sunderland argues that women must be more widely included in the economic debate and recognised for their roles in stimulating economic growth .
This is welcome stuff , but like the current economic debate itself , does not go far enough .
The issue is not just about women , or any under - represented group , entering into the economic discussions on their current terms , but about pointing out how bonkers some of the current terms are in the first place .
Do n't we need a new type of conversation that names the many absurdities inherent in our global economic rules and questions them from the off ?
For example , under the current rules for measuring growth in GDP , only activities that involve some transfer of money are economically relevant .
This means that the work of the world 's subsistence poor and the work of those raising children and building communities are on the whole considered irrelevant and unproductive by economists .
Similarly , the services provided to us free of charge by the planet are also economically invisible , because no money changes hands when we get say fresh air , or clean water .
If economically invisible , why should we expect politicians and business leaders in the game of chasing growth to really care about such things ?
At the same time wars , oil spills and crime waves can be good news for growth figures since they can all increase spending and production .
Under this bizarre logic the New Zealand MP and radical economist Marilyn Waring famously pointed out : " If you want a really productive oil tanker voyage , it 's a very good idea to ram your oil tanker into an iceberg .
The Exxon Valdez was the most productive oil tanker voyage in history . "
If the sanity of these sorts of basic economic assumptions are not up for debate , then does it even matter who is involved in the discussions ?
Nor should we just celebrate women 's roles as consumers or creators of economic growth .
We need to recognise that men and women alike are more than simply consumers or contributors to growth .
When I check in on my elderly neighbour in the snow , when I make time to chat ( during working hours ! ) with a friend having a hard time , when I just sit quietly with my partner after a long week , none of these things increases my consumption or contribution to growth .
But so what ?
They are all valuable , meaningful human activities – the real stuff of our lives .
Is n't it time for deeper conversations about whether increased consumption and economic growth necessarily leads to the things we really want ?
Economists such as Richard Layard point out the many discrepancies between the things that make people happy and provide meaning in life and the things that contribute to economic growth as measured under current rules .
Studies consistently show that beyond a certain level of material wellbeing ( roughly where the UK was in the 1960s ) , there is no increase in subjective happiness with increased GDP .
Environmental economist Paul Hawken goes even further in poking the rules of the economic game and its fixation on growth alone , on quantity rather than quality .
He points out that continual growth in any living system ( be it a human body , a forest or an elephant ) is unhealthy beyond an adolescent stage , and is associated in adult humans with tumours and cancers .
He suggests that as a culture we are still at an immature stage of development – and need to grow up pretty quickly .
Rather than discussing the roles of men and women in the economic crisis , we need to explore the unbalanced world views that all of us , men and women alike , have come to accept as normal in modern , industrial society .
In business and politics it is considered normal to focus exclusively on numbers , quantities , on whatever can easily be analysed into parts , measured and reported .
It is considered odd , and even " unprofessional " to place equal value on emotional experience , subjective well - being , relationships and seeing the world as a complex whole .
The quest for growth at any cost means many politicians and business leaders have come to focus only on a subset of human activity .
And much of what they focus on to stimulate growth creates no real happiness or wealth .
To paraphrase Einstein : " You ca n't solve a problem with the same kind of thinking that created it . "

On programming language design
Andrej Bauer
, ,
In a recent post I claimed that Python ’s lambda construct is broken .
This attracted some angry responses by people who thought I was confused about how Python works .
Luckily there were also many useful responses from which I learnt .
This post is a response to comment 27 , which asks me to say more about my calling certain design decisions in Python crazy .
Language design is like architecture .
The architect is bound by the rules of nature , he has to take into account the properties of the building materials , and he must never forget the purpose that the building will serve .
Likewise , the designer of a programming language is bound by the theorems of computability theory , he must take into account the properties of the underlying hardware , and he must never forget that the language is used by programmers .
When I teach the theory of programming languages , I tell my students that there is a design principle from which almost everything else follows :
“ Programmers are just humans : forgetful , lazy , and they make every mistake imaginable . ”
Therefore , it is the task of the designer to make a programming language which counters these deficiencies .
A language must not be too complex , lest the programmer forget half of it .
A language must support the programmer ’s laziness by providing lots of useful libraries , and by making it possible to express ideas directly and succinctly .
The language must allow good organization of source code , otherwise the programmer will use the copy - paste method .
The language must try really hard to catch programming mistakes , especially the mundane ones that happen to everyone all the time .
When it finds a mistake , it must point to the true reason for it , preferably with an error message that humans understand .
You will notice that so far I have not said a word about efficiency .
If this were the year 1972 we would talk about efficiency first and forget about the programmers , because 37 years ago hardware and processing time were the scarcest resources .
Today we live in different times when the most expensive resource is development time .
In 1972 it was a good design decision to implement arrays in C so that they did not carry with them information about their lengths ( save a couple of bytes on each array ) , it was a good decision not to check for out - of - bounds errors in array indexing ( save a couple of CPU cycles ) , and it was a good decision not to have garbage collection ( it did n’t work well anyhow ) .
From today ’s point of view all these decisions were horrible mistakes .
Buffer overflows , which are a consequence of missing out - of - bounds checks , cost the industry huge amounts of money every year , while lack of automated garbage collection results in memory leaks that cause programs to be unstable .
Of course , even today C might be just the right tool for your specific task .
I am not saying that memory efficiency and speed are not important .
They are not as important as they used to be .
The first objective in a programming language design today should be friendliness to programmers .
A lot is known about how to write an optimizing compiler and how to generate efficient code , so usually the design of the language does not prevent generation of efficient compiled or interpreted code .
People do not make bad design decisions because they are evil or stupid .
They make them because they judge that the advantages of the decision outweigh the disadvantages .
What they often do not see is that they could have achieved the same advantages in a different way , without introducing the disadvantages .
Therefore , it is very important to get the order right : first make sure the design avoids the disadvantages , then think about how to get the advantages back .
Let us now apply these principles to several examples .
Undefined values ( NULL , null , undef , None )
Suppose we want a language with references ( pointers in C ) .
The principle tells us that it is a bad idea to allow invalid references because programmers will create them .
Indeed , most recently designed languages , say Java and Python , do not allow you to write obviously risky things , such as
int *p = ( int *) 0 xabcdef ;
Unfortunately , many designers have still not learnt that the special NULL pointer or null object is an equally bad idea .
Python ’s None , perl ’s undef , and SQL ’s NULL all fall in the same category .
I can hear you list lots of advantages of having these .
But stick to the principle : NULL is wrong because it causes horrible and tricky mistakes which appear even after the program was tested thoroughly .
You cannot introduce NULL into the language and tell the programmer to be careful about it .
The programmer is not capable of being careful !
There is plenty of evidence to support this sad fact .
Therefore NULL , null , None and undef must go .
I shall collectively denote these with Python ’s None .
Of course , if we take away None , we must put something else back in .
To see what is needed , consider the fact that None is intended as a special constant that signifies “ missing value ” .
Problems occur when a given value could be either “ proper ” or “ missing ” and the programmer forgets to consider the case of missing value .
The solution is to design the language in such a way that the programmer is always forced to consider both possibilities .
For example , Haskell does this with the datatype Maybe , which has two kinds of values :
Nothing , meaning “ missing value ”
, meaning “ missing value ” Just x , meaning “ the value is x “
The only way to use such a value in Haskell is to consider both cases , otherwise the compiler complains .
The language is forcing the programmer to do the right thing .
Is this annoying ?
You will probably feel annoyed if you are used to ugly hacks with None , but a bit of experience will quickly convince you that the advantages easily outweigh your tendency for laziness .
By the way , Haskell actually supports your laziness .
Once you tell it that the type of a value is Maybe , it will find for you all the places where you need to be careful about Nothing .
C , Java , Python , and perl stay silent and let you suffer through your own mistaken uses of NULL ‘s , null ‘s , None ‘s , and undef ‘s .
Other languages that let you have the data type like Haskell ’s Maybe are ML and Ocaml because they have sum types .
Pascal , Modula - 2 and C have broken sum types because they require the programmer to handle the tag by hand .
Everything is an object ( or list , or array )
Many languages are advertised as “ simple ” because in them everything is expressed with just a couple of basic concepts .
Lisp and scheme programmers proudly represent all sorts of data with conses and lists .
Fortran programmers implement linked lists and trees with arrays .
In Java and Python “ everything is an object ” , more or less .
It is good to have a simple language , but it is not good to sacrifice its expressiveness to the point where most of the time the programmer has to encode the concepts that he really needs indirectly with those available in the language .
Programmers cannot do such things reliably , and the compiler cannot help them with the task because it does not know what is in programmer ’s head .
Let us look at a typical example in scheme .
Suppose we would like to represent binary trees in which the nodes are labeled with integers .
In scheme we might do this by representing the empty tree as ( ) , and use a three - element list ( k l r ) to represent a tree whose root is labeled by k , the left subtree is l , and the right subtree is r .
A quick search on Google shows that this is a popular way of implementing trees in scheme .
It ’s simple , it ’s cool , it ’s easy to explain to the students , but scheme will have no idea whatsoever what you ’re doing .
There are a number of trivial mistakes which can be made with such a representation , and scheme wo n’t detect them ( at best you will get a runtime error ) : you might write ( l k r ) instead of ( k l r ) , you might mistakenly pass a four - element list to a function expecting a tree , you might mistakenly think that the integer 42 is a valid representation of the tree ( 42 ( ) ( ) ) , you might mistakenly try to compute the left subtree of the empty tree , etc .
And remember , the programmer will make all these mistakes .
With objects the situation is somewhat better .
In Java we would define a class Tree with three attributes root , left , and right .
It will be impossible to build a tree with a missing attribute , or too many attributes .
But we will hit another problem : how to represent the empty tree ?
There are several choices none of which is ideal :
the empty tree is null : this is the worst solution , as any Java programmer knows we define a class Tree and subclasses EmptyTree and NodeTree represent the two different kinds of tree we add a fourth attribute empty of type boolean which tells us whether the tree is empty
There are probably other options .
The first solution is horrible , as every Java programmer knows , because it leads to many NullPointerExceptions .
The second solution is probably the most “ object - orientedly correct ” but people find it impractical , as it spreads code around in two classes .
When I taught java I lectured the third solution , but that one has the big disadvantage that the programmer is responsible for checking every time whether a tree is empty or not .
A decent programming language should help with the following common problems regarding binary trees :
Prevent the construction of an invalid tree , such as one with missing parts , or dangling pointers .
Prevent at compile time access to a component which is not there .
For example , the compiler should detect the fact that the programmer is trying to access the left subtree of the empty tree .
Make sure the programmer never forgets to consider both possibilities –the empty tree and the non-empty tree .
The above scheme representation does not help with the first problem .
A C implementation with pointers would allow dangling pointers .
An object - oriented solution typically wo n’t help with the second and the third problems .
You might wonder what it is that I want .
The answer is that the programming language should have built - in inductive data types , because that ’s what binary trees are .
In Haskell , which has inductive data types , trees are defined directly in terms of their structure :
data Tree = Empty | Node Int Tree Tree
This expresses the definition of trees directly : a tree is either empty or a node composed of an integer and two trees .
Haskell will be able to catch all the common problems listed above .
Other languages supporting this sort of definition are ML , Ocaml , F# , and interestingly Visual Prolog ( I am told by Wikipedia ) .
We might ask for more .
Suppose we wanted to implement binary search trees .
Then we would require that the left subtree only contains nodes that are smaller than the root , and the right subtree only nodes that are larger than the root .
Can a programming language be designed so that this property is guaranteed ?
Yes , for example the compiler could insert suitable checks into the code so that anomalies are detected during execution as soon as they occur .
This might be nice for debugging purposes , but what is production code supposed to do if it discovers an anomalous data structure during its execution ?
Ignore it ?
Raise an exception ?
It is much more useful to know before the program is run that the data structure will never be corrupted .
Here we hit against a law of nature : there is no algorithm that would analyze an arbitrary piece of code and determine whether it will only produce valid search trees .
It is a fact of life .
If you really want to check that your programs are correct you will have to help the compiler .
There are excellent tools for doing that , such as Coq and Agda–have a look to see how programmers might develop their code in the future .
Confusing definitions and variables
A definition binds an identifier to a particular fixed value .
A variable or a mutable value is a memory location which holds a value that can be read and changed .
These two notions should not be confused .
Unfortunately , traditional programming languages only provide variables , so many programmers do n’t even understand what definitions are .
Java tries to fix this with the final declaration , and C++ with the const declaration , but these are not used by programmers as much as they could be ( which is a typical sign of dubious design decisions ) .
Using variables instead of definitions is wrong for a number of reasons .
First , if the compiler knows which identifiers are bound to immutable values it can optimize the code better .
It can , for example , decide to store the value in a register , or to keep around several copies without worrying about synchronization between them ( think threaded applications ) .
Second , if we allow the programmer to change a value which is supposed to be constant , then he will do so .
If you observe how variables are typically used , you will see several distinct uses :
often a variable is only assigned to once and is used as an ( immutable ) definition
a variable in a loop or list comprehension ranges over the elements of a list , or a collection of objects
a variable stores the current state and is genuinely mutable
Should loop counters be mutable ?
I think not .
Code that changes the loop counter in the body of the loop is confusing and error prone .
If you want to fiddle with counters , use the while loop instead .
So in two out of three cases we want our variables to be immutable , but the popular programming languages only give us variables .
That ’s silly .
We should design the language so that the default case is an immutable value .
If the programmer wants a mutable value , he should say so explicitly .
This is just the opposite of what Java and C++ do .
An example of a language that is designed this way is ML and ocaml .
In Haskell you have to jump through hoops to get mutable values ( now I am going to hear it from a monad aficionado , please spare me an unnecessary burst of anger ) .
Out of scope variables
I thought I would not have to explain why undefined identifiers are a bad a idea , but the reader in comment 27 explicitly asked about this .
If a programmer refers to an undefined name then an error should be reported .
Concretely , I claimed that Python should complain about the following definition :
def f( n ) : return i + n
What is i ?
Pythonists will quickly point out that i will be defined later , and how deferred definitions are useful because they allows us to define mutually recursive functions .
Indeed , Java and Haskell also accept mutually recursive definitions .
But unlike Python they make sure that nothing is missing at the time of definition , whereas Python will only complain when the above function f is used .
To be honest , Python kindly displays the correct error message showing that the trouble is with the definition of f .
But why should this be a runtime error when the mistake can easily be detected at compile time ?
Actually , this question leads to a more general question , which I consider next .
When should mistakes be discovered ?
Should programming bugs be discovered by the programmer or by the user ?
The answer seems pretty clear .
Therefore , a language should be designed so that as many programming errors as possible are discovered early on , that is before the program is sent to the user .
In fact , in order to speed up development ( remember that the development time is expensive ) the programmer should be told about errors without having to run the program and directing its execution to the place where the latest code change actually gets executed .
This philosophy leads to the design of statically checked languages .
A typical feature of such a language is that all the types are known at compile time .
In contrast , a dynamically typed languages checks the types during runtime .
Java , Haskell and ocaml are of the former kind , scheme , javascript and Python of the latter .
There are situations in which a statically checked language is better , for example if you ’re writing a program that will control a laser during eye surgery .
But there are also situations in which maximum flexibility is required of a program , for example programs that are embedded in web pages .
The web as we know it would not exist if every javascript error caused the browser to reject the entire web page ( try finding a page on a major web site that does not have any javascript errors ) .
Let me also point out that testing cannot replace good language design .
Testing is very important , but it should be used to discover problems that cannot be discovered earlier in the development cycle .
I used to think that statically checked languages are better for teaching because they prevent the students from doing obviously stupid things .
About two years ago I changed my mind .
The students learn much better by doing stupid things than by being told by an oppressive compiler that their programs are stupid .
So this year I switched to Python .
The students are happier , and so am I ( because I do n’t have to explain that code must be properly indented ) .
Python does not whine all the time .
Instead it lets them explore the possibilities , and by discovering which ones crash their programs they seem to understand better how the machine works .
Atlantic wind farms alone could meet 25 % of US electricity needs
According to a new report released by the Interior Department , shallow - water offshore wind farms could supply as much as 20 % of the electricity in most coastal states .
The report , released last week by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , said that the greatest offshore wind energy potential in the U.S. lies off the Atlantic Coast which holds 1,000 gigawatts of electricity , or one quarter of national demand .
[ social_buttons ]
“ More than three - fourths of the nation ’s electricity demand comes from coastal states and the wind potential off the coasts of the lower 48 states actually exceeds our entire U.S. electricity demand , ” Salazar told a summit meeting of 25X ’ 25 America ’s Energy Future , a group working to lower America ’s carbon emissions .
From Maine to Florida , state and local officials have been drafting plans and regulatory structures for offshore wind farm siting and permitting .
States have regulatory jurisdiction within three miles of their coast , beyond that boundary , the federal government has jurisdiction .
And the federal waters between North Carolina and Delaware hold 71 percent of the nation ’s shallow - water wind resources , the Interior report says .
In North Carolina , where the shallow waters and high winds in and around the Outer Banks are legendary , state legislators and some coastal counties are already preparing standards for where to allow wind farms .
The state ’s sounds , inside the Outer Banks , could be likely targets .
“ We do n’t have a proposal yet , but in all the presentations I ’ve seen , the ( potential ) facilities seem to be in shallow water , ” Mike Lopazanski of the N.C. Division of Coastal Management told the Charlotte Observer .
The report also notes large potential in the Pacific — approximately 900 gigawatts along the coast of California , Oregon and Washington — but that deeper waters off the Pacific coast make developing that wind energy resource far more difficult with current available technologies .
There are more than 2,000 megawatts of offshore wind projects proposed in the United States , yet the country is still waiting for its first offshore turbine .
Though it has yet to receive final approval from all relevant regulatory bodies , the Cape Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts is the closest to fruition .

( CNN ) -- Relatives of slain California 8 - year - old Sandra Cantu expressed " shock " Saturday at news that a neighbor -- a Sunday school teacher whose daughter was a playmate of Sandra 's -- was arrested in the girl 's death .
Melissa Huckaby was charged with kidnapping and murder in the death of 8 - year - old Sandra Cantu .
" Just utter shock and disbelief , " Sandra 's aunt Angie Chavez told CNN affiliate KOVR .
" I can't imagine a mother doing this to a child . "
Melissa Huckaby , 28 , was booked into the San Joaquin County Jail early Saturday and faces charges of kidnapping and murder in the death of Sandra in Tracy , California .
Sandra was last seen March 27 in the Tracy mobile home park where she lived with her family -- the same mobile home park where Huckaby lives .
The girl 's body was found Monday , stuffed into a suitcase submerged in a pond at a dairy farm .
" We have to live the rest of our lives without Sandra .
[ Huckaby ] is in jail .
She can still see her little girl grow up , " Sandra 's uncle , Joe Chavez , told KOVR .
He said the family is " shell - shocked " and hopes that in time they can learn to trust people again .
" Who can you trust at this point ? " he said .
" Who do you know ? "
A police spokesman told reporters Saturday he " could n't begin to theorize " a motive for Sandra 's death .
Watch police discuss the arrest »
Huckaby is the granddaughter of Clifford Lane Lawless , pastor at the Clover Road Baptist Church , which was searched as part of the investigation , Tracy police Sgt. Tony Sheneman told reporters .
Huckaby taught Sunday school at the church , he said .
In addition , Huckaby 's 5 - year - old daughter was close friends with Sandra , who often played at Huckaby 's home .
Earlier Saturday , Sheneman said he did not believe Huckaby had retained an attorney .
In a Friday interview with the Tracy Press newspaper , Huckaby acknowledged owning the black rolling suitcase that held Sandra 's body , but said she reported it missing the day before the girl 's body was found .
She said it disappeared the same day the girl was last seen .
" There 's been a lot of speculation on the news about what happened to my suitcase , " she told the newspaper .
" It 's not my granddad's .
It 's mine , and someone took it . "
Police said Huckaby lives in the same mobile home complex where Sandra lived with her family ; the Tracy Press reported Huckaby lives with her grandparents .
Police noted " inconsistencies " between comments Huckaby made to the newspaper and a previous statement she gave authorities , Sheneman said .
It was one reason police asked her Friday to come to the station to be interviewed again .
She drove there about 6 p.m. Friday , he said .
Authorities believe Huckaby lied about the suitcase being missing , Sheneman said .
Asked whether authorities believe Sandra 's death was planned , Sheneman said the question is " not something I can answer right now " but " we do have an indication . "
He said authorities have found where they believe the girl was killed , but would not divulge that location to reporters .
" I could n't begin to theorize what her motive is , " Sheneman said of Huckaby .
During the Friday night interview with police , Huckaby was " very relaxed for a bit , and then she became very emotional , and then she became relaxed again " before appearing resigned , Sheneman said .
He declined to say whether Huckaby had confessed , but said " she revealed enough information that we had probable cause to arrest her . "
Huckaby was booked into the San Joaquin County Jail about 3:25 a.m. ( 6:25 a.m. ET ) , according to the county sheriff 's Web site .
She is set to appear in court Tuesday .
Police took Huckaby into custody about 11:15 p.m. Friday ( 2:15 a.m. ET Saturday ) , Sheneman said , but she chose to continue talking with them for more than two hours .
Authorities told Sandra 's family of the arrest about 2:15 a.m. local time , he said .
" They were in disbelief . "
Watch neighbors remember slain girl »
Police have had contact with Huckaby before , but she does not have a record of violence , Sheneman said , but did not elaborate .
He said no other arrests are expected in Sandra 's death .
Citing court records , the Tracy Press reported Huckaby pleaded no contest January 9 to a felony charge of second - degree commercial burglary and a misdemeanor charge of property theft with a prior theft , burglary or robbery .
A criminal complaint says she was jailed in Los Angeles County on a property theft conviction in 2006 and that she attempted to steal from a store in November 2008 .
According to the complaint , she is on probation in San Joaquin County and is due back in court April 17 .
Asked about the court records , Huckaby told the newspaper it was n't her and that she did not know why the address and cell phone number in the court documents match her own .
" I do n't know what to say , " she said .
" That 's not me . "
Police believe that by the time Sandra was reported missing , she was already dead , Tracy Police Chief Janet Thiessen told reporters Saturday .
" There was some speculation early on that [ the suspect ] would be a man , " Sheneman said Saturday .
" It 's unusual for a woman -- statistically , according to the FBI -- to be involved in anything like this . "
The day Sandra was last reported seen , she returned home from school , kissed her mother and left to play with a friend who lives nearby .
A short time later , wearing a pink Hello Kitty T - shirt and black leggings , she left to go to another friend 's home , according to a family spokeswoman .
Police said the girl 's clothing helped them identify her body .
Huckaby told the Tracy Press that Sandra stopped by her home that day to ask if she could play with Huckaby 's daughter , but Huckaby refused because she wanted her daughter to pick up her toys .
Sandra left for another friend 's home , Huckaby told the newspaper .
How Sandra died has not been made public .
An autopsy was conducted earlier in the week , but CNN affiliate KRON - TV said results are not expected for weeks .
Thiessen said Saturday any autopsy information as well as search warrants filed in the case remain under seal .

LA GLORIA , Mexico ( CNN ) --
Tucked away in this small mountain village , off a dusty road flanked by pig farms , is where the earliest case of swine flu -- a virus spreading globally -- was confirmed .
Five - year - old Edgar Hernandez , known as " patient zero " survived the earliest documented case of swine flu .

Meet the child known as " patient zero " by his doctors -- 5 - year - old Edgar Hernandez , who survived the earliest documented case of swine flu in an outbreak that , officials say , has now spread across four continents .
His family lives in the 3,000 - population village of La Gloria in the state of Veracruz , where a flu outbreak was reported on April 2 .
State officials arrived and took samples from dozens of people .
Lab tests confirmed that Edgar was the only patient in Veracruz to test positive for the swine flu virus ; the others had contracted a common flu .
Health officials had returned to Edgar 's sample only after cases of the new flu strain were spotted around the country .
" In this case , there 's a patient who turned out to be positive for the swine - flu virus , with the exception that at that time in no region of the world it had been established as an etiological , epidemic cause , " said Mexico Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova .
Edgar has managed to bounce back from his symptoms and playfully credits ice cream for helping him feel better .
His mother blamed the virus on a huge pig farm in the neighborhood .
Officials have conducted tests at the farm owned by U.S. company Smithfield Foods , and those tests came back negative .
Meanwhile , Mexican health officials suspect the swine flu outbreak has caused more than 159 deaths and roughly 2,500 illnesses .
The World Health Organization says at least 105 cases have been confirmed worldwide , including 64 in the United States ; 26 in Mexico ; six in Canada ; three in New Zealand ; and two each in Spain , the United Kingdom and Israel .
WHO has confirmed deaths only in Mexico , where seven people have died from swine flu .
The deadly outbreak in Mexico prompted authorities to order about 35,000 public venues in Mexico City to close or serve only take - out meals as health officials tried to contain the virus .

Officials in Mexico City also ordered the closing of bars , clubs , movie theaters , pool halls , theaters , gyms , sport centers and convention halls until May 6 , said Juan Jose Garcia Ochoa , one of the city government 's top officials .
Officials on Friday closed schools in the city and Monday extended that order nationwide until at least May 6 .
" I 'm pretty nervous of this whole virus thing , " Berta Hernandez said as she touched up her eyeliner inside a packed and humid subway car in Mexico City .
She did not dare lift her surgical mask to put on lip gloss .
" I 'm nervous of the people who are n't wearing masks .
Maybe they will suddenly sneeze or cough , " she said .
Governments around the world scrambled to prevent further outbreak .
Some , like China and Russia , banned pork imports from the United States and Mexico , even though the World Health Organization said the disease " has not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and prepared pork ( pig meat ) or other products derived from pigs . "
Several others , such as Japan and Indonesia , used thermographic devices to test the temperature of passengers arriving from Mexico .
The Philippines ' health department urged people to avoid kissing and hugging in public .
Argentina announced a five - day ban on flights from Mexico .
Four cruise lines -- Holland America , Royal Caribbean , Norwegian and Princess -- canceled upcoming calls to Mexican ports .
President Obama said the outbreak is a cause for concern , not for alarm .
The government urged travelers to avoid nonessential travel to Mexico .
iReport.com : " Regular life " in Mexico with masks
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued emergency authorization for the use of two of the most common antiviral drugs , Tamiflu and Relenza .
The authorization allows the distribution of the drugs by a broader range of health - care workers and loosens age limits for their use .
In Mexico City , however , there is a shortage of such medication .
It also became impossible to find protective surgical masks , which the government had handed out to one out of every five residents .

Worried citizens continue to flood in night and day at hospitals , only to be turned around by armed guards .
" I was looking for a mask at my local pharmacy , but they sold out , " supermarket worker Rafael Martinez said as he rode the subway .
" I know it 's a risk , but I can't find one . "
Swine influenza , or flu , is a contagious respiratory disease that affects pigs .
When the flu spreads person - to - person , instead of from animals to humans , it can continue to mutate , making it harder to treat or fight , because people have no natural immunity .
Symptoms include fever , runny nose , sore throat , nausea , vomiting and diarrhea .
Common seasonal flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people every year worldwide , far more than the current outbreak of swine flu .

But there is no vaccine for the new disease , and little natural immunity , an expert said .
" I think the reason to be concerned is ... we had a vaccine for regular flu , " said Dr. Carlos del Rio of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta , Georgia .
" This is a totally new virus .
...
You have a virus to which there 's no pre-vaccination , there 's no prior immunity .
And , therefore , the mortality rate may be higher than other influenza viruses . "
Watch why swine flu is a " sloppy virus " »
Researchers do not know how the virus is jumping relatively easily from person to person , or why it 's affecting what should be society 's healthiest demographic .
Meanwhile , Mexico 's largest city saw the the government close universities , postpone sporting events and cancel church services in an effort to try to stem the spread of the virus .
" I do n't think it 's feasible or advisable to shut down the city , " said Jose Luis Suarez , a newspaper vendor .
" People would try and get out somehow , and that would make a bad situation worse . "
CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in La Gloria , Mexico , contributed to this report .

Whatever can be done on the command line can be done here too .
“ tomboy ” - this plugin provides information on Tomboy based notes , keeping most formatting from the notes intact in the output .
Note :
The shell plugin will provide the equivalent functional to that used with exec / execi calls in Conky .
The big difference however , is that it sources all the results from execs inside [ ] from within a template file , meaning that formatting of command line results is much simpler and neater .
A lyrics scripts would work nicely in it for example
Current Limitations
Compiz wallpaper settings are not supported yet , however gnome , xfce , kde3 , and kde4 are .
If tiling or simple background colours are used , the application will no handle these well .
I am attempting to find a better way to handle system wallpaper , independently from the window manager type , so that the only thing this application will be dependant on is gtk , webkit and python libraries .
However this may be some time off .
If you have issues with wallpapers and the fake transparency is not working , I suggest you use the –wallpaper option , as described in the guide .
Basic Install
Method 1 : Using apt
1 ) Create the necessary list file for access to the repository by running one of these :
Jaunty Jackalope :
sudo wget -q
http://www.kaivalagi.com/ubuntu/ppa/m-buck-gtk-desktop-info-jaunty.list
- O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/m-buck-gtk-desktop-info-jaunty.list
Intrepid Ibex :
sudo wget -q
http://www.kaivalagi.com/ubuntu/ppa/m-buck-gtk-desktop-info-intrepid.list
- O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/m-buck-gtk-desktop-info-intrepid.list
2 ) Add the gtk - desktop - info repository public key to your apt setup by running this :
wget -q
http://www.kaivalagi.com/ubuntu/ppa/m-buck-gtk-desktop-info-key.gpg
- O- | sudo apt - key add -
3 ) Now that is done simply run the following to install
sudo apt - get update && sudo apt - get install gtk- desktop - info
Method 2 : Using tar.gz file
Only go this route if you know what you 're doing , you are not likely to get much help if you get stuck !
1 ) Go to
2 ) Extract all the contents of the tar.gz files to an appropriate folder of your choice , the default location is /usr / share / gtk- desktop - info
3 ) Copy the gtk - desktop - info and gtk - desktop - info. guide script files to /usr / bin , edit them to point to the folder you extracted everything to , and make them executable

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Europe expects a number of deaths from the global outbreak of swine flu , although the continent is well prepared to fight the disease , a senior European Commission official said on Wednesday .
“ Yes , people will die from this .
It is not a question of whether people will die , but more a question of how many .
Will it be hundreds , thousands or tens of thousands ? , ” Robert Madelin , Director - General for Health and Consumer Policy at the European Commission told Reuters .
“ We do n’t know the scale of this pandemic .
But Europe is better prepared than ever , ”
Madelin also said a travel ban to Mexico or the United States was not something the Commission would propose at a meeting of EU health ministers on Thursday , preferring instead to caution travellers to be more prudent .
He also said a vaccine could be ready in Europe in 100 days .

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) filed suit against Apple Inc. today to defend the First Amendment rights of an operator of a noncommercial , public Internet " wiki " site known as BluWiki .
EFF and the San Francisco law firm of Keker & Van Nest represent OdioWorks LLC , which runs the BluWiki website .
Like many " wiki " platforms , such as Wikipedia , it is open to the public for collaborative authoring and editing on any topic .
The site is entirely noncommercial , operated by OdioWorks as a public service .
Late last year , after BluWiki users began a discussion about making some Apple iPods and iPhones interoperate with software other than Apple 's own iTunes , Apple lawyers demanded removal of the content .
In a letter to OdioWorks , the attorneys alleged that the discussions constituted copyright infringement and a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's ( DMCA 's ) prohibition on circumventing copy protection measures .
Fearing legal action by Apple , OdioWorks took down the discussions from the BluWiki site .
OdioWorks filed the lawsuit today in order to vindicate its right to restore those discussions .
Filed in federal court in San Francisco , the suit seeks a declaratory judgment that the discussions do not violate any of the DMCA 's anti-circumvention provisions , and do not infringe any copyrights owned by Apple .
" I take the free speech rights of BluWiki users seriously , " said Sam Odio , owner of OdioWorks .
" Companies like Apple should not be able to censor online discussions by making baseless legal threats against services like BluWiki that host the discussions . "
The discussions on the BluWiki site focused on how hobbyists might enable iPods and iPhones to work with desktop media management software other than Apple 's own iTunes software .
The discussions were apparently spurred by Apple 's efforts prevent the iPod Touch and iPhone from working with competing media management software such as WinAmp and Songbird .
" Apple 's legal threats against BluWiki are about censorship , not about protecting their legitimate copyright interests , " said Senior Staff Attorney Fred von Lohmann .
" Wikis and other community sites are home to many vibrant discussions among hobbyists and tinkerers .
It 's legal to engage in reverse engineering in order to create a competing product , it 's legal to talk about reverse engineering , and it 's legal for a public wiki to host those discussions . "

Texas Woman Breaks Neck , Back In Airplane Turbulence A Texas woman may have disobeyed warnings to remain in her seat during flight .
April 21 , 2009  --
A woman who was paralyzed after disobeying warnings to remain in her seat during a turbulent flight over Texas has suffered the same type of catastrophic injuries as the late Christopher Reeve , according to her doctor .
" She is paralyzed from the nipples to her toes , " said Dr. Trey Fulp , the spinal surgeon who will perform a second operation today on the passenger at the McAllen Medical Center in McAllen , Tex .
The woman was one of two passengers and one crew member on Continental flight 511 from Houston to McAllen who were injured early Saturday morning in mid-flight .
Fulp described the severity of the passenger 's injury as a " hangman 's fracture , " a term used to describe the neck break commonly seen in patients who hang themselves .
Fulp 's wife , Kathy Fulp , was one of the first nurses to treat the patient .
She told ABCNews.com that the 47 - year - old Spanish - speaking woman , whom she declined to identify by name , suffered a broken back at the thoracic level and a fracture between the C1 and C2 vertebrae in her neck , the same injury that left Reeve paralyzed after falling off his horse in 1995 .
" She had gotten up and gone to the bathroom , " said Fulp .
" When she was in the bathroom the flight apparently hit turbulence and she was thrown to the ceiling , which is how she got the C1 C2 fracture .
Then she was thrown back against the toilet , which broke her back . "
It was not immediately known if she will be able to walk again .
Kathy
Fulp said that flight attendants rushed to the passenger 's side and moved her into the aisle of the aircraft for the remainder of the approximately 50 - minute flight .
The two other individuals were treated for minor injuries , according to Fulp , who said one of them had torn a ligament in her knee .
The injuries were sustained during the descent of the aircraft , approximately 15 minutes before landing .
Mary Clarke , a spokeswoman for Continental Airlines , confirmed that three individuals from Flight 511 , en route from George Bush Houston Intercontinental Airport to the McAllen - Miller International Airport , had been taken to the local hospital after being injured in the turbulence .
Storms in the Houston area had delayed the flight several hours and had caused major delays for both inbound and outbound aircraft .
" The flight experienced turbulence as it approached McAllen , " said Clark , who declined to identify the injured passengers and crew member or provide details of the injuries .
" The seat belt sign was illuminated at the time , " added Clark .
The passenger , who was from McAllen , had gotten up from her seat to use the restroom after the sign to remain seated was illuminated .
Clark said the Boeing 737 had 104 passengers and five crew members and was scheduled to arrive in McAllen at 10:40 p.m. on Friday , April 17 , but because of the weather delay did not land until after 2 a.m. on Saturday April 18 .
" Our real priority is to assist the customer who remains hospitalized and their family members with their needs , " said Clark , who confirmed that the National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating the incident .
According to Kathy Fulp , the passenger was operated on for six hours yesterday and was scheduled for surgery again today to repair injuries to her neck .
Described by Trey Fulp as " alert , " the passenger was reportedly aware of her condition and managed to wiggle her toes this morning , a positive sign for a patient who is battling paralysis .
The surgeon told ABCNews.com that the patient has been removed from the ventilator and is now able to speak .
He described her as " anxious " and " scared " but said that her family -- including her children -- were at the hospital with her .
He said he remains hopeful that she will recover because of the speed at which she was operated on .
" Only time will tell if she will recover , " said Fulp .
" My gut feeling is that she will because
TBILISI ( Reuters ) - Thousands of Georgians took their campaign to oust Georgia ’s President Mikheil Saakashvili to his office on Monday , the fifth day of protests against his rule .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
Several thousand marched on the newly - built presidential residence that looks down on the Mtkvari River in Tbilisi , whistling and chanting “ Misha , Go ! . ”
They pledged to stay there until Saakashvili , commonly known as Misha , resigns over his record on democracy and last year ’s disastrous war with Russia .
Opposition leaders said they were shifting the focus of the campaign from the parliament to Saakashvili ’s office .
“ That way he will hear our voices much more loudly , ” said Kakha Kukava , one of several opposition leaders taking part in the campaign .
Up to 20,000 people rallied outside the parliament .
Turnout had dipped over the weekend and there were signs that some opposition leaders were considering talks with the president .
Some 60,000 people rallied at the start of the campaign on Thursday , followed by 20,000 on Friday , blocking Tbilisi ’s central avenue and the main roads running past the president ’s office and the public broadcaster .
MISTAKES
Critics accuse Saakashvili of monopolising power and exerting pressure on the judiciary and media since coming to power on the back of the 2003 Rose Revolution promising to consolidate Georgian democracy .
Last year ’s war , when Russia crushed a Georgian assault on breakaway South Ossetia , has emboldened opponents who say the 41 - year - old leader has made too many mistakes to remain in power until 2013 .
But analysts question whether the opposition can remain united or muster the numbers over a sustained period to force him out .
Despite the defection of some senior allies and repeated cabinet reshuffles since the war , Saakashvili ’s position appears to remain strong .
The West , which receives oil via Georgia from the Caspian Sea , is watching the situation closely .
European Union special envoy Peter Semneby has been trying to broker a dialogue but opposition leaders have sent mixed signals about their readiness to talk .
How do you go from having 411 complaints about your business , many including choice words like ‘ scam ’ , ‘ lawsuit ’ , and ‘ prison ’ …
… to having just 27 “ reports ” , the most recent of which speaks only of the horrors of a “ VERY HAPPY FIANCE ” ?
DirectBuy , “ the # 1 way to buy direct for your home ” , has somehow managed this remarkable transformation over the course of the last year .
They were in the uncomfortable position of having a supposedly uncensored review site , Infomercialscams.com , appearing just behind their official site in Google searches for “ DirectBuy ” , and the overwhelming sentiment was negative .
Here are excerpts from some of the 411 complaints on that site archived from last year :
2/1/2008 – Kenya – “ Please contact me if a lawsuit or something will occur .
This company lied to me and my spouse . ”
1/26/2008 – Derrick – “ This is an absolute scam … Why is n’t this company being reported to the Better Buisiness Bureau . more than it has …… … ”
1/25/2008 – Gavin – “ Let ’s hope that by June these bastards are out of business . ”
1/22/2008 – Tia – “ they do n’t tell you that DB adds on an additional 8 % handling fee to nearly every item they sell .
Once the item is delivered to DB it is YOUR responsibility to pick - up your merchandise or HIRE a moving company to do it for you !!!
If a class action lawsuit is filed COUNT US IN !!!!!!
DO NOT FALL FOR THIS SCAM … “
Many of the reports are highly detailed , describing the entire experience of attending a DirectBuy open house , being pressured by unscrupulous salespeople , and then being shown the door after asking too many questions .
Those who did sign up for the program found themselves paying unexpected fees with no way to cancel after the third day of membership .
Once the negative reviews piled up , DirectBuy ’s lawyers authored a cease and desist notice , demanding that all “ defamatory and disparaging remarks ” be removed from Infomercialscams.com and affiliated sites .
When that did n’t work , they opted for another approach : throwing cash at the review sites to make the complaints go away .
After being retained by DirectBuy , the company behind Infomercialcams.com , ICA , conducted what is described as an “ autonomous investigation into [ DirectBuy ’s ] organization ” .
Here ’s a portion of the findings from that investigation :
Our ICA investigation gives DirectBuy an affirmative rating .
DirectBuy appears to be completely committed to providing the highest level of customer success and satisfaction possible .
That is apparent in the evidence that DirectBuy is dramatically improving its business processes and services .
DirectBuy is willing to satisfy its customers by correcting problems and resolving misunderstandings .
To illustrate their promise to achieve this high level of service , DirectBuy has set up a special email address to respond to complaints made specifically on the Infomercialscams.com website .
DirectBuy ’s guarantee is to respond to your concerns within 48 - 72 hours ( excluding holidays and weekends ) .
[ emphasis added ]
There you have it .
By setting up a special email address for complaints , DirectBuy has wiped the slate clean in the eyes of this investigative body , and the hundreds of reviews on Infomercialscams.com written prior to 6/2/2008 are erased from memory .
Given this transaction , it would seem Infomercialscams.com has a unique interpretation of their own tagline : “ uncensored infomercial complaints ” .

Mr Clegg said growth forecasts would stoke up false hopes Alistair Darling 's moves to tax higher earners more will only affect a " tiny minority " and raise very little money , says Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg .
He said the failure to stop high earners declaring income as capital gains meant a " massive subsidy for the very rich " remained in place .
And the chancellor 's growth forecasts suggested he was living in a " fantasy world " , he said .
He said it was not likely that many of the policies would ever be implemented .
Responding to the Budget statement Mr Clegg said the " worst of times demands the best of budgets " and referred to memorable budgets of the past .
Heavy taxes Instead the government had been " desperately rushing around picking up half - baked ideas to save the skin of this failing government " , he said .
" Patchwork repairs " were not enough , Britain needed to do things " fundamentally differently " , particularly by making big changes to the banking sector .
High street banks should not be taking " unnecessary risks " with people 's money while " risky casino investment banking " should be " cut loose to fail " , he said .
Taxes are still too heavy on those who can least afford it and too easy to avoid for those who know how
Nick Clegg
Tax rise as UK debt hits record UK economy in a ' mess ' - Cameron
While Mr Darling had addressed the issue of higher tax relief on pension incomes for the wealthy , he had only " tinkered " with the loophole , removing it from the " tiny minority " earning more than £ 150,000 a year .
The 18 % capital gains tax , which the Lib Dems say high earners use to avoid the top rate of income tax , remains a " massive subsidy for the very rich " , Mr Clegg said .
" The biggest disappointment of all in this Budget is its failure to sort out Britain 's unfair tax system , to put money into people 's pockets to help them make it through this recession , " Mr Clegg told MPs .
" Taxes are still too heavy on those who can least afford it and too easy to avoid for those who know how .
That 's how this government and the Tories seem to want it . "
He said the chancellor 's predictions that the UK economy will grow 1.25 % next year then 3.5 % the year after that " stoke up false hopes " .
" Given the lamentable failure of this government to get its own predictions right people will be asking what kind of fantasy world the Labour Party lives in , " he said .

Internet exclusive trailer for Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince .
Trailer features new footage from the film with emphasis on young Tom Riddle , Narcissa Malfoy , Professor McGonagall and Luna Lovegood .
The One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project , which builds low - cost mobile computing devices for students in developing countries , has announced plans to update its XO laptop .
The new model , which has been dubbed XO generation 1.5 , will include a VIA processor instead of the aging AMD Geode processor that is included in the current XO model .
OLPC has faced many challenges since its inception and was recently forced to make massive cuts due to a decline in sponsorship and the failure of its second G1G1 fundraising effort .
The organization largely refocused its efforts on creating a reference design for the XO 2 , which will have dual touchscreens , possibly an ARM processor , and a target price of $ 75 per unit .
The XO 1.5 is a less ambitious undertaking and will bring a much - needed incremental improvement to OLPC 's hardware while the XO 2 is under development .
The hardware refresh was announced by John Watlington , OLPC vice president of hardware , on the project mailing list last week .
He says that the refresh is unrelated to OLPC 's ongoing 2.0 design activities and it will not include changes to the XO laptop 's exterior design .
According to Watlington , the update will lower the price of the XO and include better components while retaining the current level of energy efficiency .
The new processor is a VIA C7 - M , which can be clocked at up to 1GHz .
The new XO model will also include a VX855 MSP , a low power chipset component that is capable of handling high - definition video .
The memory has been upped to 1GB and the built - in storage will be 4GB of NAND flash .
OLPC plans to make bare - board prototype models available to developers by the end of May .
" OLPC is excited to announce that a refresh of the XO - 1 laptop is in progress .
In our continued effort to maintain a low price point , OLPC is refreshing the hardware to take advantage of the latest component technologies , " Watlington wrote .
" We 're excited to be finally able to make this news public .
While members of the technical team have been working on this for several months , it was not until last week that we could with any certainty say that we were going to refresh the hardware and what that refresh was likely to be . "
The improved parts will help boost the XO 's competitive edge and could make it a more compelling option for government buyers .
It 's still unclear , however , if the move will buy enough time for the organization to finish designing the XO 2 , the next major upgrade .
OLPC has appeared increasingly directionless in the wake of its repeated strategy changes and reorganization attempts .
Perhaps the XO 1.5 will help the organization get back on track .

( CNN ) -- Analysts in China are dismissing claims that nearly 1,300 computers in more than 100 countries have been attacked , and have become part of a cyber - espionage network apparently based in China .
The network was discovered after computers at the Dalai Lama 's office were hacked , researchers say .
" This is purely another political issue that the West is trying to exaggerate , " Song Xiaojun , a Beijing - based strategy and military analyst , told China Daily , a state - run newspaper .
Zhu Feng , a professor with the school of international studies at Peking University , added : " Cyber security has been a global issue , but this time those who see China as an emerging threat again have picked the subject as a new weapon . "
Computers -- including machines at NATO , governments and embassies -- are infected with software that lets attackers gain complete control of them , cyber - security experts alleged in two reports Sunday .
One report was issued by the University of Toronto 's Munk Center for International Studies in conjunction with the Ottawa , Canada - based think tank The SecDev Group ; the second came from the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory .
Watch CNN's John Vause report on the network »
Researchers have dubbed the cyber - espionage network GhostNet .
The network can not only search a computer but see and hear the people using it , according to the Canadian report .
" GhostNet is capable of taking full control of infected computers , including searching and downloading specific files , and covertly operating attached devices , including microphones and web cameras , " the report says .
The discovery of GhostNet grew out of suspicions that the office of the Dalai Lama had been hacked .
His staff sent a foreign diplomat an e-mail invitation to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader , but before the Dalai Lama 's people could follow up with a phone call , " the diplomat 's office was contacted by the Chinese government and warned not to go ahead with the meeting , " according to the Cambridge report .
The investigation resulted in both reports .
Both found links to computers in China , but the researchers did not conclude who they thought was behind the " malware , " or malicious software .
The Dalai Lama told CNN he did not know who was behind the hacking , but said there should be an investigation .
China , he added , " as a great nation ... ( has a ) certain sort of moral responsibility and practical responsibility .
Now in order to utilize that opportunity , China should -- must -- bring trust from rest of the world .
Then China really can ( a ) make positive contribution , " he told CNN 's Sara Sidner .
" In spite ( of being a ) big nation , they act like ( a ) very weak nation -- all sort of spying ...
I think that is very , very unfortunate , " he said through a translator .
The cybersecurity experts who say they discovered GhostNet said China was a player in the field , but did not blame Beijing for the attacks .
" Chinese cyber espionage is a major global concern ... ( b) ut attributing all Chinese malware to deliberate or targeted intelligence gathering operations by the Chinese state is wrong and misleading , " says the Canadian report , titled , " Tracking GhostNet : Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network . "
" The sheer number of young digital natives online can more than account for the increase in Chinese malware , " it adds .
But the report also points out that China is among a handful of countries , also including the United States , Israel and the United Kingdom , which are " assumed " to have considerable cyber - espionage capabilities .
Attempts by CNN to contact the Chinese government in Beijing , and its American embassy and consulate offices were unsuccessful .
Hackers gained access to computers in the Dalai Lama 's office by tricking computer users into downloading attachments in e-mail which had been carefully engineered to appear safe , according to the authors of the Cambridge report , titled , " The snooping dragon : social - malware surveillance of the Tibetan movement . "
" The attackers took the trouble to write e-mails that appeared to come from fellow Tibetans and indeed from co-workers , " say the report 's authors , Shishir Nagaraja and Ross Anderson .
Once the attackers gained an initial foothold , " they also stole mail in transit and replaced the attachments with toxic ones , " they add .
The Dalai Lama investigation led to the discovery of hundreds more infected machines in locations from The Associated Press in Britain and Deloitte and Touche in New York , to the ministries of foreign affairs in Indonesia , Iran and the Philippines .
The office of the prime minister of Laos was also snared , as was a single non-secure computer at NATO , " Tracking GhostNet " claims .
Infected computers " checked in " with control servers as early as May 2007 and as recently as March 12 of this year , the report adds .
Attempts by CNN to verify the reports ' allegations with NATO , the Laotian government and the Dalai Lama 's organization in India were not immediately successful on Sunday .

When I said this on Twitter today , it struck up a lot of support .
It actually came out as a throwaway comment in Wednesday ’s Astroengine Live when I was having a rant about the misconception that space exploration is a luxury and not a necessity .
If I was debating this now , I ’d probably be somewhere between “ necessity ” and “ luxury ” .
On the one hand it would be nice to have a very wealthy space agency , carrying out unimaginable science throughout the Solar System , colonies on the Moon and Mars , mining asteroids and setting up an interplanetary transportation system .
On the other hand , none of these things will be possible unless there is huge ( global ) public support and political will …
But then I thought back to Robert Zubrin ’s words about financing a huge manned Mars mission ( Apollo 2.0 style ) to save the economy .
After all , investment in private space contractors , education and training would be the mother of all stimulus plans .
Rather than throwing $ nth billions into failing banking systems , sick economies and damaged infrastructure , do something new with this cash , create a utopian Mars effort , get man onto the Martian regolith within 8 years .
Hell , we can do that !
Yes , we can do that , I ’d even go so far as saying that if the cheque was big enough , we could mount a manned expedition to Mars in five years .
Now that would be impressive .
But this wo n’t happen .
Although the world ’s space agencies are doing their thing in space , each one has their own agenda .
Surely it would be advantageous to team up ?
Perhaps the International Space Station could serve as a blueprint for the future of mankind in space ?
Each member nation provides their best pieces of kit and most gifted individuals , pushing man deeper into space than previously imaginable .
This sentiment was shared by Jeff Foust when he spoke to Astroengine contributor Nina Lincoff yesterday .
“ There are these capabilities that exist around the world and if we partner with them than we can do more of these complex missions and experiments on top of what we already want do .
By developing with a space program that is sophisticated enough and with enough potential helps to elevate you as a country .
If you cooperate with NASA , you enhance your own prestige . ” — Jeff Foust
Although there are plenty of collaborations going on around the world , there is little motivation to push for an “ International Space Ship ” any time soon .
This is primarily due to funding and international politics .
Some things just do n’t change .
So what could motivate the world ’s nations to unite in a massive space exploration collaboration ?
Why should the first man on Mars be American or Russian or Chinese or European ?
Why ca n’t it be all of the above ?
This will probably only happen if the NewSpace era is more than just a fad ; perhaps companies like SpaceX , Bigelow Aerospace , XCOR , Orbital Sciences , Boeing , Lockheed Martin will be the trailblazers of a huge emerging industry .
Space commercialization is happening now , perhaps it will bring together nations under one flag , the flag of profit .
Perhaps this can be done with huge collaborative efforts by international space agencies , governments investing in science and technology , companies being subsidised to provide launch capabilities , orbital solar energy plants , transportation systems and refuelling depots at the Lagrangian points –
[ stop ]
When I start talking like this , I have found that I draw huge criticism from an unlikely crowd of people .
I receive emails and comments from space enthusiasts , not unlike myself , accusing me of being an “ idiot ” , “ naive ” or “ British ” ( yep , somehow “ British ” was used as an insult because “ you lot do n’t have a space agency “ , for some reason this gave me no right to comment on US efforts in space .
Oh do calm down and get to the back of the queue ) .
So this brings me to another point .
Yes , there are many “ dreamers ” when it comes to space exploration , and I consider myself to be one of them .
I do n’t have all the answers to the current issues for NASA , ESA , Rocosmos or the British National Space Centre ( take that Mr “ You Do n’t Have A Space Agency ” !
It may not be well known , but at least we ’re doing something ) , but if we begin stifling people who have an enthusiasm for space exploration just because it does n’t “ fit ” with popular opinion , the very people who might be space exploration visionaries will turn away from the thing they do best : communicate the excitement of scientific endeavour .
Just because us “ dreamers ” may not be “ right ” , it does n’t mean we ’re wrong either .
I ’m sure Elon Musk was accused of being a dreamer at some point when he said , ‘ I know , I ’m going to launch stuff into space and make it cheap !’
As for stimulating humanity to take that next leap of evolution into space , it needs to be a global effort and we need to see humanity spreading to other worlds as a necessity and not a luxury .
I can guarantee that if the single biggest threat to mankind ( apart from ourselves ) is spotted through a telescope in the future , we ’ll really wish we had a thriving space travel infrastructure so we can deal with the ever present threat of an asteroid impact .
Therefore , who needs to stimulate the economy when you need to save a civilization ?
The truth is , there are far greater things at stake than the credit crunch , we need to be prepared to participate in this Solar System of ours to ensure the survival of our species .

無償だから、実験だから、データが消えても構わない、リンクが死んでも構わない、登録していたRSSフィードが死んでも構わないと考えたのだろうか。これから企業情報システムでもSaaSやクラウドの隆盛で課金モデルが多様化しようというご時世に、Doblogにホストしている2000〜3000人だけでなく、その数百倍はいる読者に対して「私たちは予告なくサービスを何ヶ月も止めた挙げ句、全てのデータは復旧できず、唐突な撤退を表明する会社です」と宣伝することの風評リスクは考えなかったのだろうか。
サービスが無償であれ有償であれ、データは利用者のものである。そしてデータとはビット列でダウンロードできるか否かではなく、これまで通り検索から辿り着けるか、リンクを辿れるか、といった文脈に大きく依存している。だからこそお客様のデータを預かるのであれば事業継続性に関わらず、お客様のデータが生き続けるよう最大限の配慮をした方が良い。
具体的には例え ばYahoo!がYahoo Photosを閉鎖した時の対応や、最近だとSONYがEyeVioをスプラシアに営業譲渡したときの対応から学ぶべきではないか。まずは営業譲渡でドメインやサービスを維持できる可能性を模索し、それが難しくとも他社サービスへの円滑なデータ移行をサポートすること等が考えられる。gooはじめブログを引き続き提供するグループ企業はあるのだから、その気になればグループ内で助け合うこともできるはずだ。
吹けば飛ぶベンチャーであれば万年ベータでサービスを立ち上げて、採算が合わないと分かるなり撤退するなり会社を畳めばいいが、名の知れた会社でやる場合には会社の本業を含めた信頼を損なうことがないよう、損益に見合わない損害賠償リスクを負うことのないよう、リスクを管理する必要がある。費用構造や信頼性確保のための追加コストを考えると小回りの効くベンチャーと比べて大きなハンディとなるが仕方ない。
サービスを終了する理由についてブコメ界隈では嘘とか言い訳と書かれているが当人たちに悪気はないのだろう。後知恵ではあるが、もう少し配慮して利用者目線のアナウンスと幕引きを考えれば火に油を注ぐことにはならなかった。重箱の隅を突けばデータを失わない構成で採算を取ることも含めて「ブログシステムを構築するための技術的知見」だし、システムトラブルがあっても利用者への迷惑を最小限に抑えるのが「コミュニティ･サービスを運用・運営するためのノウハウ」だろうから、何がどう「蓄積については十分に達成できた」と結論づけたのか興味深いところではある。
この不景気 でDoblogに限らず数年前のWeb
2.0の掛け声に踊って立ち上げたサービスも優勝劣敗が明らかとなって、どう考えても投資を回収できないので出血を止めたいと考えているIT企業は少なからずあるのではないか。
Webサービスが運用保守にカネがかかり続ける上に利用者から請求できないのは、消費者向けWebサービスに限らず企業向けSaaSやクラウドも同様で、所有からサービスへのシフトが進めば進むほど、利用者に迷惑をかけず風評リスクを回避した不採算サービスからの撤退戦略は事業計画の勘所となるだろう。
今からでも遅くはないか らDoblogは上手にダメージ・コントロール・ダンスを踊ることを考えた方がいい。それは必ずしも既にうんざりさせられている利用者や閲覧者のためではなく、トップマネジメントがSaaSやクラウドの重視を表明しているグループへの風評リスクを最小化するために必要な投資ではないか。うまくやればDataPortabilityの実現へ向けたノウハウ蓄積を図ることもできる。

In this age of 1080 p resolution , to best stress the idea of “ blood ” was to immerse users in a game wrapped in black and white .
MadWorld revolves around the themes of brutality and exhilaration .
To give MadWorld the graphical edge to match its brutal theme , we tried removing all color from the world except for blood .
As a result , we decided the best way to convey blood , and thus brutality , was against this black and white backdrop .
Knowing that there are no other action games with this sort of avant - garde graphical style , our course was set .
By adding touches from American comics , like the exclamations that appear during action scenes , anyone who knows how it feels to read a comic book ( or watch an episode of Tom & Jerry ) should instantly be able to enjoy playing MadWorld .
We are also taking the simple controls of the Wii and adding a variety of actions to the gameplay mix .
Often times , brutality is expressed in a spiteful nature .
There are already plenty of games out there that hit this mark ; however , we decided that MADWORLD ’s brutality should be aimed at providing the user with a sense of exhilaration during play .
To give you an example from gameplay , we have a scene where you can pull a street sign from the ground and shove it into a enemy ’s head .
However , I thought that it is much more fun to stab someone with a sign that actually has some sort of meaning as opposed to a knife .
We tried the idea out , and the reaction amongst the team was so positive , I knew this was the way to proceed .
While one type of action is already fun , one of MadWorld ’s most innovative points is the ability to link and layer these actions together .
For instance , you can grab that enemy with the street sign through his head and throw him against a spiked wall .

Early today hackers launched an attack against the SoapBlox network , wreaking havoc with a significant number of progressive blogs ( including Pam ’s House Blend , My Left Wing and several state - focused sites ) .
At one point it looked as though the whole network may have been trashed , although at this point it seems that some sites ( like our friends at Square State ) were mercifully unaffected ( for the time being , anyway ) .
Some that were initially taken down are now back up and running .
It ’s not yet known who was behind the attack .
Paul Preston , who runs the network , was understandably at the point of despair early today , posting a note saying that the operation was dead .
Fortunately his latest missive notes that things are stabilized and moving ahead , and for this we ’re grateful .
With luck today ’s events will result in the development of a more reliable infrastructure .
Paul has done heroic work building and maintaining SoapBlox , but like a lot of us out here , he ’s been doing so with precious little support or resources .
Perhaps today ’s hack was inevitable , and I hope that it wo n’t be long before we can all look back and say things like “ that was the best thing that ever happened to the progressive blog network . ”
UPDATE : New statement from SoapBlox provides additional details .
Meanwhile , I do n’t know if anyone has yet had time to call the FBI .
If not , it needs to happen soon .
Never mind the nature of the views being expressed on these sites – this attack was a naked broadside aimed at the very infrastructure of public speech and discourse in America , just as surely as if vandals had destroyed the presses used by the likes of Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine back in the 1700s .
As long as the United States professes to be in the free speech business , actions like these cannot be allowed to stand .
Those responsible need to be found and brought to justice , and we at Scholars & Rogues hope that the incoming Attorney General feels as strongly on this point as we do .

Ok I have the fancypants resume .
I have the cover letter .
I pimp that shit out and make it all special and fancy for each and every job I apply too .
I have the little outfit which I iron on the floor of my hovel on top of a cutting board and towel .
Not that it matters , because I DON ’T GET ANY CALLBACKS FROM YOU PEOPLE .
WHAT THE FUCK .
Listen , I KNOW times are tough but !
You post the jobs , I send the resume , and I KNOW I ’m hirable .
I got hired at four , that ’s right , 1234 baking jobs before the economy tanked , and I turned them all down .
Cocky ?
Perhaps .
I did n’t know the stupid economy would take a dump right when I was feeling confident about waiting for a job that was juuuuust right .
So , now I ’m paying the price .
Fine .
I accept that it was a dick move .
And now I ’m applying left and right for baking jobs , any baking jobs , shit , food prep jobs , whatever , piece of crap industrial sweatshop baking jobs , and I get nothing .
WTF do you people want from me ?
Here , here ’s my fucking resume .
Here ’s the real shit , not the kiss - ass garbage I spend hours laboring over on my 2nd hand laptop at the free wifi café .
OBJECTIVETo bake the living shit out of shit .
QUALIFICATIONS : Take all the bile and outrage in this resume .
The food I make is as sweet as these words are bitter .
The cupcakes I make are cuter than a puppy ’s ass .
A whole tray of puppy ’s asses .
I was genetically engineered by the US government in a covert project called BakerBot4000 - R. I do n’t know what the 4000 - R stands for but it ’s as impressive as is sounds .
I crank out bread like that crazy ass Mormon family on TLC cranks out babies .
One time my boss walked in on me at work and I was sleeping but guess what ?
He could n’t say SHIT cause I was baking at the SAME TIME .
Anyway I was n’t really sleeping , I was meditating on the next AWESOME savory scone that could make you forget how to speak your first language .
One time I took a tray of scones out of the oven that were so golden and perfect it was like staring at the face of God , and maybe God was involved because the oven was n’t even PLUGGED IN .
Are you one of those bosses who needs to sit on a stool in the kitchen and tell me about your love life til 3 am ?
I will solve that shit like Dear Abby and Dr. Drew and make you feel good about being such a dumbass .
Are you tired of stupid ass stoner bakers who ca n’t bake without being “ baked ? ” I eat those fools for breakfast .
Are you yourself a pothead ?
Hey , I do n’t judge .
Would you rather not even know I exist , and just want the baked goods to magically appear without having to deal with anyone ’s needy , personal bullshit ?
Wow , that would sure be refreshing .
Do n’t question my methods .
Just stick a muffin in your mouth and shut up .
Also I sweat 100 % pure vanilla extract and I poop marzipan which really cuts back on costs .
JOB HISTORYCome - &- Get - It soup kitchen :
At this job I baked bread so fucking perfect that the local hobos would eat it and instantly transform into one of the following : super hot firemen , solutions to global warming , or just piles of diamonds .
I had a dream about crossaints and this somehow resulted in a fold in space - time , resulting in their invention sometime in the middle ages .
Government contract as BakerBot4000 -R : I ca n’t tell you much about this job or I would have to kill you ( and I totally could . )
I had to leave this job because , I was told , my rate of productivity was making the president “ look bad ” in comparison .
However , it was the Bush administration so I refuse to take responsibility for this .
A Pet Rock could make that guy look bad .
REFERENCESGod taught me the whole manna thing , but I ’ve promised not to abuse my power .
I invented Martha Stewart and when I refused to give up my secret recipe for a cake that causes the consumer to attain a state of perfect bliss , sometimes referred to as nirvana , she went temporarily insane and ended up in jail .
Inspired by Steve Madonna .
Luckily for you all , I am married and Steve and I shall never meet .
Otherwise we would spawn monster beast children that would tear you all apart and render the employment system ( aka “ capitalism ” ) even more obsolete than it already is .
This is not the most prurient example of augmented reality we 've seen , and it may not have an obvious movie tie - in , but we will give it bonus points for being educational .
Visitors to an exhibit titled " A Future for the Past , " currently at the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam , can peep context specific info and virtual reconstructions of Satricum and the Forum Romanum , superimposed on large scale photographs of each respective site .
There are two types of hardware on hand -- both the MovableScreen - packin ' iMac stationary display and the UMPC devices allow the user to seemingly view through the photos , exploring specific points of interest .
There 's no telling how much a setup like this would run you if you wanted to , for example , let your friends and neighbors virtually peruse that massive Lego city you built in the garage , but make sure you let us know when you get it up and running .
That would be so sweet .

Think back to the last time someone handed you a floppy disk that had valuable files on it .
It 's probably been a few years .
Most people no longer even have a floppy drive with which to access the disk .
This is where problems start to arise for some people and businesses .
Will today 's technology become obsolete as quickly as this floppy drive computer ?
For years , individuals and companies have stored important data on floppy disks and magnetic tapes that have either decayed in quality or are no longer accessible due to lack of available hardware to run them .
Up to 20 percent of the information recorded by NASA for the 1976 Viking mission was lost because it was on magnetic tape .
Thousands of years ago people were writing on stone tablets .
Over time stone tablets turned into writing on paper and then all of a sudden we were recording onto magnetic tape , floppy disks , flash memory and most recently , Blu - Ray DVDs .
Recording formats are changing so quickly nowadays that people need to be thinking about whether their files are going to be accessible in a few years in their current format .
Preserving digital material is n’t as easy as filing away a few papers .
You must make sure the file format you store them on will make them easily accessible in the years to come .
Take , for example , JVC ’s Everio line of hard - drive camcorders .
Instead of recording in a standard format such as .avi or .mpeg , they record in .tod .
Only a few programs can even read that file format because it is so obscure .
So you have to go through a lengthy conversion process where there is a potential for a loss of image and audio quality .
Who knows - maybe in 10 years . tod files will not be supported by any program , and those videos will be lost .
Technology has helped us preserve history at a greater rate than in years past but it requires us to be more proactive while doing it .
So here 's the question :
Should there be more of a standard format for preserving digital files , and should there be better support for future use of those varied formats ?

Update 2 : scroll down .
we found another source .
Update :
We have received an email from Noah K. of yu+co :
“ Please remove the Watchmen titles from your site .
It has copyright laws protecting it .
I am asking nicely .
The site has ben flagged and the next person will not be as friendly .
Please remove to protect yourself .
Thank you . ”
* Free speech time *
Noah , I genuinely thank you and yu+co for your willingness to share this artwork with the world .
However , I ’m thoroughly upset with Hollywood ’s actions .
Just on the basis of curiosity – will removing the video “ protect ” myself from one of those mean and scary MPAA lawyers ?
While I ’m willing to cooperate with your request , I ’m failing to understand the intentions of Hollywood ’s top executives : is it one of their main objectives to prevent their work from having an online viral effect ?
Does that mean they do n’t want more visibility , and further , a larger fan base ?
The video montage was a work of art .
Viewers of this web site were appreciating what your company did , they were not stealing it .
It was a simple , unique and all - around awesome sequence .
I mean , come on , Hollywood .
This is why I think they ’re being , well , silly :
(1) They ’re putting an unexplainable amount of time and effort …
( 2 ) to threateningly take down this particular video …
( 3 ) from every web site and blog …
(4) IN THE WORLD .
(5) The sad news is that it simply will not stop people from finding it .
The MPAA can huff and puff , but they will never blow the Internet down – nobody ’s scared of the big , bad wolf anymore .
By the time they ’re ( close to ) taking down all sources of this amazing video art piece , the DVD for Watchmen will already be out .
And people who would have originally seen merely the opening credits would have already ( surprise ! ) found the movie ’s torrent .
The Internet can not be stopped .

“ Anyway … to respect copyright and uY + co , ( and Noah K at uY + co ) I am not hosting this on my site .
Out of respect to the incredible Watchmen movie , I am just pointing to another place that does host it .
Just like Google and all the other search engines do . ”

To me , this was a very unique opening sequence .
The opening , made by Yu+Co , had a very old comic book feel to it with subtle movements and cg effects .
The company was nice enough to post it on their website for the whole web to see .
The company has also done big film credit sequences for films like 300 , Enchanted , and The Italian Job .
Every piece of work they have done was done in good taste and great creativity .
The idea for The Watchmen ’s opening credit sequence seems very much like those old Gatorade commercials .

Some of the early reports out of Pittsburgh indicate the man who shot three cops today was fearful that the Obama administration was going to " take away his guns . "
A man opened fire on officers during a domestic disturbance call Saturday morning , killing three of them , a police official said .
Friends said he feared the Obama administration was poised to ban guns .
Three officers were killed , said a police official at the scene who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media .
Police spokeswoman Diane Richard would only say that at least five officers were wounded , but would n't give any other details .
...
One friend , Edward Perkovic , said the gunman feared " the Obama gun ban that 's on the way " and " did n't like our rights being infringed upon . "
Another longtime friend , Aaron Vire , said he feared that President Obama was going to take away his rights , though he said he " was n't violently against Obama . "
Perkovic , a 22 - year - old who said he was the gunman 's best friend , said he got a call at work from him in which he said , " Eddie , I am going to die today .
...
Tell your family I love them and I love you . "
He feared an Obama gun grab ?
Gee , I wonder where he could have heard that .
Indeed , a story replete with NRA - style fearmongering about the looming " grab " -- which has been fueling a run on guns at local shops -- ran just three days ago in the Pittsburgh Tribune .
We 've been reporting for awhile on the surge in gun sales , and how the paranoia around guns is making the more unstable elements of the right particularly edgy .
Inevitably , that edginess is going to break out into actual violence -- as it appears to have done today .
Ironically , this is exactly the kind of incident that law - enforcement intelligence - gathering is supposed to help prevent -- intelligence like the Missouri State Patrol report so hysterically attacked by these same paranoid right - wingers .
I tried to explain at the time that these kinds of extremists are in fact a very real danger to people in law enforcement , but all anyone on the right wanted to talk about was Ron Paul bumper stickers .
Well , there you go .
My new book is looking more timely all the time .
We 'll have an announcement about it Monday .
“ Nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . ”
So declared President Obama , after his commendable decision to release the legal memos that his predecessor used to justify torture .
Some people in the political and media establishments have echoed his position .
We need to look forward , not backward , they say .
No prosecutions , please ; no investigations ; we ’re just too busy .
And there are indeed immense challenges out there : an economic crisis , a health care crisis , an environmental crisis .
Is n’t revisiting the abuses of the last eight years , no matter how bad they were , a luxury we ca n’t afford ?
No , it is n’t , because America is more than a collection of policies .
We are , or at least we used to be , a nation of moral ideals .
In the past , our government has sometimes done an imperfect job of upholding those ideals .
But never before have our leaders so utterly betrayed everything our nation stands for .
“ This government does not torture people , ” declared former President Bush , but it did , and all the world knows it .
And the only way we can regain our moral compass , not just for the sake of our position in the world , but for the sake of our own national conscience , is to investigate how that happened , and , if necessary , to prosecute those responsible .
This week 's podcast is even more eclectic than usual , taking in armageddon , vampires , the mafia and an off - screen baby , too .
With Jason Solomons away on paternity leave , Xan Brooks contemplates the end of the world with the eco- drama - documentary The Age of Stupid .
Director Franny Armstrong tells Xan how she was inspired by Steven Soderbergh 's Traffic for the structure of her film , and how she persuaded Pete Postlethwaite to appear in it .
Just before he went , Jason caught up with Gavin and Stacey 's James Corden and Mathew Horne to discuss their buddy - movie - horror - caper Lesbian Vampire Killers and camping it up in the best British tradition .
And finally , Peter Bradshaw joins Xan to cast their critical eyes over the latest releases .
Up for scrutiny are Duplicity , the slick , cerebral , quadruple - crossing comedy with Julia Roberts and Clive Owen ; the huge American hit Paul Blart : Mall Cop ; and Il Divo , Paulo Sorrentino 's fascinating biopic of the former Italian prime minister Giulio Andreotti .
State officials have issued new guidelines saying California drivers cannot lose their licenses just because they have a medical marijuana prescription .
A revised Department of Motor Vehicles ’ training memo instructs agency staff to treat medical marijuana like any other prescription drug when considering whether to renew a driver ’s license .
Medical marijuana advocates released the memo this week and credited the changes to lawsuits filed by medical marijuana patients whose licenses were revoked .
A DMV spokesman said the revisions do not represent a new policy but merely spell out guidelines already in practice .
Medical marijuana is legal in California under a voter - approved ballot measure passed in 1996 .
As you start working on your research projects , you should look to the published scholarship about The Wire as useful sources .
As of now , there is one published book of essays , The Wire : Urban Decay & American Television ( edited by Tiffany Potter & C.W. Marshall ) that is on reserve for our course ( PN1992.77.W53 W57 2009 ) – you can view the table of contents on the publisher ’s page .
There are also two theme issues of academic journals on the show : an issue of dark matter ( an online journal ) and Film Quarterly ( available on - campus through this link ) .
It is essential that you look through these sources for potential research that relates to your projects .
However , note that until we ’ve finished the series , many essays will reveal crucial plot points from season 5 , so tread lightly for spoilers or plan to start digging in on May 4 .
If you find other sources that are helpful , please post links or citations to them in the comment thread here .
Words fascinate me .
The origin of words , otherwise known as etymology , I find to be such a fascinating exploration .
We are so accustomed to the words we speak and write each day that it's not often that we stop and examine where they came from , how they were originally used , and who introduced them .
The word " etymology " comes from the Greek word etumos which means real or true ; while ology is the study of something .
Take the word hippopotamus .
The Greeks called horses hippos , while " potamus " meant river : so a hippo is essentially a river horse .
There are endless examples of derivatives that make up the English language .
One such word we use often in the modern world , yet did n't even exist not long ago , is blog , the contraction of the word weblog ( which you just so happen to be on now ) .
Recently , while reading about the origins of words , I discovered that William Shakespeare was a master at introducing words into our language .
Of the many sonnets , poems , and plays he wrote , 1,700 of the words included were FIRST written by Shakespeare himself .
Many of them we use so frequently that it's hard to imagine them not being a part of our vocabulary .
Some of those include :
accommodation admirable advertising ( adj. ) aerial Photo by THEORO amazement apostrophe assassination bedroom belongings to besmirch birthplace bloody bump changeful control ( as a noun ) countless courtship critic critical cruelhearted disgraceful dishearten dislocate dwindle employer employment engagement eventful exposure eyeball farmhouse fashionable fitful frugal generous gloomy gnarled hostile housekeeping hurry impartial indistinguishable invitation invulnerable lapse laughable lonely lustrous majestic mimic misplaced monumental motionless multitudinous obscene pious premeditated published radiance reliance road sanctimonious satisfying shipwrecked shooting star submerge suspicious unearthly unwillingness varied
This is obviously a short list of his impact on language and the usage of words .
He also coined many phrases that have become accepted and regularly employed , like :
all that glitters is not gold
be all and end all break the ice catch a cold clothes make the man dog will have his day elbowroom fair play fancy - free foregone conclusion give the devil his due green eyed monster heart of gold hot - blooded housekeeping it 's Greek to me lackluster leapfrog live long day long - haired method in his madness mind 's eye naked truth one fell swoop primrose path strange bedfellows the course of true love never did run smooth the milk of human kindness to thine own self be true too much of a good thing wear one 's heart on one 's sleeve Next time you happen to use one of these words or phrases , give a small nod to Mr. Shakespeare .
I 'm sure he would dig that !
To read more about these words that Shakespeare 's first introduced , check out the excellent book , " Coined by Shakespeare : Words and Meanings First Penned by the Bard " by Stanley Malless .
Tori and Candy Spelling : Latest War of Words
It 's always fun to hear about a Hollywood fight among family members and when it comes toand her mom Candy , there have been many .
Now the two ladies have decided to take it to the pages of their new books .
On April 14 , 2009 Candy 's book Stories From Candyland will hit bookstores .
Her book is a memoir that her rep assures will not be a tell - all but more a series of " little vignettes " of her life .
Candy is a guest blogger for the Huffington Post and a columnist for Los Angeles Confidential .
As for Tori , her new book Mommywood was supposed to be released on April 28 , 2009 but oddly enough that has changed and now both books will come out on the same day .
Tori 's rep stated that this was not his clients decision but the publishers decision in order to get in on Mother 's Day promotions at major retailers .
Tori knows what it tastes like to have a number one book on the New York Times bestseller list .
She scored that with her first book sTori Telling .
It should be fun to see who comes out on top .
We 're guessing Candy will have plenty to say , oh ... in probably some sort of open letter .
Good luck ladies !

China says the bronzes were taken abroad illegally 150 years ago China has condemned what it calls the illegal auction in Paris of two bronze artefacts taken from a Chinese palace 150 years ago .
The strong statement said China did not recognise the 31 m euro ( £ 28 m , $ 39 m ) sale of the bronze rat and rabbit .
It also ordered tighter checks on artefacts that Christie 's auction house takes into or out of China .
The bronzes were sold as part of the estate of late French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent .
China says the animal heads were part of a collection of 12 looted from the Old Summer Palace in Beijing in 1860 when it was sacked and burnt by French and British armies during the Second Opium War .
This will have a serious impact on [ Christie 's ] development in China
The State Administration of Cultural Heritage , China
The animals represent the Chinese zodiac , and adorned a fountain built for the Emperor Qianlong .
China has managed to track down five of the other statues , which are now displayed in a Beijing museum .
It had earlier called on Christie 's to stop the bronzes ' sale .
New limits " The State Administration of Cultural Heritage resolutely opposes and condemns all auctions of artefacts illegally taken abroad , " the agency said in a statement posted on its website .
" Christie 's must take responsibility for the consequences created by this auction . "
The cultural heritage agency said it had " pressed for the withdrawal of these Summer Palace relics " .
Everyone we spoke to believed that the bronzes should be returned to China
James Reynolds
Reynolds ' blog : China 's bronzes " But Christie 's took its own course and insisted on auctioning the relics looted from the Summer Palace in breach of the spirit of international pacts and the consensus on the return of such artefacts to their original countries , " it said .
The Chinese heritage administration said the auction would bring repercussions as it had " harmed the cultural rights and national feeling of the Chinese people " .
" This will have a serious impact on its development in China , " it said in the statement to the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party .
In a separate statement , it said new limits would be imposed on what Christie 's could take in or out of China .
Christie 's said it regretted Beijing 's " reprisal measures " .
" We continue to believe that sale by public auction offers the best opportunity for items to be repatriated as a result of worldwide exposure . "
The auction house remained committed to China and was ready to discuss the situation with its cultural heritage agency , it said .
Last year Christie 's global sales totalled $ 5.1 bn ( £ 2.8 bn ) , its website said .
Its main hub in Asia is in Hong Kong , where a booming market led to sales of $ 452.3 m in 2008 .
Online commentaries in China have blamed France , not just Christie's , at a time when ties between Paris and Beijing have already been strained by French President Nicolas Sarkozy 's meeting late last year with the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader , the Dalai Lama .
Hong Kong actor Jackie Chan has also joined the criticism , calling the artefacts ' sale " shameful " .
" They remain looted items , no matter whom they were sold to .
Whoever took it out ( of China ) is himself a thief , " AFP news agency quoted him as saying .

Patty is at Motel 6 on Roscoe - w4 m - 38
Reply to : pers-bcp5n-1220365113@craigslist.org
I ’m leaving tomorrow for Canada .
If you have any balls , McGough , you ’ll come and say good bye because I do n’t know if me and the little ones will ever be back .
Grow some freakin’ balls dude .
Stop calling the cops like a puss .
Be a man .
This is your last chance to see me and speak honestly and explain why you lied to the cops .
Why you would do something so mean to me .
I deserve an explanation .
Pronouncing your impotency was mean , but does n’t equate to trying to have me locked up .
Patty dipped a towel into the metal bucket of ice , half water by now but still cold .
She wrung it out and brought it to her forehead .
When she pulled it away , there was a brown stain of day - old sweat .
Patty aired herself out by pacing around the room , feeling too keyed - up , but at the same time too lazy , to shower .
The room smelled old and dry and faintly of drug store perfume .
Flat sunlight poked through moth eaten curtains , pink flowers against a blue sky .
Patty could see Donald and little Julie roughhousing out by the pool .
Donald had found a plastic squirt gun and was using it to douse his sister in chlorine .
The girl retaliated by chucking golf ball - sized berries at his head .
Patty lit her second - to - last Virginia Slim and thumped down on the bed .
The comforter was a flipped - around version of the curtains .
Blue flowers on pink sky .
Patty sighed once , and then again after she decided she deserved it .
There was leftover Chinese in the fridge , and Patty mulled the idea of cold broccoli in greasy peanut sauce .
She lifted her shirt and stuck a finger into the corner of her once - white bra .
She pulled out a wet wad of crumpled hundred dollar bills .
“ Canada , ” Patty muttered .
“ They use dollars in Canada ? ”
There was a knock on the door and then two more .
Patty leapt up , shoving the money back down inside her cleavage .
She peeked through the curtains .
Donald was holding Julie by her feet and dangling the little girl over the pool .
Julie shrieked bloody murder while Donald cackled like late night TV .
Patty dropped the curtain and smoothed her hair .
She checked the peephole , but it was too scratched up to see through .
She pulled open the door with a tentative hand .
McGough .
Patty felt her anger rise like acid reflux .
She slammed the door right back in McGough ’s swollen pig face and fell onto the bed .
She clenched her fists and ground her molars , practically tombstones .
She opened the door .
“ McGough . ”
McGough grunted .
Patty let him in .
She put her hands on her hips and chewed gum that was n’t there .
They stood like that for a while , roughly unlit dynamite .
“ You want Chinese ? ” Patty finally asked .
McGough shrugged .
Patty got the broccoli and the orange chicken from the fridge and handed the cartons to McGough along with a pair of wooden chopsticks .
“ The hell I ’m supposed to do with these ? ”
Patty shook her head .
She took the chopsticks back from McGough and demonstrated the over , under method for scooping food .
“ You never used chopsticks before ? ”
McGough shrugged again .
He tried to do as Patty showed .
A sticky clump of chicken fell from the box and died on the carpet .
Patty laughed despite herself .
McGough let out a quick snort .
Seconds later , they were steamrolling the bed , crunching the blue flowers with their bulk .
McGough sucked the sweat off Patty ’s neck .
Patty reached for McGough ’s belt buckle , a pistol of polished brass .
McGough breathed deeply .
Patty clawed at his pants .
McGough jumped back suddenly .
Patty reached out for him and he slapped her hand away .
“ Patty .
I can ’t . ”
She looked at him and shrugged .
Pulled splinters from the chopsticks .
Stuck one in her mouth and sucked it slowly .
McGough tightened his shiny buckle .
“ I mean … I can ’t . ”
Oh .
Patty began to laugh .
Quietly at first , then loud enough to ruin a nap .
“ I swear to fucking god . ”
McGough grabbed the carton of broccoli and threw it at the wall , where it thwacked and slimed down the cheap paint .
He tucked his shirt back into his pants and stomped towards the door .
“ You better go get your kids before they drown each other to death .
Cops can be here in under five . ”
Patty looked through the window where Donald and Julie were chicken fighting in the water , using sticks to jab each other in the belly .
She pulled ice from the metal bucket and sucked .
“ McGough ? ”
McGough turned , a quiver below his snout .
“ They use dollars in Canada ? ”

Several hundred students have fallen ill at the New York school hit by a swine flu outbreak , city officials said today as the number of confirmed cases in the United States rose to 64 , with at least seven people hospitalized .
A U.S. health official said deaths were likely .
“ I fully expect we will see deaths from this infection , ” as swine flu cases are investigated , said Richard Besser , acting director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
New York has the largest number of swine flu cases , with a heavy concentration at a Catholic school in Queens where students recently went on a spring break trip to Mexico .
There were indications that the outbreak may have spread beyond the school , with two people having to be hospitalized and officials closing a school for autistic kids down the road .
Those cases have not been confirmed .
“ It is here and it is spreading , ” New York City Health Commissioner Thomas Frieden said .
“ We do not know whether it will continue to spread . ”
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that 82 of 380 students at P.S. 177 , a school for autistic children , have called in sick .
A third school in Manhattan is being evaluated because students there are sick , Frieden said .
The CDC said the country has 64 confirmed cases across five states , with 45 in New York , one in Ohio , two in Kansas , six in Texas and 10 in California .
At least four other cases have been reported by states .
At least five other people have been hospitalized in the U.S. , including three in California and two in Texas , Besser said .
The increase is not surprising .
For days , CDC officials have said they expected to see more confirmed cases — and more severe illnesses .
Health officials across the country have stepped up efforts to look for cases , especially among people with flu - like illness who had traveled to Mexico .
CDC officials also had warned that updates in the number of confirmed cases would at times be disjointed , as different states announce new information before the CDC ’s national count is updated .
A handful of schools around the country have closed over swine flu fears and some people are wearing masks , but it ’s mostly business as usual in the U.S. , even at border crossings into Mexico .
So the leech whose salary as Attorney General of the United States we pay , who is , in effect , our employee — even our servant , if you swallow Leviathan ’s claptrap about public service — reviled us as " a nation of cowards " last week .
Try calling your boss a yellow belly and see what that does for the old working relationship .
Yet Public Servant Eric
Holder not only delivered this insult in his " Remarks " for the " Department of Justice [ DOJ ] African American History Month Program , " he expects our deferential agreement .
And what makes us cowards ?
Have we defended the torture of helpless prisoners , as has Holder ’s DOJ ?
Or the armed kidnapping of a terrified , 6 - year - old refugee fleeing Castro ’s hell ?
Have we preyed on folks who prefer reefer to rum , ginning up crises and calling for longer terms of imprisonment to curry favor with voters ?
Have we kicked the down and dying Second Amendment in the hopes of advancing our career with the Democratic Party ?
No .
We ’re jellyfish because we do n’t share Holder ’s obsession with skin-color .
And yet the hypocrite alleging our racism lives in a glass house .
" We still speak too much of u2018 them ’ , " Holder confesses , " and not u2018us . ’ "
Actually , regardless of how politicians like the AG " speak " about their fellowmen , the rest of us likely do n’t much notice the Creator ’s rainbow of hues , except as a descriptive : when asking the rector about a parishioner I do n’t know , I might say , " The elderly black lady who sits in the first few pews and always wears a red hat . "
Holder can laze about the office we buy him and " speak of u2018 them ’ " ; the rest of us are too busy working and paying taxes for such tawdriness .
Holder ’s " Remarks " are a vacuous yet horrifying blend of platitudes , pap , megalomania , and threats .
Here ’s a federal official lusting not only to know our thoughts and emotions but to compel their conformity with his : " Through its work and through its example this Department of Justice , as long as I am here , must — and will — lead the nation to the u2018new birth of freedom ’ so long ago promised by our greatest President .
[ Yo , Barack : I smell disloyalty in the ranks . ]
This is our duty and our solemn obligation . "
Funny : the DOJ ’s " Mission Statement " is about as unconstitutional as they come , but even it does n’t mention any such " duty . "
Despite their inanity , Holder cleverly phrases his " Remarks . "
He appears to accuse all ethnicities of refusing to " talk enough with each other about race " : his is an equal - opportunity condemnation .
But he knows that we know who ’s really at fault for this " truly sad " and " continuing problem . "
Ironically , as Holder bloviated about the DOJ ’s " duty and …solemn obligation " to force his fetish on the rest of us , one of New York City ’s biggest buffoons seemed determined to spoof the whole topic .
Al Sharpton pitched yet another fit , this time over a political cartoon in the New York Post : two cops stand over a " violent " chimpanzee they shot and killed in Connecticut after it mauled a woman ; one cop tells the other , " They ’ll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill . "
Al spies a reference here to Barack Obama .
Hmmm .
Either
Al ’s illiterate or he has an unhealthy fixation with the charlatan in the White House .
How else to account for reading the president into this caption since Congress writes legislation and the bill in question originated with the last Administration ?
( Come to think of it , the previous Thief - in - Chief did bear a striking simian resemblance … )
But Al ’s made a career of ignoring picayune things like facts .
Clearly , this cartoon calls Obama a monkey — “ troubling at best , " Al roared , " given the historic racist attacks of African - Americans as being synonymous with monkeys . ”
He manufactured enough dudgeon to hurl himself and 200 protestors at the Post ’s offices .
Alas , the besieged Post apologized .
But Al does n’t want apologies .
He wants power .
Like many " civil rights activists , " he ’s a failed candidate who ca n’t satisfy his lust to boss us at the ballot box .
Ergo , he rabble - rouses , which lets him boss his foolish followers and the companies they bully instead .
He denounced the Post ’s mea culpa with all the bluster and intimidation we ’ve come to expect from such churls : " The New York Post statement will be discussed by all of the leadership of the various groups that have mobilized and we will respond to it at the rally at 5 p.m. [ Friday ] outside of the New York Post . … we will make a collective decision on how to proceed .
…
Let us remember that Mr. [ Rupert ] Murdoch [ the Post ’s publisher ] got a waiver from the FCC so he could own two radio , two television stations and a newspaper in this town .
We will ask the FCC to review that waiver . "
Hard to believe a goon this heavy - handed has n’t managed to win even one of his five political campaigns .
Demagogues as fraudulent and malicious as Al immediately jumped on his band - wagon .
" To compare the nation ’s first African - American commander - in - chief to a dead chimpanzee is nothing short of racist drivel , " huffed Barbara Ciara , president of the National Association of Black Journalists .
Barb is doubtless an expert on racist drivel , as the white , Hispanic , and Asian journalists unwelcome in her organization could testify .
No racial hustling is complete without Spike Lee .
" This is not the end , ” he growled at Friday ’s demonstration .
“ It ’s not just black folks .
It ’s an insult to everybody . ”
Oh , come on , Spike .
The only insult is coming from you et Al , and it ’s aimed at our intelligence .
Obama has a great many crimes to his credit , but get over it : he did n’t write the bail - out bill .
So the cartoon ’s chimp refers to the Congressional cretins who did , OK ?
Nor could the governor of New York resist adding his two cents , even if they jangled incoherently .
“ They [ sic — presumably the Post ? ] do feed a kind off a negative and stereotypical way that people think , " David Patterson babbled , " but I think if it ’s enough that people are raising this issue , I hope they would clarify it .
In a situation like this where an economic downturn has shown in the past that it does lead to a lot of unnecessary and stereotypical characterizations , an explanation is in order . ”
You betcha ; in fact , maybe someone could explain Dave ’s meaning .
Then the governor revealed what ’s driving him and no doubt many of the Post ’s other enemies : “ I ’m trying to be fair to the New York Post , who [ sic ] has never been very fair to me . "
The Post understands the game being played : it noted in its apology that " there are some in the media and in public life who have had differences with The Post in the past — and they see the incident as an opportunity for payback . "
Al can thank the fierce competition over subscribers in a town with multiple daily newspapers for the extensive and sympathetic ink he ’s garnering .
While he uses his followers as pawns in his struggle for power , Murdoch ’s competitors use him .
Meanwhile , if the cartoon offends anyone , it oughta be the chimps .
What slander , to compare even the most violent primate on his worst day with the thugs and warmongers in Congress .
Where ’s PETA when you need them ?

• Lifespan half that of wild animals , report says • Call for health checks and phasing out of captivity
Animal welfare officers yesterday urged zoos to phase out keeping elephants , after two damning reports found the animals suffer serious health problems and die much younger in captivity .
Elephants born and raised in zoos live less than half as long as those living in their native Africa and Asia , despite being protected from predators and having better care , according to one of the reports .
Many of the deaths are thought to be linked to obesity , because the animals are well fed but get very little exercise in their small enclosures .
Scientists also blamed high stress levels , which the animals suffer most after being transferred between zoos and being separated from their mothers .
Scientists called on zoos to introduce immediate health checks on elephants to identify obese and stressed animals .
In one study , researchers led by Ros Clubb , a wildlife scientific officer at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , analysed records of 786 Asian and African female elephants kept in European zoos between 1960 and 2005 .
They then compared the lifespans of the captive animals with Asian elephants used by a logging company in Burma , and African elephants living in the Amboseli national park in Kenya .
Asian elephants born in captivity typically lived for 18.9 years , while those used as working animals in Burma survived for 41.7 years .
African elephants also fared worse , living for 16.9 years in captivity and 35.9 years in the wild .
When the scientists discounted African elephants killed by people in the national park , the typical lifespan reached 56 years , more than three times as long as those kept in zoos .
" You would expect captive elephants to live at least as long , if not longer , than those in the wild because they are better cared for , but that is not the case .
The difference is massive , " said Clubb , whose study appears in the US journal Science .
A second report , commissioned by the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , examined the welfare of 77 elephants in 13 UK zoos .
It found that the animals spent 83 % of their time indoors and 71 were overweight .
Only 11 were able to walk normally .
" We often hear that zoos play a vital role in conserving elephants but patently this is not the case , " said Rob Atkinson , head of wildlife science at the RSPCA .
" The new data shows elephants die young in Europe 's zoos , and those Asian elephants born in captivity have a poor chance of survival .
Surely the way forward is to encourage conservation programmes in native habitats rather than condemn elephants to a shortened and unhealthy existence in our zoos . "
He added : " Elephants are having a torrid time in our zoos , judging by this overwhelming evidence , and action must be taken to alleviate their welfare problems as a matter of urgency . "
Zoo enclosures for elephants are typically 60 to 100 times smaller than the smallest wild territories .
African elephants can roam over 2,000 square miles , and Asian elephants 300 square miles .
In captivity , researchers said , elephants are also at risk from infanticide , tuberculosis , herpes and lameness .
Most proposals that are being made rely on a very big increase in carbon free energy , both to charge electric vehicles ( EV’s ) and to replace oil and natural gas ( NG ) presently used for hot water and space heating .
In this post , I lay out a path by which 50 % of North American energy might come from wind by 2030 , including replacement of a large share of oil and natural gas use by electricity .
Would a “ 50 % of electricity generated by wind scenario ” work in North America by 2030 ?
In this post , I make a rough cut estimate of what might be required to make such a transition in about 20 years time .
This is a guest post from Neil Howes .
Neil has recently retired from his position as an Associate Professor at the University of Sydney .
Neil 's previous guest posts at TOD include " A North American Energy Plan for 2030 : Hydro-electricity the forgotten renewable energy resource " and " A National Electricity Grid For Australia " .
Quantity of Additional Low - Carbon Electricity Required
Present electrical consumption is 550 GWa .
If the North American countries - Canada , Mexico and the United States - were to replace :
70 % of their oil usage ( by replacing over 90 % of the oil used for heating and land transportation with electricity and 50 % of the jet fuel used via a combination of conservation measures ) ,
95 % of the coal used for electricity production ( 250 Gwa ) and
half of the NG used for hot water and space heating ( 60GWa )
They would need to generate an additional 450GWa , but would net out coal replaced of 250 GWa , for a total of 750 GWa production .
In a previous article , I have shown that hydro electricity could account for a third of this ( 140GWa ) .
Other possible low carbon energy resources are solar , wind , geothermal , ocean ( tidal and wave ) , biogas and nuclear power .
What if hydro- electricity can only be increased by 50 % by 2030 ( from 94 to 141GWa ) rather than the 130 % increase that I have previously suggested , and if other additional low carbon energy sources can only account for an additional 50GWa ?
This would mean that either more than 5 % of today ’s thermal coal would be needed to generate electricity or an additional 372GWa would have to come from wind power ( 50 % of total ) .
I am not suggesting it would be desirable to obtain more than 50 % of electricity from wind , but wind capacity can be built quickly , and there do not seem to be any serious resource limitations to expanding wind ( a recent report from the US Interior department noted that offshore wind alone could supply enough power to meet all US electricity needs ) .
This level of wind power has been suggested by some ( such as Repower America ) as possible and practical , but many have questioned if wind could even provide 15 - 20 % electrical energy because of the intermittency of wind energy .
For the purpose of the discussion of wind intermittency , I am assuming that an expanded North American grid extending from Alaska to Labrador in the North , and south beyond Mexico City will be built .
Such an extended grid would help smooth out fluctuations .
Electricity from Wind
Although only 9GWa was generated from wind power in 2008 ( 26GW installed capacity ) , this represents 1.7 % of N America ’s electricity production and wind capacity addition has growing at about 30 % per year over the last decade .
The advantage of wind energy is that new capacity can be built quickly ( 1 - 2 years ) , with small incremental low risk investments .
Wind energy is less site specific than hydro , has less impact on the environment , and wind energy does n’t require cooling water .
The cost of wind power capacity had been declining with technical advances , until the last 2 years with increased costs caused by rising material costs ( especially steel and cement ) and manufacturing capacity constraints .
These costs now seem to be declining from very high levels in early 2008 .
Capacity 2008 Average 2008 Capacity 2030 Average 2030 Lowest production 2030 Hydro 160 GWc 94 GWa 260 GWc 141 GWa 20 GW
Pumped storage included in hydro ( 3 GW ) included in hydro ( 6 GW ) ( 40 GW ) Coal 350 GWc 250 GW 100 GW ( weeks ) 5 GWa ( summer ) 0 Natural Gas 450 GWa 100 GWa 450 GWc ( days ) 40 GWa 0 Wind 26 GW 9 GWa 1142 GW ( 546 GW max ) 372 GWa 312 GW ( >98 % ) Solar ( CSP ) 0.5 GW 0.1 GW 50 GW 12.5 GWa 0 Nuclear 110 GW 100 GWa 130 GWc 125 GWa 100 GW V2G ( PHEV ) 0 0 50 GW ( for 6h ) ( 100 GW ) ( 150 GW for 10h ) Oil ( Mexico ) 10 GW < 10 GW 0 0 0 Total 1056 GW 556 GWa 2147 GW 780.5 GW Table 1 : Electricity supply and grid regulating ( demand ) in N America 2008 and 2030
High quality wind resources ( wind speeds greater than 6.9m / sec ) in the US are estimated to be > 5,500GWa , about x10 all of N America ’s present electricity production of 550GWa .
Canada ’s potential appears to be similar or greater than the US , while Mexico ’s wind resources are more limited ( these figures do not include deep offshore resources that could be harnessed by floating wind turbines or higher altitude wind resources that could potentially be harnessed by airborne wind turbines ) .
For example , the Great Lakes have excellent offshore wind resources , and are close to major demand , with a potential of 321GWa in Michigan waters alone .
Wind resources are widely distributed although some regions especially the SE of US , have poorer resources .
If an additional 372GWa was to be generated from wind power by 2030 , this would require an expansion of today ’s 26GW capacity to 1142 GWc .
I am using a 0.33 capacity factor although this could well be higher as larger turbines are built and with expanded grid infrastructure , better remote wind sites will be developed including off - shore wind having a higher capacity factor .
Such an expansion would require new capacity additions to rise from the 2008 level of 9GWc to 60 GWc per year by 2013 , and continue at that level until 2030 .
This is more than the National Renewable Energy Lab's ( NREL ) 20 % by 2030 wind power proposal that envisioned installing 16GW capacity per year , but the NREL expected much slower growth than has occurred , thus the US alone has reached 2013 expected capacity in 2008 .
Wind capacity would have to increase by 50 % for 5 years to reach 60 GW capacity additions per year by 2013 , allowing an additional 1110 GW capacity to be built by 2030 .
As the NREL study showed , wind turbine manufacture is suited to rapidly expanding capacity , providing capital and labor are available .
Many components , such as large towers and turbine blades can be manufactured locally from steel plate , glass fiber and resins , or casting made using multiple molds prepared from master plugs .
Foundations and electrical connects can be built using normal reinforced concrete construction methods that are used for road , bridge and multi-story construction .
ERoEI and Life Cycle Resources
Both hydro electricity and wind power have high ERoEI , hydro because of the long life of structures ( > 100 years ) and wind because of the fast energy payback , even assuming a 20 year life of turbines .
Earlier studies of turbines built in 1990 ’s 100-750 kW capacity had an average ERoEI of 18:1 , but larger turbines ( 500 - 750kW ) had > 30:1 .
Turbines are now 1.5- 3.5 MW and appear to have ERoEI of 30 - 200:1 , with energy paybacks of a few months .
Life - cycle analysis indicates that wind energy , is low FF use , and CO2 emissions ( 5 - 40 g/ kWh ) about 25 to 100 times less than coal - fired electricity .
Oil used for road transport would be 1 - 5 % of energy use .
The steel required to build 60 GW capacity per year would be 6.9 million tonnes ( 115tonnes / MW capacity ) , about half the amount of scrap steel that could be recovered annually from scrapped N American automobiles , using electric arc furnaces .
Integrating 50 % wind energy into a continental grid .
Wind energy is variable at one location , producing less than 30 % of the average output ( ie. < 10 % capacity ) about 30 % of the time , but as the distance between wind farms increases the correlation between power output and locations decreases .
Most studies of wind integration into grids have examined relatively small geographic regions , such as Denmark ( 43,000 km ^ 2 ) , Northern Germany ( < 50,000 km ^ 2 ) , and the UK ( 250,000 km ^ 2 ) .
A UK study looked at sites up to 800 km separation ( North / South ) , and found a low correlation between distant sites , so that > 80 % of the time a wind grid would be producing > 30 % average output .
Even more optimistic predictions were made by Archer and Jacobson , when they examined predicted output of up to 19 sites covering a 850x850 km region ( 700,000 km ^ 2 ) in US mid-west .
Better information about wind shear at heights typical of modern turbines , and the “ nocturnal jet ” show that more consistent wind power is available during summer evenings than originally realised .
Similar studies in Australia with 9 sites in 3 states , over a 4 year period , separated by up to 1500 km , showed energy output was > 10 % capacity 98 % of the time during peak demand summer months .
Canadian wind strength - source ( pdf )
Critics of wind energy can cite specific times when wind energy provided little , for example ERCOT in Texas , Feb 2008 , 2992MW wind capacity only produced 300 MW ( 6 % ) or in California on July24 , 2006 , during peak power demand , where 2377MW wind capacity only produced 333MW ( 12 % capacity ) .
While Texas ( 695,000 km ^2 ) and California ( 423,000 km ^ 2 ) are large by European standards , two sites in California ( San Gorgonio Pass and Altamont Pass ) accounted for 50 % of CA capacity .
North America covering > 22 million sq km , is 50 times the area of California , 100 times the area of the UK , and 500 times the land area of Denmark or Northern Germany .
Furthermore , the continent has an East / West width at 50N latitude , of 4,000 km , a critical issue for wind reliability , because weather systems , such as slow moving blocking high pressure systems and low pressure storm fronts generally move from west to east at these latitudes .
There are ten major high quality wind resource regions in N America ;
1 ) NE coast and off - shore ( QC, NS , NB , NH , ME , VT , RI , SDC )
2 ) West coast and off - shore ( CA , OR, WA , BC ) ,
3 ) Pacific coast of Alaska , and Aleutian Islands
4 ) the Canadian prairie extending through the mid-west plains and Texas plateau ( SK, ND , SD , NE , KS , OK , TX )
5 ) the Great Lakes off - shore and lake shore regions ( ON , MN , IL , WI , MI , OH , PA , IN , NY )
6 ) the Appalachian Mountains ( WV , KY , TN, NC , VA )
7 ) Rocky Mountains ( NM , CO , WY , ID , MT , ALTA )
8 ) the Nelson River and West Hudson on - shore ( MAN )
9 ) James Bay / East Hudson ’s Bay on - shore ( Northern QC )
10 ) Labrador and Newfoundland on - shore ( NFL ) .
Other more remote regions such as , the Canadian arctic ( Baffin Island ) also have good wind resources that are influenced by circum polar weather systems .
The North American grid presently extends to nine of these major regions , the exception being the Alaskan Pacific Coast .

If an installed capacity of 1142 GW wind energy was built at widely dispersed wind locations we would expect to deliver within a range of 27 -39 % of capacity ( expected power 372 GW ) over the entire N American continent most of the time .
This is a best guess estimate , based on studies of connecting multiple wind farms over much smaller regions , where more connections do not increase total power under high wind conditions but produce more power under conditions of lower wind speeds .
Since the 10 regions are up to 4,000 km apart , and can extend for up to 1,500 km , it would be very unlikely for more than three of the ten regions to be producing < 5 % capacity at any one time , based on the normally distributed power curve of combined sites .
Seven of those 10 regions also have flexible hydro capacity so 7/10 of the wind power would be firm .
The other 3 regions each extend > 2,000 km ( the East and West coast and Mid- West ) , so it would be unlikely that 2 of these regions would be producing < 5 % of capacity at the same time .
This would mean the grid would be receiving > 27.4 % of the expected 33 % capacity for the installed national capacity ( > 312 GW ) .
Thus the grid will have to supplying up to 62 GW ( 3.6 % ) additional peak power in low wind conditions , when those coincide with a peak demand period .
Additional reserves of 219 GW are thus 350 % larger than expected wind variability .
Generating 50 % of the electrical power by wind places high demands on the grid .
Critical to any plan that involves a large expansion of renewable energy is the expansion of the N American grid with long distance HVDC connections between regions of high wind , solar and hydro electricity generation and regions of high electricity consumption .
A 3,000 km UHDV link from Alaska and the Yukon to both the Western and Eastern Interconnections would be especially important to access both wind and hydro resources and would add extra stability to the grid .
Losses by a 800,000V DC line would be 2 % per 1,000 km , less than existing 1,000 km HVDC used today to bring power from Canada to the Eastern Interconnect .
Good wind resources along the arctic coasts of Hudson Bay and Labrador would only need short transmission lines to connect with existing James Bay ( QC ) , Nelson River ( MAN ) and Churchill Falls ( NFL ) hydro schemes , sharing the same HVDC lines to the eastern interconnect .
A southern HVDC line from Arizona / Sonora solar power sites to Mexico City would also link into the Rocky Mountain and Mid-West wind regions .
Using 372 GWa wind power across the continent will require large amounts of electricity to be moved long distances , but not as much as may be imagined .
Most of the NG peaking plants are close to demand so this power would only travel short distances .
Water impounded behind a dam is the cheapest form of electric power storage , and it can be drawn upon at very high rates for short local demand peaks , reducing the demand on the HVDC interconnects .
Pumped storage is 85 % efficient , it can be low cost when combined with existing hydro dams , but more expensive if a purpose built facility .
All regions with high wind resources , except the Prairie / mid West region also have access to one or both of these storage mechanisms , and because the wider grid will be able to replace hydro use , interconnections between regions can be of limited capacity .
Care and maintenance coal - fired generators that are located near demand could be used with 24 - 48 hour notice , if hydro was not available ( due to low water levels ) or if longer low wind events persisted in one region .

The assumptions I have used are that the additional hydro and pumped storage capacity is built on existing dams , by adding more turbines , to provide more peak power or new remote dams are built where good wind resources ( 9 - 10 m / sec ) can be combined with hydro sharing the same transmission lines .
In sub-arctic regions water flows are high during summer , wind is high in winter .
Similarly CSP solar power located in SW of US and adjacent Sonora would provide additional peak power to Mexico , CA and TX .
Thus wind and hydro electricity from Alaska and sub-arctic Canada ( Nelson River , James Bay and Labrador ) would be 100 % reliable , with hydro replacing wind during low wind periods , and water stored during high wind periods .
The capacity of the transmission lines from these 4 regions could be 145GWa shared power , from 280GW wind capacity and 135GWc hydro .
The mid-west prairie region could share connections to the Great Lakes ( sharing Nelson River power ) , and share solar connections to CA via Arizona or south to Mexico .
Thus , the major consuming regions would produce about 60 % wind and hydro power locally and import 200GW , representing 26 % of total power but < 10 % of peak power capacity .
Thus if in the future a major consuming region ( W coast ) were to lose 95 % of local wind power capacity of 150GWc ( say only have 7GW of expected 50GWa ) for 6 hours it would require at most to import about 1/4 of the lost production ( 11GW ) via the HVDC grid from several other regions ( Alaska , Rocky Mountains , Mid-West ) , moving an additional 0.5 % of national peak power capacity .
The other 32GW , would come from short distances ( NG peak , hydro ) using existing infrastructure as it does today .
Over1 - 4 days this loss ( 192GWh ) could be restored by continued higher imports ( 2 - 8GW ) , during off peak periods , allowing local hydro to be accumulated .
A smart grid would enable short term demand reduction reducing refrigerator , A/ C or heating demand by short term on / off cycling .
Real cost pricing of peak power would encourage consumers to reduce activities such as dish or cloths washing during peak times .
Hot water heating using CO2 heat pumps is especially suitable for grid load management , because of the potential to store energy as hot water over the peak period .
Vehicle to grid ( V2G ) can provide short term spinning reserve power ( pdf ) and could provide longer term storage to help reduce long distance power transfers , using as little as 500Wh transfer in vehicles that had completed the days journey ( 100 M vehicles ) providing up to 50GWh towards a demand peak due to grid failure , with only a minor change to available EV range .
Another potential energy resource is a reduction in electricity consumption due to more efficient utilization .
One - third of today ’s electricity consumption could be saved if all states used electricity as efficiently as the ten highest GDP / kWh states ( pdf ) .
Perhaps N America does n’t really need to rely on more than 50 % of its electricity from wind power .
Others could make a reasonable case that solar could also provide up to 50 % of N America ’s power .
The most urgent problem is the arrival of “ Peak Oil ” .
No amount of low carbon electrical energy is going to directly replace oil used in transport or oil and condensate used for chemical synthesis .
Abundant low carbon electricity , however , will allow a lot of additional options during the transition to a low oil economy .

this is just me , thinking about digital comic book .
to make this work , you just have to clik on the arrow on the screen .
you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard too , and it 's more convenient , but you have to click on the screen first .
i've done this in a few hours so it 's really badly drawn , i was just thinking about the new ways of making comics with all the new tools we have .
sorry about my terrible , terrible english .
done with flash .
special thanks to Trudy Cooper and Danny Murphy from Platinum Grit [ link ] for showing me the right way .
EDIT : Thanks a lot for the positive feedback so far , it means a lot !
I 'm really , really pleased when i read that it give ideas , or make some people want to try it .
I would like to say that , yes , I 've red Scott McCloud books , and yes , they were a great influence for me .
I 'm not familiar with what he said in detail about digital comics though , some friends just pointed me some things that look very similar in the way of thinking about digital comics .
that 's not a surprise , McCloud practically shaped my way of thinking about comics .
I liked his digital comics based on " infinite canvas " but somehow was n't fully satisfied with them , so that 's why i came up with this .
I do n't know if he actually submitted something similar , and any hints would be appreciated .
thanks again !
Sunday Profile : Eckhart Tolle Eckhart
Tolle says you should use your mind , not let it use you .
Feb. 15 , 2009 --
He has sold millions of books in many countries throughout the world , and is launching an online channel this spring .
Celebrities like Cher and Meg Ryan swear by him , and Paris Hilton even brought his book with her to jail .
Oprah Winfrey not only put his book in her book club , but she also hosted an unprecedented 10 - part online series with him .
Tolle , who was born in Germany is a rather unassuming " spiritual teacher " and does n't like the term " guru . "
Tolle does n't do " self - help " in the traditional sense .
He is n't teaching people how to lose weight , get a job or have a better sex life .
Instead , he 's teaching people how to shut off the noise in their heads and be happy .
His message is that our egos are destroying our lives , and by ego he does n't just mean thinking we are special , he means our thinking , period .
That voice in our heads , our ego , Tolle believes , has a relentless need to be right , which leads us to make enemies .
Tolle granted ABC's Dan Harris a rare interview .
Eckhart Tolle :
To me the ego is the habitual and compulsive thought processes that go through everybody 's mind continuously .
External things like possessions or memories or failures or successes or achievements .
Your personal history .
All these things , a bundle of thoughts , of repetitive thoughts that give you a sense of who you are .
Dan Harris :
So our ego , this constant stream of thinking , the voice in our head is making us miserable ?
Eckhart Tolle :
Yes , that 's right .
And it prevents you from being truly alive .
So I 'm not saying we mus n't think anymore .
That would not be possible and it would not be desirable .
Thinking is a wonderful tool if it 's applied .
Thinking however can not become the master .
Thinking is a very bad master .
If you 're dominated by thinking then your life becomes very restricted .
If you 're able to use your mind instead of being used by your mind , that 's a beautiful thing .
To use your mind constructively .
Psychologists found that 98 or 99 percent of our thinking is repetitive .
And also a lot of our thinking is very negative .
People tend to dwell more on negative things than on good things .
So the mind then becomes obsessed with negative things , with judgements , guilt and anxiety produced by thoughts about the future and so on .
Many people live habitually as if the present moment were either an obstacle that they need to overcome in order to get to the next moment , and imagine living your whole life like that , where always this moment is never quite right , not good enough because you need to get to the next one , that is continuous stress .
Tolle blames most of the ills of the world on our egos : broken homes , wars and our destruction of the planet .
But according to Tolle , our ego is n't the only thing making us unhappy .
He says we 're wasting our lives by refusing to live in the present moment .
He says he can teach people how to become aware of the voice in their head , and thereby tame it .
He calls it " awakening , " a fancy - sounding name for what he says is a very attainable state .
Tolle 's personal spiritual awakening came out of his own mental anguish .
Eckhart Tolle :
It 's a state of conciousness .
The possibility of living in a more peaceful , more vibrantly alive state of conciousness .
That 's all .
Not some weird belief system that we need to adopt .
It 's much more fundamental and much more simple .
Dan Harris :
How did you get this way , how did you awaken ?
Eckhart Tolle : I was so unhappy that I could n't stand it anymore .
I had to step out of this identification with the unhappy mind created self .
Dan Harris :
So unhappy that you were considering suicide ?
Eckhart Tolle :
Yes , yes I was several times close to suicide and so one night a shift happened and I realized the unhappy me , the unhappy self , is not really who I am , I could sense underneath it a presence and an aliveness and an intelligence that had nothing to do with the negative thoughts that were continuously going through my head .
After he awakened , he says he quit his job as an academic and eventually sat on a park bench , homeless for several years , living in a state of bliss .
Dan Harris :
Do n't you ever get pissed off , annoyed , irritated , sad , anything negative ?
Eckhart Tolle :
No , I accept what is .
And that 's why life has become so simple .
Dan Harris :
Well , what if somebody cuts you off in your car ?
Eckhart Tolle :
It 's fine , it 's like a sudden gust of wind , I do n't personalize a gust of wind , and so it 's simply what is .
Dan Harris :
And you 're able to enjoy every moment , even if I start asking you a ton of annoying questions ?
Eckhart Tolle :
Yes , that would be fine .
So it 's really .
Dan Harris : Do n't tempt me [ laughing ] .
Eckhart Tolle : [ laughing ]
It 's finding , becoming friendly just with the is - ness of this moment .
While many fans of Tolle 's say he has changed their lives , some Christians say his teachings are not compatible with the Bible .
They accuse Tolle of promoting " The Doctrine of Demons . "
Dan Harris :
Do you believe that Jesus is the son of God ?
Eckhart Tolle : I believe that Jesus realized his oneness with God and he showed , what he attemped to do was show the way to all of us , how to realize our own onenes with God also , so he 's a precursor .
Dan Harris :
But that 's different , I mean Christians , the whole point of Christianity is the divinity of Jesus Christ .
Eckhart Tolle :
Yes , but I believe that what Jesus Christ was really teaching was the divinity in everyone .
Dan Harris :
But do you believe that Christianity is just as valid as say Islam , Buddhism , Hinduism ?
Eckhart Tolle :
Yes , all religions at their core , they have a basic truth .
Dan Harris : But , many Christians would vehemently disagree with that .
They would say our religion is the one true religion .
Eckhart Tolle :
And that is called the ego , it says we are right and you are wrong .
Religion for many people has turned into a form of ego , but for others it has n't , and for some people religion actually still works .
Tolle seems unperturbed by any controversy that is created about him .
In fact , it seemed hard to bother him at all .
Dan Harris :
So if we were all to sort of leave the room , right now and just lock you in here and you 'd be by yourself .
Could you sit happily on the couch here indefinitely ?
Eckhart Tolle :
Well I do n't know indefinitely because the body has its needs and so on , but I 'm quite happy being with myself in a room all alone .
I enjoy that .
I do that quite a lot .
Just sit , in a room , or outside , just enjoying the simplicity and aliveness of the present moment .
When I go back to my room after our conversation , I just enjoy being there .
The present moment is alive , I am alive .
The world around me is alive .
It 's deep enjoyment of living .
Dan Harris :
And to those who are going to haer this and say … flaky !
You say , " fine , you 're losing out ? "
Eckhart Tolle :
It 's your mind that has some judgments about it because your mind does n't understand what I 'm talking about .
You need to be a little bit of a glimmer of a recognition from a dimension that is deeper than the mind in you … and you say , " Oh he actually has a point . "
And from there you can open up and begin to experience what it is to be home with the present moment which is life .

In the Ideas section of today ’s Boston Globe , I ’ve got a new article .
Read all about it !
RELIGION CAN BE good for more than the soul , a growing number of studies seem to say .
Over the past decade , academic research on religiosity has exploded , and with it has come a raft of publications suggesting that spiritual beliefs and practices can add years to life , lower blood pressure , or keep at - risk kids on the straight and narrow .
As sociologists , psychologists , and physicians turn their attention to measuring the effects of religion , often fueled by grant money from private foundations , the results have percolated swiftly through weekend sermons and the popular media .
Being nonreligious , one might conclude , looks more and more like a danger to your health .
That ’s right .
I ’ve jumped cheerfully on the religion - and - health bandwagon .
But do n’t worry , it gets more interesting than that .
Beginning in conversations with the sociologist Phil Zuckerman several months ago , I found a pretty wide spread of folks who are actively ( 1 ) trying to bring non-religious people into the focus of quantitative sociology and psychology and ( 2 ) trying to discredit claims that religion is good for your health .
This article focuses mainly on the first group .
This trend toward the non-religious is a direct reaction to the return of religion to academia in recent years .
Here ’s a quotation from my interview with the leading sociologist of religion Christian Smith , which I wish had made it into the article :
In the old days , among people at universities , being skeptical or being nonreligious was more taken for granted .
So that was a more invisible category .
The more religion has had a resurgence , if you think it has , the more being not religious has become interesting .

Every three years , the US Copyright Office reviews the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act 's most controversial section — the ban on circumventing DRM , even for legal uses .
The Copyright Office has the authority to issue three - year exemptions to that blanket ban , carving out space for DVD - ripping film school profs , for instance , or making it legal for people to bypass DRM in order to unlock cell phones .
Tomorrow , four days of hearings begin on a new round of exemptions ( read the schedule ) .
What 's on the table ?
Jailbreaking your iPhone , busting the DRM on music and movies if authentication servers ever die , ripping clips from DVDs for noncommercial use , breaking digital locks on DRM schemes that " compromise the security of personal computers , " and cracking open DRM on subscription streaming video " where the provider has only made available players for a limited number of platforms , " among others .
Advocates of new exemptions are aiming high here , especially when you consider how stingy the Copyright Office has been in handing out such exemptions over the years .
We spoke to three such advocates who will be testifying before the Copyright Office over the next few weeks , often while sitting right next to lawyers from Apple Computer , the DVD Copy Control Association , Time Warner , the MPAA , and others who oppose them .
Given the odds against them , how are they preparing for the hearings — and do they hold out any chance of success ?
Fred von Lohmann , Electronic Frontier Foundation
The three - year exemption process looked so broken back in 2005 that the EFF issued a screed about how the process was n't worth participating in .
One of the authors was Fred von Lohmann , EFF 's super - sharp copyright lawyer , who tomorrow will find himself defending not one but three new exemption requests .
What changed ?
Von Lohmann tells us that the process has improved since that report , and in 2006 the Copyright Office changed some of the " procedural hurdles " that EFF had complained about .
" So while we continue to be frustrated by the Office 's continued resistance to personal uses that many consumers take for granted ( like backing up digital media ) , " von Lohmann says , " we are focusing our efforts on the kinds of proposals that the Copyright Office has shown at least some willingness to entertain .
This does not diminish the fact that the DMCA rulemaking has not , and will never , address many of the major the problems that the DMCA 's anticircumvention provisions have caused for consumers . "
This time around , EFF is pushing for exemptions that would allow cell phone unlocking , cell phone jailbreaking , and the use of DVD clips in noncommercial videos where the intended use is " fair . "
Given the extreme skepticism shown by the Copyright Office to these sorts of " let us rip DVDs when the intended use is fair " type arguments , this may be a tough sell .
Von Lohmann acknowledges as much , saying , " I will admit , however , that the Copyright Office has been generally hostile to DVD - related exemptions in previous rulemakings , so we 'll have to wait and see .
But the importance of an exemption has become particularly obvious in light of the RealDVD litigation , where Hollywood has again renewed its argument that the DMCA trumps fair use where DVDs are concerned .
If that 's right , then fair users need a DMCA exemption . "
The Copyright Office has in the past been receptive to arguments about cell phone unlocking , so von Lohmann may have better luck there ( Apple 's Greg Joswiak will also be testifying , apparently against the jailbreaking exemption ) .
Even with some precedent for cell phone unlocking exemptions , researching , writing , and then defending DMCA exemption proposals is a lot of work .
" We have put a considerable amount of time and effort into understanding how iPhone jailbreaking and unlocking work in preparation for the rulemaking , " von Lohmann says .
And , even if successful , the exemptions remain in place for only three years .

A senior Pentagon official has delivered a stinging attack on the US Air Force , saying that its philosophy of using fully qualified human pilots to handle unmanned aircraft at all times has resulted in unnecessary , expensive crashes .
By contrast , US Army drones with auto - landing equipment and cheaply - trained operators have an enviable record .
The comments were made by John Young , outgoing acquisition chief at the Defense Department .
Young 's remarks are reported differently by various media , and were followed up with corrections by his staff , so it 's hard to be sure how many of what classes of aircraft he said had crashed or not crashed .
What 's clear is that in Young 's view the Air Force deliberately insisted on not having auto - landing in their well - known Predator drones , and that this has been unnecessarily costly .
" The Air Force built a budget that did n’t include putting auto - land capability in their Predators , despite the fact that we ’ve lost a third of the Predators we ’ve ever bought , and a significant fraction of the losses are attributable either to the ground control station or the pilot ’s operation of that ground control station , or the pilot ’s operation of the vehicle , " he said , according to Stars and Stripes .
It 's well known that Air Force Predators and Reapers must be handled at all times in flight by a fully - qualified human pilot , a commissioned officer and gentleman / woman who has learned his or her trade in normal manned aircraft .
During landing and takeoff , this pilot officer will be in a control station at the runway , so as to reduce latency : but for most of a mission the aircraft is handled over satcomms from bases in the USA .
The US Army has a differing philosophy : it 's " Sky Warrior " variant of the Predator is intended to land itself automatically , and the present - day Shadow has such kit already .
Army drones are controlled by noncomissioned tech specialists who , while fully trained and qualified for their job , have no airborne stick time in regular aircraft .
They are always in theatre with the rest of the troops .
A US Army sergeant , qualified to fly both the Warrior and the Shadow and with operational experience in Iraq , recently told the Reg :
Officers and Warrant Officers have a college degree as per their job requirements .
NCOs and Enlisted Soldiers are not required to have a degree to join the military and tend to be seen as little more than trained monkeys ...
The US Air Force considers itself to be the only branch qualified to fly aircraft .
They have been trying to take the UAS program away from the Army as a matter of principle ...
Previous training in crewed aircraft is irrelevant to UAS training ... I am insulted by much of the ' Oh , you fly an X - box ' mentality which I constantly have to battle .
UN Commissioner : investigate Israel for war crimes Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday January 10 , 2009
Print This Email This Israel leaflets Gaza , promises fighting will intensify
Navi Pillay , the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights , wants an investigation into what she believes to be war crimes committed by Israeli forces .
She specifically highlighted a recent incident in which Israel attacked a civilian safe house in Gaza , killing more than 30 people .
Her stinging words arrived just one evening before Israel began dropping leaflets on Gaza Saturday , each warning of a coming escalation .
The UN Office for the Coordinator of Humanitarian Affairs reported that 110 Palestinians , all in a single extended family , were " herded " into the house and told not to leave by Israeli soldiers .
Less than 24 hours later , the house was attacked .
 Those who survived and were able walked two kilometers to Salah Ed Din road before being transported to the hospital in civilian vehicles , " reads the UN report .
" Three children , the youngest of whom was five months old , died upon arrival at the hospital . 
Pillay said the attack bore " all the elements of war crimes , " according to a published report .
According to the International Committee of the Red Cross , four infants , clinging to the corpses of what was believed to be their parents , were discovered after the attack .
The children went undiscovered for over 48 hours , despite Israeli solders being mere yards away .
Pillay , from S. Africa , is a former judge with the International Criminal Court .
Israel denies the incident altogether .
The UN report cites specific testimony , though does not identify the origin .
The announcement by the UN commissioner comes on the heels of Red Cross criticism .
The aid agency said Israel has failed at helping injured civilians , a key rule of war .
Israel said its military " works in close cooperation with international aid organizations during the fighting so that civilians can be provided with assistance . "
" I am concerned with violations of international law , " Pillay told Reuters .
" Incidents such as this must be investigated because they display elements of what could constitute war crimes . "
During the first week of January , the Red Cross criticized Israel for hampering ambulance services to embattled Palestinian civilians .
" The situation is extremely dangerous and the coordination of ambulance services is very complex because of the incessant attacks and military operations , " ICRC spokeswoman Dorothea Krimitsas said in Geneva .
" Wounded people have died while waiting for Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances , " she added .
Pakistani ambassador Zamir Akram echoed Pillay 's sentiment , in a speech delivered on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference .
" In their totality these constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , " he declared .
With wire reports
WebKit is an open source Web content engine for browsers and other applications .
We value real - world web compatibility , standards compliance , stability , performance , battery life , security , privacy , portability , usability , and relative ease of understanding and modifying the code ( hackability ) .
Project Goals
Web Content Engine
The project ’s primary focus is content deployed on the World Wide Web , using standards - based technologies such as HTML , CSS , JavaScript and DOM .
However , we also want to make it possible to embed WebKit in other applications , and to use it as a general - purpose display and interaction engine .
Open Source
WebKit should remain freely usable for both open source and proprietary applications .
To that end , we use BSD - style and LGPL licenses .
Specifically , we aim for licensing compatible with LGPL 2.1+ .
We do not currently plan to move to LGPL 3 .
In addition , we strive to create a courteous , welcoming environment that feels approachable to newcomers .
WebKit maintains a public IRC chat room and a public mailing list where the ideas of contributors both new and old are heard and discussed with equal weight .
Compatibility
For users browsing the web , compatibility with their existing sites is essential .
We strive to maintain and improve compatibility with existing web content , sometimes even at the expense of standards .
We use regression testing to maintain our compatibility gains .
Standards Compliance
WebKit aims for compliance with relevant web standards , and support for new standards
In addition to improving compliance , we participate in the web standards community to bring new technologies into standards , and to make sure new standards are practical to implement in our engine .
We use regression testing to maintain our standards compliance gains .
Stability
The main WebKit code base should always maintain a high degree of stability .
This means that crashes , hangs and regressions should be dealt with promptly , rather than letting them pile up .
Performance
Maintaining and improving speed and memory use is an important goal .
We never consider performance “ good enough ” , but strive to constantly improve .
As web content becomes richer and more complex , and as web browsers run on more limited devices , performance gains continue to have value even if normal browsing seems fast enough .
We consider speed , memory use , responsiveness and frame rate to be important aspects of performance .
Battery Life
In addition to traditional performance metrics , we aim to minimize power consumption to maximize browsing battery life for portable devices .
Security
Protecting users from security violations is critical .
We fix security issues promptly to protect users and maintain their trust .
Privacy
We believe privacy is a human right .
WebKit code wo n’t track the user or otherwise violate their privacy .
And we will strive to prevent websites and other parties from doing so .
Portability
The WebKit project seeks to address a variety of needs .
We want to make it reasonable to port WebKit to a variety of desktop , mobile , embedded and other platforms .
We will provide the infrastructure to do this with tight platform integration , reusing native platform services where appropriate and providing friendly embedding APIs .
Usability
To the extent that WebKit features affect the user experience , we want them to work in accordance with good human interface design principles , and to mesh well with platform - native HI conventions .
Furthermore , we strive to integrate with platform accessibility features to allow access for all users , including those with disabilities .
Hackability
To make rapid progress possible , we try to keep the code relatively easy to understand , even though web technologies are often complex .
We try to use straightforward algorithms and data structures when possible , we try to write clear , maintainable code , and we continue to improve names and code structure to aid understanding .
When tricky “ rocket science ” code is truly needed to solve some problem , we try to keep it bottled up behind clean interfaces .
In addition , we make heavy use of automated regression tests as a safety net , to allow aggressive changes with less risk of regressions .
What WebKit is Not
There are a few points that arise occasionally which we consider out of scope for the project .
WebKit is an engine , not a browser .
We do not plan to develop or host a full - featured web browser based on WebKit .
Others are welcome to do so , of course .
WebKit is an engineering project not a science project .
For new features to be adopted into WebKit , we strongly prefer for the technology or at least the use case for it to be proven .
WebKit is not a bundle of maximally general and reusable code .
We build some general - purpose parts , but only to the degree needed to be a good web content engine .
WebKit is not the solution to every problem .
We focus on web content , not complete solutions to every imaginable technology need .
Wage deflation is setting in .
Let 's look at some anecdotal evidence .
The Times Plans Temporary Pay Cuts
March 26 , 2009
Facing a steep drop in revenue , The New York Times Company plans to cut the pay of most employees by 5 percent for nine months , in return for 10 days ’ leave , and will lay off 100 people and make other budget cuts , executives said on Thursday .
The company will make the pay cuts unilaterally for most nonunion employees , including top executives , in its corporate division , at the flagship Times newspaper and at The Boston Globe .
The reductions will be in effect from April through December .
At The Times newspaper , the company will ask the Guild , which represents most newsroom employees , to accept the 5 percent cut and 10 days off voluntarily , and avoid possible layoffs .
It is not clear how the moves will affect unionized employees at The Globe .
March 9 , 2009
Struggling newspaper publisher McClatchy , parent company of Charlotte 's Observer , said Monday that it would cut 1,600 jobs and lower salaries across the company .
McClatchy ( MNI ) , based in Sacramento , Calif. , said the job cuts amount to about 15 percent of its work force .
The company plans to begin laying off workers and restructuring operations by the end of the first quarter .
The reductions will result from a combination of layoffs , attrition and outsourcing , the company said .
McClatchy said that its salary reductions would include a 15 percent cut in Pruitt ’s base salary .
In addition , other executive salaries will be hit with a 10 percent reduction , while board members will see a 13 percent decline in cash compensation , including retainers and meeting fees .
Also , McClatchy will pay no bonuses to executive officers this year .
March 12 , 2009
The Indianapolis News Guild is sad to inform you that Gannett is now seeking to cut the pay of newsroom and building services employees by 15 percent .
The lawyer for the company provided us with a one - page “ supplemental ” proposal this afternoon that he said would implement this uniform salary reduction either 1 ) at the time we reach a new contract with the company , or 2 ) at the time both sides reach an impasse and cease talks .
This was a disappointing move , given that we thought the company ’s bargaining team was starting to embrace the concept of negotiating instead of dictating .
In fact , we believe the company ’s actions at the table today raise the specter of regressive and bad - faith bargaining .

The thousands of contractors who work at Microsoft through third - party agencies are facing pay cuts beginning Monday , as Microsoft continues to look for ways to cut costs .
Microsoft and its contracting agencies agreed to a 10 percent cut in the bill rate , impacting all temporary worker assignments .
Several contract employees have said the reduction is being passed on to them in the form of a pay cut .
One person said some agencies are seeking to pass deeper pay cuts onto their workers .
Several contractors contacted The Seattle Times , asking for anonymity for fear that speaking out would jeopardize their jobs .
The 10 percent cut is for existing contracts .
New contracts will have a 15 percent reduction in the rate .

The Rocky Mountain Paper closed recently after 150 years in print .
The Seattle Post Intelligencer can only be found on - line now .
And Portland ’s Willamette Week has instituted an 8 percent pay cut .
So the staff at The Oregonian knew cuts were coming .
Nobody from the Oregonian 's management responded to a request for an interview .
But in a letter to employees Publisher Fred Stickel said that the Oregonian lost “ several million dollars ” last year -- and does n’t have enough income to cover expenses this year .
Stickel says quote :
" The economic crisis has dramatically worsened the precarious financial situation facing the media industry , our Company , and many of our advertising customers . "
To fix the problem he announced a 15 percent pay cut for himself and other top staff , and a five or 10 percent cut for other employees .
Some part - time workers are also being laid - off , while other staff will be required to take four furlough days over the next few months .

SPOKANE , Wash .
The Spokesman - Review newspaper will freeze wages in 2009 , and seek a 5 percent salary cut for all managers , non-union employees who earn more than $ 11 an hour , and , with their voluntary consent , all union employees .
Wednesday , March 18 , 2009
Morris Communications Co. announced today it will reduce employee wages by 5 to 10 percent effective April 1 .
The reductions will affect hourly and salaried employees .
Mr. Morris said the pay cuts are designed to preserve jobs in a difficult economic environment .
" The newspaper business is facing unprecedented challenges , " Mr. Morris said in a news release .
" Just yesterday , after 126 continuous years of publishing , the Seattle Post - Intelligencer printed its last edition .
Other newspapers have sought protection from creditors in bankruptcy court , severely cut back on their publishing schedules or abandoned the business entirely .
March 19th , 2009
The Daily News will cut its work force and reduce wages as part of a major nationwide effort by its owner , the McClatchy Co. , to cut $ 110 million in expenses to offset declining advertising revenue , Patrick Doyle , the newspaper 's publisher , told employees in a letter Thursday .
This will be the third round of staff reductions at the newspaper in 10 months and is symptomatic of an industry - wide crisis threatening to sink newspapers across the country .
Staffing at the Daily News will drop by 45 people , or about 17 percent , through a combination of buyouts , layoffs and the elimination of vacant positions , Doyle said .
Seven of the jobs eliminated were the result of new , more efficient production equipment .
The cuts will affect every department , from circulation to advertising , production and news .
The paper will also impose pay cuts ranging from 2.5 percent for lower - paid employees to 10 percent for the highest paid , Doyle said .
Those making less than $ 25,000 a year will not see a reduction .

Shinchang Electrics Co. offered union leaders a proposal that would reduce wages at the auto - parts company by 20 % in exchange for no layoffs among its 810 workers this year .
Eight days later , the union agreed .
The deal is one sign of the unusual way South Korea is grappling with the global economic crisis .
Across the country , executives , salaried employees and hourly workers at companies from banks to shipbuilders are joining to slash wages and other costs with the goal of avoiding layoffs .
March 12 ( Bloomberg ) -- Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. , the city - state ’s largest newspaper publisher , will cut wages and bonuses of 3,000 employees and freeze hiring to reduce costs amid the island ’s deepest recession .
The lower salaries will result in a 20 percent drop in the overall wage bill , the company said today in a statement to the Singapore exchange , without giving a figure for savings .
Hiring has been halted and profit - related bonuses will drop , it said .
Singapore ’s government has said the economy may contract as much as 10 percent this year , prompting companies to fire staff , cut pay and conserve cash .
Singapore Airlines Ltd. has offered more than 14,000 workers the option of as much as two years of unpaid leave , the Straits Times reported on March 11 .
“ We need to bring our costs down in the face of a weaker advertising market and uncertain business environment , ” SPH Chief Executive Officer Alan Chan said in the statement , which was released after the close of trade .
“ It is imperative that we prepare for a longer - than - expected downturn . ”

Newspaper Guild members at The Sacramento Bee agreed Friday to take pay cuts of up to 6 percent to save jobs at the 152 - year - old paper .
Members voted 65 percent to 35 percent to accept the deal , said Ed Fletcher , a reporter who heads the Guild 's local at the Bee .
Even with the pay cuts , Bee managers plan to cut 34 of the 268 Guild - covered positions in the editorial and advertising departments .
Another 19 jobs would have been in jeopardy if the union had rejected the pay cuts .

Reports of deep job cuts at International Business Machines ( IBM ) come at a potentially delicate time for the company — just as it is hoping to secure money from the federal stimulus package .
The company will lay off as many as 5,000 U.S. workers in its Global Business Services unit , transferring some of the work they performed to India , according to media reports .
Any job transfers IBM may make to India would occur at a sensitive time , as the recession deepens and as the U.S. unemployment rate climbs .
Moreover , the company would be cutting high - skill positions domestically as it and others jockey for new business from the $ 787 billion stimulus package Congress enacted in February — primarily to help create U.S. jobs .
Currently , 29 % of IBM 's workforce is in the U.S. , down from 35 % in 2006 .
The fact that IBM has built up large workforces in such low - cost countries as India allows it to shift work abroad more easily , says Ron Hira , assistant professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology .
He says the current economic climate allows IBM to position itself as one of many firms squeezed by the recession and forced into layoffs .
IBM " can now blame the layoffs on the economy , masking the reality that it is offshoring high - wage , high - tech jobs to low - cost countries , " says Hira .
But while offshoring has been on the rise for decades , the economics of the recession are creating a new political climate that makes such moves more controversial .
That 's because , as IBM and others continue global restructuring , they 're working to secure pieces of the $ 787 billion stimulus measure enacted in February .
IBM is seeking a share of the $ 8 billion the U.S. plans to spend on high - speed rail and part of the $ 20 billion in the stimulus plan to digitize the U.S. health - care system .
Palmisano was one of 13 executives who met with President Barack Obama in January in an appearance aimed at pressuring the House of Representatives to pass the economic stimulus bill .
He joined the CEOs of Xerox ( XRX ) , Motorola ( MOT ) , and Google ( GOOG ) .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - Japan said on Friday it could shoot down any threatening object falling toward its territory , after North Korea said a planned rocket launch would send it across Japanese territory .
A South Korean officer looks at a map depicting the danger areas in the event of a rocket launch by North Korea , at a task force meeting of government officers at the foreign ministry office in Seoul , March 13 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jeon Su-young / Yonhap
North Korea has given notice to global agencies that it plans to launch a satellite between April 4 and 8 , presenting a challenge to new U.S. President Barack Obama and allies who see it as a disguised missile test .
“ Under our law , we can intercept any object if it is falling toward Japan , including any attacks on Japan , for our safety , ” Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura told a news conference .
South Korea ’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement any such launch would be in violation of Security Council Resolution 1718 .
“ If North Korea goes ahead with the launch , we believe there will be discussions and a response by the Security Council on the violation of the resolution . ”
North Korea told agencies including the International Maritime Organization the launch would take place over Japan in daylight hours and that the boosters would fall into the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean , the IMO said .
North Korea has said it is sending a communication satellite into orbit , and has the right to do so under its space program .
The United States , South Korea and Japan have said they see no difference between a satellite launch and a missile test because they use the same rocket , the North ’s long - range missile called the Taepodong - 2 with a range that could take it to Alaska .
The only time the North tested the Taepodong - 2 in 2006 , it blew apart a few seconds after being fired .
Analysts said the North appears to have made technological advances to fix flight problems and is confident of a successful launch .
The U.N. sanctions imposed after the 2006 test forbid further ballistic missile testing .
“ Giving the coordinates and letting everyone know that the boosters will drop in areas that are not a threat to anyone is a way of showing that they have acquired technical precision , ” said Cho Min of the Korea Institute of National Unification .
UNPRECEDENTED NOTIFICATION
The notice itself , unprecedented for the reclusive communist state which previously launched ballistic missiles without warning , also indicates it is seriously troubled that the United States or Japan might try to shoot it down , said Baek Seung - joo , an analyst at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses .
The North has said it would consider that to be an act of war .
Analysts do not expect the United States will intercept the rocket because the North Korean launch poses no severe or immediate security threats while a strike could greatly ratchet up tensions and increase risk to the region ’s major economies .
A 1998 launch of an earlier version of the Taepodong flew over Japan and dropped in the Pacific , which the North called a successful launch of its satellite Kwangmyongsong - 1 .
Japan Airlines
Corp said that because of the launch warning , the airline would alter flight paths between April 4 and 8 on routes to London , Paris , Frankfurt , Amsterdam , Rome , Milan and Moscow , as well as Honolulu and Kona in Hawaii .
All Nippon Airways
Co said that during the same period it would be altering flight paths on routes between Tokyo and London , Paris , Frankfurt .

North Korea on Friday again stopped crossings of South Korean personnel into a jointly run factory park on its side of the armed border , four days after cutting off military communication and temporarily suspending border crossings for a day , the Unification Ministry in Seoul said .
More than 200 outh Koreans who are at the Kaesong industrial park remain stranded at the plant just north of the border , once hailed as a model in reconciliation .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak urged the North to stop raising tension with its rich neighbor .
“ The North is threatening us from land , sea and sky , ” Lee said at the Naval Academy .
“ It ’s not hesitating to threaten civilians as well as making military threats . ”
Analysts said the early April launch is timed to coincide with the opening of its Supreme People ’s Assembly and meant as a celebration of the re-election of leader Kim Jong - il as chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission .
In the body of nearly every Associated Press wire report involving the United States and Iran , you 'll find some version of this :
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the hostage - taking at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran . [ 1 ]
That editorial statement provides the historical backdrop for AP's U.S. - Iran reportage .
Like many of AP 's historical accounts , it is a parody of the actual record .
US - centric timeline
The events of 1979 are trumpeted to the exclusion of all others before and since , implying that Iran must atone for the past .
But the 1979 Revolution was a response to the U.S. government 's own anti-Iranian revolution and hostage - taking of 1953 and the subsequent 26 - year rule of the U.S. - installed Shah , Mohammad Reza Pahlavi .
AP naturally avoids editorial description of the U.S. - subsidized Shah 's reign . [ 2 ]
To successfully cast Iran as the perpetual aggressor , AP must also omit all post -'79 U.S. aggressions against Iran , such as : the arming ( including WMDs ) and otherwise facilitating of Saddam Hussein for his 1980 – 88 aggressive war on Iran ; direct U.S. military aggression against Iranian targets toward the end of that war ( including the 1988 massacre of all 290 passengers and flight crew aboard Iranian Air Flight 655 , by guided missile , over Iranian waters ) ; the ongoing , taxpayer - looted funding of regime - change in Iran ( including media propaganda and covert military operations ) ; and the ongoing , liberty - and prosperity - destroying economic sanctions .
All of those are illicit acts of war , but according to AP they never happened .
All told , AP discards about 90 % of the conflict timeline to put the onus squarely on Iran .
Omitted : US Constitution and Algiers Accords
According to state - worshiping news media ( a.k.a. , “ MSM ” ) , the U.S. government is worth its weight in good intention , no matter how “ ineffective ” its policies .
How do AP editors pull this illusion off ?
Simple .
Just conceal the most authoritative legal restraints on central power found in the plain and explicit language of the U.S. Constitution .
But there is another , less - referenced document whose plain language discourages certain propaganda mills from being intellectually honest with their readers .
Signed by the United States and Iran , the 1981 Algiers Accords ( .pdf ) , from the top , declares :
[ T ]he United States will restore the financial position of Iran , in so far as possible , to that which existed prior to November 14 , 1979 . . . .
The United States pledges that it is and from now on will be the policy of the United States not to intervene , directly or indirectly , politically or militarily , in Iran 's internal affairs .
AP 's account recalls zero U.S. - Iran diplomacy “ since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the hostage - taking at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran . ”
But the ' 81 Accords was the very document that made the hostages ' release official and sought to normalize relations .
You might think it took some diplomacy to reach agreement there .
But once again , for AP it is simple : conceal the existence of not only illicit U.S. intervention in Iranian affairs , but the legal restraints thereon , and you are easily able to frame every Iranian response to unprecedented U.S. aggression as being unprecedented aggression itself .
Of course , if U.S. officials had simply fulfilled their oaths to preserve and defend the Constitution these last 60 years , there would 've been no need for the Algiers Accords , and no major U.S. - Iranian row would exist today .
But you wo n't know it if you get your news from the New York Times , AP , NBC , and the like .
Their unspoken duty is to frame a narrative around an innocuous U.S. government so that ill - informed and illicit U.S. interventions , to which — surprise ! — statist media are rarely averse , are received with shallow disagreement if not “ patriotic ” support .
1. The Associated Press via Yahoo !
News .
2 . An occasional report will mention the violent overthrow of the “ pro-US ” Shah by “ hard - line ” Iranian students , as if the pillaging of the average Iranian under the Shah 's regime was non-violent and moderate .
One should wonder how AP defines pro-US .
A row over giving more say in the running of the International Monetary Fund to countries such as China threatens to jeopardise the lender 's bid to raise an additional $ 500bn to deal with the global economic crisis .
The IMF spent much of its annual summit in Washington , which ended last night , discussing how it will raise the new funds , but the developing countries on which it is depending for much of the money repeatedly warned that they would not contribute more without being given greater control of the organisation .
The $ 500 bn ( £ 340bn ) , which was agreed upon at last month 's G20 meeting in London , is seen as a crucial weapon in the armoury of the international response to the credit crisis and economic downturn .
A failure to secure the extra money could have serious implications for the growing number of countries that are dependent on IMF loans and aid .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
However , representatives of some of the developing countries most likely to help reach the $ 500 bn target are not yet convinced that the IMF 's more powerful members are serious about ceding any control .
Alexei Kudrin , Russia 's finance minister , warned yesterday that developed countries were proving reluctant to offer concessions .
" We already meet a cool attitude and even resistance [ to reform of the IMF ] " Mr Kudrin said .
" The leading countries are not in a hurry ... this was the main discussion , the nerve of the IMF meeting . "
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the IMF 's managing director , has so far secured commitments of around $ 324bn from members for the top - up in the len- der 's funding , including $ 100 bn promised by the US .
Mr Strauss - Kahn said yesterday that a bond issue was one of the ways in which the IMF was hoping to make up the shortfall in funding , with countries including Brazil and China already having indicated that they would consider subscribing for such bonds .
" I 'm sure this vehicle will be used , " Mr Strauss - Kahn said .
" Now we 're discussing with different creditors the way to implement it and the amount that we put in . "
However , Guido Mantega , the Brazilian finance minister , described the IMF 's plans as " premature " and " insufficient " .
Mr Mantega , who yesterday met with finance ministers from Russia and China , as well as India , the fourth member of the so - called Bric group of leading developing nations , said that contributions made by these countries would be " provisional " , implying that support might be withdrawn if the IMF 's decision - making process is not reformed to their satisfaction .
The Brazilians are also anxious to see more of the IMF 's lending directed towards emerging nations .
The IMF has already promised to change the shareholding and voting power of members by January 2011 , but negotiations on the terms of such reform have only just begun .
Firm proposals on many of the key issues around the management of the IMF are unlikely to be made before October .
Tensions at the IMF summit , which , like the G20 meeting , was disrupted by a wide variety of protesters , were heightened by a separate row over the forecasts made by the organisation about the next stage of the banking crisis .
European governments are furious about the IMF 's assertion that the continent 's banks will be forced to write down the value of their assets by $ 750 bn over the next year .
The British Government last week succeeded in having the IMF withdraw some of its forecasts about its borrowing and France yesterday joined the lender 's critics .
Finance minister , Christine Lagarde , said : " Many of us expressed our greatest reserve on the methodology adopted by the IMF . "
Mr Strauss - Kahn is also attempting to defuse a potential argument between some European countries , which are increasingly focusing on how government intervention in the banking sector might be withdrawn once the crisis passes , and more cautious members , including the US , who insist it is too early to begin discussing an " exit strategy " .
Henry Chinaski never cared for the American dream , the thought of needing to become ' something ' and fit into the system disgusts him .
He believes that life is free and yours to live like you see fit , and if that in some cases involves copious amounts of whiskey then so be it .
Henry spends his days drinking and listening to the radio , and he spends his nights drinking and fighting against Eddy who he thinks personifies shallowness and shameless self promoting .
Sometimes in the middle of this he finds the time to jot down a few lines of poetry or a short story .
After fighting Eddy and winning for a change Henry is thrown out of his regular bar where Eddy is a bartender .
This leads him to seek another watering hole where he happens to find Wanda who is a barfly , in her own words " if another man came along with a fifth of whiskey , I 'd go with him " .
Henry is not fazed by this thou and moves in with her .
Of course Wanda immediately goes off and sleeps with Eddy , but after some clothes ...

Although the days of long and tedious code branches to target specific browsers in JavaScript are over , once in a while it ’s still necessary to do some simple code branching and object detection to ensure that a certain piece of code is working properly on a user ’s machine .
In this article , I ’ll outine 7 areas where Internet Explorer and Firefox differ in JavaScript syntax .
1 . The CSS “ float ” property
The basic syntax for accessing a specific css property for any given object is object .
style .
property , using camel casing to replace a hyphenated property .
For example , to access the background - color property of a < div > whose ID is “ header ” , we would use the following syntax :
document.getElementById( " header " ).style.backgroundColor= " #ccc " ;
But since the word “ float ” is already reserved for use in JavaScript , we cannot access the “ float ” property using object.style.float .
Here is how we do it in the two browsers :
The IE Syntax :
document.getElementById( " header " ).style.styleFloat = " left " ;
The Firefox Syntax :
document.getElementById( " header " ) .style.cssFloat = " left " ;
2. The Computed Style of an Element
JavaScript can easily access and modify CSS styles that have been set on objects using the object .
style .
property syntax outlined above .
But the limitation of that syntax is that it can only retrieve styles that have been set inline in the HTML or styles that have been set directly by JavaScript .
The style object does not access styles set using an external stylesheet .
In order to access an object ’s “ computed style ” , we use the following code :
The IE Syntax :
var myObject = document.getElementById(" header " ) ; var myStyle = myObject.currentStyle.backgroundColor ;
The Firefox Syntax :
var myObject = document.getElementById(" header " ) ; var myComputedStyle = document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(myObject , null ) ; var myStyle = myComputedStyle.backgroundColor ;
3 . Accessing the “ class ” Attribute of an Element
As is the case with the “ float ” property , our two major browsers use different syntax to access this attribute via the getAttribute method in JavaScript .
The IE Syntax :
var myObject = document.getElementById(" header " ) ; var myAttribute = myObject.getAttribute (" className " ) ;
The Firefox Syntax :
var myObject = document.getElementById(" header " ) ; var myAttribute = myObject.getAttribute ( " class " ) ;
This syntax would also apply using the setAttribute method .
See a demo page that demonstrates these two different syntaxes
4 . Accessing the “ for ” Attribute of the < label >
Tag
Similar to number 3 , we have different syntax to access a < label > tag ’s “ for ” attribute in JavaScript .
The IE Syntax :
var myObject = document.getElementById(" myLabel " ) ; var myAttribute = myObject.getAttribute ( " htmlFor " ) ;
The Firefox Syntax :
var myObject = document.getElementById(" myLabel " ) ; var myAttribute = myObject.getAttribute ( " for " ) ;
5. Getting the Cursor Position
It would be rare that you would want to find the cursor position of an element , but if for some reason you need to , the syntax is different in IE and Firefox .
The code samples here are fairly basic , and normally would be part of a much more complex event handler , but they serve to illustrate the difference .
Also , it should be noted that the result in IE will be different than that of Firefox , so this method is buggy .
Usually , the difference can be compensated for by getting the “ scrolling position ” — but that ’s a subject for another post !
The IE Syntax :
var myCursorPosition = [ 0 , 0 ] ; myCursorPosition [ 0 ] = event.clientX ; myCursorPosition [ 1 ] = event.clientY ;
The Firefox Syntax :
var myCursorPosition = [ 0 , 0 ] ; myCursorPosition [ 0 ] = event.pageX ; myCursorPosition [ 1 ] = event .
pageY ;
6. Getting the Size of the Viewport , or Browser Window
Sometimes it ’s necessary to find out the size of the browser ’s available window space , usually called the “ viewport ” .
The IE Syntax :
var myBrowserSize = [ 0 , 0 ] ; myBrowserSize[ 0 ] = document.documentElement.clientWidth ; myBrowserSize [ 1 ] = document.documentElement.clientHeight ;
The Firefox Syntax :
var myBrowserSize = [ 0 , 0 ] ; myBrowserSize[ 0 ] = window.innerWidth ; myBrowserSize [ 1 ] = window.innerHeight ;
7. Alpha Transparency
Okay , this is not a JavaScript syntax issue — alpha transparency is set via CSS .
But when objects fade in and out via JavaScript , this is done by accessing CSS alpha settings , usually inside of a loop .
The CSS code that needs to be altered via JavaScript is as follows :
The IE Syntax :
#myElement { filter : alpha( opacity=50 ) ; }
The Firefox Syntax :
#myElement { opacity : 0.5 ; }
So , to access those values via JavaScript , we would use the style object :
The IE Syntax :
var myObject = document.getElementById(" myElement " ) ; myObject.style.filter = " alpha( opacity=80 ) " ;
The Firefox Syntax :
var myObject = document.getElementById(" myElement " ) ; myObject.style.opacity = " 0.5 " ;
Of course , as mentioned , normally the opacity / alpha would be changed in the midst of a loop , to create the animating effect , but this simple example clearly illustrates how it ’s done .
Are There Other Differences ?
These are some of the differences I ’ve personally come across either in development or research , but I ’m sure there are others .
Leave a comment if you think I ’ve left out an important one , and I ’ll try to update this list , or else do a “ Part 2 ” post .
Justice Department , Dick , and Steinbeck All Sharpen Knives Against Google
" What is thy bidding , foul mage ?
We hear and obey ! "
Yesterday , Andrew DeVore , a lawyer representing the heirs of John Steinbeck and the Philip K. Dick Trust , delivered a brief to Judge Denny Chin asking for a four month extension of the Google Books Settlement so that authors could get their minds around the agreement and what it means for the future of fiction .
Judge Chin has agreed , extending the settlement agreement until September 7th .
REPEAT : JOHN STEINBECK AND PHILIP K. DICK HAVE BEEN SUMMONED FROM THE GRAVE BY UNHOLY LEGAL NECROMANCERS TO LEAD ARTISTIC OPPOSITION TO A SETTLEMENT DEEMED DANGEROUS FOR THE MISSING AND THE DEAD .
From Andrew DeVore 's letter " The scope of the proposed settlement is unprecedented .
For authors who do not opt out , the settlement if approved would impose a complex scheme for the wholesale allocation of rights and remedies , and compensation for exploitation of those rights , in the digital world .
And it would cement the scheme in perpetuity in an area of commerce that has seen explosive growth in just the last five years , and that may well prove to be the most important and valuable channel for the distribution and exploitation of creative works .
" DeVore 's letter also cites the fact that many authors and publishers have only recently been notified about the settlement , and the fact that Google 's database of books is difficult to navigate and full of incorrect information .
Additionally , the terms of the settlement are deceptive and unclear as pertains to the rights to non-display uses of books -- uses like data mining ad keyword search .
The Justice Department has also opened an inquiry into the settlement as a result of pressure from the Internet Archive and Consumer Watchdog From the New York Times : " Lawyers for the Justice Department have been in conversations in recent weeks with various groups opposed to the settlement , including the Internet Archive and Consumer Watchdog .
More recently , Justice Department lawyers notified the parties to the settlement , including Google , and representatives for the Association of American Publishers and the Authors Guild , that they were looking into various antitrust issues related to the far - reaching agreement .
"
The inquiry does not necessarily mean that the department will oppose the settlement , which is subject to a court review .
But it suggests that some of the concerns raised by critics , who say the settlement would unfairly give Google an exclusive license to profit from millions of books , have resonated with the Justice Department .
" I think we can all safely say that Philip K . Dick at least would not want to deliver the power to manage , sort , and hide the contents of all world literature to a massive internet search company .
I also think we can all safely say that we would all like to see provisions in the settlement for Google to begin research on a fully - functional android containing Philip K. Dick 's consciousness that will head their Book Rights Registry and will have the ability to morph into a predator drone to protect the interests of writers .
" OH SHIT IT IS THE DICKBOT .
BURN ALL DOCUMENTS AND GO OUT THE WINDOW .
THERE IS NO TIME . "
A college principal , who may be a danger to others after receiving intensive radiation treatment , is believed to be on the run in Ireland after failing to appear in Britain on child pornography charges .
A court in London was told that Thomas Leopold , 42 , could harm anyone he comes into contact with because he was given large doses of radiation for a thyroid condition and his levels of radioactivity could be dangerous to others .
The lecturer jumped bail to board an overnight ferry to Ireland under the noses of British police earlier this month .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" This is not a joke , " Judge John Price said as he issued an arrest warrant .
" Please warn officers that when he is arrested , he might be radioactive . "
Mr Leopold is thought to have been given radioactive liquid iodine to treat his ailment .
The radiation eventually fades but patients can still pass it on through urine , saliva and sweat .
Mr Leopold , who is head of a tutorial college in Harrow , Middlesex , is accused of downloading indecent images of children in 2006 .
His trial had been listed for hearing on 9 February but only four days earlier he was questioned by a Special Branch officer as he attempted to board a ferry in Fishguard in Wales .
" He told the officer his bail condition had been varied , enabling him to make the journey to visit his mother , " prosecuting attorney Nick Mather told Southwark Crown Court .
Mr Leopold was then waved on to the ferry bound for Rosslare and has not been seen since .
It is understood that when he showed his radiation card , he was permitted to stay in his own car as the ferry travelled across the Irish sea .
" He is in chronic poor health , " defending attorney Jeannie Mackie told the court .

" His doctor confirmed that he is dangerous , in terms of radioactivity , for a period of six weeks after treatment and he had treatment on February 3 .
Mr Leopold , from Hammersmith in west London , denies five counts of making indecent images of children and one of possessing 87 such images on or before April 2006 .
When he failed to turn up at a previous hearing , he told authorities he was in Ireland looking after his sick mother .

After watching a video about making mushrooms taste bacon , i decided to try it .
Following the basic instructions in the video , I chopped up 2 containers of shitake mushrooms in to strips ( I also removed the stems ) .
Larger mushrooms I cut in to 3 strips , smaller ones I cut in half .
In the end , it did n’t seem to matter much what size the pieces were .
Next , I mixed them with a little olive oil and salt , spread them out on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and popped them in my oven — which just happened to be preheated to 350° .
After stirring them with tongs every 10 minutes or so for an hour , it appeared that they were done .
But did they taste like bacon ?
And what was I going to do with them ?
The finished product did have a slight bacon taste and was somewhat crunchy to boot .
Not a bad substitute for bacon , especially if you are on a diet , a vegetarian , unable to eat bacon due to religion , or you are out of bacon and all the grocery stores near you are closed but you just happened to have a bunch of shitake mushrooms laying around waiting to get eaten .
One thing I need to mention is that after an hour in the oven , the mushrooms had lost quite a lot of mass .
One whole container of mushrooms cooked down to about 1 serving .
Now that I had these crispy baconish fungi , I needed to put them to use .
Here ’s what I did :
Mango , avocado , baconshroom salsa :
Dice one small mango ( champagne mango ) and one small avocado .
Add the baconshrooms , some fresh cilantro and squeeze half a lime over the top and mix it all up .
Blood orange balsamic dressing ( low calorie ) :
Add the juice from 2 blood orange , about the same amount of balsamic vinegar , 2 or 3 tablespoons of Grey Poupon or other dijon mustard and a pinch of salt to a sealable plastic container .
Close the lid tightly and shake for 30 seconds or so until there are no lumps of mustard remaining .
If necessary , add a little sugar or splenda to knock down the acidity .
Shrimp :
Thaw frozen shrimp :)
Yeah , I know , but it ’s all I had .
Of course grilled fresh shrimp would be much better or , dare i say , pan seared scollops .
Put the wishing - they - were - grilled - but - sadly - they ’re - frozen shrimp on a bed of lettuce , add the salsa and dressing , maybe even some some freshly ground pepper and voila !
Salad with shrimp , mango - avocado - baconshroom salsa and blood orange balsamic dressing .
Yummy !
Enjoy !

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Prices of existing Manhattan apartments fell by double digits in the first quarter , according to several market reports released on Thursday by New York City ’s biggest real estate brokerages .
The median resale price of an existing Manhattan apartment fell 11 percent to $ 749,000 in the first quarter , according to a report from PropertyShark.com , a foreclosure data Website and The Corcoran Group , New York City ’s largest brokerage .
“ Prices still have downward pressure on them , and you ’ll see lower prices in the next quarter than you ’re seeing now , ” said Corcoran Chief Executive Pam Liebman .
Of all listings in the quarter , 37 percent , or 5,641 , saw price cuts , while prices rose on only 136 properties , according to data from real estate Website StreetEasy.com .
The price declines reflect the ongoing turmoil afflicting Wall Street which started in the summer of 2007 with the first stirrings of the credit crisis and intensified last September with Lehman Brothers ’ bankruptcy , said Gregory Heym , chief economist of brokerage Brown Harris Stevens .
“ Wall Street is the leading economic force in the city , so it ’s not surprising , ” Heym said .
Brown Harris Stevens ’ data had median resale prices down by 16 percent in the first quarter .
Job losses and deep cuts in the financial services industry have cooled the normally overheated New York City property market .
In February , New York City ’s unemployment rate rose 1.2 percentage points to 8.1 percent from January , the highest level since October 2003 , the state Department of Labor said last week .
In 2008 , Wall Street firms slashed bonuses by 44 percent , cutting the total to $ 18.4 billion from $ 32.9 billion , state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a January report .
The drop in prices indicate more to come , because resale prices are not susceptible to distortion like sales figures that include new construction , in which contracts are signed up to 18 months before the sale is completed .
The lag between the signing and closing of a resale contract is much shorter .
In the first quarter , for example , the median sales price for new development rose 26.4 percent compared with last year to $ 1.28 million , according to StreetEasy.com ’s data .
But excluding new development , the price correction will continue to unfold in the next Manhattan market report , and maybe even in the one after that , said Matthew Haines , PropertyShark.com ’s founder : “ We are in a period of price discovery . ”
Wall Street ’s pain also manifests itself in a dramatic decline in sales activity , most vividly seen in an 87 percent year - over - year decline in closings over $ 10 million , the Brown Harris Stevens Report said .
But volume fell across the board , with the number of sales falling by almost half to 1,195 compared with last year , according to the Prudential Douglas Elliman / Miller Samuel report .
The global credit crisis , which is making it harder to get a mortgage for expensive Manhattan real estate , is also dampening demand , said Corcoran ’s Liebman , who has high hopes for government efforts to unleash the flow of credit .
“ We need to get lending back on track for our buyers , and that will help a lot , ” she said .
RICH countries in the OECD 's Development Assistance Committee gave $ 119.8 billion in foreign aid last year , according to preliminary estimates released on Monday March 30th .
This is over 10 % more than in 2007 and is the highest amount ever given .
The 22 countries in the DAC devoted an average of 0.47 % of GDP to aid , up from 0.45 % in 2007 , though this is still considerably below the United Nations target of 0.7 % .
Despite the plight of the global economy , the OECD expects that aid will continue to grow , reaching $ 145.1 billion ( in 2008 terms ) in 2010 .

The bit coins are the new technological innovation that had been used as an alternate money transaction method .
The dealing regarding this network had been grown rapidly as well it becomes more popular within a short time .
Now the bit coins had been widely used as the form of the crypto currency or also known as the digital payment system .
The main concept of the bit coin is that it is a decentralized currency and the payment system that seeks for eliminating all the needs for the trusted authorities .
The bitcoin is based on the idea that the money had not created in virtual rather than the real money .
It contains for both the self governing as well for the self sustaining .
The rule that had been framed over this does not have a single entity it was made up with the protocol .
That is a certain set of rules and regulation had been framed for using and for assessing them .
It would be processed only based on the rules and the regulation .
You could only able to generate the particular amount of the bit coins .
You can use of them effectively
You can open and access them in the decentralized nature of the bitcoins networks .
The community would be in the double modes as like the flexible as well as in the dynamic methods .
For accessing this there is no certain form of the rules and the regulation had been formed .
It implements a technical solution for protecting the network against the malicious attacks .
This would try to eliminate the problem at the starting point by creating a trustless infrastructure .
The identity of the particular node would be entirely irrelevant in this case .
The challenges had been resolved in the purely perfect manner through the notation of the mining .
You can signup to dating sites , like Tits Finder who offers bitcoins for payments , and keep all the transaction information private .
The bitcoins governance of the politics
The bit coins had been initially released as like the open source software and this would sure encourage all the things and despite this type of the formal emphasis with the different set of the open source software projects .
The open source communities had been mainly based on the two different types .
They are as like the democratic organic and the autocratic mechanistic .
It contains the former display with the highly structured and the meritocratic governance that would have the feature sophisticated and had been implemented in the governance system .
The difficult issues of the bitcoins
The conflict management that holds the difficult issues would deals with the consensus oriented to the communities and this helps to avoid both the paralyzing deadlocks and the divining fights .
It would create some type of the lacking in the conflicts managements procedures .
The Vires in Numeris is the first motto printed in the physical bitcoins wallet .
The decentralized inherently would affect the political structures by removing its overall control .
It had been achieved through the decentralized that too with the peer to peer type of the payment mode .
On the other hand it acts as like the decentralized platform for the financial institutions that would define the terms and the conditions and this would have the entire control over the complete transactions .
The politics would progressively give the way to form the technologically driven protocols for the other type for the social co ordinations .
It is regarded as the more efficient way through which the individual would cooperates the collective goal for particular economy .
One can not able to easily get rid from the politics with the help of the technological support alone .
It would have the wider range of the powerful dynamics inherently .

Carrying a Gun Would n't Necessarily Get You Out of a Shooting Saving yourself during mass murder -- having a gun is n't always the answer .
April 10 , 2009  -- America is facing an epidemic of gun violence .
Thirteen people were killed last week in Binghamton , N.Y. , when a gunman , identified by authorities as 41 - year - old Jiverly Wong , executed a mass shooting at the American Civic Association .
The aftermath of that bloodshed has raised many questions , including whether armed , everyday citizens could take down such a gunman and save lives .
Could you protect yourself if you only had a gun ?
There are 250 million guns in the United States , enough for almost every man , woman and child to arm themselves .
The FBI performed 12 million gun-related background checks in 2008 , according to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System .
And with more than 50 deaths resulting from mass shootings in the past month alone , the argument for ordinary citizens arming themselves in schools , workplaces and anywhere else continues to grow .
But if teachers at Colorado 's Columbine High School or the students and faculty of Virginia Tech University had concealed or open - carry permits , range training and loaded handguns mixed with their school supplies , could they have taken down men armed to the teeth , ready to die and acting under the element of surprise ?
Watch " If I Only Had a Gun " tonight on a special edition of " 20/20 " at 10 p.m. ET
Some , like the group Students for Concealed Carry on Campus , which claims to have more than 38,000 members , think it would at least give people a better chance to survive .
Matt Guzman , leader of the advocacy group 's Texas chapter , said that an armed student or citizen might even be more effective in taking down a gunman than law enforcement .
" It 's a different situation between civilians that are armed and police that are armed , " Guzman said in an interview on " Good Morning America Weekend " shortly after a school shooting at Northern Illinois University last year that left six people dead .
" When police respond , there 's multiple police officers , they 're at a safer distance , 20 , 30 feet away .
And one officer does n't fire ; it 's multiple officers firing .
[ If ] it 's one person , one criminal , a robbery , mugging , things of that sort [ where ] the victim is a couple feet away , you do n't have to be a crack shot . "
But opponents argue that using a weapon for self - defense in a true emergency is not like target practice .
" Video games and movies , they glorify gun fights , " said Chris Benton , a police investigator with the Bethlehem , Pa. police department .
" It 's not reality you know and they get that warped sense that this video games is exactly what I can do in real life . "
Average Citizens Not Prepared to Handle a Gun in an Emergency
Opponents also point out that most people are ill - prepared to handle a gun .
Only six states , for instance , require any kind of training before issuing a routine permit to own a gun , according to the San Francisco - based Legal Community Against Violence .
Of the 48 states that allow concealed - carry permits , less than half require people to " demonstrate knowledge of firearm use and / or safety , " and even fewer require an actual training course .
Such a lack of training sends up red flags for people like investigator Benton and firearms instructor Glen Dorney .
" Rounds are coming back at you , " Benton said .
" You 've got outside environments , people are screaming , running .
It 's too much for a normal person who 's never been trained to deal with .
It 's overwhelming . "
Dorney said , " If you do n't have training and you do n't use proper tactics with what you 're doing , you 're probably making yourself a target for somebody . "
And it 's not just tactical issues one faces in an active - shooter environment , the men say , citing the physiological effects of stress .
" What happens is that you get so jacked up you forget how to do the simple things , " Benton said .
" Because your [ heart rate ] elevates , your fine motor skills deteriorate , and you can't get your gun out .
And you 're thinking , ' Oh there 's a gun ; I 'm getting shot at . ' "
Dorney said , " You get tunnel vision as well , because now you 're not looking at the entire environment ; you 're focused on one thing , and it 's probably going to be the threat .
It 's been equated to taking paper towel rolls when they 're empty , and sticking them up to your eyes .
That 's almost what you see .
And ... and you have to train yourself to be able to break that . "
Also , they said , the vigilante is responsible for whatever his or her bullets hit .
" You have to be able to know what your target is ; but you also have to know what 's behind your target , what 's around your target ; you 're very responsible for everything , " Benton said .
" One stray bullet that misses and hits a bystander , you 're responsible for it . "
Bill Stanton , former New York City police officer and safety expert , likens it to getting behind the wheel of a car , in bad weather , without a license .
" You know , would anybody think to get in a car and drive during a rainstorm if they did n't have a license ? "
Stanton asked .
" Would anybody get behind a wheel of an airplane without any flying lessons , you know ?
While this is n't as dangerous , it 's pretty close . "
Stanton said there 're better ways to survive or help those around you .
In a scenario such as the Binghamton shooting , where the assailant blocked the building 's exit , he said that hostages should be thinking about alternative exits and hiding places .
" Is there a window with a garage roof right next door that I can jump from one to the other ?
Am I capable of doing that ?
Or maybe I 'm just going to go to the closet and hide , " he said .
" Know your strengths , know your vulnerabilities , and get away from that violence . "
The person who is most likely to survive a shooting is the one who immediately springs into some kind of action that Stanton refers to as " go mode " and tells themselves , " OK , this is what 's happening .
This is what I have to do .
" If you have this guy ... that just comes into a classroom , puts a gun to your head and pulls the trigger while you are talking to someone else , well , you know what ?
There is nothing you could do , " he said .
" But there were people that survived : the ones that played dead .
The ones that , you know , went through a window .
The ones that hid behind a desk .
The ones that got on the phone and called in 911 .
When they do a post interview of all these different people , you 'll see a , a general commonality : ' I knew I had to live . ' "
And remember that cell phone in your pocket ?
It might be the best weapon you have for survival .
" Get on the cell phone , tell people , barricade these doors , and wait it out , " said Stanton .
Stanton adds that in this age , when most seem to want to tune out the outside world , people would be better prepared by staying alert with an everyday survival mindset .
" You need to be on yellow alert in all your waking hours , " he said .
" You know , do n't keep your head in the clouds ; be aware of what 's going on and listen to that internal radar .
Listen to that inner voice .
What people need to do is they need to observe , not just look .
They need to listen , not just hear someone .
These are the things that trained professionals do . "
Stanton said there are three immediate steps to take if you 're suddenly in the middle of a deadly shooting : " Identify what 's going on , recognize the situation , and have an exit strategy . "
To put these theories to the test , Benton , Dorney and the Bethlehem Police Department set up an experiment at Muhlenberg College in Allentown , Pa. ABC News sent out word that police were offering free gun training .
And from those who were interested , six people with gun experience ranging from none to more than 100 hours at a range were chosen to take part .
After going through a basic safety course that covered more training than almost half the states in the country require to carry a concealed weapon , the participants were given a real glock handgun loaded with simunition bullets -- bullets that are filled with a kind of paint that does not injure someone on contact .
The participants then headed from the training class to a lecture on protective gear .
In the lecture hall were cops or people working with ABC posing as other students taking part in the day 's training .
None of our participants knew that in moments they would be jolted into an intense and terrifyingly real simulation of an attack by a gunman .
What happens when the gunman bursts through the door ?
Will the students fall into the same problems the experts talked about , or will they snap to action and cut the gunman down ?
Watch Diane Sawyer 's special tonight to find the startling results , and learn how to best survive this worst - case scenario .
So Rush Limbaugh has challenged Obama to a debate .
It ’s smart for Rush .
If Obama is going to anoint him as the leader of the Republican Party , he may as well respond in kind .
And hey , he articulates conservative principles very well .
But still .
I hope Rush Limbaugh fails in his attempt to set himself up as the de facto head of the Republican Party .
[ UPDATE : More accurately , as the de facto head of the conservative movement .
See UPDATE below . ]
It ’s good for him personally .
I get that .
And I love hearing the guy hold forth .
I wish him all the success in the world for his radio program .
But some of the things he says are designed principally to stir controversy and draw attention to himself .
Like saying he hopes Obama fails .
Rush knows his comments will elevate his profile and make him seem more important .
I know : when he says he hopes Obama fails , he does n’t mean he wants to see Americans suffer .
He just does n’t want liberal policies enacted because he thinks they ’re bad for the country .
I get it .
I agree with that .
But , you know , that ’s nuance .
The problem is , Americans have short attention spans and do n’t always do nuance well .
Just by writing the title of this post the way I did , I ’ll get an angry reaction from some — even though , if you read the post , I have n’t said anything particularly negative about Limbaugh .
As Allahpundit says :
It ’s Republicans who are suffering from having to thread the needle between defending Limbaugh and rejecting the “ I want him to fail ” rhetoric .
What harm has Rush suffered ?
His stature ’s never been greater , as he himself acknowledges right here .
Indeed .
Michael Steele and other Republicans need to say : “ Rush Limbaugh is an articulate man who expresses conservative principles well .
But when he says he wants Obama to fail , he ’s putting things in a deliberately controversial way to draw attention to himself .
I would n’t say I want Obama to fail .
I would say simply that I think conservative principles are better for our country .
That ’s how I feel — and I ’m not apologizing for saying so . ”
P.S. I hope David Frum fails too .
UPDATE : Some commenters object that Rush is not the head of the Republican party , and indeed recently said he does n’t want to be .
These commenters say that , if anything , he is the head of the conservative movement .
Fair enough .
I understand ( painfully well , as a conservative ) that the two are not synonymous , and I take Rush at his word .
Therefore I have changed my post to say “ conservative movement ” instead of Republican party , and thanks to those who pointed this out .
I do n’t think that this change alters the point of my piece significantly .
Namely : it ’s great to have someone strongly articulating conservative values . . . but prominent conservatives need not sign on to his “ I want Obama to fail ” phraseology .
That phraseology is counterproductive because it puts conservatives on defense .
Conservatives need not sign on to that formulation to prove that they stand for conservative principles .
Recently , Sean Leather took up the idea of incremental folds . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] .
At the end of his first article on the topic he made a comment on how this was a useful design pattern and sagely noted the advice of Jeremy Gibbons that design patterns are more effective as programs , while complaining of cut and paste coding issues .
The following attempts to address these concerns .
Below , I 'm going to be using two libraries which I have n't mentioned on here before :
My monoids library which contains among other things a large supply of monoids and the concept of a Reducer .
A ' Reducer ' is a monoid that knows how to inject values from another type .
It also supports efficient left - to - right and right - to - left reduction , but we will be availing ourselves of neither of those extra faculties at the moment .
The other library is reflection , which is a transcoding of Oleg Kiselyov and Chung - chieh Shan 's incredibly elegant approach from " Functional Pearl : Implicit Configurations " updated slightly to work with the changes in GHC 's implementation of ScopedTypeVariables since the article was written .
The source code for this post is available as Incremental.hs .
The ' monoids ' and ' reflection ' libraries are available from hackage .
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators , MultiParamTypeClasses , FlexibleInstances , FlexibleContexts , UndecidableInstances , ScopedTypeVariables , GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} module Incremental where import Text .
Show import Text .
Read import Data .
Reflection import Data .
Monoid .
Reducer hiding ( Sum , getSum , cons , ReducedBy ( Reduction , getReduction ) )
[ Edit : updated to hide a few more things from Data .
Monoid .
Reducer which now contains a ' ReducedBy ' constructor , which serves a different purpose . ]
I want to take a bit of a different tack than I did with ' category - extras ' and define algebras and coalgebras as type classes .
class Functor f =>
Algebra f m where phi :: f m -> m class Functor f =>
Coalgebra f m where psi :: m -> f m
This means that if you need to use a different Algebra , apply a newtype wrapper to the value m .
We 'll fix this requirement to some degree later on in this post .
Now , for every Functor , we can reduce it to ( ) .
instance Functor f => Algebra f ( ) where phi _ = ( )
And we can define the idea of an F - Algebra product
-- F- Algebra product instance ( Algebra f m , Algebra f n ) =>
Algebra f ( m , n ) where phi a = ( phi ( fmap fst a ) , phi ( fmap snd a ) ) instance ( Algebra f m , Algebra f n , Algebra f o ) =>
Algebra f ( m , n , o ) where phi a = ( phi ( fmap f a ) , phi ( fmap g a ) , phi ( fmap h a ) ) where f ( x , _ , _ ) = x g ( _ , y , _ ) = y h ( _ , _, z ) = z
and so on for larger tuples .
From there , the usual direction would be to define a fixpoint operator in one of several ways , so not to disappoint :
newtype Mu f =
In ( f ( Mu f ) ) instance ( Eq ( f ( Mu f ) ) ) =>
Eq ( Mu f ) where
In f == In g = f == g instance ( Ord ( f ( Mu f ) ) ) =>
Ord ( Mu f ) where
In f ` compare ` In g = f ` compare ` g instance ( Show ( f ( Mu f ) ) ) =>
Show ( Mu f ) where shows
Prec d ( In f ) = showParen ( d > 10 ) $ showString
" In " .
shows Prec 11 f instance ( Read ( f ( Mu f ) ) ) =>
Read ( Mu f ) where readPrec = parens .
prec 10 $ do Ident " In " < - lexP f <- step readPrec return ( In f )
Now , we can define an Algebra and Coalgebra for getting into and out of this fixed point .
instance Functor f => Algebra f ( Mu f ) where phi =
In instance Functor f => Coalgebra f ( Mu f ) where psi ( In x ) = x
But our goal is an incremental fold without boilerplate .
So I 'd rather than the fixed point operator did the heavy lifting for me .
So lets define an alternative fixedpoint , in which we 'll carry around an extra term for the result of applying the incremental Algebra so far .
data ( f :> m ) = f ( f :> m ) :> m
The much more categorically inclined members of the audience may recognize that immediately as the ' cofree ' comonad of f from category - extras , and in fact we could continue on adding that definition , and turn it into a comonad for any Functor .
I leave that as an exercise for the interested reader , but what we are interested in is the ' extract ' operation of that comonad , which we 'll just call value for now .
value :: ( f :> m ) -> m value ( _ :> m ) = m
The particularly observant may further note that value itself is an ( f :>) - algebra , since the ' extract ' operation of any copointed functor f is just an f -algebra .
First , we add some boilerplate in the fashion of Mu f above .
instance ( Eq m , Eq ( f ( f :> m ) ) ) =>
Eq ( f :> m ) where f :> m == g :> n = f == g && m == n f :> m /= g :> n = f /= g || m /= n instance ( Ord m , Ord ( f ( f :> m ) ) ) =>
Ord ( f :> m ) where ( f :> m ) ` compare ` ( g :> n ) | a == EQ = m ` compare ` n | otherwise = a where a = f ` compare ` g instance ( Show m , Show ( f ( f :> m ) ) ) =>
Show ( f :> m ) where shows
Prec d ( f :> m ) = showParen ( d > 9 ) $ shows Prec 10 f . showString " :> " . shows Prec 10 m instance ( Read m , Read ( f ( f :> m ) ) ) =>
Read ( f :> m ) where readPrec = parens $ prec 9 $ do f < - step readPrec Symbol " : > " < - lexP m <- step readPrec return ( f :> m )
and then we note that we can ask for the ' tail ' of any cofree comonad as well , which gives us a more immediately useful coalgebra .
instance Functor f => Coalgebra f ( f :> m ) where psi ( x :> _ ) = x
And now , we come back to why we made algebras and coalgebras into a typeclass in the first place .
We can define an algebra for how we propagate the information from another algebra that we want to incrementally apply to our functor f .
instance Algebra f m =>
Algebra f ( f :> m ) where phi x = x :> phi ( fmap value x )
We can give these convenient names so we do n't get our phi's and psi's confused .
forget :: Functor f => ( f :> m ) -> f ( f :> m ) forget = psi remember :: Algebra f m => f ( f :> m ) -> f :> m remember = phi
' forget ' discards the wrapper which contains the result of having applied our algebra .
' remember ' takes an f ( f :> m ) and adds a wrapper , which remembers the result of having applied our selected f- algebra with carrier m .
With these convenient aliases , we can define catamorphisms and anamorphisms over ( f :> m ) .
cata :: Algebra f a => ( f :> m ) -> a cata = phi .
fmap cata .
forget ana :: ( Algebra f m , Coalgebra f a ) => a -> ( f :> m ) ana = remember .
fmap ana .
psi
cata just forgets the wrapper , and applies an algebra recursively as usual .
On the other hand , our anamorphism now needs to know the algebra for the incremental fold , so that it can apply it as it builds up our new structure .
We can easily go back and forth between our two fixed point representations .
tag :: Algebra f m => Mu f -> ( f :> m ) tag = remember .
fmap tag .
psi untag :: Functor f => ( f :> m ) ->
Mu f untag = phi .
fmap untag .
forget
Now , with that machinery in hand , lets try to build a couple of examples , and then see if we can push the envelope a little further .
So lets define the binary tree that Sean has been using , except now as a base functor that we 'll fold .
data Tree a r = Bin r a r | Tip deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show , Read ) instance Functor ( Tree a ) where fmap f ( Bin x a y ) = Bin ( f x ) a ( f y ) fmap _ Tip = Tip
As with Sean 's code , we 'll use a pair of smart constructors to build our tree , but note , we no longer have the unsightly and easily mistaken explicit algebra arguments .
You can no longer mistakenly apply the wrong algebra !
bin :: Algebra ( Tree a ) m => ( Tree a :> m ) -> a -> ( Tree a :> m ) -> ( Tree a :> m ) bin a v b = remember ( Bin a v b ) tip :: Algebra ( Tree a ) m => ( Tree a :> m ) tip = remember Tip
And , we 'll need some data to play with , so lets define a nice generic looking tree .
testTree :: ( Num a , Algebra ( Tree a ) m ) =>
Tree a :> m testTree = bin tip 2 ( bin ( bin tip 3 tip ) 4 tip )
And while we 're at it lets define a couple of algebras to try things out .
newtype Size = Size { getSize ::
Int } deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show , Read , Num ) instance Algebra ( Tree a )
Size where phi ( Bin x _ y ) = x + 1 + y phi Tip = 0 newtype Sum = Sum { getSum ::
Int } deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show , Read , Num ) instance Algebra ( Tree Int )
Sum where phi ( Bin x y z ) = x +
Sum y + z phi Tip = 0
With those we can now rush off to ghci and give it a whirl .
* Incremental > testTree :: Tree Int :>
Sum Bin ( Tip :>
Sum { getSum = 0 } ) 2 ( Bin ( Bin ( Tip :>
Sum { getSum = 0 } ) 3 ( Tip :>
Sum { getSum = 0 } ) :>
Sum { getSum = 3 } ) 4 ( Tip :>
Sum { getSum = 0 } ) :>
Sum { getSum = 7 } ) :>
Sum { getSum = 9 }
Note that each node in the tree is tagged with the accumulated result of our algebra .
Of course , since we also have an f - algebra with carrier Mu f , we can ask for that to be computed incrementally as well .
* Incremental > testTree :: Tree Int :>
Mu ( Tree Int ) Bin ( Tip :>
In Tip ) 2 ( Bin ( Bin ( Tip :>
In Tip ) 3 ( Tip :> In Tip ) :>
In ( Bin ( In Tip ) 3 ( In Tip ) ) ) 4 ( Tip :> In Tip ) :>
In ( Bin ( In ( Bin ( In Tip ) 3 ( In Tip ) ) ) 4 ( In Tip ) ) ) :>
In ( Bin ( In Tip ) 2 ( In ( Bin ( In ( Bin ( In Tip ) 3 ( In Tip ) ) ) 4 ( In Tip ) ) ) )
Of course , this prints very poorly , but shares heavily as you can see below thanks to vacuum by Matt Morrow .
Now , defining Sum , and Size manually may be all well and good , and its sure a lot less work than it was before , but we can also just decide to lift almost any Monoid into an f - Algebra .
Here is where we need the ' Reducer ' concept from ' monoids ' that was mentioned earlier .
newtype Mon m = Mon { getMon :: m } deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show , Read , Monoid ) instance ( a ` Reducer` m ) =>
Algebra ( Tree a ) ( Mon m ) where phi ( Bin x v y ) = x `mappend` Mon ( unit v ) `mappend` y phi Tip = mempty -- where unit :: ( a ` Reducer`m ) => a -> m
Of course , we 're not limited to trees .
data List a r = Cons a r | Nil deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show , Read ) instance Functor ( List a ) where fmap f ( Cons a x ) = Cons a ( f x ) fmap _ Nil = Nil instance Algebra ( List a )
Size where phi ( Cons _ xs ) = 1 + xs phi Nil = 0 instance Algebra ( List Int )
Sum where phi ( Cons x xs ) = fromIntegral x + xs phi Nil = 0 instance ( a ` Reducer` m ) =>
Algebra ( List a ) ( Mon m ) where phi ( Cons x xs ) =
Mon ( unit x ) `mappend` xs phi Nil = mempty cons :: Algebra ( List a ) m => a -> ( List a :> m ) -> ( List a :> m ) cons a b = remember ( Cons a b ) nil :: Algebra ( List a ) m =>
List a :> m nil = remember Nil testList :: ( Num a , Algebra ( List a ) m ) =>
List a :> m testList = cons 2 . cons 5 . cons 8 $ cons 27 nil
But now we 're at a bit of an impasse .
How do you deal with f-algebras that use some environment ?
When writing these out by hand , if a particular algebra uses a variable that is in scope it just closes over it in its environment .
Giving a reference to the carrier for the algebra permits the abstraction to leak , and most likely requires you to regress to a smart constructor approach in which you package up that extra information by hand .
Since we package up the algebra in a type class , we seem , at first glance to have lost the ability to access an environment .
After all a ' benefit ' of the looser types permitted by Sean 's post was that he could build values using an arbitrary algebra , just using any old pair of functions .
One useful example that would seem at first glance to be ruled out is the following .
Every different filter function would have to be a different algebra !
filter_phi :: Algebra ( List a ) m => ( a -> Bool ) ->
List a ( List a :> m ) ->
List a :> m filter_phi p Nil = nil filter_phi p ( Cons a as ) | p a = cons a as | otherwise = as
So , lets do just that .
We need to be able to reify an arbitrary function from a term into a type and we can do this with Data .
Reflection !
For the technical details , please read Oleg and Chung - chieh 's very elegant functional pearl , but the idea is that by carefully abusing the ability to convert a list of integers into a type , we can convert a stable pointer into a type and share it in a limited context .
In this case , that stable pointer can point to our particular algebra , environment and all , and yet we can be sure that the user does n't try to mix incremental folds that use different environments .
To do this , we need a phantom type parameter in the carrier for our f-algebra .
newtype ( a ` ReducedBy` s ) = Reduction { getReduction :: a }
and to reflect the function back down from the type level in our f-algebra .
instance ( Functor f , s ` Reflects` ( f a -> a ) ) =>
Algebra f ( a ` Reduced By` s ) where phi = Reduction .
reflect ( undefined :: s ) . fmap getReduction
With that we can define any f-algebra that needs context , by reflecting it into the type system .
The rank - 2 type protects us from trying to put together data structures that were constructed using different algebras .
So now we can now apply this particular algebra to filter a list incrementally build up a list which incrementally builds itself in the [ Int ] monoid and tracks its length .
Here we 'll filter the list from earlier for even numbers and apply these other incremental operations all in one go .
It reads a little more naturally if broken into parts , but we can write this all in one go .
test :: List Int :> ( Mon [ Int ] , Size ) test = reify ( filter_phi ( \\x -> x ` mod ` 2 == 0 ) ) ( \\ ( _ :: s ) -> getReduction ( value ( testList :: List Int :> ( ( List Int :> ( Mon [ Int ] , Size ) ) ` ReducedBy` s ) ) ) )
Which we can test out :
* Incremental > test Cons 2 ( Cons 8 ( Nil :> ( Mon { getMon = [ ] } , Size { getSize = 0 } ) ) :> ( Mon { getMon = [ 8 ] } , Size { getSize = 1 } ) ) :> ( Mon { getMon = [ 2 , 8 ] } , Size { getSize = 2 } )
And there you have an incremental fold upon reflection .

HUDSONVILLE -- Derek Copp , the Grand Valley State University student shot by police during a drug raid , wants to apologize to the sheriff 's deputy who shot him for the trouble his arrest caused , his criminal attorney said this morning .
" My client wants to send a letter of apology , " attorney George Krupp told Hudsonville District Judge Kenneth Post at Copp 's arraignment on a marijuana - delivery
Copp , 20 , also acknowledged at his arraignment that he smoked marijuana as recently as eight days ago .
The admission came after the judge asked if Copp would be " clean or dirty " if given a drug test .
Copp said dirty , because he smoked marijuana April 14 .
At this morning 's arraignment , Copp waived a probable - cause hearing and his case was sent to Ottawa County Circuit Court for trial .
He is accused of selling 3.3 grams of marijuana to an undercover officer for $ 60 hours before the March 11 raid at his Campus View apartment .

His roommate , Conor Bardallis , 21 , also charged with delivery of marijuana , is accused of selling 3 grams of pot to an undercover officer in February for $ 50 .
Bardallis , already arraigned , has a pretrial conference on Friday , and is free after posting 10 percent of a $ 3,000 bond .
Post said Copp could be released after posting 10 percent of a $ 3,000 bond .
His father was waiting for a bank to open this morning to obtain the cash .
The felony charge carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison .
The defendants were under investigation by the West Michigan Enforcement Team , or WEMET , a consortium of police officers from Ottawa , Allegan and Muskegon counties .
Copp was shot in the upper chest as police executed a search warrant at his Georgetown Township apartment , just off the GVSU campus .
Ottawa County sheriff 's Deputy Ryan Huizenga has been charged with careless discharge of a firearm causing injury , a two - year , high - court misdemeanor , and is on desk duty at the Sheriff 's Department while administrators conduct an internal review and the criminal case plays out .
His probable - cause hearing , originally set for Wednesday , is expected to be adjourned until early May .
The shooting has sparked protests by GVSU students and others , and raised questions about police tactics in what Copp 's supporters call a minor marijuana case .
His supporters were disappointed that Copp faced charges .
Huizenga , 37 , a 12 - year deputy , has gained support in the community , with nearly 300 people attending a recent rally at the Sheriff 's Department headquarters in West Olive .
One of Copp 's attorneys , Fred Dilley , has said that police found only " a few tablespoons " of marijuana inside the apartment .
In obtaining arrest warrants , state police Lt. Cam Henke , in charge of the drug team , did not mention whether drugs were found in the search .
Copp is originally from Spring Arbor .
Bardallis , from Parma in Jackson County , is a senior majoring in professional writing and an honor student , his friends say .
Copp was shot when he raised his hands to shield his eyes from police flashlights , police said .
Investigators say Huizenga had his finger inside the trigger guard , instead of outside , when his .40 - caliber Glock fired .

This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
I ’ve come to prefer a point - buy system for attributes in D&D 3.x and PathfinderRPG , pretty much lifted directly from Mike Mearls ’ revised edition of the D20 / OGL Iron Heroes game originally developed by Monte Cook — yes , that Monte Cook .
I ’m rethinking that , though , in favor of a point - buy system using an actually different means of representing the attributes themselves .
The new system is essentially a drop - in replacement for the standard D20 / OGL system , without any need to alter anything else in the core rules to use this new system other than how attribute bonuses and penalties ( by race or level progression ) are assessed .
Problems :
The reason I ’m considering using this modified attribute system is that the Iron Heroes point - buy system does n’t solve a big problem I ’ve had with D20 / OGL attributes all along ( as well as attributes in several other systems , including OD&D ) : some attributes are basically “ dead air ” .
That is to say ( using D20 / OGL as the example ) that , for instance , increasing your Strength from 11 to 12 gives you a + 1 to attack and damage rolls , but increasing it from 12 to 13 does n’t give you anything in - game .
This causes some minor problems such as skewing the motivations for players to buy up to certain attribute numbers as they get their bonus attribute points with level advancement .
It changes strategies for character advancement , and even the roleplayers most dedicated to the craft of non-metagaming character development must feel tempted at times to increase one stat rather than another simply because of the stat modifier effects .
Solutions :
I ’ve recently become increasingly interested in taking an alternative approach to attribute numbers .
Instead of 3 -18 attributes with modifiers based on the attribute , I could use the modifiers themselves as the attribute numbers , rather than using numbers between three and eighteen as intermediaries between character creation and in - game effects of attributes .
I think this works particularly well for games that use a point - buy system for character creation .
In the following table , there are three columns : the first , “ Score ” , is the attribute score for the new system ; the second , “ Cost ” , is the cost of purchasing the attribute score at character creation using the point buy system ; the third , “ Correspondence ” , shows the equivalent 3 - 18 scores ( actually 1 - 20 ) for standard OGL 3.5 and Pathfinder RPG rules .
This chart works not only for giving you an idea of what each modifier - style attribute score means , and for determining the point - buy cost of each score , but also as a means of determining attributes based on a randomized dice - roll character creation system ; if you want to roll for your stats , just roll like usual , and just translate from the number in the Correspondence column to the modifier in the Score column ( which , in case I have n’t made it obvious , is equal to the attribute modifier for each number in the Correspondence column according to official D20 / OGL rules anyway ) .
Score Cost Correspondence - 5 - 21 01 - 4 - 12 02 to 03 - 3 -06 04 to 05 - 2 -03 06 to 07 - 1 -01 08 to 09 +0 +00 10 to 11 +1 +02 12 to 13 +2 +04 14 to 15 +3 +07 16 to 17 +4 +13 18 to 19 +5 +25 20
Origins :
Now that I ’ve explained it all in terms of how you get from a traditional 3 - 18 D&D attribute system to this modifier - as - score system , I ’ll let you in on a secret : that ’s not really how I ended up considering this as an alternative system .
It really started with a “ Modern Horror Genre ” roleplaying game a friend and I cooked up a couple decades ago for our own use , shortly before the first edition of the White Wolf Vampire : the Masquerade game came out , that we called Inner Sanctum .
That system used a random dice roll system to generate attributes that were modifiers rather than numbers that translated to modifiers .
Stats were generated using 2d6 - 7 to produce values between - 5 and +5 .
More recently , as I mentioned in passing in How do you feel about energy resistance ? , I ’ve been working on the design of another original roleplaying game .
Its working title is currently Apotheosis RPG , though that ’s subject to change .
Inspired by my own previous work on Inner Sanctum , I decided to go with a basic - 5 to +5 system for attributes .
I was also inspired , to some degree , by the desire to avoid the problems of the traditional 3 - 18 system , as well as those of GURPS ’ approach of rolling against the attribute numbers themselves as a kind of difficulty target .
By default , I ’m looking at a point - buy system for determining attribute scores in ARPG , and the numbers above that match up with the ultimate effects of using the Iron Heroes point - buy system for values from 3 - 18 are numbers I was considering using , though I wo n’t settle on anything for sure until I know more about how the rest of the system will fit together ( of course ) .
The above table is , in essence , the result of me directly porting the working system for ARPG to Pathfinder RPG ( or , in effect , D20 / OGL ) , with the addition of the Correspondence column to give a quick point of reference for making transition from the traditional 3 - 18 system to using modifiers as attribute scores .
Changes :
All in all , it ’s not a really dramatic change .
Things are basically the same as they ever were with a D20 / OGL compatible system , other than notation .
The minor changes , in practice , involve only adjusting attribute bonus and penalty points and skipping all the annoying “ some attribute points do n’t really matter ” stuff .
The first part of changing the way attribute score bonuses and penalties are handled is dead easy .
In both the D20 3.5 system and the Pathfinder RPG system , all race - based bonuses and penalties come in twos .
Divide the numbers by two , so that a + 2 becomes a +1 and a - 2 becomes a - 1 , and you ’re golden .
The second part , which consists of dealing with attribute bonuses as a character advances in level , is a little less obvious .
In the default system for D20 / OGL compatible games including both D&D 3.5 and Pathfinder RPG , a single discretionary point of attribute score bonus is acquired at every level divisible by four .
It may seem arithmetically obvious that those points should just be divided by two as well , but that results in no attribute score increases except at 8th and 16th levels .
Another option might be to split the difference , going with a bonus point every level divisble by six ( 6th , 12th , and 18th levels ) .
I think a better option would be to divide by two , but round up , giving a bonus point at 4th , 12th , and 20th levels .
edit :
As John points out in the first comment response to this SOB entry , spells and similar effects that temporarily alter attribute scores might also need some conversion , which is a fact I managed to completely fail to notice when I first wrote this .
That complicates things significantly for me , if I want to explain all the necessary changes , but I think that for the most part such conversions should be very easy for GMs to sort out on a case - by - case basis .
John also suggests just going with a + 1 discretionary attribute score bonus every four levels , exactly as in the standard character progression charts , even though the ( theoretical ) arithmetic effect in attribute bonuses is doubled .
The argument is that the effect in play is not the same as the effect on the attribute modifiers themselves , which is true .
Still , it changes the rate of attribute advancement , so I ’m reluctant to just jump off the ledge on this one .
Opinions :
I think that about covers it .
Have I forgotten anything ?
What you do you think of the idea ?
Is there anything I should do differently ?
Controversy has erupted at UC Santa Barbara over a professor ’s decision to send his students an e-mail in which he compared graphic images of Jews in the Holocaust to pictures of Palestinians caught up in Israel ’s recent Gaza offensive .
The e-mail by tenured sociology professor William I. Robinson has triggered a campus investigation and drawn accusations of anti-Semitism from two national Jewish groups , even as many students and faculty members have voiced support for him .
The uproar began in January when Robinson sent his message -- titled “ parallel images of Nazis and Israelis ” -- to the 80 students in his sociology of globalization class .
The e-mail contained more than two dozen photographs of Jewish victims of the Nazis , including those of dead children , juxtaposed with nearly identical images from the Gaza Strip .
It also included an article critical of Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians and a note from Robinson .

“ Gaza is Israel ’s Warsaw -- a vast concentration camp that confined and blockaded Palestinians , ” the professor wrote .
“ We are witness to a slow - motion process of genocide . ”
Two Jewish students dropped the class , saying they felt intimidated by the professor ’s message .
They contacted the Simon Wiesenthal Center , which advised them to file formal complaints with the university .
In their letters , senior Rebecca Joseph and junior Tova Hausman accused Robinson of violating the campus ’ faculty code of conduct by disseminating personal , political material unrelated to his course .
“ I was shocked , ” said Joseph , 22 .
“ He overstepped his boundaries as a professor .
He has his own freedom of speech , but he does n’t have the freedom to send his students his own opinion that is so strong . ”

Robinson , 50 , who is Jewish , called the accusations and the campus investigation an attack on academic freedom .
He said his former students , the Wiesenthal Center and the Anti-Defamation League had all confused his criticism of Israeli policies with anti-Semitism .
“ That ’s like saying if I condemn the U.S. government for the invasion of Iraq , I ’m anti-American , ” he said .
“ It ’s the most absurd , baseless argument . ”
Robinson said he regularly sends his students voluntary reading material about current events for the global affairs course , and that no one raised questions when he subsequently discussed his e-mail .
“ The whole nature of academic freedom is to introduce students to controversial material , to provoke students to think and make students uncomfortable , ” said Robinson , a UC Santa Barbara professor for nine years .

As the dispute over his e-mail plays out , UC Santa Barbara has become the most recent U.S. university to confront campus unrest over issues related to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
In recent years , Jewish and Muslim groups have quarreled repeatedly at UC Irvine about the Holocaust and Israeli policies toward the Palestinians .
Professors and students at Columbia University have also argued over issues of intimidation and academic freedom amid debates on the Mideast .
In Robinson ’s case , reaction has been strong -- on both sides .
Shortly after hearing from the two students in January , the Wiesenthal Center produced a YouTube video titled “ Jewish Students Under Siege from Professor at UC Santa Barbara . ”
The clip shows one of Robinson ’s former students , her face obscured to protect her identity , reading from his e-mail .

The head of the ADL ’s Santa Barbara region sent Robinson a letter in February calling on him to repudiate his statements about Israel .
Last month , the ADL ’s national director , Abraham Foxman , in a meeting with faculty members at the campus , urged the university to conduct an investigation into Robinson .
He was told that an inquiry was already underway .
“ You can criticize Israel ; you can criticize the war in Gaza , ” Foxman said .
“ But to compare what the Israelis are doing in defense of their citizens to what the Nazis did to the Jews is clearly anti-Semitism . ”
Robinson ’s supporters say the professor is being maligned for exercising his right to challenge his students to think critically about the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Students on campus have formed a group , the Committee to Defend Academic Freedom at UCSB , which is chronicling the saga on its website .

Letters of support also have arrived from academics across the country , including one from California Scholars for Academic Freedom , which says it represents 100 professors at 20 college campuses .
The group argues that the allegations have been raised against Robinson to “ silence criticism of Israeli policies and practices . ”
Some UC Santa Barbara faculty members also are speaking up for Robinson .
History professor Harold Marcuse , who attended the March meeting with the ADL ’s Foxman , said the pictures e-mailed by Robinson were “ well within the bounds of appropriateness on campus .
It ’s something I could have used in a course . ”
Marcuse , who is Jewish and teaches about the Holocaust in his world history and German history classes , said he would not have injected his own views into such a message to students , but added : “ I do n’t think Bill Robinson ’s e-mail is anti-Semitic in any way .
I think criticism of Israel is OK . ”
One UC Santa Barbara official has already looked into the allegations against Robinson , and a faculty committee is being formed to decide whether to forward the case to UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Henry Yang .
A university spokesman declined to comment on the case .

Robinson has hired an attorney , and the student committee supporting him has scheduled a May 14 campus forum on the matter .
Joseph and Hausman , the students who filed the original complaints , said they plan to attend .
So do Hausman ’s parents from Los Angeles and Rabbi Aron Hier , director of campus outreach for the Wiesenthal Center .
“ I just want to bring awareness , ” said Hausman , 20 .
“ I want people to know that educators should n’t be sending out something that is so disturbing . ”

When Bindu Reddy , one half of the two member team behind the just launched Likaholix ( a recommendation engine and social platform for likes ) reached out to us about her new initiative , we were intrigued by the fact that her and her partner are two ex-Googlers who seem to be heading down the same path as many other ex-Googlers : launching social software of some kind .
We 've certainly noticed that former Google employees tend to attach themselves to overly social products like FriendFeed and Plinky .
With this in mind , we asked Reddy to elaborate on this growing trend and talk about the motivations behind Likaholix .
Why Googlers Are Leaving
So , why are Googlers leaving the search behemoth ?
For one , growing pains in community building initiatives .
Reddy believes that " Google product managers are top class and have great innovative ideas for community sites and they are a bit frustrated that they can't realize their vision in Google , which is why a lot of them quit to follow their dreams . "
In her opinion , the reason former Googlers focus on community - oriented is because they , " know that it is very difficult to take on Google on a pure technology play , " and , " when it comes to community based sites , Google does n't do all that well .
Google 's infrastructure , most of it built in - house , makes it really difficult to iterate rapidly .
Google Video , a product that I worked on comes to mind .
Part of the reason Google Video failed miserably against You Tube was that the team could n't iterate rapidly and build some of the community and upload features as rapidly as they wanted .
Youtube , at that time a small start - up was able to build and release a lot of features quickly . "
Infrastructure Works For and Against Google
According to Reddy , " Most Google infrastructure is based on the original search thinking that scaling is done by using lots of cheap hardware using software layers to protect against machine failures .
While this works really well for certain problem classes , there is a " scalability and complexity tax " which most new services pay in terms of development speed , even though they do n't need it in the initial phases . "
The reason she sees more opportunity with Likaholix is because Google can't always leverage open source tools due to infrastructure limitations , where Likaholix can " leverage as many open source tools as possible , " admitting that they " could not have made this much progress over the last 7 months or so in terms of product , UI and engineering if we were to build this at Google . "
Reddy does admit , however , that Likaholix 's less complex infrastructure is not poised to compete with Google's .
" Google would never have any load / traffic issues .
They are always built to scale .
In contrast Likaholix has been slow when we have experienced high load / traffic today , " she said .
When asked if Google should be worried about any one particular competitor in the social sphere , Reddy stated without hesitation — Facebook .
" It is soon becoming the identity and communication platform for the web ( people are beginning to spend more time here than on Google services ) " and Twitter , which " s becoming the goto destination for real time search , " she added .
From Google to Likaholix
Likaholix is a community - focused site that does one thing really well — likes .
There 's certainly an element of social awareness to Likaholix that you 're not likely to find in most Google products .
So even though Likaholix has the feel of a destination site , it 's also creating logical extensions to onsite liking and commenting .
Users can share their likes with Facebook , Twitter , and FriendFeed , import existing reviews from both Yelp and Amazon , as well as grab the bookmarklet for instant liking while browsing .
The site strays from FriendFeed by trying to focus on all things you like , instead of just news , to include people , activities , products , restaurants , and the like .
The end game being users turning to Likaholix first when they searching for something to watch or buy , or some place to go .
Likaholix does have familiar elements of early stage Google beta products , so users can expect a spartan design ( for the time being ) , and smart search functionality .
Reddy and Sundararajan are also replicating a Gmail ( you need an invite to join at first ) and Grand Central - like user growth strategy , so after our 200 invites are used up , you probably wo n't be able to access the site until you receive an invite from a friend .
The idea being that users will take advantage of their 10 invites and the site will grow via word of mouth , and the focus will remain on sharing likes with real friends .

SAN JOSE , Calif . ( AP )  Public school employees throughout California are being warned of extensive job cuts as local officials face a deadline for issuing layoff notices to educators .
The State Department of Education estimates that preliminary notices will be given to 26,500 teachers by the Sunday cutoff .
An additional 15,000 bus drivers , janitors , secretaries and administrators are also expected to receive the written warnings .
Because of the bleak economic outlook , the state has ordered local school districts to absorb more than $ 8 billion in cuts over the next year .
Many , if not most , of the early layoff notices could be withdrawn by June , officials said .
The phrases deep space , zero gravity and computer virus may all sound like they originated in science but , according to the Hugo prize - winning author Jeff Prucher , they were first used by science fiction writers .
The first known use of the term " zero gravity " - a defining feature of life in outer space - is from Jack Binder in 1938 , said Prucher .
" Starting at the zero - gravity of earth 's core , accumulative acceleration is easily built up in a four - thousand - mile tube , " Binder , who achieved greater fame for his work as an artist , wrote in a short story over 70 years ago .
Arthur C Clarke coined the phrase " zero - g " in Islands in the Sky , Prucher added .
This 1952 novel by the prolific Clarke , author of 2001 : A Space Odyssey , sees a man wins a trip to a space station 500 miles from earth .
Deep space , said Prucher , appears to have been coined by EE " Doc " Smith , a chemical engineer who became the father of the space opera genre , in 1934 .
" Bradley swore a mighty deep - space oath and braced himself against certain annihilation , " wrote Smith in his novel Triplanetary .
" One of the other defining features of outer space is its essential emptiness .
In science fiction , this phrase most commonly refers to a region of empty space between stars or that is remote from the home world , " said Prucher .
" The more common use in the sciences refers to the region of space outside of the Earth 's atmosphere . "
The " fertile mind " of EE Smith also gave us the concept of a pressure suit , Prucher went on , " a suit that maintains a stable pressure around its occupant ; useful in both space exploration and high - altitude flights " .
Curiously , the author said , Smith 's pressure suits were furred , " an innovation not , alas , replicated by NASA " .
Gas giant , said Prucher , referring to a large planet such as Jupiter which is composed mainly of gaseous material , was first used by James Blish in the short story Solar Plexus .
" A quick glance over the boards revealed that there was a magnetic field of some strength near by , one that did n't belong to the invisible gas giant revolving half a million miles away , " wrote Blish .
" The odd thing about it is that it was first used in a reprint of the story [ in 1952 ] , 11 years after the story was first published , " said Prucher .
" Whether this is because Blish conceived of the term in the intervening years or read it somewhere else , or whether it was in the original manuscript and got edited out is impossible to say at this point . "
Spaceships started using ion drives , which move the craft forwards by emitting charged particles in the opposite direction to travel , in the 1970s , but the term is first thought to have been used in Jack Williamson 's The Equalizer in 1947 , said Prucher .
" It had its own ion drive , a regular crew of six , and plenty of additional space for our party , " runs Williamson 's novel .
The verbal analogy between biological viruses and self - replicating computer programmes was first made by Dave Gerrold in his 1972 story When Harlie Was One , about a computer ( the acronym stands for Human Analog Robot Life Input Equivalents ) which believes it is human .
Prucher , a freelance lexicographer who won best related book at last year 's Hugos for his dictionary of science fiction Brave New Words , picked out the phrases in an article for Oxford University Press .
He ran into some bother over his crediting of the term genetic engineering to Jack Williamson 's 1941 novel Dragon Island with one critic pointing out that Williamson has admitted that " some scientist beat me by a couple of years " .
" Thanks for pointing that out , " Prucher replied to his critic .
" Add it to the list of Words You Might Think Came from Science Fiction but Actually Came from Science . "
The administration is seeking additional power to seize firms involved in the financial problems .
Which is fine -- so long as their plan for dealing with these firms does n't encourage more mergers and buyouts like JP Morgan / Bear Stearns or Whoever / Wachovia .
Because , despite the Bush administration defending these mergers as " necessary to preserve the free market , " they 're neither necessary nor " free . "
In fact , the last round of buyouts came with with special breaks instituted by then Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , who rescinded a 1986 rule and provided an estimated $ 140 billion in tax breaks to grease the skids for mergers .
In some cases , the government did more than make it easier for financial institutions to merge .
In some cases it played Shadchan for reluctant partners , in others ( as with Wachovia ) it drove institutions to marry at the point of a fiscal shotgun .
So banks that were too big to fail became bigger financial institutions that ( like Citigroup ) required billions more to keep afloat .
Let 's wind back the clock a bit .
Remember Smith - Barney , the brokerage that used the slogan " we make money the old fashioned way -- we earn it ? " ( you can bet no one on Wall Street is using that motto today )
In the 1980s , Smith - Barney was already part of an insurance / brokerage mash - up called Primerica .
Then Primerica was bought by Commercial Credit , which merged with Travelers Insurance , which bought the brokerage firm Solomon Brothers , which merged with Citicorp to form Citigroup .
Fun fact : this was all pre-1999 , when the Glass - Stegall Act was still in full effect , meaning that several of these mergers were probably illegal .
But instead of enforcing the existing law , Congress chose to pass Gramm - Leach - Bliley , pasting a retroactive smiley face over these mergers and clearing the way for more in the future .
So instead of several smaller companies , we ended up with one behemoth which has collected $ 45 billion in bailout bucks , in addition to billions more in tax breaks -- $ 10 million of which is going to spruce up executive 's offices .
But why should we be surprised by that , or by the bonuses handed out in AIG ?
When we gripe about these companies that have become " too big to fail , " what we really mean is that they have become too big to be dictated to .
They have been provided with such fiscal leverage , such control of the system , that they are too big for the United States government to control .
This is a problem whose coming was welcomed by many conservatives , who have long lived in a Rand - ian dream world where business size is equated to moral worth -- and feared by everyone else at least as far back as Teddy Roosevelt .
Theodore Roosevelt actually liked big business .
He thought that the growth of big business was very healthy , that most of the businesses got there because they were efficient and the businessmen were doing their jobs right .
But two things bothered him .
...
One was just that idea that they were overshadowing the government , that some of these tycoons , such as J. P. Morgan , could presume that they were sovereign equals of the U.S. government .
For example , when the first big anti-trust suit under Roosevelt was brought , which was against Morgan 's railroad combine , Morgan said , " Send your man to see my man and tell him to fix it up . "
Roosevelt 's answer to that was , " That can not be done .
Nobody treats as a sovereign equal to -- of the President .
No company can presume to be -- no private interest can presume to be equal to the government .
The government must be superior to all of these . "
Market fundamentalists may cheer at the idea of government being bossed about by business forces , since they 've long held disdain for government and awe of the most ruthless business mogols .
They 'll defend elevating business above government as " freedom " while ignoring the fact that it 's enormously undemocratic .
If we get anything out of living through the Great Bushwhack , let 's hope it's a new understanding that the market fundamentalists are simply anti-American nuts .
From its beginning , the " American compromise " has represented an understanding that business be regulated by government for the betterment of both the market and the people .
Teddy did n't mince words when it came to restating this as a central , and often neglected , role of the government .
Of course there are many sincere men who now believe in unrestricted individualism in business , just as there were formerly many sincere men who believed in slavery -- that is , in the unrestricted right of an individual to own another individual .
...
The proposal to make the National Government supreme over , and therefore to give it complete control over , the railroads and other instruments of interstate commerce is merely a proposal to carry out to the letter one of the prime purposes , if not the prime purpose , for which the Constitution was founded .
When it comes to " too big to fail , " the solution now as the same as it was a century ago : chop them up .
That means not waiting until a company has an effective monopoly on the market before applying anti-trust laws .
It means applying those laws when a company reaches the size where it deforms the market , bullies its competitors , and when the prospect of its failure is so frightening that we cushion its fall with billions in taxpayer assistance .
It means applying those rules to AIG and Citigroup and others like them long before now .
So give the administration the authority to seize the companies at the heart of the financial meltdown .
Not to let them " fail gracefully . "
Not to force them into more corporate marriages .
Not to prop them up with more billions in government investment .
Seize them , then slice them , dice them ... heck , use them to make julienne fries ( whatever those are ) .
The truth is that many of these corporate monsters are much less efficient as giants stitched together by the egos of their officers , than they were as separate entities .
Chop 'em up .
Then put back reasonable restrictions on the merger of financial institutions so that this does n't happen again .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - American workers were hammered again in March with large job losses , pushing the total number of jobs lost since the recession began to 5.1 million , the Labor Department reported Friday .
U.S. nonfarm payrolls fell by 663,000 in March , close to expectations , while the unemployment rate jumped to a 26 - year high 8.5 % from 8.1 % , as expected .
" This recession is far from over , " wrote David Rosenberg and Sheryl King , economists for Bank of America 's Merrill Lynch .
" There is nothing in this report that points to economic recovery , " said economists at RDQ Economics .
Details of the report confirm that the U.S. economy likely contracted violently again in the first quarter .
Economists believe gross domestic product likely fell at a 5.5 % annual pace after a 6.3 % decline in the last three months of 2008 .
However , the dismal employment report also comes just as some " green shoots " of incipient growth have surfaced in more forward - looking economic indicators , such as consumer spending , building permits , factory orders , stock prices and consumer expectations .
The labor market has n't yet shown any signs of improvement .
Leading employment indicators -- such as jobless claims or the number of temporary workers -- have worsened in recent months .
Typically , payrolls are considered a coincident indicator of the economy , while the unemployment rate is a lagging indicator , turning up after everything else improves .
" It appears that the jobless rate will continue to rise at a rapid clip over the next few months and should breach 10 % sometime in the second half of 2009 , " wrote David Greenlaw and Ted Wieseman , economists at Morgan Stanley .
Details of the report were almost universally grim .
Payrolls in previous months were revised lower by a total of 86,000 .
January 's revised job loss of 741,000 was the worst since 1949 .
In February , 651,000 jobs were lost .
Read the full government report .
In the past six months , 3.7 million jobs have been destroyed , or 2.7 % of payrolls , the second - largest percentage loss in 50 years .
Total hours worked in the economy fell by 1 % .
The average workweek fell by 6 minutes to a record - low 33.2 hours .
" Businesses are girding for a long siege -- slashing employment and dividends , " wrote Peter Morici , a business professor at the University of Maryland .
" They are preparing for a depression and the eclipse of American leadership . "
Job losses were widespread across industries in March .
Among major sectors , only health care added jobs , but the increase of 14,000 was about half the average gain over the past six months .
According to a survey of hundreds of thousands of work sites , goods - producing industries shed 305,000 jobs , and the services industries cut 358,000 .
Of 271 industries , just 22 % were hiring in March .
Manufacturing industries cut 126,000 workers .
Hours worked in manufacturing fell by 2.1 % .
Construction cut 161,000 jobs .
The unemployment rate for construction workers rose to 22.3 % .
In the services , professional and business services cut 133,000 jobs , including 72,000 temp jobs .
Retail companies cut 48,000 jobs .
Financial services cut 43,000 jobs .
Transportation industries lost 34,000 .
The separate survey of households showed employment dropped by 861,000 , with unemployment rising by 694,000 to 13.2 million .
The employment - population ratio dropped to 59.9 % , the lowest rate since 1985 .
A separate gauge of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and workers who can find only part - time work rose to a record 15.6 % , with data reached back to 1994 .
The number of workers who want full - time work but can only find part - time jobs rose by 423,000 to 9 million in March .
Since the recession began , involuntary part - time workers have increased by 4.4 million .
About a quarter of the 13.2 million officially unemployed have been out of work longer than six months , the highest percentage since 1983 .
And just the other day , it seems , China ’s leaders woke up and realized that they had a problem .
The low yield does n’t seem to bother them much , even now .
But they are , apparently , worried about the fact that around 70 percent of those assets are dollar - denominated , so any future fall in the dollar would mean a big capital loss for China .
Hence Mr. Zhou ’s proposal to move to a new reserve currency along the lines of the S.D.R. ’s , or special drawing rights , in which the International Monetary Fund keeps its accounts .
But there ’s both less and more here than meets the eye .
S.D.R.’s are n’t real money .
They ’re accounting units whose value is set by a basket of dollars , euros , Japanese yen and British pounds .
And there ’s nothing to keep China from diversifying its reserves away from the dollar , indeed from holding a reserve basket matching the composition of the S.D.R. ’s  nothing , that is , except for the fact that China now owns so many dollars that it ca n’t sell them off without driving the dollar down and triggering the very capital loss its leaders fear .
So what Mr. Zhou ’s proposal actually amounts to is a plea that someone rescue China from the consequences of its own investment mistakes .
That ’s not going to happen .
And the call for some magical solution to the problem of China ’s excess of dollars suggests something else : that China ’s leaders have n’t come to grips with the fact that the rules of the game have changed in a fundamental way .
Two years ago , we lived in a world in which China could save much more than it invested and dispose of the excess savings in America .
That world is gone .
Yet the day after his new - reserve - currency speech , Mr. Zhou gave another speech in which he seemed to assert that China ’s extremely high savings rate is immutable , a result of Confucianism , which values “ anti-extravagance . ”
Meanwhile , “ it is not the right time ” for the United States to save more .
In other words , let ’s go on as we were .
That ’s also not going to happen .
The bottom line is that China has n’t yet faced up to the wrenching changes that will be needed to deal with this global crisis .
The same could , of course , be said of the Japanese , the Europeans  and us .
And that failure to face up to new realities is the main reason that , despite some glimmers of good news  the G - 20 summit accomplished more than I thought it would  this crisis probably still has years to run .
T
he inaugural class of our Stand - Up Comics Hall of Fame made room for comedians both family - friendly ( Bill Cosby ) and blue ( Lenny Bruce , Richard Pryor ) -- and if something ain't broke , there 's no reason to fix it , so for this year 's class we followed the same formula .
Though each of our new Hall of Fame members has achieved major commercial success -- and each of them arguably redefined comedy for his era -- they each took different steps to get there .
With Bob Newhart , you get mild - mannered dry wit ; with Steve Martin , joyous absurdity .
Eddie Murphy , of course , brings hilariously lewd humor to the table .
And Sam Kinison ?
Well , he was just nuts .
It 's a varied list , and we think you 'll agree that everyone in this year 's class is more than deserving of the honor .

Australian authorities are racing to save dozens of pilot whales and a small pod of dolphins beached on an island .
The mammals have stranded themselves on King Island , in the Bass Strait between the mainland and the southern state of Tasmania .
Reports say about 140 out of nearly 200 whales have already died .
More than 400 whales have died in Tasmanian waters in recent months , in a phenomenon for which scientists still have no definitive explanation .
The 194 pilot whales and half a dozen bottlenose dolphins became stranded on Naracoopa Beach on King Island on Sunday evening .
Chris Arthur , of Tasmania 's Parks and Wildlife Service , told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that 54 whales and seven dolphins were still alive .
" It 's amazing , some will die straight away , some will survive for days , " he said .
" These are fairly robust animals , pilot whales , we experienced that in the past .
While they 're alive there is a chance , " he said .
Local residents joined rescuers in trying to keep the animals wet and finding ways to move them out to open water .
More than 100 King Island residents have volunteered to help the efforts .
More than 150 pilot whales died after beaching themselves on Tasmania 's remote west coast in November and 48 sperm whales died in January on a sandbar off Perkins Island .
Mass strandings of whales occur periodically in Australia and New Zealand , as the whales migrate to and from Antarctic waters , for reasons that are not entirely understood .
Theories include disturbance of echo- location , possibly by interference from sound produced by human activities at sea .
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- U.S. envoy George Mitchell was in Israel on Thursday for his first visit since right - wing politician Benjamin Netanyahu became prime minister .
U.S. envoy George Mitchell , right , meets Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman on Thursday in Jerusalem .
It is Mitchell 's third visit to the region since President Obama appointed him as special envoy for Middle East peace .
Mitchell plans to meet with Netanyahu and other Israeli politicians Thursday , as well as Palestinian leaders -- including President Mahmoud Abbas -- in the West Bank and Jerusalem on Friday .
The former senator and seasoned diplomat has not been shy in articulating the U.S. desire to see a two - state solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , which has led to speculation that the new Israeli government and the Obama administration may find themselves on a collision course .
Netanyahu has indicated he wants serious negotiations with the Palestinians to continue , but he has not explicitly stated his support for Palestinian statehood .
Questions about the new Israeli government 's commitment to a negotiated peace process came up when the new foreign minister , nationalist politician Avigdor Lieberman , declared the Annapolis process " null and void . "
The Annapolis process , launched by the Bush administration in 2007 , paved the way for the resumption of Israeli and Palestinian talks after they stopped earlier in the decade .
After meeting Lieberman on Thursday morning , Mitchell said he had reiterated the U.S. stance .
" U.S. policy favors , with respect to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , a two - state solution which would have a Palestinian state living in peace alongside the Jewish state of Israel , " Mitchell said .
" We look forward also to efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace throughout the region . "
Lieberman said the two men had a " great opportunity to exchange some ideas " and spoke about close cooperation .
" We spoke to coordinate our position regarding the Palestinian issue , regarding the area problems , " he said .
" We are looking forward to the next meeting for some really deep dialogue about security , about economy , about all problems in the entire region . "
The Israeli foreign minister said Israel will do everything necessary to improve the Palestinians ' economic situation .
But in a statement after his meeting with Mitchell , he emphasized that Israel expects an " unequivocal commitment " from the international community to Israel 's security and to the Jewish state .
Mitchell met Wednesday night with Defense Minister Ehud Barak , who told the U.S. envoy that the countries ' bilateral relationship is " deep and close . "
" It is possible to reach cooperation and understanding on all issues that are on the table , " said Barak .
The issue of Iran and its nuclear program was also a topic Thursday .
After Mitchell met with Israeli President Shimon Peres , the president said he emphasized dialogue on the issue .
" It is our common interest that dialogue with Iran will expose if there is an opportunity with Iran or is it all a hoax , " Peres said .
" We all want a world that is clean of nuclear bombs , but the problem is that those holding the bombs are religious fanatics , extremists , that do not cringe from all methods of killing .
" We need to create a wide international cooperation regarding the matter of Iran , " he said .
" All this talk about a possible attack by Israel in Iran are not true .
The solution to Iran is not a military solution . "
Lieberman said the subject of Iran is a " major problem " for Israel and the whole region .
" If you are looking for a stable solution to the Palestinian problem , before everything else you have [ to ] stop the intensification and the spreading of the Iranian threat , " Lieberman said in his statement .
CNN Jerusalem Bureau Chief Kevin Flower contributed to this report .

Controlling Robots With Your Brain Closer Than You Think
Be careful what you wish for because your new robot just might hear you and carry out that wish whether you want it done or not !
Honda ’s amazing new technology connects thoughts inside a brain with robotics and seems straight out of a weird sci - fi flick .
Better think carefully from now on .
Opening a car trunk or controlling a home air conditioner are specific , easy tasks that can now be accomplished with just the wish to do so .
Asimo , Honda ’s new human shaped robot can read wireless commands that are analyzed from thought patterns and emanate from the electric currents on a human scalp as well as changes in the cerebral blood flow .
These commands occur when the thought concerns any one of four movements .
These include : eating , moving the right hand , running and moving the left hand .
It is not surprising that this innovation should come from Japan , as it has one of the leading robotics industries in the world , but Honda was the first to admit that this technology , while well on its way , was still in a basic research stage because of possible distractions in the person ’s thinking and the diversity of brain patterns .
Research on the brain is being tackled around the world , but Honda claims to be far ahead of all the others when it comes to figuring out a way to read brain patterns without having to embed sensors into the skin .
“ I ’m talking about dreams today .
Practical uses are still way into the future .
Our products are for people to use .
It is important for us to understand human behavior .
We think this is the ultimate in making machines move , ” said Yasuhisa Arai , executive at Honda Research Institute .
Dreams of the heart , the kind Jiminy Cricket used to tell us occurred whenever we wished upon a star , those are still a bit harder to conjure on command .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Federal Reserve policy - makers , faced with bleaker forecasts for a rapidly worsening recession , decided to buy a “ substantial ” amount of U.S. Treasury and mortgage debt to halt the slide , minutes of their most recent meeting showed on Wednesday .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gives the closing address at the Credit Markets Symposium in Charlotte , North Carolina , April 3 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jason Miczek
Staff economists for the Federal Open Market Committee lowered projections for U.S. real gross domestic product in the second half of 2009 and 2010 , indicating a more gradual recovery .
However the minutes , which were from the central bank ’s March 17 - 18 meeting , did not offer any revised figures .
“ The deterioration in labor market conditions was rapid in recent months , with the steep job losses across nearly all sectors .
Industrial production continued to contract rapidly as firms responded to the falloff in demand and the build up of some inventory overhangs , ” the Fed said in the minutes .
The Fed had already given up on any growth in 2009 when it released its last quarterly forecasts in February , saying that the U.S. economy would shrink 0.5 percent to 1.3 percent for the year .
At that time , it anticipated a 2010 rebound to growth of 2.5 percent to 3.3 percent .
But the Fed staff forecasts indicated the GDP decline would flatten out gradually over the second half of 2009 and then turn to expansion “ slowly next year as the stresses in financial markets ease , the effects of fiscal stimulus take hold , inventory adjustments are worked through and the correction in housing activity comes to an end . ”
The revisions caused the Dow Jones industrial average to turn negative and other indexes to pare gains amid renewed worries about the health of the economy .
The dollar extended its drop against the yen , while longer - dated U.S. Treasury debt held onto price gains .
“ The assessment of the economy is very bad .
This is clearly a big problem that they are worried about , ” said Robert Brusca , chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics in New York , adding that he saw very little encouraging language .
The Fed minutes said FOMC members particularly noted a sharp fall in foreign activity that was reducing exports as a key development since their January meeting .
WHAT TO BUY ?
At the conclusion of the March 17 - 18 meeting , the Fed announced plans to buy up to $ 300 billion of longer - term U.S. Treasury securities and an additional $ 850 billion of agency mortgage debt to deal with the weak economic outlook .
It agreed to keep its benchmark federal funds rate in a zero to 0.25 percent range .
But there was some division among members over which securities to buy and the appropriate amount , given the expansion of the Fed ’s balance sheet through a new securities loan program .
“ One member preferred to focus on additional purchases on longer - term Treasury securities , whereas another member preferred to focus on agency MBS ( mortgage - backed securities ) .
However , both could support expanded purchases across a range of assets , and several members noted that working across a range of assets and instruments was appropriate when the effects of any one tactic were uncertain , ”
Fed policy - makers saw little chance of a pickup of inflation as rising unemployment and falling capacity utilizations were holding down wages and prices .
“ Several expressed concern that inflation was likely to persist below desired levels , with a few pointing out the risk of deflation , ” the minutes said .
RECOVERY TIMING UNCERTAIN
The Fed participants expressed a wide variety of views about the strength and timing of recovery , and did not interpret an uptick in housing starts as the beginning of a new trend , although there was only “ limited scope for housing to fall further . ”
They noted some signs of stabilization in consumer spending in January and February , but said the fear of unemployment could damp consumption growth in the near term .
FOMC members said they anticipated demand for funds from the Fed ’s new Term Asset - backed Securities Loan Facility would be modest initially , and some firms might be reluctant to borrow from TALF out of concern about potential future changes in the government ’s policies for financial rescues .
Some members also expressed concern about risks that expansion of the Term Asset - backed Securities Loan Facility would raise if it were expanded to include older and lower - quality assets .
The U.S. Treasury a few days later announced plans to expand the TALF to include older commercial and residential mortgage - backed securities as a way to help clear problem assets off bank balance sheets .
Thanks to music trade group IFPI , the recent Pirate Bay ruling has now been " Englished " ( PDF ) .
While the verdict itself is well - known , numerous case details will be surprising to non-Swedish speakers — such as who paid for The Pirate Bay defense , which defendant was also arraigned on drug charges , and what happened to all that Pirate Bay computer equipment confiscated by the police ?
A masterpiece of prose , the verdict is not .
" A number of different filesharing programs and technologies have been developed over the years , " says one representative section .
" There have been or are two main types of filesharing systems . "
But it does offer plenty of fascinating detail that was difficult for those not at the trial to learn .
Let 's take a look .
Confiscated equipment .
All the confiscated servers and routing equipment from a police raid on The Pirate Bay " is declared forfeit , " while other seized computers will remain confiscated " until the sentence has become legally binding . "
That process could take years , given the appeal already filed in the case , so by the time the equipment could be released , it will be obsolete .
Confiscated drugs .
In the section devoted to defendant ( and lover of wispy beards ) Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , we come across this curious section .
Not only were computers confiscated , but police picked up " three confiscated tablets of Klomifen , " " narcotic drugs , " and a " spoon containing traces of amphetamine . "
Image credit : Gottfrid Svartholm WargImage credit : Wikimedia Commons
Turns out that Warg was n't just accused of aiding copyright infringement but also of violating Sweden 's Prohibition of Certain Health - Impairing Goods Act .
As part of the 2006 police raids on The Pirate Bay , the cops searched an apartment belonging to Warg 's parents , where they found several of the listed items in " a drawer unit " and " a cupboard at the desk . "
Warg said that the apartment had been rented out to others at the time and that he had no knowledge of the drugs there ; the court agreed that nothing had been proven against him .
But there was a second incident in June 2007 , when a police patrol was called to an apartment and found Warg " heavily intoxicated . "
In his backpack , other " preparations " were found .
Warg told the court " that , despite being intoxicated , he can remember the event .
He has also stated that the backpack was his , but that he , at some point during the evening , had lent it to some individuals at the party .
He knows ' approximately ' who he lent the backpack to , but he does not want to reveal the names of these individuals . "
This did n't go over well with the court , which found " beyond reasonable doubt that Gottfrid Svartholm Warg has been in possession of the preparations in question , and that he should , therefore , be sentenced for breach of the Prohibition of Certain Health - Impairing Goods Act . "
Who paid for the lawyers ?
The older ( and much richer ) defendant Carl Lundstr ? m apparently paid for his own lawyer , but the three Pirate Bay admins did not .
Their lawyers were all supplied and eventually paid for by the Swedish government , and they were n't cheap .
Fredrik Neij 's lawyer , for instance , was given 949,025 kronor ( about $ 115,600 ) for his services ; 35,525 kronor of that amount was given for " time wasted . "
On moving to Argentina or Russia .
As it became clear that Sweden might not be the best long - term base for The Pirate Bay , Carl Lundstr ? m explored the possibility of moving the site to Russia or Argentina — and he asked the Swedish Embassy for help .
" A request by Carl Lundstr ? m to the Swedish Embassy in Argentina for assistance in relocating the operation there , since the situation vis a vis copyright in Argentina could be assumed to be more user - friendly than in Europe , was turned down by the Embassy , " says the verdict .
" Carl Lundstr ? m then contacted an Argentinean lawyer with the aim of ascertaining the cost of establishing the operation as a company in Argentina . "
Similar moves were made in Russia ; nothing appears to have come of them .
Legal advice .
Why the interest in getting out of Sweden ?
A new copyright law came into effect in 2005 , and Lundstr ? m worried that it would make the site illegal .
" Carl Lundstr ? m contacted a lawyer , " says the verdict .
" Following discussions with his legal representative , he e-mailed Gottfrid Svartholm Warg and mentioned that as of 1 July 2005 , the operation would be unlawful and that they should , therefore , consider relocating the operation to another country . "
In the meantime , Fredrik Neij sought some legal advice of his own .
Rather than pay a lawyer , though , he sought out the advice of a " law student who , in turn , checked with his teachers and professors . "
Based on advice from the student , Neij told the court that he believed The Pirate Bay was legal .
The Pirate Bay meets ...
TV ?
One other curious revelation was that Lundstr ? m had the idea back in 2006 " for new services in the form of a pooling of The Pirate Bay ’s website and a digital television receiver . "
Few details are offered , but this sounds a bit like a set - top box that could tune TV and also grab video content from The Pirate Bay .
As with many of the other schemes mentioned in the verdict , nothing came of this .
The Google defense .
During the trial , the defendants harped on the fact that Google also indexes . torrent files , many of them infringing ; why was a search engine like The Pirate Bay on trial while a search engine like Google was not ?
Here is the judge 's answer in its most condensed form : " In accordance with what will be further demonstrated below , all the defendants were aware that a large number of the website ’s users were engaged in the unlawful disposal of copyright - protected material .
By providing a website with advanced search functions and easy uploading and downloading facilities , and by putting individual filesharers in touch with one other through the tracker linked to the site , the operation run via The Pirate Bay has , in the opinion of the District Court , facilitated and , consequently , aided and abetted these offences . "
What happened to the " safe harbor " ?
US law offers immunity ( under both the Communications Decency Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ) to certain websites and ISPs for the actions of their users .
Europe 's " Electronic Commerce Act " contains a similar provision , but the judge found that The Pirate Bay did n't qualify .
Why not ?
Because the law requires that a service provider was " not aware of the existence of the illegal information or operation , and was not aware of facts or circumstances which made it obvious that the illegal information or operation existed or who , as soon as he received knowledge about or became aware of this , prevented the spread of the information without delay . "
Since they posted many of the takedown letters sent in by copyright owners , the admins certainly knew about all sorts of copyright infringement taking place on their site .
They did nothing about it and instead mocked the rightsholders .
" It must have been obvious to the defendants that the website contained torrent files which related to protected works , " said the court .
" None of them did , however , take any action to remove the torrent files in question , despite being urged to do so .
The prerequisites for freedom from liability under ?18 have , consequently , not been fulfilled . "
Translation : no immunity .
The end of the beginning
Despite the verdict , the case is just getting started .
Defense lawyers have already filed an appeal and have since accused the judge overseeing the case of a conflict of interest .
Judge Tomas Norstr ? m belongs to a couple of Swedish copyright associations , a fact no one managed to dig up before the trial .
While the court 's judgment sheds plenty of light on how The Pirate Bay operated and what its backers believe , the least relevant part of it may in fact be the legal reasoning .
Developing web applications using a static data store where data must be updated , stored and manipulated frequently can be a cumbersome task .
However this article will introduce you to the world of relational databases allowing you to maximise your data 's potential .
Introduction
With the constant expansion of web applications and user driven web sites it becomes a necessity to have a way to store data in an
organised fashion which can be retrieved and manipulated on the fly ; something which is impossible with static content .
In order to achieve this , a database must be used !
A database in its simplest form is the collecting of data in an organised fashion whether it is using a filing cabinet or a computerised database .
Integrating a database into your web site or web application allows you to store and retrieve data using specific commands .
For this article we will be using a relational database management system package called MySQL .
This is open - source software available under the GNU general public licence which of course makes it free of charge !
The MySQL web site can be found at http://www.mysql.com/
any word that you see underlined in this article indicates a MySQL function you can find full documentation on these functions on the MySQL web site .
TIP : To search the MySQL web site for a function , simply append the function name to the MySQL URL .
E.G .
http://www.mysql.com/SELECT
this example would search for select .
I have produced a modified version of Jesse Ruderman 's Google search bookmarklet in order to search the MySQL 5.1 documentation .
To use this simply highlight the underlined word then press the bookmarklet to be taken to the search results .
Alternatively launch the bookmarklet with nothing highlighted to be given a prompt box asking you to enter what you wish to search .

Understanding a database
In order to store data in a database firstly a database must be created .
This database can then store many tables ( imagine a filing cabinet storing many files ) ; each table must have defined columns , and of these columns are created to store specific data ( imagine a data entry form ) .
It is possible to limit what can be inputted into these such as numeric data or character limits for example .
Once data has been entered into the database it will be stored in an appropriate table , the table will then consist of rows and columns much like a spreadsheet as data is saved and displayed in a tabular form .
MySQL can manage multiple databases which can contain multiple tables .
Access levels can be granted to different users to provide or revoke specific privileges .
MySQL uses commands / functions based on SQL ( structured query language ) .
This allows us to use keywords to specify what data we wish to return .
MySQL then implements some additional features to enhance the functionality available .
Keywords are generally easy to understand and often relate to an English word or phrase ( E.G. SELECT , UPDATE , WHERE ) .
Getting Started
In this installment we will cover :
Installing MySQL on your local machine ( windows )
Configuring your local MySQL installation ( windows )
Connecting to your local database
Connecting to a remote database
Entering and formatting queries
Formatting and logging results
Backing up a database
Restoring a database
In order to use MySQL it is necessary for us to have it installed whether it be on our local system or on a remote web host .
However in order to connect to either we must firstly have an interface to use .
Today we will be using the essentials package which is available on the MySQL web site at http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/.
At the time of writing the current stable version is 5.1 and I will be discussing how to install it on the windows operating system .
Firstly locate the software which you require , I will be using the 64 bit windows version but you may choose otherwise depending on your system architecture .
For this article I have chosen to use the essentials package as it includes all the features needed .
You can compare the differences between the windows versions at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/windows-choosing-package.html.
Installing MySQL on your local machine
Once you have downloaded the appropriate installation executable , launch it and you will be prompted with the above window .
As you can see I am installing version 5.1.30 .
Press
Next to progress onto the next screen .
I have chosen to keep with the typical installation , however feel free to choose what components you want to install .
You will need the MySQL server and data files if you are working on your local machine ; however if you have a remote database available to you that you wish to use you can choose not to install these features .
You will need the MySQL command line shell as this is the application that we will be using .
Again if you are not using a local database you can skip the Command line utilities and server instance configuration .
This article will not cover using C with MySQL however if you are developing using C you may choose to install this .
Press
Next to progress onto the next screen .
You will be then asked to confirm your choices , press Install if you are happy otherwise press Back to make any changes .
Your installation will start , at this point you may get an interruption from an anti virus or Windows Vista User Account Control , it will state that a program is asking to be installed or access specific files .
This will be signed by MySQL AB ; this is the company which operates and maintains MySQL which you can read about at http://www.mysql.com/about/.
Once installed , make sure you have the Configure the MySQL Server now ( if installed ) ticked and press finish .
Congratulations , you have successfully installed MySQL Server / components .
Next the MySQL server Instance Configuration Wizard should load .
However if it does n't launch do n't worry , you can access it in the MySQL programs folder ( if installed ) .
Configuring your local MySQL installation
We are now going to configure your installation ( if you installed the server ) , press Next to progress onto the next screen .
You now have the option of using a standard configuration ; however I will be using a detailed configuration which will allow me to customise different aspects of my installation .
I have chosen this as a developer machine ; however you may choose which option you prefer .
The developer machine will allow full usage however it will prevent too many resources being used .
Press
Next to progress onto the next screen .
As this installation is intended for development purposes and not for a specific project , I chose a multifunctional database which allows use the InnoDB and MyISAM storage engine .
You can read more about storage engines at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/storage-engines.html.
Press
Next to progress onto the next screen .
You must now select where you want to store the InnoDB datafile , depending on storage space you have available you may wish to change this if you have a larger capacity or faster drive available .
Press
Next to progress onto the next screen .
You must now set up the amount of concurrent connections that you are going to have connecting to your database at any one time .
Choosing DSS allows up to 100 connections but assumes an average of 20 concurrent connections .
OLTP allows up to 500 concurrent connections .
However for our developer machine we are often only going to be making a single connection ; therefore I set the manual setting to 5 .
Press
Next to progress onto the next screen .
You now are given the choice to customise TCP / IP settings .
I have un -ticked the checkbox in order to disable this .
By disabling this it prevents remote connections to the database .
You can then set the server mode , I left this box ticked ( you can read more about server modes in detail at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-sql-mode.html).
Press
Next to progress onto the next screen .
We now need to select what character set / encoding we are going to be using .
I chose UTF8 as it allows different languages to be inputted ( international readers ) .
Press
Next to progress onto the next screen .
You now need to decide if you want to run the server as a service , you can customise the service name by the drop down box .
By installing MySQL as a service by default the server will be started automatically and will restart in even of failure .
I recommend using the setting above .
You also get the option to include the MySQL Bin files in the windows path .
This allows us to call MySQL directly from the command line , I also recommend doing this .
Press
Next to progress onto the next screen .
You now have to provide a password for the root account .
This is the ' master ' account with full privileges ( the account username will be ' root ' ) ; I do not recommend leaving this blank !
The choice to enable access from root machines is un -ticked by default ; I kept it this way as I had disabled TCP / IP settings but it also proves a higher security risk potential if details fall into the wrong hands .
I also disabled the choice to enable an anonymous account as this database is intended for personal use .
Press
Next to progress onto the next screen .
Your installation configuration is now ready to be applied , press execute to start the process .
You should then receive a successful configuration message .
Once completed , press finish to exit this wizard .
Your have now successfully completed the configuration .
If you are installing MySQL on a different operating system or if you wish to refer back to the official documentation it can be found at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/installing.html.
Connecting to your local database
Now that you have the server installed we can now connect to it !
I am going to be using the Windows CLI ( command line interface ) to initialise the connection , but you may use the MySQL CLI found in the MySQL programs folder .
Firstly open a command prompt by opening the run dialog box found on the start menu and then type CMD and press [ ENTER ] ; upon which you will be displayed a window similar to the one below .
The first command that we are going to type is going to connect to the server with our user name and password .
There are several ways of connecting to the server all of which do the same task .
The MySQL connection command uses the following syntax :
Each of these arguments can be passed to the mysql command as follows :
-- host=host or - hhost
-- port=port or -P
--username=username or - uusername
-- password =password or - ppassword
database is given simply as a string ( E.G. db_name )
Note :
By supplying the full password string like this it will be visible on screen , if you prefer you can simply supply the -p or - password command with no password to be presented with a hidden password entry prompt .
We also do n't need a command terminator as we are typing into the Windows CLI at the moment not MySQL .
So as we wish to connect to our local computer so we can eliminate the host argument ( see connecting to a remote host later in this article ) .
We want to log in as our root account to give us full privileges , so we are going to need our username and password ; as we currently have n't got any databases set up we will not supply the database argument either .
I will be connecting to the " root " user account on my local machine with the password of " secret " using the following command :
This connects to MySQL using the root user with a password of secret .
The following commands will achieve the same result .
The user account ' root ' is the master MySQL account which was created during the installation ; this is the same user that you should be connecting as .
However please note that it is not recommended to leave a root account turned on a web installation , please refer to user accounts and privileges at the MySQL web site for further information . ( http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/adding-users.html)
Connecting to a remote database
( skip this if you are connecting to a local database )
In order to connect to your remote database , often supplied by a hosting provider , you must know the IP address or host name of your database ( and possibly the port number if it has been changed the default is 3306 ) .
You would connect to this as you would a local database just replacing the host and port arguments depending on your hosting configuration .
Disconnecting
To disconnect from the MySQL session send the QUIT ( or \q ) command .
Formatting queries and results
Now that we are connected ( after receiving " Welcome to the MySQL monitor . " message ) we are ready to send our commands however there are a few other points to note .
MySQL allows use of whitespace without affecting the commands entered .
This comes in handy in making our queries as readable as possible ( see the image below ) .
Both of these queries produce the same result , however the second one is significantly easier to read .
Note :
This query will not work as we do not have a database set up this is for demo purposes only !
You can see the code I used below , both of the queries entered are identical however by pressing [ ENTER ] the CLI allows us to continue the command on a separate line .
MySQL has implemented a feature to cancel an input if your command spans multiple lines , simply issue the clear command " \c " .
This however also means that a special command must be sent to indicate that it is then end of the command .
We can use either of the following :
;
\g
\G
The first two terminators are identical , however the third one when used within a query that returns data shows the result in a vertical table rather than horizontal .
This is great to bear in mind if we are returning information from a table which has many columns as it may become unreadable .
Restoring a Database
Next we will be importing a SQL file , this is the same process that you would do if you were restoring a database backup .
This file simply has all the commands necessary to make a duplicate of the database at the given backup time .
Ideally we would make our own database , however making a database can be a complex subject including relationships , naming conventions , storage engines and field settings which is beyond the scope of this article .
We are going to be using a pre-prepared database available at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/#sampledb scroll down until you see the example databases and you want to go ahead and download the world database
( world.sql ) .
Once connected to MySQL we are going to restore the world database as it is a backup of a previous database .
This file is simply a list of MySQL commands which will be run to make the new database .
This SQL file only contains table data and does not store database information , therefore we must first create a database to store the tables in ( refer to the analogy at the start of the article ) .
Note :
To save the length of this article I will be placing multiple commands in the code snippets , you can separate these commands or issue them together lookout for the command terminators shown previously in this article .
Also be aware that MySQL functions are not case sensitive so SELECT is the same as select and SeLEcT .
I personally capitalise MySQL functions in order to make my queries as easy to read as possible , as queries get longer and more complex this becomes a valuable feature alongside whitespace .
To make the database we are going to issue the CREATE DATABASE command , once created we are then going to USE the database .
Time to import the backup , there are many ways of doing this , its known as batch processing ( http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/batch-commands.html).
Since we are connected to MySQL already we are going to use the SOURCE command followed by our file name .
I have extracted the " world.sql " file from the zip folder and placed it on my C : drive root you will need to know the absolute path to your source file .
If you only provide your file name MySQL will look for source in the folder you launched your command prompt from ( C:\USERS \USERNAME on vista C: \Documents and Settings \Username
on XP ) .
You cannot browse to a different directory while using the MySQL interface so make sure you supply the appropriate absolute path .
After issuing this command the CLI window will issue each of the commands within the SQL file , once completed you will be returned to the mysql > prompt .
No you have a fully functional database at your disposal .
However we do not yet know what it contains !
Let 's do a little bit of diving around ; we are going to use the following commands :
SHOW TABLES ; - this shows the tables in the current database .
DESCRIBE tbl_name ; - this shows what fields exist in the specified table .
After issuing the command we now know that the database contains three tables : " city " , " country " and " countrylanguage " .
Next we are going to find out what fields these tables store .
You want to issue the DESCRIBE tbl_name for each of the tables .
After issuing the DESCRIBE command for the country table you will see below that it returned a unreadable mess , to solve this simply use the \G terminator instead of ;.
Now we have all the information that we need in order to manipulate the tables as we wish , we have the database username , password , database name , table names and field names if you are developing in a different language such as PHP this is the information you would require to return data to your system ( see http://php.net/mysql).
Logging results
We can choose to log output of the MySQL interface ; we do this by sending the \T filename .
txt command .
In order to stop logging we issue the \t command .
The below example saves a file called log .
txt to the root directory of the E : hard drive .
On my machine this is a spare hard drive , please note you must have permission to access this drive ; you will be unable to write to your windows installation drive root on Windows Vista without launching MySQL from an elevated command prompt .
Backing up a database
The MySQL monitor comes with an extension called mysqldump ; as you might expect dumps the necessary information from the database to be able to make an exact replica .
The mysqldump command uses the following syntax :
To launch this you should be disconnected from the MySQL session .
The following code logs into the MySQL session with the root user account with the password secret , it then dumps the table db_world to the file db_worldbak.sql .
Conclusion
After reading this article , I hope you have gained a firm understanding of how to interface with mysql on a command line level .
Something which can prove useful as commands can be sent directly to the MySQL database rather than via another scripting language .
Please do not stop here , http://dev.mysql.com/doc/ really is a great resource and in no time you will be making you own database .
Below I have written some basic queries to search the world database and some examples for you to try .
Lets see if you can understand them , if not again you know where the documentation is located .
In English this query SELECTS and returns the Name and Population FROM the table city WHERE the country code is GBR , the results are then filtered using ORDER BY Population ASC ( ascending population ) and is then LIMIT ed to return the first 5 results .
This query shows the name and population of the least 5 populated cities in Great Britain .
And one more for the road …
In English this query SELECT s data , it CONCAT enates Name from the city table and Language from the countrylanguage table and displays the results AS Detail the query also SELECT s Population from the city table .
Again this query SELECT s its data FROM the city table and the countrylanguage table , this returns data where the city 's country code is the same as the country code of the country language .
The data is filtered to display countries WHERE there country code is GBR AND the Language is English , this is then ORDER ed BY increasing population , and results are LIMIT ed to show the results from 6 to 10 .
This query is known as an INNER JOIN , as two tables are linked together within the query .
This query will display the 6th to the 10th least populated cites with the GBR country code which speak English .
How did I know what data to write those queries for you ask !
By running the following SELECT query it uses the wild card character to select all the fields and return all of the data in the specified table .
From the result of the query I got an understanding of what was included and I made some scenarios which I wanted to query .
Here are a few functions which you may want to look at in more detail to get started :
SELECT
FROM
WHERE
LIMIT
ORDER BY
AND
OR
CONCAT
SHOW DATABASES
USE
CREATE
SHOW TABLES
DESCRIBE
UPDATE

Tesco is to encourage customers to discard unwanted and excessive packaging near the tills , in an experiment along the lines of a similar " take - back " scheme in Germany .
The supermarket chain has already cut back on what it regards as " wasteful " packaging , such as bulky dog food bags and unnecessary plastic wrapping on food .
A regional trial will now try to find out which kinds of packaging consumers are prepared to do without .
Common customer gripes include the amount of plastic , cardboard and foil used with Easter eggs , the superfluous boxes accompanying toothpaste , and the trays and plastic film that " protect " fruit .
The trial runs initially for six weeks from today , at Tesco stores in Guildford , Surrey , and Ilminster , Somerset .
The company stressed that the arrangements were temporary to get consumer feedback .
The scheme allows customers to leave excess packaging for recycling .
Alasdair James , Tesco's head of energy , waste and recycling , recently visited Germany .
He said : " We know our customers expect us to help them recycle easily and we have also committed ourselves to cutting our own waste .
This unique pilot helps us do both .
Packaging left by customers at the store will tell us a lot about areas we may need to look at again , as well as where we have got it right . "
Tesco has more than 3,500 recycling and reducing packaging projects .
It stressed that for regulatory reasons or where labelling was essential - for instance in warning of products containing nuts - packaging might still be necessary .
A large proportion of retail packaging ends up in landfill space where it takes a long time to decompose , and even then the waste can give off harmful gases and toxins which pollute the air and water .
Tesco said it was now diverting 87 % of its waste from its store network away from landfill , compared with its target of 95 % by the end of the year .
Lucy Neville - Rolfe , Tesco executive director for corporate and legal affairs , said : " Tesco is committed to tackling environmental and climate change and we are always working hard to play a positive role and make it easier for our customers to do the same .
We know that our customers want us to continue to reduce packaging .
" At the same time we need to make sure that we are preventing unnecessary food waste .
We are looking to find the least amount of packaging necessary and this trial will help us to establish customers ' views . "
A recent report by the Local Government Association said that Waitrose had the most packaging and Tesco the least , while Sainsbury 's had the highest proportion that could be easily recycled , and Lidl the lowest .
Nintendo DS Cover ( NSFW )
The Nintendo DS handhelds are quite popular amongst all gaming fans and Nintendo has always tried to stay ‘ family friendly ’ .
But all gamers eventually shed their acne and grow up to be young men who still love Nintendo while loving other things as well .
This Nintendo fan has taken his DS and mixed it with another work of art making this little gadget probably the most wanted handheld amongst his friends .
Cheekily , he or she ( let me not be sexist ! ) has decided that to get the most fun out of anything , something more should be added to it .
And that is probably how the wool cover of this DS grew two well - shaped tits !
The NSFW cover by Astroberry just goes to show that young men with raging hormones need to declare to the world that just because they still stay loyal to the world of gaming does n’t mean they are still little boys .
After all , everyone is entitled to enjoy the benefits of two very different worlds .
Humorously , the cover also seems to announce the entry of girls into the gaming world .
Though slightly risqué , the tit cover gives the NDS an audaciously sexy look .
If this had been a mod instead of a cover it would definitely have featured on our list of the 28 geekiest Nintendo DS Mods .
Nearly every issue of major science journals contains new developments in nanotechnology which may eventually help us develop nanoscale medical implants , sensors , pollution scavengers , and other devices .
In designing nanomachines , one has to think about how to power them .
Batteries or other external power sources would add to the cost and size of the devices , so it would be preferable if they could be self - powered , having their own power cell or some power - harvesting mechanism .
Several years ago , scientists found that they could create an electric current by pushing water through a single - walled carbon nanotube ( SWCNT ) — the direction of the electric potential along the tube could even be flipped by changing the course of the water flow .
Last year , Chinese scientists led by Lianfeng Sun managed to make hydroelectric power converters based on this phenomenon , which led them to suggest that " SWNTs can be exploited as unique , tunable molecular channels for water and might find potential application in nanoscale energy conversion . "
However , before it ’s sensible to look into further applications , it ’s necessary to figure out how water and SWCNTs generate hydroelectric voltage .
Without a basic understanding of the mechanisms involved , it would be difficult to design an efficient power - harvesting technique .
Quanzi Yuan and Ya - Pu Zhao from the Chinese Academy of Sciences investigated how water interacted with SWCNTs at the atomic level , and their work appeared today in an early edition of the Journal of the American Chemical Society .
They computationally simulated a system where osmotic pressure was pushing water molecules through a SWCNT that was 12.3 � long and 8.14 � in diameter .
As a frame of reference , a molecule of water has a diameter of about 2.75 �.
They then varied different parameters to determine the source of the voltage and its properties .
One of the first things Yuan and Zhao noticed was that water moved through the nanotube in a perfect single - file formation .
Water molecules normally form ordered hydrogen bonds with one another , and the ability to hydrogen bond was responsible for the formation of this single - file chain .
Each water molecule in that chain has a dipole moment and is polar , as the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms .
Thus , when hydrogen bonded in a single - file fashion , all the water molecules contribute to give the collective chain a dipole moment as well .
The dipole moment of the chain creates a polarity difference through the SWCNT , resulting in a charge of 0.134 e at one end of the tube and a charge of - 0.005 e at the other end .
Yuan and Zhao calculated that the voltage difference between the two ends was 17.2 mV , the electric current was 1.72 �A , and the electric field of the tube was 107 V/m .
Based on these results , Yuan and Zhao conclude that " the structure of a water - filled SWCNT " makes it " a promising candidate for a synthetic nanoscale power cell , as well as a practical nanopower harvesting device . "
While the authors succeeded in figuring out the fundamental reason behind the voltage generation and identified the process as useful for real - world applications , further computational work would be helpful , as it is still unclear how factors like changing the diameter of the nanotube or the velocity of the moving water molecules will influence the voltage generation .

A rightwing “ patriot ” blew up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 Americans .
Another rightwing activist committed a series of bombings that killed two people and injured at least 150 others .
A heavy FOX News consumer shot up a Unitarian church in Knoxville for reasons that he plainly described as politically eliminationist .
Last week a white supremacist shot three police officers in cold blood after posting a string of online commentary that echoed hysterical rightwing radio rants almost word - for - word .
The shooter admitted that he would have killed more if he could .
Here is a suggestion if Michelle still needs shoulder to cry on .
Go find a cop .
There ’s no need to come to southwestern PA ; I saw squad cars from Michigan , Massachusetts and Canada at Thursday ’s funeral .
Tell him or her how completely unfair it feels to have the government keeping an eye on paranoid gun fetishists .
She can explain to her new friend how the government was never meant to use unrestrained police powers on her kind of American .

At least now I can stop wondering whether rightwing torture - and - wiretap freaks ever understood that putting ‘ Islamic ’ or ‘ terrorist ’ in the title of a law is not a great way to limit its scope to people they consider Islamic terrorists .
If the meaningful part of a law has no penalty for using supposed ‘ antiterrorist ’ powers on anyone that a law enforcement agency damn well pleases then that is what it will do .
Republicans were not just trying to grease laws with titles that nobody would want to vote against .
They really believed that a law ’s title and its preamble , if the author even bothered , had some totemic power to protect conservative ultrapatriots from the vile treatment that they wanted to impose on others .
Evil , yes , in the obvious pleasure they took in seeing mostly innocent prisoners tortured .
But definitely also stupid .
Watching Malkin , the other Boleyn girl , squirm now after she smugly cheered the disappearance of Catherine of Aragon Jose Padilla only a few years ago does not exactly feel good .
But it sure is n’t wrong .

I ’ve just looked at Skitch after someone used it to share a screenshot with me , and thoughts floated across my head about how I might use that too .
Then I thought , now , hang on a second , I already have a website to publish images on , but I have to save them , then scp them up , and so on , and that ’s fiddly and annoying .
Then I thought , this could be easier .
So , Places > Connect to Server , and fill in SSH details for kryogenix.org , with the folder being my “ random ” folder on the website , and tick “ add bookmark ” with the bookmark name being “ kryogenix random folder ” .
Now , to take a screenshot and publish it , I just hit Print Screen ( which takes a screenshot and offers to save it ) , say “ Save ” , and pick “ kryogenix random folder ” from the drop - down list of where to save it to .
Publishing screenshots with three clicks .
That ’ll do nicely .
( Skitch does other stuff , as I understand it , like cropping images and adding annotations .
It would be cool if the Gnome screenshot tool allowed these things too , but I can live without them . )
A review of cases over the last two years shows a pattern : the drug cartels hire people in need of cash with no criminal records to buy guns from legal sources , often just one or two at a time .
Once the smugglers have amassed a cache of weapons , they drive them across the border in small batches , stuffed inside spare tires , fastened to undercarriages with zip ties or bubble - wrapped and tucked into vehicle panels .
In some cases , the drug traffickers and gun smugglers are linked .
On a recent evening in Reynosa , a border town , a Mexican army patrol found an abandoned farmhouse that had been used by drug traffickers .
Hidden deep in the brush outside was a plastic barrel filled with guns .
The authorities believe that the traffickers were taking drugs to the United States and using the money to return with guns .
The cartels also employ spies to keep track of the sporadic efforts of the Mexican military to search cars , law enforcement authorities say .
Because there is no computerized national gun registry , agents say , tracking guns relies on a paper trail .
Agents must contact the manufacturer or importer with a make and a serial number and work their way down the supply chain by telephone or on foot .
At the retail level , records of gun sales remain in the hands of the dealers .
Agents can request to see them only if a gun is recovered in a crime or during periodic audits .
By law , those audits can be done only once a year , and , in practice , most dealers face such a review once every three to six years , because auditors are stretched thin .
The record keeping is not always perfect .
In trying to track guns confiscated in Mexico last year , agents found that one in five of the guns could not be traced because the dealers had no record of the sale or had gone out of business and the records had been lost .
Even when the original legal buyer is located , a gun owner in many states , can legally say “ I lost it ” or “ I sold it to someone I do not know . ”

Honda Motor with the Japanese government - affiliated Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International and precision equipment maker Shimadzu , has co-developed a brain machine interface ( BMI ) system that allows a person to control a robot through thought alone .
Honda said —
“ The BMI system uses statistical processing of the complex information to distinguish brain activities with high precision without any physical motion . ”
In 2006 they managed to get a robotic hand to move by analyzing brain activity using a large magnetic resonance imaging scanner like that found in hospitals .
The latest work is a step more advanced and measures the electrical activity in a person ’s brain using electroencephalography and blood flow within the brain using near - infrared spectroscopy to produce data that is then interpreted into control information .
It requires no physical movement .
TAXPAYERS spent $ 86.6 million on advertising to promote the policies of the Federal Government in its first year , with a large chunk being spent on Defence Force recruitment campaigns .
But the spending was dwarfed by what the Howard government forked out in its final year : a whopping $ 254 million , the bulk of which was spent on promoting its failed WorkChoices policy .
According to the first report on campaign advertising by government departments in the first half of the 2008/09 financial year , the Rudd Government spent $ 53.2 million .
The Government spent $ 86.6 million in the 2008 calendar year , but has not provided a detailed breakdown of the $ 33.4 million spent in the first half of the year .
Another detailed report of the entire financial year 's spending will be released in September .
Defence was the biggest - spending department , with $ 16.3 spent on a new Defence Force recruitment drive .
The Australian Better Health Initiative asking Australians to measure their waist lines  a program in which Victoria does not participate  cost Australians $ 7.3 million .
That , combined with a new campaign warning of the dangers of binge drinking that cost taxpayers $ 6.8 million , made the Department of Health the second - largest spender between June and December .

Officer Morgado could be seen having an exchange with a man in a crosswalk .
Officer Paul Morgado : " What the f*** did you say ?
Do n't you f***** call me s***. Do n't f***** do that s*** dude .
" Charles Haynes : " I did n't touch you .
" Morgado : " Turn around .
Turn around .
" 26 - year - old Charles Haynes was just leaving a job at a nightclub .
Morgado : " Dude , put your hands behind your back .
" Haynes : " All right , brah .
" Morgado : " Do n't do that s*** to me .
" What did Haynes do wrong ?
Morgado : " You called me right to my face , ' a little b****.'" Haynes : " I did n't call you a little b****. " Morgado : " You 're going to jail .
" In a lawsuit filed in January , Haynes claims it was Officer Morgado who started the trouble by saying , " Get out of the ( expletive ) street , boy . "
Haynes admits answering with his own expletive and calling into question Morgado 's sexual orientation .
After that point , the tape picks up .
Police backup can be seen arriving at the scene .
They arrest Haynes for public intoxication , but there is little evidence of that on the video in Hayne 's words or actions .
The officers later let him go without charges .
" I think it 's important for people to remember that cops are human beings and we make mistakes .
And , we need to correct those mistakes , " says Gary Delagnes with the San Francisco Police Officers Association .
The head of the police officers union believes Morgado had a lapse in judgment and lost his temper .
But , he is disappointed the district attorney 's office has filed a misdemeanor charge of battery against the officer , even though the judge agreed to a pre-trial diversion program that could lead to the charge being dismissed .
" As far as I 'm concerned there was no serious injury here .
It was a lapse in judgment , a loss of temper , and we can't have that .
And , I think it can be corrected administratively through the department in this particular case , " says Delanges .
"
The case came to us as more of an outrage case .
It 's an outrage case , " says John Burris , Haynes ' attorney .
Burris has filed a civil rights lawsuit against Morgado , the police department and the city .
He is especially concerned about the report Morgado filed which paints Haynes as the aggressor .
" This is not the worst physical case I 've ever had .
But , in terms of the unlawful arrest , the verbal abuse and then ultimately physically manhandling him , it 's just a violation of one 's constitutional rights , " Burris says .
The police union says Haynes could lose his job over the incident after the case is referred to the police commission .
The SFPD and the city could take another hit ; the lawsuit is asking for $ 1 million in damages .
The police department declined to comment on the case calling it " a personnel issue . "
Phone calls to Officer Morgado 's attorney have not been returned .
I have used brown paper bags in the past to rewrap boxes for shipping , but I never thought of making shipping envelopes from brown bags .
This genius packaging idea reuses plastic grocery bags for waterproofing and brown paper bags to make the outer envelope .
My favorite part is the stitching to close it up .
No glue or tape necessary !
This fabulous eco packaging idea from Linda Everett of LindaEve and the Eco Etsy Team .
Linda developed this packaging to use for her beautiful bags made from neckties and repurposed fabrics .
She shares a complete tutorial for making your own grocery bag shipping envelopes on the Eco Etsy Blog .
She recommends wrapping the item to be shipped in a plastic grocery bag first to provide some waterproofing .
But do n’t tape the plastic bag , just wrap the item inside it , so the bag can be reused again by the recipient .
The outer envelope is cut from a brown paper bag .
You will probably get two envelopes per bag , more if your items are small .
Instead of tape or glue , simply stitch the seams shut for a great handmade touch .

In a contemporary retelling of Aesop ’s fable of the tortoise and the hare , Pittsburgh is finding recession - era advantages in a slow - growth legacy .
The city , which has lost half its population since 1950 , had a well - chronicled change of character over the second half of the 20th century : from a center of the steel industry to headquarters for many large corporations to a much more diverse economy that encompasses health care , education , finance and technology .
As it shrank , the city had relatively little new construction compared with many United States cities .
But it was in the forefront of the movement to conserve existing structures and clean up the contaminated industrial sites called brownfields , becoming a leader in the field of sustainable building .
That is now serving Pittsburgh well during the economic downturn .
Describing the area ’s rebuilt economy , the Allegheny County executive , Dan Onorato , said : “ It ’s clean , it ’s shiny , it ’s green .
Slow , steady growth is our strongest asset . ”

This week , Governor Mark Sanford announced that South Carolina will reject a large chunk of the stimulus funds targeted for his state .
The state legislature may disagree .
If so , this could set up a confrontation over the constitutionality of the stimulus , specifically the provision that purports to enable state legislatures to bypass Governors and accept funds on behalf of their state .
Professor Ron Rotunda doubts this provision is constitutional .
He writes :
If state law does not give the state legislature the right to bypass the governor , how can Congress just change that law ?
Where does Congress get the power to change a state constitution ? . . .
The two main sources of power that might justify subsection ( b ) are Congress ' power over interstate commerce and its power to tax and spend .
The commerce power does not support this law .
The commerce power is very broad indeed , but there are limits .
One important one is that Congress can only use the commerce power to subject the states to " generally applicable " law .
For example , if Congress sets the minimum wage at $ 7 an hour for all workers in interstate commerce , that law can include state workers in interstate commerce .
But subsection ( b ) is not " generally applicable . "
By its very nature it only governs states .
The second main source of federal power is the spending power , allowing Congress to bribe the states to take certain actions .
. . .
The spending clause does not work here .
Congress is not telling a state , " You must change your state constitution before we will give you a dime . "
Instead , Congress is simply telling the state , " We have changed your state constitution so that we give more power to the state legislature , without any pesky interference from the governor . "

DETROIT 
More than 14,000 retirement - eligible hourly workers have elected to stay at the financially troubled automaker General Motors rather than leave with a buyout package worth up to $ 45,000 .
G.M. said in a statement on Thursday that more than 7,500 members of the United Automobile Workers union who work in its factories had accepted the offers by this week ’s deadline .
Most of the workers will leave by April 1 .
The number is more than double the projection of one analyst but illustrates the difficulty G.M. faces in trying to persuade workers to give up their jobs during a recession , even at a company perilously close to bankruptcy and after the U.A.W. agreed to reduced job - security provisions .
But G.M. needs many longtime workers to leave , so it can replace them with new hires earning half as much .
The company has borrowed $ 13.4 billion from the federal government since December and is asking for $ 16.6 billion more .
It must show President Obama ’s auto industry task force by next Tuesday that it is making progress on cutting labor costs and other aspects of its restructuring plan .
World War II as Trauma , Memory and Fantasy in Japanese Animation
By Susan J. Napier
In her book Hiroshima Traces Lisa Yoneyama discusses how recent scholarship has tended to define memory in opposition to history , suggesting that “ Memory has often been associated with myth or fiction and contrasted with History as written by professionals . [ 1 ]
Yoneyama herself problematizes this opposition as a “ false dichotomy , ” stating that “ the production of knowledge about the past … is always enmeshed in the exercise of power and is always accompanied by elements of repression . ” [ 2 ]
She exhorts her readers to remember that , “ we begin our investigations into the past with an awareness that historical ‘ reality ’ can only be made available to us through the mediation of given categories of representation and processes of signification . ” [ 3 ]
This article examines how one of the most significant events in modern Japanese history , defeat in the Second World War , is represented through the medium of animation , a medium which allows history and memory to transform into myth and even into fantasy , ultimately creating for the viewer an experience which allows for a working through of what might be called historical trauma .
Japanese popular culture has engaged with memories of the Second World War since at least the early 1950 ’s when the first Godzilla ( Gojira ) film took on atomic testing , wholesale destruction and the American enemy in the form of a kaiju eiga or monster movie .
Japanese manga ( comic books ) have revisited WWII often , especially in the works of Matsumoto Leiji whose depictions of aerial dogfights and last minute sacrifices gained a wide following .
Since the 1960s , animated films and television series have produced some of the most memorable visions of the war .
The two most famous of these are the remarkably faithful recreations or rememorations of cataclysmic events such as the atomic bombing of Hiroshima depicted in Barefoot Gen ( Hadashi no Gen 1983 ) and the final days of the war as seen by two children in Kobe shown in Grave of Fireflies ( Hotaru no haka , 1988 ) .
In these two films personal memory on the part of the writers of the original texts ( respectively Nakazawa Keiji on whose autobiographical manga Barefoot Gen is based and Nosaka Akiyuki who wrote the semi-autobiographical short story Grave of Fireflies ) , became part of a collective Japanese memory as the films were seen by millions of Japanese schoolchildren .
But the war , the defeat and the atomic bomb also manifest themselves consistently in more displaced forms , most obviously in the overall fetishization of apocalypse which has been a staple of Japanese animation since the 1970 ’s to the present .
Here discussion focuses on one anime depiction , the Space Battleship Yamato ( Uchu Senkan Yamato ) television and film series from the 1970’s ??? and what might be called the Yamato ’s descendant , the series Silent Service ( Chinmoku no Kantai ) from the late 1990’s .
Both works refer explicitly to the Second World War at the same time as they go beyond history and memory to produce a cathartic and fantastic reworking of the loss .
The Space Battleship Yamato series premiered in October of 1974 , three years earlier than the first Star Wars film .
Like Star Wars and the 1960 ’s American Star Trek series , however , Yamato can be seen as an immensely entertaining science fiction series , with memorable characters , cutting edge special effects ( for the period ) , and compelling story lines , that also possesses a strong ideological subtext .
In the case of Star Trek and Star Wars , this subtext is clearly linked to the period in which each was created .
Star
Trek with its introspective , racially mixed crew and regular invocation of the Enterprise ’s mission , “ to seek out new worlds and new civilizations ” may be seen as an optimistic answer to American anxieties during the Vietnam War , when many at home and abroad perceived America ’s advance into Southeast Asia as racist and imperialist .
The original Star Wars trilogy , on the other hand , with its evil Galactic Empire and largely Caucasian cast , took place mainly during the manicheanism of the Reagan years when American triumphalism coexisted with heightened Cold War tensions .
The Yamato series can also be seen as a product of its time when Japan was one generation away from the war , an era in which technology and economic success seemed to promise a bright future , but also one in which many expressed anxiety over loss of basic Japanese traditions , including notions of community , sacrifice , and respect for the past .
Unlike Star Wars and Star Trek , however , which take place in the science fiction continuum that Fredric Jameson describes as “ the defamiliarization of the present “ ( my italics ) , the action of the Yamato films is predicated on coming to terms with a past event , the sinking of the battleship Yamato off Okinawa in the final days of the war , an incident that , in its iconic significance for the Japanese people , may be interpreted as an originary event , linked with the supreme originary event , the loss of the war .
Furthermore this is an event which , in displaced form , is revisited constantly throughout the series , a dip into a quasi - repressed nightmarish past which , through the medium of animated science fiction , is reworked into a dream of success .
Interestingly , when the series was initially shown on Japanese television it garnered relatively low ratings , forcing the producer , Nishizaki Yoshinobu , ( the actual creator of the series was Matsumoto Leiji and there were a number of different directors involved ) , to shorten the original 39 week broadcast to 26 weeks .
It was with the opening of the first Yamato film , however , ( essentially a compilation from the season ’s episodes ) , that the film and series began to become a pop culture phenomenon .
In fact , the Yamato film series is widely credited with having inspired the beginnings of anime fandom , as fans from around the country came to camp out on the cinema ’s steps the night before the opening . [ 5 ]
As the editorial staff of Animerica puts it , “ the first film ] ignited a ‘ Yamato craze ’ which would go on to consume Japan - and eventually many other parts of the world - for the next ten years . ” [ 6 ]
The four films comprising the 1970 ’s cinema series range over a mise en scene that varies from Earth to the Magellanic Clouds and beyond , even to the fourth dimension , but always calling attention to the WWII historical framework . [ 7 ]
This is most obvious in the first film of the series Battleship Yamato ( Uchusenkan Yamato ) , when an increasingly radioactive future earth is menaced by alien invaders known as the Gamilans .
For somewhat enigmatic reasons , the government decides that the only way to save humanity is to revive the actual battleship Yamato from its watery grave off Okinawa .
The sequence in which the Yamato is raised is clearly calculated to be both thrilling and deeply evocative of the actual historical event of the Yamato ’s sinking .
In a several minute sequence the film flashes back to the sailing of the original Yamato , the largest battleship ever created .
As the film indicates , the battleship Yamato was freighted with far more iconic significance than an ordinary ship .
Its name itself consciously refers to Japan , since “ Yamato ” was the ancient name for Japan and warriors were urged to have Yamatodamashii ( Yamato spirit ) .
Equally important , the ship bore the final hopes of warding off , or at least slowing the advance of invading Americans on the eve of the battle of Okinawa .
The film shows the 1945 Yamato setting sail , waved off by ordinary Japanese hopeful of its success , then offers a detailed depiction of its destruction .
The film then cuts to the future , showing the ship ’s literal resurrection .
Through the astonished eyes of two young soldiers , we see the reconstituted Yamato breaking through mud and rock ( the accretions of history ) , to the strains of moving music .
The following scene shows its successful first flight , also accompanied by emotionally charged music .
In these few minutes the film encapsulates emotions ranging from despair to hope , the basic emotional trajectory of the entire series .
In an article on the Yamato phenomenon originally published in Bungei Shunjuu , the Japanese writer Yoshida Mitsuru sums up the first film in the following manner :
Space Cruiser Yamato fights alone as best it can against the swarms of enemy forces , its unassisted fight reminiscent of how the battleship Yamato accompanied by only 10 ships and with no air protections , fought a fatal battle and sank off Okinawa before the onslaught of 300 American warships and 1,200 American planes .
But unlike the tragic demise of its prototype , the space cruiser Yamato successfully obtains the radioactivity - removing device with the help of Stasha , a mysterious beauty who lives on the planet Iscandall , destroys the Gamilus forces and returns safely to earth . [ 8 ]
The Yamato 's successful saving of the earth becomes the basic diegetic pattern for the series .
Battles are fought , new worlds are discovered , the earth is menaced and then saved , always by the Yamato which miraculously survives destruction time after time .
Indeed , throughout the spaceship ’s interstellar journeys one tactic is particularly common : faced with a particularly menacing threat — one that seems impossible to escape — the crew consistently chooses , not simply to confront the menace , but to head straight into it , courting almost inevitable disaster but somehow emerging intact .
At one point in Space Battleship Yamato ( the first film of the series ) , for example , the crew of the Yamato is attempting to engage with an alien attack force , only to be stymied by the intensity of a star that blocks their passage .
Rather than trying to go around the star and lose precious time , the crew suits up in special heat suits and skims the fiery surface , plunging through awesome solar flares that almost consume it and finally just managing to escape .
Later in the same film the Yamato is nearly destroyed by a metal - eating oil sea while being attacked by an enemy above the surface .
Rather than emerge from the water , however , the Yamato submerges into the sea just long enough to start a chain reaction on the planet ’s surface that will annihilate the enemy .
At the end of Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato ( Saraba Uchusenkan Yamato , 1978 ) , the brave and handsome young captain Kodai Susumu , alone on the ship with his dead girlfriend , plunges the ship into a kind of death star disguised as a white comet in order to save the earth even at the cost of the Yamato and his own life .
In Be Forever Yamato ( Yamato : Eien ni , 1980 ) , the fourth film of the series , the ship is forced to go into the center of the terrifying Black Nebula , where it are bombarded by both asteroids and enemy forces in a virtual visual and aural symphony of destruction .
At the last moment , however , the crew discovers an exit space from the Nebula that places them above a planet that seems to be an exact twin of the Earth , 200 years in the future .
All these exciting sequences no doubt provide suspenseful pleasure for the series ’ target audience of children and adolescents , as the Yamato comes again and again within a hair ’s breadth of being annihilated .
But the craft ’s constant plunges into danger followed by miraculous recovery can also be looked at psychoanalytically as plunges into the collective unconscious of the postwar Japanese citizenry , a form of “ working through ” the collective national trauma of defeat .
By offering the audience the chance to vicariously approach the moment of Yamato ’s ( Japan ’s ) annihilation and then successfully escape what seems like inevitable destruction , the films can be seen as a form of cultural therapy in which loss is revisited in a fundamentally reassuring manner .
One of the most interesting examples of this “ cultural therapy ” may be seen in Forever Yamato when the ship , after going through what is perhaps another dimension , discovers what seems to be a future earth .
This is an earth however , in which according to its history , the Yamato never returned from its current mission and much of earth ’s culture was lost .
The present day inhabitants of the future “ earth ” attempt to convince the Yamato ’s crew that they should simply stay in the future since history tells them that they will only be annihilated if they try to return .
Just as the crew is about to despair , however , one of the crew begins to notice suspicious differences between our earth and the future earth ( such as the fact that Rodin ’s “ Thinker ” ’s hand is the wrong one ) .
Realizing that this future earth is actually a simulacrum , a trap set up by the alien enemy , the Yamato escapes , battles its way back across the universe and , of course , saves the earth .
Even more than the first film , Forever Yamato addresses and plays on postwar Japanese anxieties , perhaps the most fundamental of which is that the successes of the postwar period were not sustainable .
Like a dream within a dream the film ’s diegesis allows for an initial reworking of the defeat only to suggest that this reworking was itself a fake , ( just as when we “ wake “ from a nightmare only to realize that the nightmare is still continuing ) and that in “ reality ” the Yamato never does make it back to save the earth .
At the last moment however , the film offers an alternative “ true ” reality in which the nightmare future is seen as only a simulacrum and the Yamato sails triumphantly on .
Of the postwar attitude toward the defeat , Yoshikuni Igarashi writes , “ … the desire to return to the traumatic experiences of the Pacific War did not disappear with Japan ’s prosperity , since the narrative of progress posited its losses as the origin of the postwar Japanese society . ”
He goes on to say that “ the familiarity of the narrative simply transformed the eyewitness accounts into clichés “ and that “ the articulation of the war experience could take place only in the form of repetition , trapped between the contradictory needs to remember and to forget the traumatic war experience . ” [ 9 ]
I would suggest that the Space Battleship Yamato series goes beyond both remembering and forgetting .
Through its medium ( animation ) and genre ( futuristic science fiction ) the series defamiliarizes the war experience , allowing not only a working through of the trauma of defeat ( through innumerable repetitions of attack and destruction ) but ultimately a reworking of the defeat , both through the final success of the Yamato in every encounter and , even more importantly , through the fetishization of the spaceship Yamato itself , not only a symbol of Japan ’s final battles in WWII but also a symbol of the Japanese nation .
Even more than the atomic bomb , which has become what Marilyn Ivy calls a metatrope for loss in contemporary Japan , [ 10 ] the Yamato , both the original and the animated versions , are tropes of the Japanese identity , initially configured as one of loss and destruction but , through the medium of animated fantasy , able to become a trope of renewal and hope .
For in many ways this reworking is a positive one , as the Yamato is more or less transformed from the emblem of prewar Japanese militarism to a global ( literally ) emissary of peace and love to the universe .
This universalization of the Yamato ’s iconic significance is made abundantly clear throughout the series .
The earth is now a single nation united against alien blue - skinned enemies ( although the characters ’ names are all Japanese and some , such as “ Tokugawa ” or “ Okita ” have historical significance ) and the theme of love of humankind is constantly evoked , sometimes explicitly in the lyrics to various theme music , and in the second film Farewell Yamato ’s subtitle Soldiers of Love ( Ai no senshitachi ) .
If the atomic bomb was a symbol for Japanese of powerlessness and victimhood , as a result of an unexpected outside force the sinking of the Yamato is a more culturally specific vision of defeat and despair .
While some Japanese criticized the film on its initially appearance as potentially reviving militarism [ 11 ] the films project a very explicit message of universal love , not simply among the inhabitants of earth but involving at least some of earth ’s alien enemies as well .
Furthermore , the Yamato unlike the Enterprise in Star Trek is always in a reactive rather than proactive mode , defending the earth rather than seeking out adventures .
A more complex situation is limned in the 1990 ’s film and manga series Silent Service .
This series , set in the contemporary era , features a nuclear submarine , originally under joint .
U.S. - Japanese command and originally called the “ Seabat . ”
In a surprise twist , however , the Japanese crew takes over the submarine and turns it into a rogue vessel , no longer under the command of any nation .
Most of the series consists of the travels of the submarine and the attempts by the international community to find and seize it , constantly defeated by the plucky and resourceful Japanese captain who masterminded the takeover in the first place .
Although unexpected , the takeover is actually presaged by a significant action taken by the Japanese commander early on in the story .
Alone with the Seabat , he takes out his knife and carves a single word into the hull .
The word ( in Japanese ) is “ Yamato . ”
Although the overall diegesis of Silent Service is less specifically evocative of history than was the Yamato series , history is still an important emotional catalyst behind the plot , as the above incident illustrates .
This more recent series is a reworking of defeat and loss on a more proactive level .
No longer in the therapeutically safe and dreamlike realm of the outer space of the future , Silent Service suggests a world of increasing international tension and rising Japanese nationalism , with the Americans clearly delineated and made to appear foolish .
Whether this contemporary reworking of loss and defeat is therapeutic or problematic remains open to question .
Yoshida Mitsuru , himself a survivor of the Yamato ’s sinking , insists that , “ Fortunately the space cruiser Yamato is decisively different from the battleship Yamato . ” [ 12 ]
The same may not be said as easily of the Japanese appropriation of the Seabat , clearly a symbol of the desire for Japanese autonomy from America .
In his seafaring novel Lord Jim , Joseph Conrad creates a character ( Jim ) , who cannot escape or even completely acknowledge a tragic mistake in his past , one that involved the lives of many innocent passengers on a pilgrim ship .
In a famous and much critically debated scene , Jim ’s two mentors , Stein and Marlowe , discuss what to do with him .
It is Stein who has the last word , telling Marlowe that Jim must “ in the destructive element immerse , ” advice that I take to mean that Jim must confront his past and his own identity .
In a sense Jim does accomplish this task although in a somewhat displaced and deeply romantic form , and one which ultimately involves the sacrifice of his life .
Both the crew of the Yamato and the former SeaBat are also plunging into a destructive element , one composed of memory , history , loss and desire .
That these “ immersions ” are also popular entertainment does not lessen their impact .

[ 4 ] I am indebted to two former students for my initial interest in the Yamato series .
Karline McLain ’s paper “ Remembering the Past , Recasting Identity ” linked the sinking of the Yamato to the atomic bombings while Eric Carmen ’s presentation on the original battleship Yamato made me aware of how accurate was the anime version of the historical event and inspired me to explore reasons behind this obsessive attention to verisimilitude .

Ironically , the Yamato series , renamed Star Blazers and edited for an American audience , is also considered to be the initial inspiration behind American anime fandom .

More so than either Star Wars or Star Trek , space itself becomes a character in the Yamato series since much of the action takes place while the ship is on interstellar voyages ( beautifully rendered in lush , dreamlike imager ) , rather than on planets .
The fascination with the element of space may connect with the modern Japanese consciousness of the Pacific Ocean , which surrounds their island nation , and more specifically , with the crucial role the Pacific in both the successes and failures of World War II .

President Barack Obama has announced the withdrawal of most US troops in Iraq by the end of August 2010 .
In a speech at a Marine Corps base , he said the US " combat mission " in Iraq would officially end by that time .
But up to 50,000 of 142,000 troops now there will stay into 2011 to advise Iraqi forces and protect US interests , leaving by the end of 2011 , he said .
Mr Obama praised the progress made but warned : " Iraq is not yet secure , and there will be difficult days ahead . "
Some Democrats are concerned that the timetable falls short of his election pledges on troop withdrawal .
Mr Obama had said previously that he would completely pull out troops within 16 months of taking the top job .
See what is being said about the plan on the web Earlier this month , he ordered the deployment of up to 17,000 extra US troops to Afghanistan , saying they had been due to go to Iraq but were being redirected to " meet urgent security needs " .
' Hard - earned progress '
In his address at Camp Lejeune , a Marine Corps base in North Carolina , Mr Obama said his national security team had drawn up a " new strategy " for US involvement in Iraq .
The strategy recognised that the long - term solution in Iraq must be political and that the most important decisions about its future must now be made by Iraqis , he said .
US TROOPS IN IRAQ Aug ' 10 troops down to 35 - 50,000 Dec ' 11 all US troops out of Iraq Source : Brookings Institution
Have your say :
What now for Iraq ?
Obama 's speech : Excerpts Iraq plan leaves questions " We have also taken into account the simple reality that America can no longer afford to see Iraq in isolation from other priorities : we face the challenge of refocusing on Afghanistan and Pakistan ; of relieving the burden on our military ; and of rebuilding our struggling economy - and these are challenges that we will meet . "
Mr Obama said all US troops would have left Iraq by the end of 2011 , in line with an agreement signed between the two countries last year .
And he paid tribute to US forces who have served in Iraq over the past six years .
" Thanks to the sacrifices of those who have served , we have forged hard - earned progress , we are leaving Iraq to its people , and we have begun the work of ending the war . "
He also said his administration would increase the numbers of soldiers and Marines , in order to lessen the burden on those now serving , and was committed to expanding veterans ' health care .
Addressing the Iraqi people directly , Mr Obama said theirs was " a great nation " that had persevered with resilience through tyranny , terror and sectarian violence .
I asked Robert Gates , the defence secretary , whether he could look the outside world in the eye and say ' America won ! '
North America editor Justin Webb
Read Justin's thoughts in full
He went on : " So to the Iraqi people : let me be clear about America 's intentions .
The United States pursues no claim on your territory or your resources .
" We respect your sovereignty and the tremendous sacrifices you have made for your country .
We seek a full transition to Iraqi responsibility for the security of your country . "
Mr Obama said that as a result of lessons learned from Iraq , he had ordered a review of US policy in Afghanistan and put the costs of Iraq and Afghanistan into the federal budget .
Stressing that Iraq 's future was inseparable from that of the broader Middle East , Mr Obama said the US would now " pursue principled and sustained engagement with all of the nations in the region , and that will include Iran and Syria " .
The new US ambassador to Iraq would be Christopher Hill , the former US chief negotiator with North Korea , the president added .
' Still dependent '
The withdrawal plan is a middle way between the speedy reduction Mr Obama envisaged during his election campaign and the slower one some military leaders may prefer , BBC North America editor Justin Webb says .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Obama wants only two combat brigades to leave this year but after December elections in Iraq the pace should quicken , our correspondent says .
The BBC's Mike Sergeant in Baghdad says that security in Iraq is now better and people say they are ready for US forces to leave .
However , some are deeply worried about what exactly will happen when US combat troops disappear , our correspondent says .
While Iraq 's security forces are much more capable now , they depend heavily on US back - up for logistics , intelligence and air support , our correspondent says .
A great deal of American financial and practical support may be needed for many years .
' Too many ' Democrats have expressed concern that the troop withdrawal is being watered down , with the bulk of troops being left in place until next year .
However , some sceptics have said that a fast withdrawal could reverse the dramatic but fragile gains in security in Iraq .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid described Mr Obama 's plan as " sound and measured " but said the US " must keep in Iraq only those forces necessary for the security of our remaining troops and the Iraqi people " .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the plan was " good news " because it signalled an end to the war , but called for clearly - defined missions for the remaining troops .
Republicans - including Senator John McCain , Mr Obama 's former rival for the presidency - broadly supported the plan but suggested Mr Obama should give credit to President George W Bush for the stability brought by his " surge " strategy of pouring extra troops into Iraq .
House Republican Minority Leader John Boehner said Mr Obama had outlined " a responsible approach that retains the flexibility to reconsider troop levels and to respond to changes in the security environment " .
REACTION TO BARACK OBAMA'S IRAQ PLAN President Obama very appropriately and correctly thanked US Marines for precipitating the turnabout in Iraq .
But if there is a chance of success in Iraq now as defined by Barack Obama , should n't there be some mention of the change in strategy , and the former Commander in Chief , the guy who hung in there ?
Marc Ambinder , Atlantic Monthly Several Democratic leaders have voiced strong concerns about the size of the " transition force . "
What 's more , for all of the success in reducing violence in Iraq , long - term political progress remains elusive , and will have to be a high priority for the administration .
Still , Obama has outlined the beginning of the end .
It 's about time .
Steve Benen , Washington Monthly
In 2003 , then Maj Gen David Petraeus , commander of the 101st Airborne Division that had participated in the invasion of Iraq , had a running joke with an embedded reporter ...
The general would turn to the reporter and muse , " Tell me how this ends . "
Today at Camp Lejeune ...
President Barack Obama - an antiwar Illinois state senator at the time of the invasion - answered Petraeus .
Spencer Ackerman , Attackerman , Firedoglake.com 2011 just became a hard stop , I think .
When presidents lay down markers like that , they do n't easily walk away from them .
It 's now what Iraqi politicians described it as : the American Withdrawal of Forces Agreement .
I fear Iraqi domestic political convenience just became American strategic reality .
This converts the SOFA from a framework for a long - term strategic partnership to a guarantee of withdrawal .

What makes image search different from text search is that people searching for images are most often looking for some entertainment rather than business - related or informative content .
What else differentiates image search is that image content is often subjective – you can ‘ like ’ or ‘ dislike ’ images ; besides , more often than not you even do n’t know exactly what you are looking for and what you want to find .
So here are some fun free image tools that turn searching for images into fun and also let you find you do n’t know what :
Search Images by Color :
Multicolr is Flickr - based color search engines .
With it you can mix up to 10 colors and select images matching the chosen color palette .
The more colors you choose , the more colorful images you get in the end :
Each search result has its own URL , so you can share it with friends .
Here ’s my latest pick :
Search Images by Similarity :
Byo image search will find images similar to the one you upload .
The exact algorithm is unclear but it seems it rather focuses on colors , though some similarity in forms and shapes can also be identified .
Retrievr is a Flickr based tool searching for images based on your sketch
You can also rate sketches created by others .
Search Images by Theme :
Tiltomo ( Flickr based ) searched for images by either color palette and texture or theme ( too bad those two criteria ca n’t be combined ) .
It has its own database of Flickr images , which means this database is not always up - to - date .
It is impressive that the engine finds images that really have similar topic ( and the similarity is not clear even to a human eye ) .
For example , the following search results definitely have something in common ( strawberries ) but the similarity is not about shapes , colors or forms , it ’s about theme :
Search Images by Face :
Exalead offers imagecontent :
Face advanced operator that restricts search results to faces only .
Google also provides that feature accessible via advanced search :

March 30th , 2009
Most people would probably read over the AP piece below without thinking twice about the mention of GM ’s new Chairman of the Board :
Board member Kent Kresa , the former chairman and CEO of defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. , was named interim chairman of the GM board .
Woh .
Hold on there .
Who is Kent Kresa ?
In addition to his work as a member of the board of GM , he ’s also a Senior Advisor at the Carlyle Group .
Since his bio on the Carlyle Group ’s website is the most complete one that I came across , I ’ll quote from it .
Everything in bold references links to the black world of special access programs :
Global private equity firm The Carlyle Group today announced that Kent Kresa , the former Chairman and CEO of Northrop Grumman Corporation , has joined Carlyle as a Senior Advisor to its aerospace and defense group .
… Mr. Kresa was Chairman of the Board of Directors of Northrop Grumman Corporation from September 1990 until October 2003 .
He served as Chief Executive Officer from January 1990 until March 2003 , and President from 1987 until September 2001 .
In 1982 he was appointed Group Vice President of the company ’s Aircraft Group and in 1986 was named Senior Vice President - Technology Development and Planning .
Mr. Kresa joined Northrop Grumman in 1975 as Vice President and Manager of the company ’s Research and Technology Center , developing new proprietary processes and products for the company .
From 1976 - 82 he served as Corporate Vice President and General Manager of the Ventura Division , a leader in the production of unmanned aeronautical vehicles .
Before joining Northrop Grumman , Mr. Kresa served with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , where he was responsible for broad , applied research and development programs in the tactical and strategic defense arena .
From 1961 - 68 he was associated with the Lincoln Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( M.I.T. ) , where he worked on ballistic missile defense research and reentry technology .
… Mr. Kresa serves on the boards of directors of the Avery Dennison Corporation , Fluor Corporation , General Motors Corporation , Eclipse Aviation Corporation , Trust Company of the West , and Advanced Bionics Corporation .
He is the Board Vice Chair of the Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles County and serves on the boards of several non-profit organizations and universities .
Mr. Kresa is a Member of the M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory Advisory Board and a Member of the UCLA Anderson School of Business Board of Visitors .
Kresa presided over Northrop Grumman ’s acquisition of TRW , another firm heavily linked to black projects .
Just how connected is this guy to the secret world ?
This is from World Policy – Arms Trade Resource Center :
This string of mergers and acquisitions created a company that is uniquely strong in both the metal bending work of building ships and planes and the cutting edge work in electronics and intelligence gathering .
It also created a company uniquely well suited to meet the defense needs of the Bush administration ’s war on terrorism .
This is neither an accident nor a lucky stroke .
This is the result of careful planning and unprecedented political influence .
Northrop Grumman CEO
Kent Kresa and other executives are part of “ St. Andrew ’s Prep , ” an informal network of Andrew Marshall protégés .
Marshall directs the Pentagon ’s Office of Net Assessment and is an iconoclastic military strategist who was given wide power to define future defense priorities by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
The strong imperative to build and deploy missile defense and the need to develop a more flexible and high tech military are just a few of Andrew Marshall ’s ideas and areas where Northrop Grumman is strong and growing stronger .
Additionally , former Northrop Grumman executives are now in influential posts in the Bush Pentagon .
Secretary of the Air Force James Roche previously served as the head of Northrop Grumman ’s Electronic Sensors and Systems Sector in Maryland .
Barry Watts , who once ran Northrop Grumman ’s influential in - house think tank , now directs the Pentagon ’s Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation .
These relationships have been extraordinarily important .
As defense analyst Byron Callan notes , the relationship with Marshall “ probably helped the Northrop Grumman guys establish a vision of where the company ought to be headed now , and in turn that vision should play to the strengths that Northrop Grumman has as a result of the role they ’ve [ Northrop Grumman executives ] played in sort of reshaping strategy . ”
What does all of this mean for GM ?
I have no idea .
But if something really , really strange happens , it might make much more sense in hindsight .
I ’m going to quote from Blank Spots on the Map again :
The Manhattan Project , a project lasting roughly five years from start to finish , had cost $ 2.3 billion in 1945 dollars .
A contemporary sum of about $ 26.8 billion : a tremendous amount .
But here , a startling fact :
The budget for the entire Manhattan Project was still billions of dollars less than the present day ’s annual black budget .
Every year , the United States spends more black dollars than it took to build the bomb .
In the few short years it took to build the bomb , and with the ensuing Cold War , the notion of having classified industries , multibillion - dollar secret budgets , legions of security - cleared personnel , and entire branches of science devoted to secret science went from being unthinkable to being so natural that few people even bothered questioning it .
What technologies might someone like Kent Kresa be tasked with providing to GM ?
Via : AP :
Neither General Motors nor Chrysler submitted acceptable plans to receive more federal bailout money , the Obama administration said as it set the stage for a crisis in Detroit that would dramatically reshape the nation ’s auto industry .
The White House pushed out GM ’s chairman and directed Chrysler to move quickly to forge a partnership with Fiat if it expects to receive additional government assistance .
GM and Chrysler employ thousands in Ohio , the No. 2 state for vehicle production .
President Barack Obama and his top advisers have determined that neither company is viable and that taxpayers will not spend untold billions more to keep the pair of automakers open forever .
In a last - ditch effort , the administration gave each company a brief deadline to try one last time to convince Washington it is worth saving , said senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to more bluntly discuss the decision .
Obama was set to make the announcement at 11 a.m. Monday in the White House ’s foyer .
In an interview with CBS ’ “ Face the Nation ” broadcast Sunday , Obama said the companies must do more to receive additional financial aid from the government .
“ We think we can have a successful U.S. auto industry .
But it ’s got to be one that ’s realistically designed to weather this storm and to emerge — at the other end — much more lean , mean and competitive than it currently is , ” Obama said .
Frustrated administration officials said Chrysler cannot function as an independent company under its current plan .
They have given Chrysler a 30 - day window to complete a proposed partnership with Italian automaker Fiat SpA , and will offer up to $ 6 billion to the companies if they can negotiate a deal before time runs out .
If a Chrysler - Fiat union cannot be completed , Washington plans to walk away , leaving Chrysler destined for a complete sell - off .
No other money is available .
Shawn Morgan , a Chrysler spokeswoman , said the company wants to work with the Treasury Department and Obama ’s auto task force but declined to comment on the White House ’s plans .
“ With the administration ’s announcement on the restructuring of the automotive industry imminent , it would be inappropriate to comment on speculation , ” Morgan said in a statement early Monday .
For GM , the administration offered 60 days of operating money to restructure .
A frantic top - to - bottom effort began Sunday after chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner stepped aside under pressure from the White House .
Fritz Henderson , GM ’s president and chief operating officer , became the new CEO , the company said in a statement Monday .
Board member Kent Kresa , the former chairman and CEO of defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. , was named interim chairman of the GM board .
Sheik Hassan Yacquub Ali , Shabaab ’s spokesman in Kismayo .
A senior leader of the radical Islamist group Shabaab in the southern city of Kismayo has welcomed Osama bin Laden ’s call to overthrow the government of President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed , and also said Shabaab would maintain its contacts with al Qaeda .
Sheik Hassan Yacquub Ali , the Information Minister for the Shabaab - controlled administration in Kismayo , said bin Laden ’s latest message was proof that al Qaeda and other Islamist groups continue to support the Islamist groups in Somalia , Shabelle reported .
Yacquub made the statements during a press conference in southern Somalia .
Bin Laden released an audiotape late last week where he urged Shabaab and other Islamist groups in Somalia to overthrow President Ahmed , who was described as an “ infidel . ”
Bin Laden called Ahmed and other Muslim leaders cooperating with the West “ the surrogates of our enemies ” a who “ must be removed by armed force . ”
Yacquub also chastised Sheihk Hassan Dahir Aweys for rejecting bin Laden ’s latest tape and said it was not helpful to oppose bin Laden ’s message .
“ Somalia knows [ its ] future and who can involve , but it is not something for Osama Bin Laden and al - Qaeda either , ” Aweys reportedly told an Arabic television station last week .
Aweys is the leader of the anti-government Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia - Eritrea and has direct links to al Qaeda .
Al Qaeda has devoted considerable propaganda resources to Somalia over the past two months .
Bin Laden ’s tape is the third message from al Qaeda ’s senior leadership since Feb. 13 .
Abu Yahya al Libi , a senior al Qaeda spokesman and religious and ideological leader , called for Somalis to fight the Ahmed government , in a video released on Feb. 13 .
Ayman al Zawahiri , al Qaeda ’s second in command , praised Shabaab for the capture of Baidoa , the former seat of the Transitional Federal Government parliament , during a videotape released at the end of February .
Shabaab ’s longtime links to al Qaeda
The senior leaders of Shabaab have had close ties to al Qaeda for years , and Shabaab and its predecessor have been al Qaeda affiliates in all but name .
Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys , Aden Hashi Ayro , and Hassan Turki have trained in al Qaeda camps during the 1990s .
Ayro was the leader of Shabaab before he was killed in a US airstrike on May 1 , 2008 .
Turki continues to serve as a military commander and senior trainer for the terror group .
Turki currently commands the Shabaab - linked Ras Kamboni Brigade , one of four groups in the Hizbul Islam alliance .
Aweys , the former leader of the Islamic Courts , was identified by the US Department of State as a Specially Designated Global Terrorists in November 2001 .
Aweys participated in the infamous “ Black Hawk Down ” incident in Mogadishu in 1993 .
Shabaab spokesman and military commander Sheikh Mukhtar Robow admitted that many Shabaab leader have trained with and take instruction from al Qaeda .
“ Most of our leaders were trained in Al Qaeda camps , ” Robow told The Los Angeles Times last August .
“ We get our tactics and guidelines from them , ” he continued .
“ Many have spent time with Osama bin Laden . ”
Robow admitted Shabaab formally seeks to merge with al Qaeda .
“ We are negotiating how we can unite into one , ” Robow said , told The Los Angeles Times .
“ We will take our orders from Sheik Osama bin Laden because we are his students .
Al Qaeda is the mother of the holy war in Somalia . ”
Robow , Turki , Sheikh Yusuf Indha’adde , have appeared on al Qaeda propaganda tapes training and fighting with foreign fighters .
Both Turki and Indha ’adde admitted to foreign al Qaeda involvement in Somalia in the summer of 2006 .
Indha ’adde served as the defense minister for the Islamic Courts prior to its fall in 2007 and is currently a Shabaab commander in Mogadishu .
Shabaab and the Islamic Courts have been sheltering of three senior al Qaeda operatives behind the 1998 attack on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
Fazul Abdullah Mohammed , Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan , and Abu Taha al Sudani have sought shelter with both Shabaab and the Islamic Courts .
Fazul served as the intelligence chief for the Islamic Courts and is believed to hold the same portfolio for Shabaab .
The US has targeted Fazul , Sudani , and Nabhan in multiple strikes in late 2007 and 2008 .
Sudani was killed during fighting in early 2007 .
Recently , the US Treasury Department applied financial and travel sanctions on three top leaders of Shabaab .
The sanctions target Shabaab founder and emir Ahmed Abdi Aw Mohamed , recruiter Issa Osman Issa , and Robow .
Al Qaeda has helped produced propaganda for the Islamic Courts and Shabaab and has even praised the group in its own propaganda tapes years ago .
Osama bin Laden endorsed the Islamic Courts during a speech back in 2006 .
“ We will continue , God willing , to fight you and your allies everywhere , in Iraq and Afghanistan and in Somalia and Sudan until we waste all your money and kill your men and you will return to your country in defeat as we defeated you before in Somalia , ” bin Laden said .
In September of 2008 , Shabaab formally reached out to al Qaeda ’s senior leadership in an effort to better integrate with the network and its strategic nodes across Africa and the Middle East .
The effort came in the form of a 24 - minute video that featured Nabhan .
In the tape , Nabhan declared an oath of bayat ( loyalty ) on behalf of Shabaab to bin Laden and al Qaeda and encouraged fighters to train in Shabaab - run camps and participate in the fight against the transitional federal government , Ethiopian forces , and African Union peacekeepers .
The response to Shabaab ’s declaration came on Nov. 19 when al Qaeda operations chief Ayman al - Zawahiri acknowledged the group in a propaganda video by calling them “ my brothers , the lions of Islam in Somalia . ”
“ ( R ) ejoice in victory and conquest , ” Zawahiri said in an official transcript acquired by The Long War Journal , “ and hold tightly to the truth for which you have given your lives , and do n’t put down your weapons before the Mujahid state of Islam and Tawheed ( oneness with god ) has been set up in Somalia . ”

Today I want to tell you about my recent adventure in data recovery .
A friend of mine had a broken USB disk that was no longer readable .
The single 230 GB partition was formatted with NTFS and neither Windows nor Ubuntu ( with the NTFS - 3g driver , I assume ) were willing to read it .
This disk contained photos , audio files and videos , the mission was to at least restore the photos .
Make a disk image
The first step for a data recovery project should be to make an image of the drive or partition : when a drives starts to lose data because of physical errors on the disk these errors tend to spread , things are getting worse and you will not get any data out of anymore at some point .
And every tool will encounter the same problems when trying to read defective sectors on disk , and it will not be possible to repair these .
By the way , if your data is really valuable you should n’t even try to recover it yourself , that is , if the drive shows signs of some physical damage .
You should disconnect it as soon as possible and hand it to a professional data recovery company – if it is worth a few hundred or thousand Euros .
The data I was working with , however , was n’t business critical .
So , after consulting $ SEARCH_ENGINE , I did an image of the drive with dd_rescue – this works similar to a normal “ dd ” but handles I /O errors more gracefully .
But here things started to get confusing : there are two programs for this purpose with an almost identical name :
Kurt Garloff ’s original dd_rescue tool uses the executable named “ dd_rescue ” , the Debian / Ubuntu package is named “ ddrescue ” .
Antonio Diaz Diaz new and improved GNU ddrescue provides an executable named “ ddrescue ” , the Debian / Ubuntu package carries the name “ gddrescue ” .
The latter is the one to choose : you get much better progress information – copying hundreds of gigabytes takes quite some time , so you want to know what ’s going on – and the capability to interrupt the process and continue where you left off with the help of a log file .
After finding out about that the hard way I got my image with
sudo ddrescue - r3 / dev/sdb1 hdimage logfile
where “ - r3 ” means : “ in case of an error , retry 3 times ” and / dev/sdb1 is the name of the partition of the USB disk , obviously .
Unfortunately , the resulting image still could n’t be mounted .
“ ddrescue ” only reported a few bad sectors on the disk , but it was obviously enough to make file access impossible .
Another idea that I was n’t able to pursue : it might have been possible to repair the NTFS filesystem with a virtualized windows instance running in VirtualBox – but VirtualBox only takes complete disks as images , not single partitions .
If I had done an image of the complete disk instead , including the partition table , this might have worked out .
I did n’t feel like copying the 230 GB over into a new image with a partition table and also did n’t have enough free disk space to do it .
Recovery tools : file carvers
The next step was trying to recover as much of the data as possible .
I had successfully used a “ file carver ” before to recover images from my digital camera ’s memory card after the FAT filesystem became corrupted .
A file carver is a program that scans a raw binary stream for the headers of known file types , like that of JPEG images or MP3 audio files , and tries to extract the contents , completely ignoring the file system .
The advantage is that it does n’t matter how broken your filesystem is – the program does n’t have to know anything about the filesystem ’s structure .
It can also recover deleted files .
The disadvantage is that you lose all information that is stored in the filesystem , the file name and directory structure .
It ’s also prone to errors for fragmented file systems , which also means that you ’re less likely to succeed when recovering large files .
I tried two tools from this category , “ foremost ” and “ photorec ” .
“ foremost ” is a simple command line tool , you call it like this :
foremost - i hdimage -o recovered -v
and it will sort the files it can find by file type into sub folders of “ recovered ” .
Photorec has a curses interface .
It also takes hints about the structure of the image , like presence of a partition table or filesystem type .
It is part of the “ testdisk ” package .
The command line invocation shows that this tool was ported from DOS :
photorec / log / debug /d output - directory hdimage
Recovery tools : Sleuth Kit
Researching further , I stumbled upon the Sleuth Kit and Autopsy .
These are forensic analysis tools and therefore are designed to recover data that someone deliberately tried to hide or destroy .
The Sleuth Kit is a suite of command line tools which Autopsy is a web frontend for .
Autopsy comes with its own web server .
I started it with these commands :
mkdir my - autopsy - dir / autopsy -d my - autopsy - dir / firefox http://localhost:9999/autopsy
Getting around the web interface can be a bit confusing : you have to create a “ case ” first , then add a host to investigate and finally a hd image to look at .
Anyway , the time it took me to get used to autopsy was n’t wasted because I now was able to see the complete contents of the original NTFS filesystem !
I was able to look at the data , browse the filesystem , download single files and compute MD5 sums .
However , autopsy offers no feature for copying whole directory trees .
This is because it is intended for forensic analysis rather than data recovery .
So you , the computer forensics expert , are supposed to look at every single file and make notes about it which in turn are then recorded in the “ case ” .
I was n’t really interested in a forensic analysis of the contents of my friend ’s drive so I took a closer look at the command line tools .
The relevant commands from the Sleuth Kit are “ fls ” for listing files in an image and “ icat ” for getting at the contents .
You use “ fls ” like this :
fls -urp hdimage
where -u means that I ’m not interested in deleted files , -r that I want a recursive listing and - p that I need to have the full path for every file .
The output looks something like this :
d/d 180 - 144-8 : some - dir d/d 5192 - 144-1 : some - dir / some sub dir r/r 5190 - 128 - 3 : some - dir / some sub dir/some_file.exe r/r 5188 - 128-3 : some - dir / some sub dir/another_file.jpg
The funny numbers in the second column are the “ inode ” of the file , which you need to feed into “ icat ” to get the contents .
So how do you recover a whole directory tree with these tools ?
What I should have done is using a script like this one :
#!/bin/sh IMAGE =hdimage fls - urp $ IMAGE | while read type inode name ; do case $ type in d / d ) mkdir " $ name " ; ; r / r ) icat $ IMAGE $ ( echo $ inode | sed 's/://g' ) > " $ name " ; ; esac done #!/bin/sh IMAGE=hdimage fls - urp $ IMAGE | while read type inode name ; do case $ type in d/d ) mkdir " $ name " ;; r/r ) icat $ IMAGE $ ( echo $ inode | sed 's/://g' ) > " $ name " ;; esac done
But I was lazy and so I saved the file listing in a text file which I turned into a big shell script using Emacs ’ rectangle functions , regular expressions and keyboard macros .
This was n’t working so well : there were some funny characters in the file names I forgot to escape , like single quotes and backticks .
So , as always , it turned out to be more work doing it “ the easy way ” .
However , in the end I was able to completely recover the data from the partition .
Analyzing the data
Since now I got all the data back , having already tried other methods of recovery before , this can serve as a nice real world benchmark of the usefulness of the file carving tools I used .
Just counting how many files these tools think they ’ve found does n’t help us much , we also need to know if the recovered files were really complete and undamaged .
I did a quick check with the files the Sleuth Kit recovered , and all files I checked seemed to be ok : the photos were fine and the videos and mp3s played without any hiccups .
So , let ’s assume that the data I got from the Sleuth Kit is really genuine .
To find out about the identity of the recovered files , I computed the MD5 hash for all of them with this little script :
for tool in foremost photorec sleuthkit ; do find $ tool - type f - print0 | xargs - 0 md5sum | tee md5sums / $ {tool} . txt done for tool in foremost photorec sleuthkit ; do find $ tool - type f - print0 | xargs - 0 md5sum | tee md5sums / ${tool}.txt done
And here ’s a script I hacked together to do some analysis on these files :
#!/bin/bash md5s_by_ext ( ) { local ext = $ 1 shift grep - hi " \. $ {ext} \$ " " $ @ " | awk '{ print $ 1 } ' } unique_md5s_by_ext ( ) { md5s_by_ext " $ @ " | sort | uniq } unique_md5s ( ) { cat " $ @ " | awk '{ print $ 1 } ' | sort | uniq } clean_wc ( ) { wc -l | sed 's / //g ' } common_files ( ) { local ext = " $ 1 " echo -ne " $ {ext} \t " echo -ne $ ( unique_md5s_by_ext $ ext sleuthkit | clean_wc ) " \t " for tools in photorec foremost " photorec foremost " ; do echo -ne $ ( unique_md5s_by_ext $ ext $ tools | clean_wc ) " \t " \ $ ( comm - 12 < ( unique_md5s $ tools ) < ( unique_md5s_by_ext $ ext sleuthkit ) | clean_wc ) " \t " \ $ ( comm - 12 < ( unique_md5s_by_ext $ ext $ tools ) < ( unique_md5s_by_ext $ ext sleuthkit ) | clean_wc ) " \t " done echo } common_files_total ( ) { echo -e " total \t " \ $ ( unique_md5s sleuthkit | clean_wc ) " \t " \ $ ( unique_md5s photorec | clean_wc ) " \t " \ $ ( comm - 12 < ( unique_md5s photorec ) < ( unique_md5s sleuthkit ) | clean_wc ) " \t \t " \ $ ( unique_md5s foremost | clean_wc ) " \t " \ $ ( comm - 12 < ( unique_md5s foremost ) < ( unique_md5s sleuthkit ) | clean_wc ) " \t \t " \ $ ( unique_md5s photorec foremost | clean_wc ) " \t " \ $ ( comm - 12 < ( unique_md5s foremost photorec ) < ( unique_md5s sleuthkit ) | clean_wc ) } echo -e " \t sleuthkit \t photorec \t \t \t foremost \t \t \t photorec+foremost " common_files_total for i in jpg gif mp3 avi mpg zip rar exe cab dll txt htm rtf pdf doc xls ; do common_files $ i done #!/bin/bash md5s_by_ext ( ) { local ext =$ 1 shift grep - hi " \.${ext}\ $ " " $ @ " | awk '{ print $ 1 } ' } unique_md5s_by_ext ( ) { md5s_by_ext " $ @ " | sort | uniq } unique_md5s ( ) { cat " $ @ " | awk '{ print $ 1 } ' | sort | uniq } clean_wc ( ) { wc -l | sed 's / //g' } common_files ( ) { local ext = " $ 1 " echo -ne " $ {ext}\t " echo -ne $ ( unique_md5s_by_ext $ ext sleuthkit | clean_wc ) " \t " for tools in photorec foremost " photorec foremost " ; do echo - ne $( unique_md5s_by_ext $ ext $ tools | clean_wc ) " \t " \ $ ( comm - 12 <( unique_md5s $ tools ) <( unique_md5s_by_ext $ ext sleuthkit ) | clean_wc ) " \t " \ $ ( comm - 12 <(unique_md5s_by_ext $ ext $ tools ) <( unique_md5s_by_ext $ ext sleuthkit ) | clean_wc ) " \t " done echo } common_files_total ( ) { echo -e " total\t " \ $ ( unique_md5s sleuthkit | clean_wc ) " \t " \ $ ( unique_md5s photorec | clean_wc ) " \t " \ $ ( comm - 12 <( unique_md5s photorec ) <( unique_md5s sleuthkit ) | clean_wc ) " \t\t " \ $ ( unique_md5s foremost | clean_wc ) " \t " \ $ ( comm - 12 <( unique_md5s foremost ) <( unique_md5s sleuthkit ) | clean_wc ) " \t\t " \ $ ( unique_md5s photorec foremost | clean_wc ) " \t " \ $ ( comm - 12 <( unique_md5s foremost photorec ) <( unique_md5s sleuthkit ) | clean_wc ) } echo -e " \tsleuthkit\tphotorec\t\t\tforemost\t\t\tphotorec+foremost " common_files_total for i in jpg gif mp3 avi mpg zip rar exe cab dll txt htm rtf pdf doc xls ; do common_files $ i done
And here are the results as a really ugly table :
sleuthkit photorec foremost photorec + foremost found matching matching
+ext found matching matching
+ext found matching matching
+ext total 4391 6600 3669 1210 771 6960 3718 jpg 831 768 711 711 853 747 747 901 755 755 gif 1 1 0 0 46 1 1 47 1 1 mp3 3218 4697 2851 2851 0 0 0 4697 2851 2851 avi 128 5 0 0 5 0 0 10 0 0 mpg 1 207 0 0 1 0 0 208 0 0 zip 5 3 3 3 13 0 0 16 3 3 rar 25 29 24 24 30 8 8 50 24 24 exe 37 60 4 4 78 6 6 83 6 6 cab 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 dll 10 69 6 6 71 7 7 80 8 8 txt 12 699 4 4 1 0 0 700 4 4 htm 6 0 2 0 3 1 1 3 2 1 rtf 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 pdf 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 doc 7 15 6 5 16 0 0 31 6 5 xls 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0
This table needs a bit of an explanation :
“ found ” means the number of files the tool extracted from the image
“ matching ” means the number of files the tool found that are identical with files recovered with the sleuth kit
“ matching +ext ” means that we ’ve also got the extension right
Foremost recovered almost 90 % of the images , Photorec following close behind 85 % , and it found only 8 photos that foremost could n’t identify .
Looking at other data types , Photorec is clearly superior : it found 24 of the 25 RAR files present in the image , foremost only got 8 of them right .
And only photorec was able to recover any mp3s : it found 89 % of them , but we also got quite some false positives here .
Neither of the tools was able to recover any movies – possibly because they were fragmented on disk .
Conclusion
So here comes the take home message :

What ’s the use of crying when you ’re sad ?
Other animals shed tears , but humans may be unique in shedding tears of grief , and Robert Provine says that he knows why : to send a signal .
“ Emotional tears are a breakthrough in the evolution of humans as a social species , ” says Dr. Provine , a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland , Baltimore County .
Writing in Evolutionary Psychology ( pdf ) , he reports the first experimental demonstration of what he calls the “ tear effect . ”
The subjects in the experiment were asked to rate the sadness of photographs of people crying , but in some of the photos the tears were digitally removed .
( The experiment used actual photographs of people , not the cartoon images shown above . )
When the tears were removed , the people were rated less sad , and their faces were often mistakenly interpreted as expressions of awe , puzzlement or concern .
Dr. Provine concludes :
Emotional tears resolve ambiguity and add meaning to the neuromuscular instrument of facial expression , what we term the tear effect .
Tears are not a benign secretory correlate of sadness or other emotional state .
Emotional tears may be exclusively human and , unlike associated vocal crying , do not develop until a few months after birth .
The emergence of emotional tearing during evolution and development is a significant but neglected advance in human social behavior that taps an already established secretory process involving the eye , a primary target of visual attention .
Dr. Provine says that so little is known about why adults cry that there are lots more questions to answer .
“ Do tears , for example , make a person appear more needy , helpless , frustrated , or powerless , as well as sadder ? ” he asks .
“ Do tears amplify a perceived emotional expression , add a unique message , or contribute a subtle nuance interpreted as sincerity or wistfulness ? ”
You ’re welcome to offer answers , or any thoughts on what may be another unique human trait : fake tears of sadness .
( As far I know , those crocodile tears are not shed by crocodiles or any other animals . )
Dr. Provine says he ’d like to test the effect of digitally adding tears to faces .
How widespread is the ability of people to cry fake tears , and how effective is that signal of sadness ?
STUTTGART , Germany , April 24 ( UPI ) -- A Romanian teenager who auctioned her virginity to fund her college studies in Germany has not said whether she will accept the top bid of $ 14,800 .
Alina Percea , who produced a doctor 's report saying she was still a virgin , after a teacher raised doubts about the subject , said previously she was seeking a sum nearly $ 59,000 higher than the top bid to help fund her college education in Stuttgart , Germany , The Sun ( London ) reported Friday .

" I want the first time I have sex to be special so I would n't want it to be a quickie , " Percea said at one point .
" The man who proves the most generous might get to stay with me for a full weekend but he has to pay for everything if we travel and stay in a hotel . "

Images from the ground of the Unha - 2 launch are starting to come in .
Besides an amazing satellite image by DigitalGlobe and presented by GlobalSecurity.org of the the Unha - 2 in flight , there are North Korean television images starting to appear in the West .
( I should mention that the flare at the of the rocket ’s contrail is not the rocket plume but rather indicates that the CCD camera on board the satellite saturated . )
I ’m going to be analyzing these images and hope to write more but I wanted to get these out as soon as possible .
There are a few comments I ’d like to make :
1 ) The first stage is not quite as large as I thought based on a slanted satellite view .
It ’s much closer to half the rocket length than the 2/3 that I originally thought .
I think I was mislead by the projection of the interstage as seen from a funny angle .
2 ) While you cannot see the individual nozzles on these images , you have to say its more consistent with a cluster of engines than a single engine .
( See this image of the missile in flight . )
3 ) The diameter is the first stage appears quite large .
More work needs to be done on measuring it .
4 ) No fins are visible on these images or the one the of the missile in flight .
While fins are not needed to insure a rocket ’s stable powered flight , some analysts had automatically put them on their models .
5 ) No clear indication one way or another ( at least with the cursory viewing of them I ’ve made so far ) of vernier engines or gimbaled engines .
Update :
It ’s a cluster !
I cannot tell for sure whether or not its 2 or 4 engines but it is definitely a cluster .
New info is coming so fast and furious that it ’s almost worth missing the Carnegie conference .
By the way , so many of you are viewing this site , I am having a very hard time posting updates !
This must be a good sign , but it ’s causing me a lot of problems with lost work .
Update :
The cluster of engines seems to use a single turbopump .
Its still possible , of course , that each nozzle has its own turbopump but given the location of the exhaust exit , Im guessing that its a single pump .
This implies a both a reduction in weight and an increase in sophistication on North Korea ’s part .
This image is a lot more convincing when you look at it in the video because you can see the exhaust plume from the turbopump pulsing .
Update : Gimbaled engines or jet vanes ?
I cannot tell for sure ( if you look at the image of the turbopump exhaust I point to above ) there appears to be four ( you can see two spaced approximately 1/ 4 the way around the stage ’s circumference ) members sticking down from the airframe to below the nozzles .
These could be either structural members to support the rocket on the launch pad or extensions for bringing down jet vanes to the level of the nozzle exits .
I frankly think the support structures is a more likely alternative so I ’m guessing the first stage is guided by gimbaled engines .
Update : I did n’t mean to rule out vernier engines .
They are certainly still a possibility .
Update : The DigitalGlobe / GlobalSecurity.org image of the Unha - 2 contrail is going to prove to be an analytical goldmine !
I have made a rough GoogleEarth overlay of it it .
Now , to find out the exact time the image was taken and use these to triangulate the Unha - 2 ’s trajectory during early flight !
The Great Australian Firewall has claimed another victim - some pages of Wikileaks have been added to the blacklist of websites which Australians are not allowed to look at .
The reason for the block is that Wikileaks published a list of websites banned by the Danish government .
Australian websites which link to the pages face the threat of a A$ 11,000 fine .
The move is part of a trial masterminded by Communications minister Stephen Conroy to test technology to block sites considered unsuitable for Australians .
The idea is that there will be two lists of approved websites - one for children and one for adults .
The plan was already looking increasingly ludicrous when an anti-abortion website was added to the list after a complaint .
Although unpleasant - the page including apparent pictures of aborted foetuses - it was not illegal child abuse imagery .
Popular broadband discussion forum Whirlpool was threatened with fines because one of its users posted a link to the page .
Conroy had previously claimed that only illegal child sexual abuse content would be included on the list .
Aussie ISPs have also railed against the idea , warning it will be expensive and ineffective , and could end up slowing internet access for everyone . ®
About a week ago I noticed that Google had quietly removed my favorite component of their on - line video services : video ranking .
It was an automated service that allowed users to be able to see which videos were viewed the most , blogged the most , and shared the most each day , week , and month .
This ranking system offered a unique snapshot of the internet video zeitgeist and oftentimes helped me find videos that I otherwise would not have found .
There was also the ability to seek out the popular videos based on geography through the country search .
This allowed me to find videos that were popular in England or Canada and compare them to the popular videos in America .
All there is now is Hot Videos , which does not provide the same depth of understanding the other metrics offered .
So why the removal of a popular feature with no note to the public ?
Well there was a tangentially related note posted back in January on Google ’s Blog about the discontinuing support for uploads to Google Video .
However , in their FAQ and blog entry there was no wayward mention that the video rankings would be taken away .
I understand that Google Video , the video hosting service , had to spend a great deal of time & money removing copyrighted material on an ongoing basis .
With YouTube already having to deal with this , it makes sense to consolidate the video operations within YouTube .
But why remove the rankings that cross over to all of the videos hosted by Google , including YouTube ?
It just does n’t make sense .
The only answer that I ’ve been able to come up with is the suppression of popular videos .
By removing the ability of users to see what videos are popular at a given time , Google can prevent users from sharing the popular videos with others .
If they want to prevent the next Zeitgeist film or rant about the smelly New World Odor , they have found the perfect way to do so : do n’t let people know what is popular through their on - line services .
Instead , make them find it themselves through other means .
But why would Google do this ?
What would be their motive ?
I really do n’t know , but it reminds me of the Samizdat in David Foster Wallace ’s Infinite Jest , where Google wants to prevent its users from watching The Entertainment in order to help maintain social cohesion .
But , alas , people will always find a way to obtain what they are looking for .
The only difference is that it now appears that Google is not being the best search engine it can be .
In summary , I do n’t care if Google stops allowing people to upload videos to their Google Video servers , people will find other servers , but do n’t remove popular methods of finding video content .
I want to know what the most viewed video was yesterday in _____[country ]
_____.
I want to know why ____________ was watched by more people yesterday than any other video on the internet .
Google once provided an excellent tool for knowledge discovery through it ’s rankings system but has taken it away without a decent reason .
So , dear Google , when will you reinstate the video rankings ?
… And why did you remove them in the first place ?

James Jones scores eight points in 11 seconds
This has to be a record of some sort .
James Jones had back - to - back four - point plays in the Heat ’s loss last night to the Hawks .
The two plays were part of a 14 - 0 ( and 19 - 2 ) run that got Miami back into the game late in the second quarter ( after falling behind by 21 points ) .
Due to the nature of the NBA game ( i.e. sooooooo many timeouts , the level of play ) , it ’s not often that you see a 14 - 0 run in a game .
And you NEVER see back to back four - point plays .
( Granted , it did n’t really look like Mike Bibby fouled him on that second make , but still . )
How would you feel if you were given a tax - free pay raise of $ 12,410 ?
I ’d imagine you ’d be pretty delighted – especially in the current economic climate .
OK , so you ’re not getting that raise , but i am going to tell you how to save $ 12 K over the next 12 months .
Trust me , this will be simpler than begging for a raise anyway !
Yes , we ’re talking about spending cuts .
Companies are doing it , schools doing it , and you must admit – the time has come for you to seriously consider cutting some ‘ extras ’ from your budget .
So get ready .
If you do all of these ( and they all wo n’t apply to everyone ) you will save $ 34 per day … that ’s $ 12,410 in a year .
( Note that figures are for illustrative purposes and have been rounded to the nearest 50 c . )
Brown - bag lunch – save $ 3 per day
Instead of buying your lunch out ( and spending $ 4 - $ 6 for an average sandwich ) , make sandwiches at home for $ 1 - 2 each .
Alternatively , take leftovers from last night ’s dinner , rather than leaving them to slowly turn to sludge in the fridge before you chuck them away .
Go vegetarian – save $ 2 per day
Try having a vegetarian meal in the evening .
The meat you eat at dinner is often more expensive than everything else on your plate : switch to a veggie protein source like quorn , tofu , beans or pulses , and you can easily save $ 2 or more per person .
( A pound of cheap beef is about $ 3 .
According to MSN Money , a pound of non-meat protein is typically well under $ 1 . )
Switch to store brands / house brands – save $ 2.50 per day
Are you a brand addict ?
Do all your food products come emblazoned with logos and company names ?
Try switching to non-branded goods ; you probably wo n’t even notice the difference .
You may even find you prefer them !
On a typical weekly shop , you ’ll save at least 30 % of your usual bill – for an average US household bill of over $ 3,000 on groceries per year , that ’s a saving of about $ 2.50 per day .
Take a thermos – save $ 3.50 per day
Instead of spending $ 4 for a latte on the way to work , take a thermos of coffee with you instead .
It might cost you $ 10 for the thermos , but after that , your daily coffee will cost you pennies .
You ’ll also avoid the line at Starbucks .
Leave your gym – save $ 2 per day
Did you join a gym at the start of January ?
Are you still on a membership plan from last year ?
Be honest with yourself about how often you go to the gym .
If it ’s once a week or less , it ’ll almost certainly work out cheaper to pay by the session .
And , of course , walking or jogging outside is completely free .
The average annual gym membership is $ 775 , so you ’ll be saving $ 2 per day .
Do n’t buy greetings cards – save 50 c per day
The average person buys over 50 greetings cards every year – at an average of $ 4 - $ 5 per card , that works out to over 50 c per day .
By making your own cards ( save ones you ’re sent and cut out motifs , or buy a pack of cheap craft papers ) , you ’ll be spending a few cents instead of a few dollars on each card .
If you ’re not the crafty type , why not send e-cards instead – they wo n’t cost you anything , and you ’ll be doing your bit for the environment .
Check out 123 Greetings for some free e-cards .
Bulk - buy non-perishable goods – save $ 4 per day
Stock up on non-perishable goods when they ’re on offer at your local store – or join a warehouse club to get bulk deals .
You ’ll typically save 30 % – 60 % on everything , about $ 4 per day on the average shopping bill .
Canned , bottled , dried and frozen groceries will all keep for weeks or months , and cleaning supplies can last for years .
Just do n’t make the mistake of spending money on something which you ’d not otherwise have bought .
Switch off the lights and television – save 50 c per day
Get yourself – and your family – into the habit of switching off lights and electrical appliances .
Not only will you be improving your green credentials , you ’ll be saving money on your electric bill .
Make sure computers and televisions are turned off rather than left on standby .
If you ’re leaving your computer for a short period of time , switch off the monitor .
Do n’t leave rooms lit if you ’re not in them .
Get your home insulated – save 50 c per day
Although you ’ll be paying for the initial work , you could easily save 50 c per day by making sure that your home ’s properly insulated – for the average American home , 50 % – 70 % of the energy bill is spent on heating and cooling .
Do n’t let the heat or cool air you ’re paying for leak straight out of your roof and walls – keep it inside where you want it !
Buy clothes on ebay – save $ 2.50 per day
The average American family spends over $ 1,700 on clothes each year – $ 4.65 per day .
Use ebay to look for clothing : you can find new and unworn items there , as well as second - hand bargains .
If you like big - name brands like Levi or Nike , you could make big savings by buying on ebay : easily saving 60 % or more on many garments .
Use your local library – save $ 2 per day
Instead of buying books and DVDs , use your local library .
Books are free to borrow , and DVDs will typically only cost a couple of dollars to rent .
If you ’d otherwise buy two books ( at $ 10.99 each ) and two DVDs ( at $ 29.99 ) , you ’d be saving over $ 2 per day , even allowing for DVD renting costs .
Car -pool with a neighbour or colleague – save $ 3 per day
Work out a schedule with a neighbour or colleague so that each of you drives half the time .
You could easily end up saving over $ 1,100 per year – $ 3 per day .
For example , a person with a 25 - miles - per - gallon car who drives 20 miles round - trip five days a week spends about $ 229 a month to drive alone .
That ’s $ 2,748 per year .
Car pooling with one person who drives half the time could cut costs in half , to $ 1,374 . ( Ventura County Star )
Buy multipacks of chips / cookies – save 50 c per day
Do you always buy a candy bar mid-afternoon ?
It probably costs $ 1 from the vending machine – but $ 2 could get you a multi- pack of six or eight candy bars .
You ’ll be saving about 50 c per day , which soon adds up .
Buy from Amazon – and use supersaver delivery – save $ 1
As most of us know , Amazon.com does n’t just do books .
Laptops , DVDs , kitchen equipment , homeware , exercise gear … prices on all of these are often cheaper on Amazon than in other stores .
( This newspaper report in the UK found that Amazon was the cheapest source of a number of popular goods . )
Your savings will vary depending how what you buy , but you could easily save at least $ 1 per day .
Carry a water bottle – save $ 1 per day
A one liter bottle of water costs about $ 1 .
Instead of buying a bottle of water every day , carry your own bottle with you whenever you go out .
You can fill it up from drinking fountains or drinking water taps in your workplace – saving $ 1 per day .
And there you have it : an extra $ 34 in your wallet every day , or $ 12,410 in the bank every year .
Can you think of any other ways to save a dollar or two per day , every day ?
Are there any methods above that you ’ll be trying out ?

SAN FRANCISCO , California ( CNN ) --
Imagine collecting thousands of empty plastic bottles , lashing them together to make a boat and sailing the thing from California to Australia , a journey of 11,000 miles ( 17,700 km ) through treacherous seas .
This 60 - foot sailboat , the Plastiki , is being built from more than 12,000 recycled plastic bottles .
You 'd have to be crazy , or trying to make a point .
David de Rothschild is trying to make a point .
De Rothschild hopes his one - of - a - kind vessel , now being built on a San Francisco pier , will boost recycling of plastic bottles , which he says are a symbol of global waste .
Except for the masts , which are metal , everything on the 60 - foot catamaran is made from recycled plastic .
" It 's all sail power , " he said .
" The idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere , or into our oceans for that matter , so everything on the boat will be composted .
Everything will be recycled .
Even the vessel is going to end up being recycled when we finish . "
De Rothschild 's vessel , scheduled to set sail from San Francisco in April , is called the Plastiki .
Its name is an homage of sorts to Thor Heyerdahl , the fabled Norwegian explorer who in 1947 sailed 4,300 miles across the Pacific on the Kon - Tiki , a raft made from balsa wood .
De Rothschild is something of an adventurer himself .
The scion of a wealthy British banking family , he is one of only several dozen people to traverse both the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps .
In 2005 he founded Adventure Ecology , an organization that uses field expeditions to call attention to environmental issues .
Watch how the boat is constructed »
Joining him on the Plastiki will be a permanent crew of three sailors and scientists plus a handful of other crew members who will rotate through the voyage .
The Plastiki is expected to stop in Hawaii , Tuvalu and Fiji on its way to Sydney , a trip estimated to take more than 100 days .
The plastic sailboat is taking shape in an old pier building not far from this city 's famous Fisherman 's Wharf .
Here , thousands of two - liter soda bottles are being stripped of their labels , washed , filled with dry-ice powder and then resealed .
The dry ice sublimates into carbon dioxide gas and pressurizes the bottle , making it rigid .
The vessel 's twin hulls will be filled with 12,000 to 16,000 bottles .
Skin - like panels made from recycled PET , a woven plastic fabric , will cover the hulls and a watertight cabin , which sleeps four .
" This actually is the same material that is made out of bottles , " said de Rothschild of the PET fabric .
" We actually wrap the PET fabric over the PET foam and then basically put it under a vacuum , heat it , press it and create these long PET panels .
So that means the boat is , technically , one giant bottle . "
Two wind turbines and an array of solar panels will charge a bank of 12 - volt batteries , which will power several onboard laptop computers , a GPS and SAT phone .
Only about 10 percent of the Plastiki will be made from new materials , de Rothschild said .
He declined to reveal how much it 's costing him to build the boat .
" We could potentially put together a boat that costs a fraction of what normal conventional boats are made of , " he said .
" The idea is to take the Plastiki , break it down [ after the voyage ] , and put it back into the system .
So , it may come out being a jacket , a bag , more bottles .
It 's infinitely recyclable . "
The ultimate goal of the Plastiki voyage is not just to encourage people to embrace clean , renewable energy but also to see consumer waste as a potential resource .
That 's what this is all about -- showcasing cradle - to - cradle products rather than cradle - to - grave , " de Rothschild said .
Whether the Plastiki will successfully complete its unique journey remains to be seen .
But to conservationists concerned about the amount of energy required to manufacture and distribute plastic bottles , its symbolic message is a welcome one .
" Anything that gets in the news and makes people stop and think about plastic can be very helpful , " said Betty McLaughlin , executive director of the Container Recycling Institute .
" But it strikes me as a long way to go .
I flew from Los Angeles to Australia once , and it took forever .
This trip strikes me as kind of dangerous . "
I always get a big kick out of caricatures .
It 's like the artists summon their inner kid as they exaggerate and distort certain characteristics of a person .
Collected here are some celebrity caricatures from some very talented artists – hopefully they 'll make you smile , maybe ever laugh .

Early on the afternoon of April 1 , Adam Wilson posted a message to Twitter .
But instead of using his hands to type , the University of Wisconsin biomedical engineer used his brain .
" USING EEG TO SEND TWEET , " he thought .
That message may be a modern equivalent of Alexander Graham Bell 's " Mr. Watson , come here .
I want to see you . "
Brain - computer interfaces are no longer just a gee - whiz technology , but a platform for researchers interested in immediate real - world applications for people who can think , but can't move .
" We 're more interested in the applications , " said Justin Williams , head of the University of Wisconsin 's Neural Interfaces lab .
" How do we actually make these technologies useful for people with disabilities ? "
The researchers built upon the BCI2000 , a software tool pioneered by Williams and Wadsworth Center neural injury specialist Gerwin Schalk .
The software translates thought - induced changes in a scalp 's electrical fields to control an on -screen cursor .
The BCI2000 is already used by 120 laboratories worldwide , but its communications applications have been largely restricted to messages appearing on a nearby screen .
" A lot of these have been scientific exercises , geared to writing things out but not really doing anything with it , " said Williams .
" We wanted to say , that 's not how a person would want to communicate , especially with the advent of online communications . "
The work is special because it meets the immediate needs of locked - in people , said Purdue University biomedical engineer Kevin Otto , who was not involved in the project .
" It 's in tune with what patients want , " said Otto .
" Social networking and communication is really their first desire .
There 's been quite a bit of success , and a few demonstrations , helping people to e-mail .
But the same reason why people choose Twitter and Facebook over e-mail is the same reason why this is significant . "
Williams described e-mail as a a relatively difficult and inefficient task for someone on a brain - computer interface .
" It 's difficult enough to be able to spell words , much less find an address book and select names .
The overhead involved in these applications is just too much , " he said .
" Twitter is very serendipitous .
It handles all the things that we 've been struggling to make easy for a patient to do .
It puts messages where people can find them .
Let the world know how you 're doing , what you 're thinking , and they 'll find you .
And that 's perfect for these patients and their families . "
Wilson will soon install their program in the homes of
10 people already outfitted with trial versions of the BCI2000 .
That system is not yet commercially available , but that day could come soon .
" It 's at the point where it 's beyond proof of concept , " Wilson said .
" We know it works .
The next question is how to integrate it into people 's homes , so that a caretaker could set it up without need for outside help . "
Other brain - computer interfaces may someday help people control robotic prostheses , even body - sheathing exoskeletons that return a user 's body to functionality .
" Those are going to be great applications in the future , but at the same time we need to see what BCIs can do right now , " said Williams .
Wilson 's later brain - to - Twitter messages included " GO BADGERS " and " SPELLING WITH MY BRAIN . "

There is new information found in an updated business plan that GM presented to the government on Wednesday .
The automaker is requesting an additional $ 2.6 billion in low interest loans to support the development and introduction of three new electric vehicles .
Specifically this is for the purpose of developing two spinoff cars from the Chevy Volt , and a third hybrid , and raises the amount GM is requesting from the section 136 , or ATVMIP loans to $ 10.3 billion .
These loans are intended to help companies build advanced technology high efficiency vehicles and are not related to the government funding GM currently possesses .
GM would n't be able to get these loans , which could be released as early as June , until they are deemed financially viable .
However this information confirms that GM has production plans to build two more EREVs , proving they do not intend the Volt to be a one - off or niche car .
Building multiple models in increasing volumes is the primary way to drive costs down for the battery technology .
GM has previously unveiled the strikingly designed Voltec - powered Cadillac Converj which could conceivably be one of those two cars .
GM -Volt.com has been told that one or more additional Voltec concepts would unveiled in 2009 .
There is speculation that one could be a Buick , perhaps based on the new China - based Excelle which sits atop the same compact delta platform the Volt and Cruze use .
Even if GM has to go through a quick - rinse bankruptcy to cleave off its bad assets , the company will survive lean and mean and if all goes to plan with at least electric cars to choose from .

Praising Jon Stewart for virtues other than comedy has become a cliché , as James Fallows noted in his Atlantic blog .
At this point it ’s hard to dispute that Stewart is not only the functional equivalent of a news anchor , but the most influential anchor in America .
Likewise , it ’s commonly recognized that jokes are merely a happy byproduct of Stewart ’s editorial alchemy .
Yet the foundation of the Daily Show , the reason it satisfies so deeply as it entertains , is only partly the thorough research and analytical intelligence it brings to bear on current events .
The crucial part of Stewart ’s formula is an exacting and sometimes harsh moral judgment .
Stewart is a TV preacher and shame is his drama .
He was widely viewed as a harsh political critic of George W. Bush and his administration .
More accurately , he was a moral critic of Bush , chastising the White House for hypocrisies more than policies ( though Stewart was not amused by torture ) .
His great genius is to wake up each day as a newborn , naïve and trusting , and to convey each night his shock and dismay at how soiled he ’s discovered the world to be .
If Stewart ’s effort to build a moral majority has a launch date , it is Oct. 15 , 2004 .
That ’s when , in the process of promoting his funny book , “ America , ” he appeared on CNN ’s Crossfire with Paul Begala and Tucker Carlson and stubbornly , even obnoxiously , refused to be funny .
Stewart ’s performance required a steely courage and Obamaesque level of self - belief .
But he quickly donned his inquisitor ’s robe and commandeered the show , transforming it into an expose of bankrupt talk show conventions .
He obliterated a tag team of skilled debaters — on their own show — by avoiding their turf , politics , and sidestepping what they mistakenly thought was his turf , comedy .
Instead , he pleaded with the Crossfire hosts to change their sinful ways and “ stop , stop , stop , stop hurting America ” with their cheesy show .
Billy Graham could n’t have said it with more pathos .
Crossfire , of course , was a tower of babble , premised on serial phoniness .
The fraud of the professionally feuding hosts .
The fraud of their Washington insider guests trading prepackaged sound and fury .
The fraud that the form and content of the program represented something grander , higher , than a swampland minstrel show .
A similar fraud is practiced by CNBC and , in fairness , practiced to a greater or lesser degree by virtually every television talking head at a network other than Comedy Central ( where the fraud of TV convention is , after all , the central gag ) .
Stewart ’s flaying of Jim Cramer , following his devastating eight - and - a - half minute dismantling of Cramer ’s network only days before , was locked down by the Daily Show ’s crack research team , which produced video of Cramer recalling his shady maneuvers as a hedge fund manager .
But on the Daily Show , the facts are put in service of Stewart ’s moral mission .
Stewart never once castigated Cramer for being dumb or naïve or mistaken or unwitting as the financial world imploded .
His complaint was that Cramer was immoral .
That he knowingly withheld knowledge of Wall Street ’s seedy machinations and thereby aided and abetted the crooks .
In effect , he accused the entire pom-pom brigade at CNBC of cheering on the thugs as they went about their muggings .
It ’s tempting to think of Stewart as a post - modern Murrow or Cronkite , creating an oasis of trust in the half - baked desert of television .
But he is less and more than that .
At its best , his show has more in common with the dramatic moments of the Watergate or Army - McCarthy hearings than with a newscast .
It enlightens less by a stream of information than by a moment of revelation .
To get away with this high - handed act , Stewart employs his “ jus ’ showbiz ” deflector , discounting his very real power and authority and routinely miniaturizing himself ( telling Begala and Carlson that his lowly show was preceded by a sock puppet ; declaring himself a “ snake oil salesman ” to Cramer ) .
Unlike the cavalcade of television preachers who came before him , the Bakkers and Swaggarts , Preacher Jon has so far exhibited the strength of character to forego the ego - driven cycle of sin , exposure and disgrace that plagues the televangelist ranks .
If he can continue to expose our hypocrisy without making noticeable contributions of his own , Stewart is poised to become one of the most significant figures in television history .
He probably is already .
It makes you wonder how , in earlier days and under different circumstances , he might have detoured television ’s drive to become the stupid — and stupid - making — medium , a status lamented by everyone from Reinhold Niebuhr and Newton Minnow to Ted Koppel .
But in the beginning , there was no Preacher Jon .
Let ’s face it , Soyuz is getting old .
It ’s not that the spaceships themselves are getting rickety , there have been many incarnations , but the original Soyuz design was first conceived in 1966 , so the Russian space agency ( Roscosmos ) is feeling it ’s about time for a change .
Soyuz has carried out the most manned missions into space out of any other space flight system ( over 100 since the 1960s ) , so Russia has every right to be proud of its achievements .
So what system does Roscosmos want to replace Soyuz with ?
Perhaps a bigger version of Soyuz ?
Perhaps a revolutionary winged spaceplane ?
Nope .
They are currently looking at plans for a Soyuz - esque capsule that will re-enter the Earth ’s atmosphere much like before .
But due to political pressure ( spawning the need to move Roscosmos ’ operations out of Kazakhstan ) , engineers must find a way to land the return vehicle in a minuscule area .
Measuring only 2×5 km ( yes , that ’s a tight 10 km2 ) , the landing strip will be as unforgiving as the new method to land the descent vehicle .
There will be no parachutes and no wings ; the new concept will use a rocket - powered landing system alone , creating the first ever rocket - powered Earth - lander .
If you thought that was a rather extreme design specification , you might be surprised to hear that engineers want to start firing these landing thrusters when the descent module is only 600 - 800 metres from the ground …
All previous Soyuz descent capsules have been slowed via a combination of atmospheric drag ( hence the need for ceramic tiles to withstand the extreme heating inflicted on the vehicle ) , parachute - aided descent and then a small burst from a solid rocket to ensure a soft landing .
Apart from a few ballistic re-entries , and a few early fatalities ( Soyuz 1 and Soyuz 11 ) , this system has worked well .
Unfortunately for Roscosmos , Moscow has decided to move space launch and landing operations out of the newly independent republic of Kazakhstan to a new spaceport being constructed in eastern Russia .
This imposes a huge design restraint on the new spaceship , it ca n’t use the vast wilderness of Kazakhstan to parachute into .
The current primary landing zone for Soyuz is 25×30 km , making a reasonably - sized target for the descent module to aim for .
Even during the bungled April 2008 hard landing , where a ballistic re-entry forced the Soyuz descent module to miss the 750 km2 landing zone by 400 km , at least there was plenty of flat Kazakhstan to bump into .
The new landing zone will be 1.3 % the size of the old one , meaning the new landing system will have to be more precise than a parachute - aided landing .
Cue the rocket - powered precision landing descent vehicle for Russia ’s next generation spacecraft .
Although I love the artistic rendering of the spaceship in orbit and the descent vehicle ( the panels riveted together and scorch - marks are a special gritty pleasure for me ) , to rely on a rocket powered landing seems a little risky .
This next generation descent vehicle will have one of the most insane landing profiles I have ever thought possible ( “ possible ” ?
I use that word very lightly ) .
Basically , using atmospheric ablation to slow it down in the first instance is perfectly fine , Soyuz does , as does the Shuttle , but it would appear that the plan is then to allow the vehicle to fall , at terminal velocity , to an altitude of 600 - 800 meters before igniting it ’s landing rockets .
Hold on .
Meters ?
Yes , meters .
According to the presentation made by Nikolai Bryukhanov , the leading designer at RKK Energia , at the 26th International Symposium on Space Technology and Science in Hamamatsu , Japan , the spacecraft would fire its engines at an altitude of just 600 - 800 m , as the capsule is streaking toward Earth after re-entering the atmosphere at the end of its mission .

I spat my coffee across the keyboard too .
But it ’s OK , the “ precision landing motors ” will fire at 30 meters , to guide the lander to the 10 km2 landing strip .
If one of the landing rockets did n’t fail ( or slightly under - perform ) that is .
Call me cynical , but I ’d be happiest if I could glide into landing on a huge airstrip .
If I do n’t have that , parachutes would do .
Preferably three of them , in case one fails , at least the other two will ensure I do n’t end up pancaked inside a flattened chunk of smouldering metal .
Hard landings do happen , regardless of how robust a system is , but to depend wholly on a rocket - powered breaking system to get cosmonauts and astronauts back to Earth seems a little extreme .
Perhaps the design of the landing strip needs to be looked at , designing the space vehicle around a landing strip probably is n’t the best way to go .
Apparently , I ’m not the only skeptic , but the design is obviously being considered .
Rocket - powered manned landings have been achieved on the Moon , there have been a few US and Russian designs incorporating rockets and rocket engine technology is becoming more and more reliable .
However , to control the descent of a free - falling space vehicle , bringing it to a stop within 800 meters from the ground leaves little ( if any ) margin for error .

The Wolfhound eats Krugman alive , along with another windbag .
Click here .
Click here to see IrishCentral 's first pin in ' Professor ' Krugman 's balloon !
Economics , they say , is the dismal science .
And , it becomes dismally gloomy in the hands of someone like Paul Krugman whose opinion piece on Ireland ’s economic challenges ( Erin Go Broke - April 20 , 2009 ) contained egregious errors which clearly compromise the conclusions he allows himself to reach .
He reports that “ Ireland moved to shore up confidence in its banks by offering a government guarantee on their liabilities ” .
This is not true .
And , it is incorrect by a magnitude that cannot simply be glossed over .
The Dublin Government only guaranteed bank deposits - something the Federal Government here did back in 1933 with the establishment of the FDIC ..
Thus , his assessment that Ireland ’ taxpayers have been put on the hook for potential losses of more than twice the country ’s G.D.P. is plainly and simply wrong .
Ireland has the most open economy on earth .
When international trade tanks , you can be sure that Ireland feels the pain .
And , it has .
But , this is not news .
A long time ago , Ireland chose the strategic option to be a free - trading nation with low corporate taxes to encourage enterprise and faster economic growth .
The Irish economy has weathered all the recessions ever since the policy was adopted over 60 years ago .
But , it has also been the fastest - growing economy in the world for most of the past 25 years .
Professor Krugman also paints a big picture that is disappointingly negative and inaccurate .
He says that Ireland has raised taxes and cut spending .
Well , a closer look at what Ireland ’s response has been is more instructive .
The very low corporate tax rate , obviously , was not touched .
Personal income tax rates were not increased .
Sales taxes ( or Value Added Taxes ) did not get hiked .
So , there were some ( but I would have to say minor ) tax increases .
But , the real story is that the Government in Ireland has taken a scalpel to Government spending – but in areas that make sense – especially the cost of Government .
For example , if private companies have to cut labor costs to survive , the Irish Government thinking is that public employees , who can not be fired , must also shoulder some burden .
Thus , every Government employee will see their wages cut by 20 % .
Not very nice if you are a Government worker – but I suppose it ’s better than losing your job
Finally , Mr. Krugman does not take the great opportunity he had to contrast the Irish Government ’s interesting and imaginative policy response to the banking crisis with the U.S. policies that have been announced .
The problem real estate loans of Ireland ’s banks will be ring - fenced in a sort of asset lockbox and will be managed back to health in time .
Thus , these problem legacy assets will no longer taint the balance sheets of the banks .
More importantly , Ireland ’s taxpayers will reap the rewards of the upside when asset values recover – something never mentioned in his piece .
The recapitalization of Ireland ’s banks has been undertaken in a timely and prudent manner .
The Government ’s liquidity injection to the banking system came in the form of preference share capital in the two largest banks .
Importantly , ownership of the vast majority of Ireland ’s banking system remains in the hands of private shareholders .
Even after these capital injections have been made with Government funds , Ireland 's total national debt ( even allowing for the increase in debt levels recently ) is today less than the total corporate debt of AT&T , Inc. - the slimmed - down regional Bell !
The great thing about a democracy is that opinion journalists are free to be depres singly negative if they choose to be .
The current international financial and economic crisis provides a grand platform for the pessimists to strut their stuff .
A little look on the bright side now and again might do a power of good for Dr. Krugman ’s dismal outlook .
