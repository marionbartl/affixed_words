A Florida teenager says he was kidnapped at gunpoint , driven to a Walmart and forced to buy his captors a PlayStation 3 for the new super - low price of $ 299.99 .
Cops have arrested one suspect .

The Naples , Fla .
teen says two guys in a white pickup truck blocked his car as he tried to enter a gated community where his friend lives .
Two guys , one with an assault rifle , the other with a pistol , jumped out , drove him to his stepfather 's home in another gated community to steal some jewelry .
Then it was off to Walmart with stepdad 's credit card .
There , the victim says one of his captors demanded he buy him a shotgun .
But it being past 8:30 , the gun counter was closed .
So the bandits said they 'd settle for a PS3 Slim , which the victim bought .
They then set him free , and he went running to the law .

Yeah , there 's been one arrest , and it sounds like there 's surveillance footage , but let 's show a little skepticism here .
If this is true , two dudes just went to a hell of a lot of trouble and are facing a whale of a stay in the joint to pull off the heist of a lifetime - a PS3 - before turning loose their rich captive .
Kidnapping , plus a gun crime does n't just get pled down to loud muffler and disorderly conduct because you netted $ 300 in merch .
Plus there 's the matter of the suspect 's fingerprints not being found inside the house .
That does n't stop WBBH - TV .
Be sure to watch that video .
I do n't know East Naples or Immokalee from Muncie , Indiana but it sounds like the reporter 's reminding us both places are the H - double - O - D hood .
And remember , " Jane , " ( if that 's your real name ) you 're not safe anywhere , even behind rich people gates .
Another shining example of local news teaching you to hate and fear your world .
Teen Accused of Kidnapping Teen at Gunpoint , Forces Him to Buy Playstation 3 [ Naples Daily News via Hot Blooded Gaming ]
WASHINGTON — A group promoting skepticism over widely - accredited climate change science has a web of connections to influential oil giant Exxon - Mobil , Raw Story has found .
The organization is called the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change ( NIPCC ) , apparently named after the UN coalition International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
An investigation into the group reveals its numerous links to Exxon - Mobil , a vehement opponent of climate legislation and notorious among scientists for funding global warming skeptics .

“ Exxon - Mobil essentially funds people to lie , ” Joseph Romm , lauded climate expert and author of the blog Climate Progress , told Raw Story .
“ It ’s important for people to understand that they pay off the overwhelming majority of groups in the area of junk science . ”
The NIPCC ’s signature report , “ Climate Change Reconsidered , ” disputes the notion that global warming is human - caused , insisting in its policy summary that “ Nature , not human activity , rules the planet . ”
Many of its assertions have been challenged by , among others , the scientists ’ blog RealClimate .
The report was released and promoted this summer by the Heartland Institute , a think tank that claims to support “ common - sense environmentalism ” as opposed to “ more extreme environmental activism . ”
It alleges that “ Global warming is a prime example of the alarmism that characterizes much of the environmental movement . ”
“ To call global warming a hoax is to question every scientific journal , every scientific academy , and buy into the most extreme conspiracy theories , ” Romm said .
Heartland has received at least $ 676,500 from Exxon - Mobil since 1998 , the year Exxon launched a campaign to oppose the Kyoto Treaty , according to official documents of the two groups that have been compiled and reproduced by the website ExxonSecrets.org .
Also , the institute ’s self - described Government Relations Adviser Walter F. Buchholtz has been a lobbyist for Exxon - Mobil , the Washington Post reported in 2004 .

The study ’s two principal authors and NIPCC leaders S Fred Singer and Craig D Idso are both associated with various organizations that have gotten generous funding from Exxon - Mobil .
Singer has researched and published for the Cato Institute , which has accepted $ 125,000 in grants from Exxon - Mobil since 1998 .
Other professional affiliations include the National Center for Policy Analysis , Frontiers of Freedom , and American Council on Science and Health — which have accepted contributions of $ 540,000 , $ 1.27 million and $ 150,000 , respectively , from Exxon .
Although some praise him as a hero , Singer has been slammed by many fellow climate scientists as “ a fraud , a charlatan and a showman ” for his unorthodox views and research .

His co-author Idso is founder , board chairman and former president of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change , whose mission statement is to “ separate reality from rhetoric in the emotionally - charged debate that swirls around the subject of carbon dioxide and global change . ”
The organization has taken $ 100,000 in funding from Exxon since 1998 , according to the oil company ’s reports .
Idso is also affiliated with the George Marshall Institute , which has reportedly won $ 840,000 from Exxon .

Exxon - Mobil has spent more money lobbying Congress in the last two years than any enterprise other than the Chamber of Commerce , dishing out $ 29 million in 2008 and over $ 20 million so far in 2009 to legislators .
It ’s among the top 10 biggest spenders of lobbying cash since 1998 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
“ Exxon has waged certainly the biggest , most concerted , and most extreme disinformation campaign on this issue , ” Romm told Raw Story .
“ The trouble is they do n’t have to win the argument — all they have to do is blow smoke and cast doubt , and they ’ve accomplished their end . ”
In a recent incident , hackers exposed private emails exchanged between climate scientists .
Some said the revealed information did n’t add up to a conspiracy , while others declared it definitive proof that anthropogenic global warming is made - up .

The Senate will soon take up the mantle on climate bill that the House narrowly passed this summer , and a heated debate is likely to occur in Congress over the nature of the threat and the type of action that needs to be taken .
“ I think we ’re going to pass it , but it ’s going to be an epic struggle , ” Romm said .
Republican Sen. Orrin Harch has referenced the NIPCC report , calling it a “ Comprehensive scientific answer to the IPCC [ sic ] Reports . ”
Various blogs , such the conservative Free Republic , have touted this report as evidence that “ global warming is not a crisis , and never was . ”
Hey , does this look vaguely familiar ?
That is not a different view of the Norway spiral light ; it was taken in Russia over a day later .
It looks like the Russians are testing more rockets , and creating more lights in the sky .
Despite the lunacy involved with the last time we saw spirals in the sky , this picture is clearly of another Russian missile test .
To recap : a weird spiral light thingy in the skies over Norway last week was caused by the sub - based rocket launch of a Bulava missile , a new system being tested by the Russians .
The spiral (s ) were due to the rocket spinning and venting some sort of gas , though the details are still being determined .
It may have been done on purpose as part of a gyroscopic - stabilization move , or it may have been spinning out of control .
The former would explain why the spiral is so beautifully symmetric .
This one was n't quite so well - formed , but is clearly the same thing .
There 's video , too :
This new one was seen just a little over a day later inside Russia , and was from a Topol missile , the land - based version of the Bulava .
According to space historian , NBC News consultant , and space folklore specialist James Oberg :
It was launched from the ' Kapustin Yar ' missile range on the lower Volga , an old test range that goes back to the late 1940s .
The missile impacted in the Sary Shagan military reservation in eastern Kazakhstan . [...]
Since the flight path was completely internal , no navigation warnings were issued .
TASS claims it hit the target , and you can see in the video there appears to be a spiral there too ; that supports the idea the spiral was on purpose and may be part of the stabilization .
Interesting .
Note that in this second picture , you can see the spiral expanding from the inside out , again , like last time , exactly what you expect from material being spewed out from a rapidly rotating booster .
Another important thing to people like me , though , is that the cause of this is clearly a rocket -- it fits what we know about how these things work , there are good explanations of it , and we even have a mea culpa from Russia .
But if you read the comments from the Norway lights post I made , or really anywhere this was discussed on the web , you 'll find hordes of people making claims that are pretty silly at best .
I have no doubt this will continue with this new sighting , as well .
After all , why make one interdimensional holographic portal from the future when you can make two ?
It just goes to show you that this sort of non-rational thinking will be with us forever .
It 's rather ironic to think that the reality of a complicated and advanced rocket system sparks retro-fantasies of UFOs .
It makes me wonder if the captain of the first starship will carry a lucky rabbit 's foot along .
In reality , I know we can never stamp out such irrationality .
All we can do is hope to minimize it .
I can be satisfied with that .

In a new study , psychologists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham ( UAB ) are able to see in detail for the first time how various regions of the human brain respond when people experience an unexpected or traumatic event .
The study could lead to the creation of biological measures that could identify people with post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) or identify PTSD sufferers who would benefit from specific treatments .
In the study , UAB researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to see how activity in the parts of the brain associated with fear , learning and memory respond when research participants were startled by a loud static sound and when they were able to correctly predict when the sound would occur .
" When the noise is unexpected , the brain 's response is larger , " said UAB psychologist David Knight , Ph.D. , principal investigator on the study , which is currently in press online and will appear in the January 2010 issue of the journal NeuroImage .
" But when participants are able to predict when they are going to hear the unpleasant static noise , you can see the regions of the brain quiet down so that a smaller emotional response is produced .
UAB Psychologist David Knight , Ph.D. , discusses his latest research on the brain 's response to distress and unexpected events .

" While past studies have looked at this startle phenomenon behaviorally , this is the first look at what is actually happening in these regions of the brain when someone is exposed to an unpleasant , unpredictable event , " Knight said .
In the study , UAB psychologists placed 15 healthy adults in an fMRI scanner and asked them to listen to a series of low - and high - pitched tones .
Some tones predicted a loud static sound would follow , while other tones predicted that the static sound would not occur .
During the study , participants were asked to rate the tones between zero and 100 ; zero if they did not expect to hear the static sound , 100 if the static sound was expected and 50 if they could not make a prediction .
In addition , the researchers measured the participants ' skin responses such as sweaty palms to determine how much the participants were physically bothered by the static noise .
The researchers then correlated the skin and brain responses to evaluate how brain activity influences emotional expression .
An analysis of the brain scans showed that unpleasant events produced activity within the frontal lobe of the brain .
The amount of activity was reduced when participants expected the unpleasant event , but not when the event was unexpected .
Further , the amount of activity within these brain regions controlled the emotional response that was expressed .
" These findings are a first step in identifying techniques and procedures that will allow us in future studies to go in and look at patient populations and better understand how their brains respond to negative or unpleasant stimuli , " Knight said .
" Those studies will hopefully lead to other studies in which we can perhaps try different medications with these individuals and see if that alters their brains to aversive stimuli , " he said .
" With that information , we can start to develop biological markers using fMRI that may help us better identify and treat different types of disorders . "

Fed chair Ben Bernanke releases new rule on overdraft fees .
An eyeblink glance at the economy View photos
The economy has grown for five straight quarters , but there are signs that the recovery is still fragile .
WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Federal Reserve on Thursday released a new rule to prohibit banks from automatically enrolling customers in overdraft protection programs , which charge fees when consumers spend more than they have .
Starting on July 1 , 2010 , all banks will have to ask their customers to opt in to overdraft protection plans for ATM and most debit card transactions .
Some banks charge as much as $ 39 when customers overdraw their bank account by even a few dollars .
" The final overdraft rules represent an important step forward in consumer protection , " Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a statement .
" Both new and existing account holders will be able to make informed decisions about whether to sign up for an overdraft service . "
Currently , more than 75 % of banks automatically sign customers up for overdraft programs , according to a study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
The new rule only affects overdraft fee services on ATM and one - time debit transactions .
Banks will still be allowed to automatically enroll customers in overdraft services for personal checks and automatic transactions like monthly bill payments .
Congress is also weighing action to clamp down on overdraft fees .
On the legislative agenda are proposals to force banks to ask customers before they automatically enroll them in overdraft programs .
The congressional bills are tougher than the Fed 's rules .
The Senate would empower banking regulators to set overdraft fees in a way that is " reasonable and proportional " and disclose to consumers details about how an overdraft charge was incurred and what can be done to fix an account balance on the same day the overdraft fee is charged .
The House would cap the number of times banks can charge overdraft fees at three a year .
It also would force banks to tell customers when an account is on the verge of being overdrawn , so they can decide whether a purchase is worth an overdraft fee .
Yet , the current congressional proposals would n't go into effect until one year after passage , though they would prohibit banks from increasing overdraft fees in the wait time .
The Fed has been under fire for not paying enough attention to consumer protection .
Separate from the overdraft legislation , Congress is proposing to strip the Fed of its consumer protection duties and create a separate consumer agency .
Lately the Fed has picked up the pace of its consumer protection activity .
Last year , it approved a rule to rein in credit card fees , but Congress enacted credit card rules that will take effect in February before the Fed rules go into effect .
On Thursday , Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , and Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , generally praised the Fed 's latest move .
" This is a long - overdue announcement for American consumers , " said Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , which is set to hold a hearing on overdraft fees on Tuesday .
Maloney called the rules a " good step forward " but added that Congress needed to press ahead .
She said in a statement that the Fed rules still allow banks to charge an " unlimited quantity " of fees and " do nothing to make fees proportional to the amount of the overdraft . "
For banks , overdraft fees are a big revenue generator because so many people rely on debit cards .
Some 75 out of 100 financial transactions are electronic , according to Moebs Services Inc. , an economic research firm .
The financial services industry is on track to make $ 38.5 billion this year on overdraft and non-sufficient fund fees , up 38 % from $ 27.9 billion five years ago , Moebs estimates .
The banking industry was not pleased by the Fed 's move .
" It radically changes and alters the overdraft services for consumers , " said Scott Talbott , chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable .
" The result will be confusion and embarrassment and frustration . "
In the initial series I summarized the argument in Ishmael by saying
The expansion of agriculture to feed the population serves to enlarge the population necessitating the continued expansion of agriculture to feed an ever - growing population .
The result of the ongoing “ progression ” and evolution of agriculture has not actually resulted in fewer people going hungry .
The Story of B goes further in exploring some of the implications of this idea .
He uses the analogy of mice in a cage .
If you feed the mice a certain amount of food they will reproduce and grow in population size as long as the amount of food is able to sustain the number of mice .
If you then increase the amount of food the population will continue to increase .
If you stop increasing the food the population will level off and remain basically static .
If you incrementally decrease the ration of food the population will decrease .
When that idea is translated to human beings it sounds very unnerving , callous and disturbing .
The productivists argue that agricultural production has continued to increase and keep pace with world population .
There is no real conversation about the relationship or correlation between production and population .
We know that the world hunger problem is not a production problem , but a distribution problem .
The world now produces enough food for every human being on the planet to have 3,500 calories per day , which is more than the recommended amount .
So , why do we continue to push for higher production and greater yield to solve the population problem ?
Are we in fact fueling the population crisis by continually increasing our production ?
Some will question how this can be true when population growth is correlated to other factors like income or education .
The character B ’s response in the book is over and over again to ask what people are made of if they are not made of food .
If the population continues to increase , then the larger population must sustain itself somehow and the only way that is possible is by eating something .
That certainly does n’t mean the larger population is eating well , but they are eating enough to survive .
Whether production increases or decreases , distribution is the real problem .
Either way inequality will continue as long as food is not distributed equitably .
The underlying question concerning population growth is whether we can actually deal with the problem if we are continuing to fuel it by producing more and more food .
When I mention the possibility of decreasing production as a way of dealing with the population problem , it sounds like I ’m recommending starving the marginal brown people of the world .
As the system currently stands that would certainly be the case if we simply decreased production overall .
A decrease in production would have to go hand in hand with an overhaul of how our food system functions .
This is a long term problem that requires long term thinking and solutions .
The planet we live on has a limit to the amount of life it can sustain .
Like an elevator or bridge that is only built to handle a certain weight , the earth has certain limits built into the ecosystems .
We can push those boundaries with technology and science , but eventually they will break .
For many in the world they have already broken , and they suffer the consequences of our over extension of the planet ’s resources .
We do n’t like to think that we are responsible or in control of other people dying .
The truth is we already are responsible for that .
Our ( American ) culture has an uneasy and unnatural relationship with death .
Death is a natural part of life .
Decreasing food production ( in concert with reorganizing our food system ) may in fact be the most ethical and just choice given the trajectory of human society .
This would , of course , be a long gradual process in which the reduction of food production and slowing of population growth would happen naturally over many decades , if not centuries .
Please share your thoughts and objections .
I know this probably sounds scary and crazy to some , but a lot of it makes sense to me .
I would appreciate thinking it through more thoroughly with your help .

I went to the first Android - focused barcamp ( droidcamp ) which took place in Berlin - Dahlem this week .
It was organised in conjunction with the more formal , pay - for droidcon , which happened the next day , same location .
From what I gathered the entrance fees for droidcon partially subsidised the barcamp , an interesting concept .
In the end lots of people attended both conferences ( I did n’t ) .
There was a great interest in droidcamp beforehand , most of the tickets were snapped up in the first hour after registration opened .
Luckily another 50 tickets were made available shortly afterwards , resulting in a total number of attendees of around 200 .
I was expecting the barcamp to be a mostly German - dominated event but was proven wrong - the introduction round was done in English and there were indeed quite a few people travelling from abroad to attend .
Consequently most sessions were done in English , with the odd exception .
Sessions
The quality of sessions ( overview ) was quite high - a mix of code and app marketing related talks , except for two pitch sessions .
The first talk I went to see was “ Music creation for Android ” by Alex Shaw , who demonstrated his synthesiser built using the NDK ( native development kit ) .
Compared to the iPhone , interesting Android music apps are still hard to find , so it was good to see someone working on that .
Next one up was “ OpenStreetMap on Android ” which gave an overview of the different libraries and apps using OSM data .
For example there is osmdroid which aims to provide a free replacement for Google ’s MapView class .
I was particularly interested in the offline capabilities , a huge advantage over Google ’s solution which always requires an Internet connection .
The web widget development talk ( Jo Ritter ) made obvious in what a mess the widget standardisation process is in at the moment – there are at least three different “ standards ” being worked on , all in different states of completion .
It ’s probably best to wait a while before any sort of merging happens .
Carl Harroch presented RESTProvider , an interesting framework to consume REST services using Android ’s ContentProvider API .
Afterwards Stefan Alund gave an early look at the DroidPush API ( slides ) , currently being developed at Ericsson .
My talk was next , with the aim to convince attendees of Scala ’s merits for Android development ( slides ) .
I think I managed to confuse some people with a mostly code snippet based presentation , but still had a few interested people asking questions afterwards .
It seems that developers are mostly concerned about tool support ( i.e. full integration in Eclipse ) and performance / memory consumption issues , so it would be good to do some research and profiling of a real Scala Android app ( there are hardly any at the moment ) .
The DalvikVM is quite a different beast , so some optimisations in Scala geared towards the JVM might not be applicable there .
Regardless
I ’m still convinced that Scala is a good fit for doing development on Android , so hopefully more people will get interested and start experimenting .
The last session I attended was an open discussion about the state of open source projects on Android , hosted by Friedger Müffke .
Google ’s open source credibility has suffered a bit recently when they sent a “ cease and desist ” letter to the developer of cyanogen , a popular firmware replacement ( it included some closed source apps ) .
Apparently the community is now working on open source replacements for some of these components .
Unfortunately I missed two interesting looking sessions , both gaming related : urban golf and Mister X goes Android , a location - based game which got played and talked a lot about during the barcamp .
Summary
It was great barcamp , very well - run and with lots of interesting attendees and sessions .
There definitely is a big interest in Android right now , and a common talking point amongst attendees was the notion that Android will “ really take off ” in 2010 .
Let ’s hope it happens , most people have been waiting for quite a while now :) .
Here ’s another list of “ hot topics ” at droidcamp .

Portugal ’s Left Bloc has achieved a major breakthrough in the last five months .
It polled nearly 11 % and 10 % respectively in the recent European and parliamentary legislative elections in June and September 2009 .
For a party that is firmly established outside of left social democracy this is a major achievement .
How did it happen ?
Its success is owed to a combination of objective and subjective factors .
The objective factors are rooted in Portugal ’s 20th century history while the subjective factors are linked to how the Left Bloc was formed and how it operates and engages with people in Portugal .
The left in Britain and particularly in England can learn from the development and practice of the Left Bloc .
Portugal ’s situation
Portugal was ruled by a right - wing military dictatorship for over 30 years .
The primary resistance during this period was the Portuguese Communist Party ( PCP ) .
The dictatorship was overthrown in 1974 by a military coup organised by the young officers who had been conscripted to fight in imperialist wars in Africa .
This coup evolved over a period of 18 months into a revolutionary movement involving millions of people .
They seized land and workers ' and people 's councils where set up all over Portugal .
A situation of dual power developed between this new form of revolutionary democracy and a counterposed capitalist democracy .
Only a failed left - wing counter military coup finally drove the revolution in the direction of a capitalist democracy .
The PCP , despite its role in facilitating the emergence of the new capitalist democracy , remained popular and gained up to 20 % of the popular vote in a series of elections in the years after the revolution .
It also controlled the major trade union federation .
At the same time a number of Trotskyist , Maoist and other revolutionary groups emerged from the revolution as a diversity of ideas and solutions exploded during the 18 - month revolutionary period after the 1974 coup .
However , they were fragmented and small and lived in the shadow of the large PCP .
The PCP was however very bureaucratic and set out to control all the social movements .
It was also , Western Europe ’s most Stalinist communist party .
For example it backed the coup against former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev .
In addition to these factors Portugal is and remains one of the poorest countries in western Europe .
It also , had / has the influence of a right - wing Catholic Church which supported the dictatorship and has had a strong role in forming reactionary social attitudes on women and homosexuality .
Finally , Portugal because of its colonial past has a multicultural population .
The Revolutionary Socialist Party ( Partido Socialista Revolucionário , PSR ) , the Portuguese section of the Fourth International , had in an open and democratic way tried to build a party using the classical methods that we have seen attempted in Britain by several organisations .
The PSR ’s success was modest – never gaining more than 2 % in elections despite them having a “ correct program ” which was clearly presented to the Portuguese population and having the “ right ” line on most of the key issues which arose in Portugal .
The PSR turned to other currents on the left in an attempt to create a wider party that could attract the thousands of activists that were involved in the wider political and social campaigns .
The origins of Left Bloc
The Left Bloc was formed by three currents that had emerged from the revolution .
These groups were the People ’s Democratic Union ( União Democrática Popular , UDP ) a pro-Albanian Maoist group ( Portugal has a large peasant population ) , the Revolutionary Socialist Party and Politics XXI ( Política XXI , PXXI ) , a group of ex-Communist Party thinkers .
The Left Bloc ’s real success was attracting initially hundreds and now thousands of independent activists from the political movements .
Discussions on the formation of the Left Bloc began in mid-1998 .
The PSR , UDP and Politics XXI took the first steps to reaching a basic political agreement and setting the basis for the new movement , without rushing into a fusion , without dissolving the existing organisations and without requiring unity in all areas of activity .
The presence from the beginning of independents who supported the project was a crucial aspect of the Left Bloc and gave it a much broader appeal than that of a simple electoral alliance of the three organisations .
At the same time a political and organisational agreement between the organisations committed them to make the Left Bloc a space for the convergence of positions and practices , not an area for political disputes , thereby enabling rapid progress in building the structures needed for the electoral and political campaigns that followed .
A key to the success of this coming together of the different left tendencies was a desire to build a movement / party that could play a key role in changing society .
This meant putting aside all political and personal ambitions .
It required a maturity driven by the desire to build a socialist society and accepting that no one party or individual had all the answers .
It also , was a realisation that there are many paths to being an activist and militant and these are shaped by each individual ’s objective and subjective conditions .
The Left Bloc has become increasingly popular of the last 10 years , especially among youth , with imaginative campaigns and dynamic proposals , the majority of its support comes from colleges , cities and educated youth or adults from the countryside , gathering both urban educated communities and dynamic trade unions , together with defenders of human rights and women ’s rights , the rights of immigrants and minorities ( they are especially involved in supporting a strongly multicultural society ) , and also many ecologists .
At this point the Left Bloc is seen by some as an alternative and refreshing “ new ” left political party to the older and more established Portuguese Communist Party and the centre left Socialist Party .
It is a diverse entity formed by people with multiple backgrounds .
The Left Bloc proposed Portugal ’s first law on domestic violence , which was passed in parliament with the support of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party , and other important laws on civil rights and guarantees , including the protection of citizens from racism , xenophobia and discrimination , gay marriage laws , laws for the protection of workers , legalisation of drugs and anti-bullfighting laws .
The Left Bloc has also campaigned for free legal safe abortion laws , allowing women to decide what they want to do with their bodies .
Hundreds of trade union representatives , at factory level and at national level , appealed for a vote for the Left Bloc in September 2009 ’s elections .
In Portugal there are still workers ’ commissions ( a remnant of the 1974 revolution ) that are directly elected in each workplace .
In Portugal ’s biggest workplace , Ford - Volkswagen in Setubal , the Left Bloc ’s supporters are the majority .
As an example of the Left Bloc ’s innovative campaigning style , it created a board game and circulated it among young people .
If the dice fell on a social problem you had to move back , if it fell on one of the Left Bloc ’s proposals you could move forward and win .
It was a big hit .
Leadership
The Left Bloc operates a policy of having a revolving collectivist leadership .
This is to avoid a situation where the party depends on one or a few individuals .
When the Left Bloc first had members in the Portuguese parliament it revolved the representatives every five months .
The National Committee of 80 people meets every two months .
It is elected in proportion to the voting on the major resolutions at the annual conference .
Women must have minimum of 30 - 40 % of all positions in the party .
This goes right down to the election to the NC based on support for resolutions
Lessons
Britain has not lived under military dictatorship or had 18 months of a revolutionary situation .
But its labour movement and to a lesser extent its political movements have been dominated by one party – the Labour Party -- like the Communist Party has in Portugal .
In both countries there has been disillusionment with this control .
In Portugal it was the creation of unified , democratic and open force that has persuaded people to join it and vote for it .
This has happened in Scotland with the Scottish Socialist Party ( SSP ) in the period 1999 to 2003 .
Sadly the spilt in the party has fragmented the left in Scotland and confused its supporters and electoral base .
But the SSP has learnt the lessons at the root of the split and is slowly rebuilding itself as a credible left alternative to the Labour Party and the Scottish Nationalist Party .
The SSP shows the potential for attracting independent socialist and activists to a new socialist project if the project has open and democratic a structure and can campaign in a popular way without diluting its politics .
That is the task facing socialists in England .
It is time , as the Left Bloc did in Portugal , to put personal and particular party ambitions aside .
The most severe capitalist crisis is since the 1930s depression offers socialists a unique opportunity to build anti-capitalist left parties outside of social democracy .
History will not look kindly upon us if we fail , not for want of trying but because of the petty self - interest of individuals and political groups .

It ’s not easy being on late - night television .
Marv Albert , the veteran NBA announcer for TNT , was in town for the Lakers - Chicago Bulls game Thursday night .
On Wednesday , Albert was a guest on the “ Jimmy Kimmel Live ” show .
The musical star was rapper 50 Cent .
As Albert arrived , with an entourage of one , TNT public relations specialist Jeff Pomeroy , there was a sudden scuffle when a multitude of 50 Cent protectors seemed unfamiliar with Albert .
There was shouting ( “ It ’s Marv Albert , ” yelled a Kimmel show guard , a pronouncement that seemed to have no effect on the 50 Cent phalanx . )
There were obscenities .
A fist or two flying .
A “ Do n’t you put your hands on me ” pronouncement .
And finally Albert made it to his waiting room , relatively unruffled but slightly puzzled .
“ Did you see that ? ”
Albert said .
“ I thought they were kidding , but then I realized they were n’t . ”

Kimmel said Albert ’s appearance was at his request .
“ I ’ve been a fan of Marv ’s for a long time , ” the late - night host said .
“ I appreciate great broadcasters who are distinctive .
I like somebody who brings a real personality to the job but in a professional way .
Your job is to call games , not tell jokes , not make yourself a personality .
I think Marv is great . ”
Perhaps 50
Cent ’s people would have recognized Albert had the broadcaster just walked down the hallway saying , “ Yessssss ! ”
Albert said he thinks the Lakers will miss the injured Luke Walton more than people might expect .
“ He ’s such a perfect fit for Phil Jackson , ” Albert said .
“ Luke is so under the radar , but when they put him in , the ball gets distributed .
The Lakers need guys like that . ”
Honoring Lakers , all year long

The other day , I noticed that one of my friends had Wikipedia ’s article on the em dash bookmarked in her toolbar .
While that article is a gem of punctuation literature , it turned out that she would go to it , select an em dash , and copy / paste it into emails .
A better way to do this is with a bookmarklet .
Drag this to your browser ’s bookmark toolbar :
character palette
Click the bookmarklet on any page .
You ’ll see a character palette like this :
Select the character you like and either copy / paste it or drag it where you like .
Then click “ Close ” to make the palette go away until you need it again .
Enjoy !
Note : I ’ve tested this in Firefox , Safari and Chrome .
This probably does n’t work in IE .

Google DNS vs OpenDNS : Google Rocks for International Users
Slow DNS resolving is one of the major causes of browsing slowdowns .
( If you do n't know what is DNS look at the end of the post ) .
The DNS services provided by the ISPs were often crappy and erratic and OpenDNS had emerged as the de-facto alternative .
OpenDNS was not without its faults .
Though it was rarely erratic , the performance was not blazing fast .
Also if OpenDNS did not find a site , it redirected the user to a generic search page .
This was not good user experience .
Another alternative was the DNS server 4.2.2.2 ( owned by Level 3 I believe ) .
But this server was not that fast outside United States .
Google in its quest to make the internet faster has stepped into the arena with Google Public DNS .
In their own words -
As web pages become more complex and include more resources from multiple origin domains , clients need to perform multiple DNS lookups to render a single page .
The average Internet user performs hundreds of DNS lookups each day , slowing down his or her browsing experience .
As the web continues to grow , greater load is placed on existing DNS infrastructure .
Since Google 's search engine already crawls the web on a daily basis and in the process resolves and caches DNS information , we wanted to leverage our technology to experiment with new ways of addressing some of the existing DNS challenges around performance and security .
We are offering the service to the public in the hope of achieving the following aims :
Google Promises us good Performance , Security and Correct Results .
Correct Results here refer to the practice of redirecting the user to an alternate page when the domain was not found ( like OpenDNS does ) .
Google has provided an extensive guide to help users start using their DNS service .
In my tests , Google DNS consistently outperformed both OpenDNS and Level 3 .
For Americans the Level 3 server ( 4.2.2.2 ) might offer as good performance as Google .
But if you are living outside US and you care about your browsing experience you should switch now :) .
The results are below
The shell script I used to get the results is this .

What is DNS
DNS is what helps your browser to identify the correct machine which corresponds to the domain names like " google.com " , " facebook.com " etc .
Each machine has a unique record called an IP Address ( like zip code ) .
DNS is like the postal system of the internet which helps to identify which domain name ( like google.com ) belongs to which address .
The wikipedia as usual has an in - depth article .
a truely vile surprise .
heres how it works .
first , take a glass jar ( must be glass ) .
make sure its got big enough of an opening to accept a leg or breast of chicken .
next , get uncooked chicken parts and milk .
it helps if the milk has alredy gone bad .
combine milk and chicken in the glass jar until you cant fit anymore and its about to overflow .
next , tightly secure the top onto the glass jar .
now , discretely place the bomb in the heating ducts of a home or apartment .
this is most effective after getting evicted or you catch your gurlfriend cheating on you .
the next step is to simply wait .
it may take time , so be patient .
what happens is after repeated exposure to heat and pressure , the glass will eventually break or the top will pop off .
if you can only find a rather thick jar you may want to poke a small hole into the top to ensure the smell gets released .
after this happens , the most vile stench is released throughout the home , creating a constant unbareable smell that only gets worse every time the heat goes on .
milk chicken bombs , when made and dispensed properly , have been known to make a home unliveable .

The best gun in the world is the one youll have with you when you need it .
Seriously , the features of a gun you dont have with you dont matter .
Like most tools theres an optimal gun for every task under the sun .
The task here is to ensure youll always have it with you when you need it .
This article will talk about the features of a gun tool that will get that job done .
And yes , I have a specific make and model in mind .
If a gun is :
Too big
Too heavy
Too hard to shoot
Too dangerous to carry
Too hard to maintain
Feels awkward to carry , store or shoot
Does not fit your wardrobe
Does not fit your hand
Does not fit your lifestyle
Cant handle most jobs you want it for
Misfires when dirty
The Concealed Handgun ... Chris Bird Best Price : $ 2.00 Buy New $ 6.97 ( as of 12:05 EST - Details )
. . . then you re less likely to have it with you when you need it .
All this and yet a gun should be comforting , not comfortable .
Carrying no gun at all would be the most comfortable .
If that s your solution my wish for you is that all the creatures you encounter feel the same way and be smaller than you .
To be comforting a gun would need to :
Have enough power to stop most bad guys .
Have enough power to stop most dangerous animals .
Be built to last while shooting the powerful rounds needed for 1 . and 2 .
Use rounds that are widely available and affordable .
Handle safely and easily ( by you ) .
Concealed Carry : The S... Clapp , Wiley Best Price : $ 3.82 Buy New $ 57.50 ( as of 03:35 EST - Details )
It would be a very special gun that had none of the drawbacks and all of the advantages listed above .
You might even say it would be the Best Gun in the world .
The Ruger SP101 .357 magnum fits that description and is my choice for the title .
I prefer the model with the 3 1/16 " barrel for more accuracy and better performance of the magnum rounds .
I also prefer it with the hammer for more deliberate round placement when the situation calls for it .
Hammerless and with the shorter barrel is better for concealed carry .
For me , that s not worth giving up the accuracy and better performance of the magnum round .
Yes , I wish it had more than 5 rounds .
And that would also make it larger and harder to reinforce the frame to withstand the punishment of the hotter .357 magnum rounds .
One study of 6000 armed confrontations showed an average of only 2.6 shots fired .
Glock OEM Range Bag ( F... Best Price : null Buy New $ 46.95 ( as of 06:20 EST - Details )
Yes , Id prefer a larger caliber to cover ALL dangerous creatures on the earth .
And that would make it too heavy and big for lifes daily routines ( Where I rarely see elephants or polar bears ) .
Yes , it is 12 oz heavier than similar aluminum alloy revolvers .
And those models hurt my hand when shooting the magnum rounds .
Theres an optimal gun for each purpose under the sun .
In future articles I hope to recommend such optimal tools given specific purpose .
But , if I had to choose only one gun for anything life may bring it would be the SP101 .
Get the hammerless with a shorter barrel for purely self - defense if thats what it takes for the SP101 to be the best gun in your world .
To all who would point out the many fascinating and useful features of a different gun I say  fantastic ! as long as you dont have to retrieve it from your gun safe when you need it .
Because . . .
 The features of a gun you dont have with you dont matter . 

Holy fetch , this documentary looks hotter than " pig sex " !
The trailer for " 8 : The Mormon Proposition " hit the Internets yesterday and it looks powerful .
---
Reed Cowan , the film maker , is the guy who had to listen to Sen .
Chris Buttars talk about " pig sex , " early releases of which caused an Utah uproar earlier this year .
" I believe that they 're probably the biggest threat to America going down that I know of , " Buttars told Cowan , referring to " the gays . "
That quote is the first thing featured on the trailer .

Word on the Internets is that the producer has submitted the film to Sundance , among other festivals .

I 'm sure you 'll get updates on the film 's progress if you follow its Facebook page .

The Secret Sentry : The Untold History of the National Security Agency by Matthew M. Aid Bloomsbury , 423 pp. , $ 30.00
On a remote edge of Utah ’s dry and arid high desert , where temperatures often zoom past 100 degrees , hard - hatted construction workers with top - secret clearances are preparing to build what may become America ’s equivalent of Jorge Luis Borges ’s “ Library of Babel , ” a place where the collection of information is both infinite and at the same time monstrous , where the entire world ’s knowledge is stored , but not a single word is understood .
At a million square feet , the mammoth $ 2 billion structure will be one - third larger than the US Capitol and will use the same amount of energy as every house in Salt Lake City combined .
Unlike Borges ’s “ labyrinth of letters , ” this library expects few visitors .
It ’s being built by the ultra-secret National Security Agency — which is primarily responsible for “ signals intelligence , ” the collection and analysis of various forms of communication — to house trillions of phone calls , e-mail messages , and data trails :
Web searches , parking receipts , bookstore visits , and other digital “ pocket litter . ”
Lacking adequate space and power at its city - sized Fort Meade , Maryland , headquarters , the NSA is also completing work on another data archive , this one in San Antonio , Texas , which will be nearly the size of the Alamodome .
Just how much information will be stored in these windowless cybertemples ?
A clue comes from a recent report prepared by the MITRE Corporation , a Pentagon think tank .
“ As the sensors associated with the various surveillance missions improve , ” says the report , referring to a variety of technical collection methods , “ the data volumes are increasing with a projection that sensor data volume could potentially increase to the level of Yottabytes ( 1024 Bytes ) by 2015 . ” 1
Roughly equal to about a septillion ( 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ) pages of text , numbers beyond Yottabytes have n’t yet been named .
Once vacuumed up and stored in these near - infinite “ libraries , ” the data are then analyzed by powerful infoweapons , supercomputers running complex algorithmic programs , to determine who among us may be — or may one day become — a terrorist .
In the NSA ’s world of automated surveillance on steroids , every bit has a history and every keystroke tells a story .
In the near decade since September 11 , the tectonic plates beneath the American intelligence community have undergone a seismic shift , knocking the director of the CIA from the top of the organizational chart and replacing him with the new director of national intelligence , a desk - bound espiocrat with a large staff but little else .
Not only surviving the earthquake but emerging as the most powerful chief the spy world has ever known was the director of the NSA .
He is in charge of an organization three times the size of the CIA and empowered in 2008 by Congress to spy on Americans to an unprecedented degree , despite public criticism of the Bush administration ’s use of the agency to conduct warrantless domestic …

If you have been blessing everyone around you with cell phone " performances " of Beyonc� 's " Single Ladies , " rest assured that your cell phone provider wo n't have to pay royalties on it .
A federal court has ruled that ringtones played aloud in public are not infringing on the content owners ' copyrights because they do n't constitute a true performance .
( In other news , children are still allowed to sing songs without paying royalties . )
Joking aside ( actually , that 's less of a joke than you might think ) , the ringtone argument was made by the American Society of Composers , Authors , and Publishers ( ASCAP ) earlier this year when it sued certain mobile carriers in the US in an attempt to force them to fork over royalties every time a customer 's ringtone is played .
Even though the carriers were already paying for download rights to the songs , ASCAP argued that each ring was a " performance " and therefore those download payments were n't enough .
This was because some ringtone providers did at one time pay for performance rights — some continue to do so , but others did not , due to an earlier court decision in a case involving AOL .
The ASCAP felt the decision was wrong and would n't apply in this case because of some differences between normal music downloads and ringtones .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , as well as a number of other interested parties from the music and technology industries , responded by arguing that ASCAP 's complaint ignored some major areas of the legal code , likening the situation to demanding royalties when someone plays the radio with the car windows down .
In her ruling , US District Judge Denise Cote pointed out that the carrier has no way to control when a ringtone is being played and earns no revenue when it happens — customers decide when and where their phones can ring , and they turn the phone on or off without the carrier 's consent .
She also said that performing a work publicly usually means that it must take place in a public space where a " substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of its social acquaintances is gathered . "
Regardless ,
Cote says that mobile carriers are only responsible for the transmission of the song to the phone , which does n't count as a performance in and of itself .
" Even if the customer could listen to the download as it was being received , and contemporaneously perceive it as the musical work , that would not constitute a public performance , " wrote the judge .
Additionally , there is no expectation of profit on the part of the carrier or the customer when the phone begins blasting Cher out of its tiny built - in speaker .
This means even if it was a performance , it would be exempt from falling under royalty requirements .
As a result , the court ruled that ASCAP failed to show infringement on the part of cell carriers or their customers .
The EFF , Public Knowledge , and the Center for Democracy & Technology applauded this decision , saying that it expands upon the AOL ruling by showing that any download — including ringtones — can't constitute a public performance , and that it should also protect people who play the radio on the beach or sing " Happy Birthday " to their children in a public park .

Mr Ramesh said that India 's interests had been safeguarded
India says it is pleased at the outcome of the recently concluded climate change talks in Copenhagen .
Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told MPs that India had been able to resist pressure from the developed world to sign up to binding emission targets .
The Copenhagen agreement has been criticised in India .
Critics say the country was forced to give up its sovereignty and agree to international checking of its efforts to lower its greenhouse gas emissions .
Facing parliament for the first time since he returned from the talks , Mr Ramesh was upbeat .
He said all of India 's concerns had been safeguarded which included resisting signing up to legally binding emission targets and identifying a peak year for carbon emissions .
In fact , he added , the BASIC group of countries which includes Brazil , South Africa , India and China had emerged as a powerful force in climate change negotiations , especially in the face of relentless pressure from richer countries .
But , he said , India 's approach had been recognised as constructive .
The Copenhagen agreement has been strongly criticised by environmentalists and opposition parties in India .

Blue Brain is an IBM computer built to simulate a human brain .
It 's powered by 2,000 microchips , each acting as a single neuron , that enable it to execute 22.8 trillion operations per second .
Based at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne , the project launched in 2005 to much controversy and skepticism .
Modeling the complexity of the brain in a computer is considered a holy grail to some , and hubris to others .
The Blue Brain Project is n't an attempt to build an artificial intelligence , although it could someday inform such an effort .
That 's because the scientists are hoping to use the machine to understand physiology , brain chemistry , and even intelligence and consciousness .
The project 's stated goal ?
" To reverse engineer the brain . "
Here 's Markam talking at TEDGlobal this year :
Already though , Blue Brain has simualated the brain 's neocortical column , containing 10,000 neurons and 30 million synaptic connection .
" The column has been built and it runs , " project director Henry Markram told Seed Magazine .
" Now we just have to scale it up . "
In two years , Markram hopes to have modeled a complete rat brain that he will then load into a mobile robot .
From SEED :
When listening to Markram speculate , it 's easy to forget that the Blue Brain simulation is still just a single circuit , confined within a silent supercomputer .
The machine is not yet alive .
And yet Markram can be persuasive when he talks about his future plans .
His ambitions are grounded in concrete steps .
Once the team is able to model a complete rat brain –that should happen in the next two years –Markram will download the simulation into a robotic rat , so that the brain has a body .
He 's already talking to a Japanese company about constructing the mechanical animal .
" The only way to really know what the model is capable of is to give it legs , " he says .
" If the robotic rat just bumps into walls , then we 've got a problem . "
Installing Blue Brain in a robot will also allow it to develop like a real rat .
The simulated cells will be shaped by their own sensations , constantly revising their connections based upon the rat 's experiences .
" What you ultimately want , " Markram says , " is a robot that 's a little bit unpredictable , that does n't just do what we tell it to do . "
His goal is to build a virtual animal–a rodent robot–with a mind of its own .
But the question remains :
How do you know what the rat knows ?
How do you get inside its simulated cortex ?
This is where visualization becomes key .
Markram wants to simulate what that brain experiences .
It 's a typically audacious goal , a grand attempt to get around an ancient paradox .
But if he can really find a way to see the brain from the inside , to traverse our inner space , then he will have given neuroscience an unprecedented window into the invisible .
He will have taken the self and turned it into something we can see .

The Creation Museum , the showplace for illustrating a literal understanding of the Bible , has a Christmas surprise for visitors .
There will be no Christ child in a stable in the annual Nativity display .
Jesus , says founder and director Ken Ham , was born in a house in Bethlehem .
Even though last year 's Christmas extravaganza at the Petersburg , Ky. , museum did have the creche scene classic Christ - child - manger - in - the - stable scenario , Ham says that this year they 're going with a " real challenge to tradition . "
They 're cosseting the Holy Family in a " representation of a typical first - century house " to follow what he considers current , authentic scholarship .
" We have these Westernized ideas that are not consistent with what the Scripture actually says and the culture Scripture is dealing with , " says Ham .
He explains that some researchers have said since the 1800s that archaeology shows people in those times would have kept their valuable animals like an ox or a donkey indoors in the lower level of their homes , even homes built into caves for warmth and protection .
Think about it .
Joseph would have been returning to his ancestral home for the census .
The Bible says that while they were there " the days were fulfilled for her to be delivered , " which could have been several days .
No way are they going to send away a woman who is pregnant to a stable .
It makes more sense that they found a home with a family but there was no room upstairs in the family living quarters so they were sheltered by the manger at the lower level .
Just in case this all confuses the 20,000 folks expected to visit the museum 's display , there will be an actor playing a Palestinian archaeologist giving talks every half hour based on findings from the Associates for Biblical Research , says Ham .
During the December weekend activities ( details here ) there will be living nativity scene with creatures from the museum 's petting zoo , a marketplace and , of course , 21st - century lighting displays , too .
Plus , says Ham , every visitor will get booklets on salvation and an introduction to the real purpose of the museum , which gets most of its press on its commitment to the six - day story of Creation .
We 're here to say the Bible is true , from Creation through Christ , the creator is our savior . "
Do you find it intriguing that the museum , devoted to literalism , would push the envelope this far into " cultural interpretation ? "
Where else could that lead ?
Ronnie
Wood recently divorced his wife of 24 years
Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood has been arrested on suspicion of assault , Surrey police have confirmed .
Wood 's spokesman told BBC News that he was arrested after an " incident " , but declined to comment further .
A police spokesman said : " We can confirm that a 62 - year - old man was arrested on suspicion of assault in connection with a domestic incident . "
The musician has been released on bail until a later date in January , pending " further enquiries " .
Last month the rock star was divorced by his wife Jo on the grounds of his admitted adultery , after 24 years of marriage .
The couple split in 2008 after the musician began a relationship with another woman .
In the divorce documents , which have been made public , the person with whom the star committed adultery was not named .
However , Wood 's relationship with Ekaterina Ivanova , 20 , was widely covered in the tabloid press .
In July 2008 , the guitarist was admitted to a rehabilitation centre for help with his long - established alcohol addiction .

When Towing Goes Wrong

One issue that is often raised against Christianity is Noah 's Ark and the Flood .
Did it really happen ?
Did the flood really cover the whole world ?
Is there enough water on earth to cover all the land ?
Could the ark really hold two of every kind of animal in the world ?
Though these might be intimidating questions , the answer to each is a resounding , " Yes . "
God said to Noah in Genesis 6:14 – 16 , " Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood ; you shall make the ark with rooms , and shall cover it inside and out with pitch .
15 “ This is how you shall make it : the length of the ark three hundred cubits , its breadth fifty cubits , and its height thirty cubits .
16 “ You shall make a window for the ark , and finish it to a cubit from the top ; and set the door of the ark in the side of it ; you shall make it with lower , second , and third decks . "
According to God 's Word , Noah built the ark .
Eight people entered it and all humanity died in the ensuing flood .
Did the flood really happen ?
Yes .
Jesus said in Matt. 24:37-39 that the flood happened .
Matthew 24:37–39 , " For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah . 38 “ For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered the ark , 39 and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away ; so will the coming of the Son of Man be . "
As far as physical evidence goes there are numerous sedimentary deposits world - wide which suggest a universal flood .
There are countless fossil deposits world - wide ( fossilization occurs when organisms are buried rapidly within sediment . ) .
Every major culture has a flood legend .
Of over 200 flood legends , 95 % say the flood was universal ; 70 % say survival depended upon a boat ; 66 % say the wickedness of man was the cause ; 88 % say there was a favored family ; 66 % say the remnant was warned ; 67 % say animals were also saved ; 57 % say the survivors ended up on a mountain ; 35 % say birds were sent out ; 9 % say eight people were saved ; and 7 % mention a rainbow .
Is there enough water to flood the entire earth ?
Absolutely !
If the earth were perfectly spherical the oceans would cover all the land by more than a mile in depth .
The biblical account is that it rained for 40 days and nights in which the floodgates of the heavens were opened up as well as the fountains from the earth ( Gen. 7:11 ; 8:2 ) .
There is a theory known as the canopy theory that states it had never rained on the earth up to the time of Noah and that a mist watered the plants ( Gen. 2:6 ) .
The theory goes on to state that there may have been a heavy cloud or water vapor layer over the entire earth and that it was this canopy of water that became torrential rains during the flood period .
Did the flood cover all the earth ?
Yes it did .
The depth of the flood waters is described in Gen. 7:19 as covering " all the high mountains under the entire heavens . "
Also , there are many references in the Bible to it being global : Gen .
6:1,4-5,12,13,17,19;7:4,6,10,19;8:3;9:15 .
There were 40 days of rain ( Gen. 7:12 ) , 110 days of flooding ( Gen. 7:24 ) and 221 more days of draining ( Gen. 8:1-5,13 -14 ) .
That is a total of 371 days of flooding .
That could not be a local flood .
Could the ark really contain all the animals of the world ?
Again the answer is " Yes . "
But let 's look at the last question in more detail .
The ark took about 120 years to build .
Noah was 480 years old when he began the work and he had the help of his wife , three sons , and his son 's wives .
He probably hired local people to help in the construction .
The dimensions of the ark have a ratio of six to one .
The Ark was six times longer than it was wide .
This is the best ratio for modern ship building .
Model stability tests have shown that the design is stable for waves up to 200 feet high and that the ark could have rotated 90 degrees and still righted itself .
The volume of the ark would be 450 feet long by 75 feet wide by 45 feet high .
This equals 1,518,750 cubic feet and is comparable to 569 modern railroad boxcars .
Therefore each boxcar , by comparison , would be 1,518,750 divided by 569 , or 2,669 cubic feet of space .
The average size of an animal on the earth is smaller than a cat .
But , just to keep it safe let 's consider the average size of an animal to be a sheep .
The average double deck stock car holds 240 sheep .
The Ark capacity would be about 569 x 240 equaling 136,560 animals of that size .
However , that still is not accurate for our needs .
Since most birds , reptiles , and amphibians are much smaller , let 's double the boxcar capacity for them .
Therefore , the boxcars could each hold 480 different kinds of birds , reptiles , amphibians .
Noah had to take two or seven of every kind of animal on the earth .
Though it is not really known exactly what is meant by a biblical kind , it is generally considered to be animals that are fertile within their own groups .
Any dog can breed with any dog , therefore , dogs are one kind .
It would only be necessary to bring representatives of each kind since the parents could produce offsping that would carry the genetic information for all variations within their kind .
Classification Number of
Species Number of
Kinds on the Ark Mammals
Birds
Reptiles
Amphibians
Fishes

Insects 3,700
8,600
6,300
2,500
20,600
192,605
850,000 3,700 ( a few live in water )
60,200 ( seven pairs according to Gen. 7:3 )
6,300
2,500
zero
zero
( Since insects are very small , and a great many
could be stored in a small area , calculation would be difficult . )
Total 1,072,305 72,700
The total number of mammals would be 3,700 times two pair which equals 7,400 animals .
7,400 divided by 240 = 31 boxcars used .
Since Gen. 7:3 says to take seven pairs of every bird then the total for birds would be 8,600 times two pair times 7 or 120,400 animals .
120,400 x 480 = 250 boxcars .
The reptiles and amphibians would be 6,300 plus 2,500 or 8,800 .
8,800 times two pair equals 17,600 animals .
17,600 divided by 480 = 37 boxcars .
The total number of boxcars used would be 318 with a total number of animals at 145,400 .
There would be 251 boxcars left over .
That means that only 56 % of the ark would be used for storing the animals .
Obviously , then , the rest of the space would be used for food for the people and animals and sleeping quarters .
In addition , considering that insects are extremely small , it is easily conceivable that they could be housed in part of the remaining space .
It should also be considered that many animals can hibernate .
Additionally , predators and prey have been known to live peacefully together during situations of stress like fire , flood , or earthquake .
In the Ark , animal behavior probably would have been different from normal daily life .
Specialists in animal behavior have noted that animals can sense danger and have often migrated to escape it .
Perhaps
God used their migratory instincts to get them to the Ark .
Though this is only a brief analysis , it should present enough evidence that the Ark account is certainly within the realm of possibility .
The awarding of the Nobel Peace Price to President Barack Obama landed with a shock on darkened , still - asleep Washington .
He won .
For what ?
For one of America 's youngest presidents , in office less than nine months — and only for 12 days before the Nobel nomination deadline last February — it was an enormous honour .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The prize seems to be more for Obama 's promise than for his performance .
Work on the president 's ambitious agenda , both at home and abroad , is barely underway , much less finished .
He has no standout moment of victory that would seem to warrant a verdict as sweeping as that issued by the Nobel committee .
And what about peace ?
Obama is running two wars in the Muslim world — in Iraq and Afghanistan — and can't get a climate change bill through his own Congress .
His scorecard for the year is largely an " incomplete , " if he 's being graded .
He banned torture and other extreme interrogation techniques for terrorists .
But he also promised to close the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , a source of much distaste for the US around the world , a difficult task that now seems headed to miss his own January 2010 deadline .
He said he would end the Iraq war .
But he has been slow to bring the troops home and the real end of the US military presence there wo n't come until at least 2012 , and that 's only if both the US and Iraq stick to their current agreement about American troop withdrawals .
He has pushed for new efforts to make peace between the Israelis and Palestinians .
But he 's received little cooperation from the two sides .
He said he wants a nuclear - free world .
But it 's one thing to telegraph the desire , in a speech in Prague in April , and quite another to unite other nations and US politicians behind the web of treaties and agreements needed to make that reality .
He has said that battling climate change is a priority .
But the US . seems likely to head into crucial international negotiations set for Copenhagen in December with legislation still stalled in Congress .

And what about Obama 's global prestige ?
It seemed to take a big hit last week when he jetted across the Atlantic to lobby for Chicago to get the 2016 Olympics — and was rejected with a last - place finish .
Perhaps for the Nobel committee , merely altering the tone out of Washington toward the rest of the world is enough .
Obama got much attention for his speech from Cairo reaching out a US hand to the world 's Muslims .
His remarks at the UN .
General Assembly last month set down new markers for the way the US works with the world .
But still ?
Obama aides seemed as surprised at the news as everyone else , not even aware he had been nominated along with a record 204 others .
Awoken by press secretary Robert Gibbs about an hour after the vote was announced , the White House says the president responded that he was humbled to be only the third sitting US president to win .
The award could be as much about issuing a slap at Obama 's predecessor , former President George Bush , as about lauding Obama .
Bush was reviled by the world for his cowboy diplomacy , Iraq war and snubbing of European priorities like global warming .
Remember that the Nobel prize has a long history of being awarded more for the committee 's aspirations than for others ' accomplishments — for Mideast peace or a better South Africa , for instance .
In those cases , the prize is awarded to encourage those who receive it to see the effort through , sometimes at critical moments .
Obama likely understands that his challenges are too steep to resolve — much less honour — after just a few months .
" It 's not going to be easy , " the president often says of the tasks ahead for the United States and the world .
The Nobel committee , it seems , had the audacity to hope that he 'll eventually produce a record worthy of its prize .
In an interesting interview with ITN News , Ed O'Brien of Radiohead suggests that bandwidth throttling ( the practice of limiting the quantity of data a sever transmits and / or accepts within a specified period of time ) may be a viable method to combat illegal downloading and filesharing .
Radiohead made waves in the worlds of music and technology by initially releasing their last record , In Rainbows , through their website as an optional ' pay - what - you - want ' download .
The move , initially thought by many to be a sign of sea change in the industry , was quickly revealed by the band to be a stunt thought up by their management , and the band drew more criticism when they elected to sign with another traditional label for physical distribution of the record , and then disappointment when the band revealed they would not reinstate the ' pay - what - you - want ' option for their next record .
What do you think ?
Is bandwidth throttling an answer in the fight against illegal filesharing , or is it just a way of punishing everyone for the actions of the few ?
Kabul , Afghanistan ( CNN ) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday that she is pleased by Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's pledge to have the country 's security forces take the lead over the next few years .
Speaking to U.S. and allied troops in Afghanistan , Clinton said the United States and other contributing nations have to do " everything we can to create the capacity of the Afghan government and the Afghan people to protect themselves . "
" I was very pleased to hear today when President Karzai said that he hopes that within three years , the Afghan security forces will have the lead in important areas and within five years -- which is an ambitious goal , but he stated it -- the Afghan security forces would have the lead throughout the country . "
Earlier Thursday , Clinton attended Karzai 's inauguration to a second term , where he vowed to tackle corruption and drug - trafficking .
The U.S. secretary of state told the troops that she knew serving was difficult , both for them and for their families .
" There are a lot of sacrifices , most particularly , not being able to see your family , friends for long periods of time , " she said .
" For everybody who serves , there 's a family that serves as well . "
To the Americans , Clinton noted the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday , saying there were many things she was grateful for but that the troops top her list .
" I want to especially wish you a happy Thanksgiving , " she said .
Clinton 's first visit to Afghanistan as secretary of state comes as President Obama is deciding whether to send up to 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan , as requested by McChrystal .
The Obama administration has expressed concerns about Karzai 's viability and has ratcheted up pressure to end corruption in order to combat an intensifying Taliban insurgency .
Clinton reiterated those concerns in a dinner meeting with Karzai on the eve of his inauguration and encouraged him to seize the " clear window of opportunity " before him at a " critical moment " in Afghanistan 's history .
Ahead of speaking to the troops , Clinton attended a Thursday briefing with those involved in development work in Afghanistan .
Personnel from the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development , as well as members of provisional reconstruction teams and military commanders , were present .

The Ringneck Snake ( Diadophis punctatus ) is a member of the colubridae family .
It is found throughout much of the United States , central Mexico , and south eastern Canada .
Ring - necked snakes are secretive , nocturnal snakes that are rarely seen during the day time .
They are slightly venomous but their non-aggressive nature and small rear - facing fangs pose little threat to humans who wish to handle them .
They are best known for their unique defense posture of curling up their tails exposing their bright red- orange posterior , ventral surface when threatened .
Ring - necked snakes are believed to be fairly abundant throughout most of their range though no scientific evaluation supports this theory .
Scientific research is lacking for the ring - necked snake and more in - depth investigations are greatly needed .
It is the only species within the genus Diadophis , and currently fourteen subspecies are identified , but many herpetologists question the morphologically - based classifications .

Asked if he would call it palliative sedation , Dr. Halbridge said , “ This would be called terminal sedation , almost . ”
He said he hesitated only because the word “ terminal ” sounded negative and might make the family feel bad , when “ it ’s really comfort care . ”
The terms “ palliative ” and “ terminal ” were interchangeable , he said .
Speaking with considerable passion , he said he saw himself as the doctor who would not “ forsake ” patients by telling them he could do nothing for them .
If there was no cure , he could at least offer comfort .
“ We are not gods who can cure everything , and I think at some point in time you have to accept that , ” he said , “ and to me , it ’s the mark of an honest doctor who understands when that time has come . ”
The decision to administer terminal sedation was based on a review of the patient ’s history that convinced him that Mr. Oltzik was “ terminally agitated , ” he said .
“ It means that he is entering the dying process and for whatever reason  whether it ’s physical , spiritual  something is interrupting the peaceful passing , and to me , because it ’s so uncomfortable for the family and for the patient , that ’s the time to medicate the patient and make them comfortable , because no matter what you do , he ’s not going to go back to the old Leo that he was . ”
He then told a self - deprecating joke about a doctor who gets to the gates of heaven and demands to jump to the head of the line , only to be turned back by St. Peter .
But St. Peter opens the gates to someone else carrying a doctor ’s bag .
“ That ’s God , ” St. Peter explains .
“ He just thinks he ’s a doctor . ”
Young residents often challenge him , saying things like , “ If I ’m 105 years old , I want to be fed , no matter what , ” Dr. Halbridge said .
His response is , “ O.K. , but did you ask your patient what he wants ? ”
Some patients are getting “ multimillion - dollar workups ” in the intensive care unit , he said , but make their wishes known by pulling out tubes .
“ I think a light bulb should go off in somebody ’s head after the third time he pulls it out .
Am I going to change the outcome of this , and if I ’m not , why am I doing it ? ”
At one point , however , Mrs. Oltzik changed her mind .
“ She was having second thoughts on that , and then she was saying , ‘ I wonder if we should cut back on his medication , ’ ” Dr. Halbridge said .
So , what I gather from the linked article is : we 're fucked , and we 're not going anywhere .
Thanks !

Also , yeah , people fail to understand the proper scale and scope of our universe .
I mean , let 's all pretend that we had a magic ship that could travel at 100 x the speed of light ( yes , we 're going just about warp 4 ) - it would take us roughly 25,000 years just to get to the Andromeda galaxy , which in space terms is basically sitting on top of us .
I mean , shit , even if we can magically go at say 120 trillion miles per hour , we can cross our entire solar system in 0.2 seconds , we 're still looking at a 10 year trip to Andromeda .
We wo n't even go into detail about some of the furthest galaxies , where traveling at that ridiculously fast speed would STILL take us 52,000 years to get there , give or take .
Traveling at 200,000 times the speed of light .
The universe is awesomely , comically large .

Advertisement England have been drawn to face the United States , Algeria and Slovenia in the group stage of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa .
Fabio Capello's men will play the United States in Rustenburg on 12 June , Algeria in Cape Town on 18 June and Slovenia in Port Elizabeth on 23 June .
Five - time champions Brazil face Portugal , Ivory Coast and North Korea in arguably the strongest group .
Holders Italy were drawn with Slovakia , Paraguay and New Zealand .
France , the 1998 winners and 2006 runners - up , will play hosts South Africa , Mexico and Uruguay , who staged and triumphed at the first World Cup in 1930 .
PHIL MCNULTY'S BLOG Capello cast his eyes over a section of the draw he could have hand - picked himself
European champions Spain are unlikely to fear Chile , Switzerland or Honduras and three - time winners Germany will take on Serbia , Ghana and Australia .
The Netherlands , ranked number three in the world , must navigate their way past Denmark , Cameroon and Japan .
Two - time champions Argentina are pooled with 2004 European champions Greece , Nigeria and South Korea .
As with every World Cup since 1998 , teams must finish in the top two in their group to qualify for the knockout phase .
Fifa announced on Thursday that the winners of the 2010 tournament , which takes place between 11 June and 11 July , will receive £ 18.6 m ( $ 31 m ) .

That is an increase of 61 % on the 2006 finals , while teams who get knocked out in the group stage are to pocket £ 5.4 m ( $ 9 m ) .
England 's seeding as one of the eight top teams in the competition meant they would always avoid Brazil , Spain , Holland , Italy , Germany and Argentina and South Africa in the group stage .
Their only previous World Cup meeting with the USA - a 1 - 0 defeat in 1950 - ranks as one of the biggest shocks in the tournament 's 80 - year history , and they have never played Algeria or Slovenia on world football 's biggest stage .
But England can lay claim to victories over the USA and Slovenia under Capello at Wembley .
Supporters piled into a fans festival on Long Street in Cape town " It 's not so bad , " the Italian told BBC Sport .
" We played against the USA and Slovenia at home - we played well , we won , but when we have to play here in June it will be difficult .
" Algeria beat Egypt ( in a World Cup qualifying play - off ) and will not be easy ; they have a really good team now .
When you play at the World Cup , every game is not easy . "
Asked if he feared England , USA coach Bob Bradley told BBC Sport : " No , not at all .
It 's big .
Algeria and Slovenia are teams that maybe are n't the biggest teams in some ways , but came through with great efforts to get here . "
If England emerge from Group C they will play either Germany , Serbia , Ghana or Australia for a place in the quarter - finals .
South Africa will get the tournament started against Mexico at Ellis Park , Johannesburg , on 11 June 2010 .
" I do n't envy the Mexicans , who are going to be subject to 90,000 vuvuzelas , " said South Africa defender Matthew Booth , referring to the loud horns that Bafana Bafana supporters bring to matches .
606 : DEBATE
Without tempting fate surely the ' big teams ' will qualify from their groups and the knock out rounds will be where the real competition is at ?
HESRE
The star - studded draw ceremony , held at the Cape Town International Convention Centre , began with a video message from revered former South Africa president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela .
" Sport has the power to inspire and unite people , " said 91 - year - old Mandela .
" In Africa , soccer enjoys great popularity and has a particular place in the hearts of people .
" This is why it is so important that the Fifa World Cup will for the first time ever be hosted on the African Continent in 2010 .
We feel privileged and humble that South Africa has been given the singular honour of being the host country . "
South Africa 's Oscar - winning actress Charlize Theron brought a touch of Hollywood glamour to proceedings , alongside England midfielder David Beckham , Ethiopian athletics legend Haile Gebrselassie and Springboks rugby union captain John Smit .
Makhaya Ntini , the first black cricketer to play for South Africa , and World Cup icons Franz Beckenbauer , Michel Platini , Eusebio and Roger Milla were present , with entertainment coming from the likes of the Soweto Gospel Choir and singers Angelique Kidjo and Johnny Clegg .

It used to be wetter ( Image : Sergio Pitamitz / Getty )
Wet spells in the Sahara may have opened the door for early human migration .
According to new evidence , water - dependent trees and shrubs grew there between 120,000 and 45,000 years ago .
This suggests that changes in the weather helped early humans cross the desert on their way out of Africa .
The Sahara would have been a formidable barrier during the Stone Age , making it hard to understand how humans made it to Europe from eastern Africa , where the earliest remains of our hominin ancestors are found .
Isla Castañeda of the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and colleagues studied land plant hydrocarbons in Saharan dust that has settled on the sea floor off west Africa over the past 192,000 years .
From the ratio of carbon isotopes in the hydrocarbons they can work out which types of plants were present at different times .

Wet spells
While about 40 per cent of hydrocarbons in today ’s dust come from water - dependent plants , this rose to 60 per cent , first between 120,000 and 110,000 ago and again from 50,000 to 45,000 years ago .
So the region seemed to be in the grip of unusually wet spells at the time .
That may have been enough to allow sub-Saharan Stone Age Homo sapiens to migrate north : the first fossils of modern humans outside Africa date from 93,000 year ago in Israel .
And both genetic analysis and archaeology show that humans did n’t spread extensively beyond Africa until 50,000 years ago , suggesting a second migration at the time of the second wet spell .
Fossil record
Ian Tattersall of the American Museum of Natural History in New York is impressed by the findings .
“ They tie in approximately with the information we have from the fossil record . ”
Castañeda ’s team is not the first to suggest that wet spells may have come in handy .
Last year , Anne Osborne of the University of Bristol , UK , suggested that the first migrants may have used a now - buried network of river channels in the Libyan Sahara , which dates roughly 120,000 years .

The Motorola DROID has been selling like hotcakes , at least hotcakes with Android 2.0 .
According to RBC Capital Analyst Mark Sue , sales figures are showing a current total of 700,000 to 800,000 handsets sold which should allow for at least 1 million DROIDS crossing the register by the end of the year .
A $ 100 million ad campaign helps , but so does the fact that the DROID is Verizon 's first real iPhone challenger .
" Verizon 's big marketing push for the DROID is strengthening as we close in on the holidays , " the RBC analyst says .
Comments by DROID users noted by Barron 's show praise for the resolution of the screen , which at 480 X 854 pixels , is currently the sharpest and clearest display out in the market , and for the fast processor .
Complaints were made about the weight of the device , which is built like a tank , as some have described the model .
The analyst also notes that sales of the Motorola CLIQ with the social networking MOTOBLUR UI and its overseas version , the DEXT , have been " okay " , but " not great " .
Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron is a little more reserved .
He estimates that sales of the world 's only Android 2.0 handset are running slightly behind target and he sees a total of 750,000 units sold for the quarter .
He expects only 150,000 - 200,000 CLIQ handsets to be sold and says that T - Mobile has backed away from promoting the device .
He also blames the battery life as a dealbreaker for purchase of the CLIQ and says that Motorola is preparing a upgrade to improve that .
T - Mobile defends its promotion of the model as a spokesman for the carrier says that , " The Motorola CLIQ is very popular among our highly connected customers and is the only device with Motorola 's innovative MOTORBLUR solution .
T- Mobile is excited about the Motorola CLIQ for the holidays and continues to showcase it prominently . "
As for the manufacturer , Kidron says some models will be hits and some not , but that the Schaumburg based company is heading toward showing a profit in 2010 .
Returning to the DROID , Verizon spokeswoman Brenda Raney says , " We are pleased with sales over the holiday weekend .
This phone clearly fits the needs of a number of customers who are excited about its availability on the Verizon Wireless network . "
Are you a DROID owner ?
Still happy to be one ?
Let us know how you feel about Big Red 's honest - to - goodness , real iPhone challenger .

The Supreme Court dealt a blow to the medical marijuana movement 6/6 , ruling that the federal government can still ban possession of the drug in states .

WINNIPEG , Manitoba , Dec. 22 ( UPI ) -- A Canadian judge in Winnipeg , Manitoba , spared a convicted medical marijuana user and advocate from a prison term as he did n't have any " real victims . "
Grant Krieger , 54 , was convicted by a unanimous jury last year of trafficking marijuana to people across the country with debilitating and terminal diseases , the Winnipeg Free Press reported Tuesday .

In her ruling Monday , Justice Shawn Greenberg sentenced Krieger to a suspended sentence with nine months probation .
" Mr. Krieger is not like most of the drug offenders we sentence in this court , " Greenberg said .
" While Mr. Krieger 's actions were illegal , many , perhaps most , would say they are not immoral .
Indeed he has no real victims . "
Krieger was diagnosed with progressive multiple sclerosis in 1978 and claims the only relief he gets from its effects come from smoking and eating marijuana .
He admits to selling marijuana to scores of people , but only those with serious disabilities , the newspaper said .
The judge acknowledged his diligence in screening customers .
" Mr. Krieger provided people with marijuana only where he was satisfied they suffered from a serious illness such as cancer , " she said .
" For example , he once turned down a person who sought his assistance for a broken arm . "
A massive moon that orbited Uranus in the past may explain the planet ’s extreme tilt ( Image : NASA / ESA / M. Showalter / SETI Institute )
Please try to resist the childish jokes , but the fact is that the odd tilt of Uranus may be the result of a particularly large moon .
Uranus spins on an axis almost parallel with the plane of the solar system , rather than perpendicular to it – though why it does this nobody knows .
One theory is that the tilt is the result of a collision with an Earth - sized object , but this “ has n’t succeeded in explaining much of anything ” , says Ignacio Mosqueira of the SETI Institute in Mountain View , California .
Why , for example , are the orbits of Uranus ’s 27 known moons not also tilted ?
Now Gwenaël Boué and Jacques Laskar at the Paris Observatory in France have come up with another explanation : Uranus may once have had an unusually massive extra moon .
If the moon had 1 per cent of the mass of Uranus – and orbited at a certain distance – it would slightly unbalance the planet and increase its wobble about its axis .
After about 2 million years , the wobbling could have become exaggerated enough to tip the planet on its side , their model has shown ( arxiv.org/abs/0912.0181 ) .

The moon may since have been ejected by the tug of another planet passing nearby .
Its fate is unclear , but it may have crashed into another gas giant if it is not still roaming the solar system .
William Ward at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado finds the theory plausible but points out there is no evidence for the extra moon other than the effect Boué and Laskar suggest it has had on Uranus ’s orientation .

Pakistan ’s Failing War on Terror
Despite the shrill public discussion of U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan , the most important front of the war in South Asia continues to be Pakistan , which the world ’s most dangerous jihadists call home .
On this issue , there is good news and there is bad news .
The good news is that U.S. President Barack Obama ’s private deliberations on strategy have focused on Pakistan , coupling offers of increased military and economic assistance with warnings that Islamabad must abandon its habit of supporting Islamist proxy forces .
The bad news is that al Qaeda ’s radical pan-Islamic ideology is infecting militants long - supported by the Pakistani state , and Pakistan ’s security services have not caught up with the problem .
Pakistan deserves credit for its recent offensive against tribal militants in Swat and Waziristan , but the Pakistani Army ’s campaign is far from adequate .
Pakistan has retained its long - standing balancing strategy of differentiating between pro- and anti-Pakistan militants , regardless of their collaboration with al Qaeda or support for violence against NATO troops in Afghanistan .
This balancing strategy is coherent from a Pakistani perspective — it is self - interested , not evil — but it creates real problems for the NATO effort in Afghanistan and increases the chance of terrorism in the West .
In the long run , it spells trouble for Pakistan as well .
Pakistan ’s balancing strategy is evident nationwide , but it is particularly clear in Waziristan .
When the Pakistani Army invaded Waziristan , it cut a deal with two Waziri tribal commanders , Gul Bahadur and Maulvi Nazir , in order to limit the risk to its supply lines while targeting the most virulent militants in the region : tribal elements loyal to Hakimullah Mehsud ( the successor to Baitullah Mehsud , who before his assassination in August was the head of the Tehrik - e - Taliban coalition ) and their Uzbek allies .
On one level , this deal is logical .
Both Gul Bahadur and Maulvi Nazir have a history of animosity ( see here and here for more ) toward the Hakimullah Mehsud faction , and both have cooperated previously with Pakistani security forces .
In 2007 , Maulvi Nazir even went to war against the Mehsuds ’ Uzbek allies .
Moreover , the Mehsud faction is closely tied to al Qaeda and under previous leadership even claimed credit for a plot against the Barcelona subway .
By cutting a deal with the Waziri tribes , Pakistan smoothed its operation against the most dangerous threat .
That counts as sound operational logic .
So , what is the problem ?
The problem is that both Gul Bahadur and Maulvi Nazir still support anti-NATO violence in Afghanistan and have long - standing relationships with pro-al Qaeda groups .
They are not the South Asian version of the Sons of Iraq ( the Iraqi insurgents who supported U.S. efforts to find and crush al Qaeda in Iraq ) .
Indeed , it was only April 2009 when Maulvi Nazir appeared in an al Qaeda - produced As - Sahab video denouncing the United States and Pakistan , and swearing to support Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden .
The intensity of Pakistan ’s recent offensive in Waziristan is laudable , and it ’s certainly an improvement from previous campaigns in the region .
But the increased intensity reflects an operational shift rather than a strategic one .
The balancing strategy is inadequate from a Western perspective , but it will slowly fail Pakistan as well .
While Pakistan has negotiated among militias to gain operational advantage over its most worrisome enemies , al Qaeda has extended its ideological and political influence over larger segments of the Pakistani militant milieu .
For Pakistan , the most worrisome development is the Tehrik - e - Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) coalition between Pashtun tribal groups and Punjabi militias , including Sipah - i Sahaba , Laskkar - e - Janghvi , and Jaish - i- Mohammed .
The Pashtun and Punjabi groups were never enemies , but had little reason to collaborate — tribal militias fought mainly for autonomy , Punjabi groups pursued narrow sectarian and religious agendas , and Kashmiri groups targeted India .
But the rash of bombings in Islamabad , Rawalpindi , and Lahore — many claimed by the TTP leadership in far - away Waziristan — indicate that the Punjabi groups have shifted their focus to more political targets , like cricket teams , Army headquarters , and police - training facilities .
Militants that used to avoid confrontation with the Pakistani state are now facilitating bombings in Pakistan ’s Punjab heartland .
While Pakistan maneuvers for operational advantage , the strategic playing field is shifting against it .
The rationale for the origin and persistence of Pakistan ’s balancing strategy is no secret : Jihadi militant groups are useful foils against India .
( When your archenemy is four times as big as you and has six times as many people , you take help where you can get it . )
But those useful - to - Pakistan jihadi militant groups justify their anti-Indian stance on ideological grounds that also demand opposition to the NATO force in Afghanistan .
Al Qaeda has used that opening to argue that Pakistan ’s facilitation of U.S. efforts in Afghanistan makes the Pakistani state and its Army an infidel force attacking true Muslims .
Or , as al Qaeda ideologue Abu Yahya al - Libi put it , " Pakistan has now become a stronghold in the nonbeliever alliance that is waging war on the religion of Islam .
Her army , intelligence agencies , and police have now become a spearhead in the direct collaboration of tearing apart the connective tissues of the Islamic Nation …
If these people … do not deserve combat to eliminate their overwhelming evil and rampant corruption in this life and in religion , who then , deserves it ? "
Despite Libi ’s rhetoric , Pakistan is not on the verge of collapse .
The problem is that Pakistan ’s continued pursuit of the same balancing strategy — albeit one that pursues anti-Pakistan militants with greater intensity — will continue to leave space for Afghan - focused militants to plan and train inside Pakistan .
That will make successfully concluding the war in Afghanistan much more difficult .
Moreover , leaving space for Afghan - focused militants almost certainly means leaving space for al Qaeda .
The Pakistani Army still seems to think it can manipulate the militant groups in its midst .
Some in the Army may argue that a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan would bolster Pakistani security because the Pakistani government will no longer be complicit with a Western occupation in Afghanistan , thus obviating al Qaeda ’s argument for attacking it .
After all , they will argue , Pakistan has managed instability in Afghanistan before , but did not suffer terrorist attacks in downtown Islamabad until the United States showed up across the border .
That mindset is outdated .
Al Qaeda is the wild card because of its uncanny ability to co-opt other militant groups , either wholesale or piecemeal .
The power that comes from the publicity and notoriety al Qaeda offers cannot be wished away and has proven infectious for Pakistan ’s domestic jihadi groups .
Al Qaeda ’s success in co-opting Pakistani militants has changed the face of the international jihadi threat .
Although al Qaeda ’s own operational capacity to conduct attacks is probably more constrained today than it was several years ago , that does not much matter if Pakistani collaborators such as Sipah - i Sahaba are attacking targets in Lahore while Lashkar - e - Taiba and Ilyas Kashmiri are linked to plotters in Denver and Chicago .
The immediate problem for the United States is that an Afghanistan strategy that does not improve Pakistani performance against its domestic militants will not dramatically mitigate the security threat to the United States from al Qaeda or its allies .
But the longer - term issues are worse : increased instability in Pakistan , a festering Afghanistan , and more tension between Pakistan and India .
Even the strongest advocates of Obama ’s new strategy understand it is a calculated risk .
But Obama is right to try to reassure and cajole Pakistan into action .
One rationale for putting more U.S. troops in Afghanistan is to bolster Pakistani will , and perhaps a demonstrated commitment to Afghanistan will shake up deliberations in Rawalpindi , the Pakistani equivalent of the Pentagon .
Despite the obvious costs , this is an experiment worth trying because the consequences of failure in Pakistan are so disturbing .
When it comes to Western security , the impact of the new U.S. Afghanistan strategy on deliberations in Islamabad and Rawalpindi is more important than its effects on the ground in Kabul or Kandahar .
To judge whether it has succeeded , Washington should watch for a strategic shift in Pakistani policy toward its militants , not just greater force employed in the service of an old , failing strategy .
A rather odd bug in the Droid phone has been mistaken for a secret , silent , over - the - air invasion by Verizon 's software - update police .
When a problem with the Droid 's autofocus mysteriously disappeared overnight , paranoid Droid owners assumed that a secret update had been sent over the air to fix it .
This would be rather creepy .
It is also wrong .
In a comment on an Engadget story about the mystery fix , Android developer Dan Morrill explained what had happened , and the truth is rather stranger than the fiction .
There 's a rounding - error bug in the camera driver 's autofocus routine ( which uses a time stamp ) that causes autofocus to behave poorly on a 24.5 - day cycle .
That is , it 'll work for 24.5 days , then have poor performance for 24.5 days , then work again .
The 17th is the start of a new " works correctly " cycle , so the devices will be fine for a while .
A permanent fix is in the works .
Not only is the bug itself an odd one , so is the lack of an internet hissy - fit about the imagined reach of Verizon .
This is exactly the kind of thing that sends blogs and Twitter into a frothing frenzy , yet the net has remained mostly quiet .
As Daring Fireball 's John Gruber points out , imagine if this had been Apple suspected of reaching into the iPhone from afar :
Am I the only one who thinks that if Apple issued an over - the - air iPhone software update — no notice , no confirmation — that it would generate a Category 5 shit storm ?
If you want to try this , set your Droid 's clock back a few days and experience the thrill of a non-focusing camera for yourself .

Wired has a great feature on grad student Daniel Reetz $ 300 homebrew book - scanner ( David linked to the Instructable for it in April ) .
The device uses a couple of digital cameras , some acrylic and some wood to scan a 400 page book in 20 minutes , converting the scans to text with free software .
So over three days , and for about $ 300 , he lashed together two lights , two Canon Powershot A590 cameras , a few pieces of acrylic and some chunks of wood to create a book scanner that 's fast enough to scan a 400 - page book in about 20 minutes .
To use it , he simply loads in a book and presses a button , then turns the page and presses the button again .
Each press of the button captures two pages , and when he 's done , software on Reetz 's computer converts the book into a PDF file .
The Reetz DIY book scanner is n't automated - you still need to stand by it to turn the pages .
But it 's fast and inexpensive .
" The hardware is ridiculously simple as long as you are not demanding archival quality , " he says .
" A dumpster full of building materials , really cheap cameras and outrageous textbook prices was all I needed to do it . "

Saché , born Sashah Adova , was a female human who served as one of the handmaidens of Amidala , Queen of Naboo .
During the Invasion of Naboo , Saché and Yané remained behind as her sovereign and the other handmaidens fled Naboo with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan , Obi-Wan Kenobi . [ 1 ]
Whilst she remained on Naboo , Saché carried messages for a resistance group until she was caught by droids and subject to interrogation by the Trade Federation , which resulted in a large collection of scars around her neck , body and arms .
During the interrogation , Saché saved the lives of members of the Royal Naboo Security Forces by refusing to name them . [ 4 ]
The Royal Security Forces repaid Saché 's bravery with loyalty second only to Amidala and , after she announced her intention to run for a seat in the planetary legislative assembly , it was done with their full support .
In 28 BBY , the same year Amidala 's term as queen ended , Saché was accepted into the assembly . [ 4 ]
Saché became an infuential member of Queen Réillata 's government and , when Governor Sio Bibble finally retired following Amidala 's death in 19 BBY , Saché was the favourite to succeed him .
However , under self - proclaimed Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine 's decree , the election was suspended and a new position was created to oversee the daily operations of the Naboo government , a position granted to former Captain Quarsh Panaka , the man who trained Amidala , Saché and the handmaidens for their security arrangement .

Biography Edit
Early life Edit
Sashah Adova , [ 6 ] a human female , was born on the planet Naboo [ 1 ] in the year 44 BBY .
When she was twelve years old in 32 BBY , she was recruited by Captain Quarsh Panaka of the Royal Naboo Security Forces to serve as one of the handmaidens for newly - elected Queen Padmé Amidala .
Along with Rabene Tonsort , Eirtama Ballory , and Suyan Higin , Adova was introduced to Amidala at the end of her second week on the throne .
Panaka introduced Adova last , unsure how to explain his reasoning that the girl , who was younger than the Queen and all the other candidates , was qualified .
Amidala subsequently brought the girls to her apartment in the Theed Royal Palace to speak with them privately , alongside her first handmaiden Tsabin . [ 6 ]
There , Amidala and her new handmaidens discussed the details of their new positions , and what Amidala hoped for from them .
Adova explained to Amidala that Panaka thought the girls would work for him directly as an extension of the Royal Security Forces , not understanding the Queen 's wishes , and that he had something on Tonsort — her past as an art forger — that he thought he could use to control her .
After further discussion , Adova suggested that the girls could be Amidala 's shadow .
Tonsort , noting her slight notoriety , suggested that the handmaidens all take new names that matched Amidala 's given one , as well .
When Ballory was hesitant , Adova noted that if she had wanted to become famous under her real name , the position of handmaiden was not for her , which led Ballory to acquiesce to the idea .
Adova , noting her position as the youngest of the handmaidens and the least likely to be called on as Amidala 's stand - in , volunteered to be the Queen 's page .
When Tonsort suggested that the disguised Amidala should also be a page , Adova also volunteered to help ease a reluctant Panaka into the idea .
When it came time to pick her new name , she dubbed herself Saché . [ 6 ]
Invasion of Naboo Edit
Early in Amidala 's reign , Naboo was invaded by the Trade Federation .
[ 1 ]
Amidala and Tsabin , now known as Sabé , switched places as the invasion forces closed in on Theed .
Saché did the elder handmaiden 's hair as part of the deception .
[ 4 ]
When Amidala , her handmaidens and her guards were rescued from the battle droids that had captured them by the Jedi Qui - Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi , [ 1 ] Saché and Higin — now Yané — stayed behind on Naboo with elements of the Royal Security Forces that led a resistance against the occupation [ 4 ] as Amidala and company escaped to Coruscant to rally assistance . [ 1 ]
During the occupation , Saché carried messages for the resistance .
She was eventually captured by the droid forces and tortured for information , but she held out and refused to name any Royal Security Forces members , such as Mariek Panaka . [ 4 ]
Amidala eventually returned to Naboo with the Jedi , upon which Saché and Yané were reunited with her and the other handmaidens .
The regrouped royal party travelled to the swamps to enlist the aid of the Gungans in driving the Trade Federation out . [ 1 ]
Personality and traits Edit
Saché was a human female native from Naboo .
She had brown hair , brown eyes and fair skin .
[ 1 ]
As a result of her torture at the hands of the Trade Federation occupying forces after her capture , her body was covered with scars that she usually concealed under clothing . [ 4 ]
Behind the scenes Edit
" I asked George if I could come and watch the shoot , and he asked if I wanted to be in the royal entourage . (...)
I 'm at the back with a hood on and you can't really see me .
I do n't even remember what my character was called . "
― Sofia Coppola , about her role as Saché
Saché was portrayed by Sofia Coppola in the 1999 film Star Wars : Episode I The Phantom Menace , the first installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy .
[ 1 ]
Coppola considers director George Lucas , a long - time friend and working partner of her father Francis Ford Coppola , " like an uncle to me — he used to send me and my brother Roman Star Wars toys when we were little , " and upon hearing he was going back to the saga , " thought it'd be so fun to see how they make them " as she was preparing her own directorial debut The Virgin Suicides , released that same year .
When she asked Lucas if she could attend the shoot , he offered her the role of Saché , and she accepted as " it seemed like a good vantage point to watch without getting in the way . " [ 7 ]

The day after the federal government told Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio that he could no longer use his deputies to round up suspected illegal immigrants on the street , the combative Arizona sheriff did just that .
He launched one of his notorious “ sweeps , ” in which his officers descend on heavily Latino neighborhoods , arrest hundreds of people for violations as minor as a busted headlight and ask them whether they are in the country legally .
“ I wanted to show everybody it did n’t make a difference , ” Arpaio said of the Obama administration ’s order .
Arpaio calls himself “ America ’s toughest sheriff ” and remains widely popular across the state .
For two decades , he has basked in publicity over his colorful tactics , such as dressing jail inmates in pink underwear and housing them in outdoor tents during the brutal Phoenix summers .
But he has escalated his tactics in recent months , not only defying the federal government but launching repeated investigations of those who criticize him .
He recently filed a racketeering lawsuit against the entire Maricopa County power structure .
On Thursday night , the Arizona Court of Appeals issued an emergency order forbidding the Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office from searching the home or chambers of a Superior Court judge who was named in the racketeering case .
Last year , when Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon called for a federal investigation of Arpaio ’s immigration enforcement , the Sheriff ’s Office demanded to see Gordon ’s e-mails , phone logs and appointment calendars .
When the police chief in one suburb complained about the sweeps , Arpaio ’s deputies raided that town ’s City Hall .
A local television station , KPHO , in a 10 - minute - long segment last month , documented two dozen instances of the sheriff launching investigations of critics , none of which led to convictions .
The most notorious case involves county Supervisor Don Stapley , a Republican who has sometimes disagreed with Arpaio ’s immigration tactics .
Last December , deputies arrested Stapley on charges of failing to disclose business interests properly on his statement of economic interest .
Stapley ’s alarmed supervisor colleagues had their offices swept for listening devices .
Arpaio contended the search was illegal and sent investigators to the homes of dozens of county staffers to grill them about the sweep .
A judge in September dismissed several of the allegations against Stapley , and prosecutors dropped the case .
Three days later , Arpaio ’s deputies arrested Stapley again after he parked his car in a downtown parking structure near his office .
No charges were filed until County Atty .
Andrew Thomas --
Arpaio ’s ally in his fights with the supervisor -- charged Stapley this week with misusing money he raised to run for president of the National Assn. of Counties .
“ It ’s just extraordinary , the kind of thing that takes place in Third World dictatorships , ” said Paul Charlton , a former U.S. attorney who is representing Stapley .
He predicted the latest charges would also be dismissed .
“ So many people are of one mind on a single issue -- illegal immigration -- that they are willing to ignore these misdeeds . ”
Arpaio brushes off suggestions that he ’s used his office to go after critics .
Many of the complaints , as in the Stapley case , come from targets of anti-corruption probes that started with tips rather than the sheriff ’s personal intercession .
“ We do n’t abuse our power , ” Arpaio said in an interview .
“ We do what we have to do . ”
Arpaio , a Republican , is highly popular in Arizona .
He won reelection last year with 55 % of the vote in the state ’s most populous county .
Though he has said he ’s not interested in running for governor , a recent poll showed him crushing the presumptive Democratic nominee , state Atty .
Gen. Terry Goddard , 51 % to 39 % .
The sheriff was not always at war with much of the region ’s political establishment .
A former official with the Drug Enforcement Administration who was first elected sheriff in 1992 , Arpaio had support from the majority - Republican county Board of Supervisors and from local Latino leaders .
“ He had a very good relationship with the Hispanic community , ” said Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox , the lone Democrat and lone Latina on the board .
But by 2005 , central Arizona was seething over illegal immigration .
Crime was rising in Phoenix , a key smuggling hub that was becoming the kidnapping capital of the country .
Arpaio received a federal waiver , known as a 287 ( g ) , that allowed his deputies to enforce federal immigration laws .
He said he had identified more than 30,000 illegal immigrants through his sweeps and interrogations in the county jail .
In October , the federal Department of Homeland Security revoked the 287(g ) for Arpaio ’s street operations , though he could continue to question jail inmates about their immigration status .
Arpaio , however , said state law permitted him to continue his street operations and is awaiting a legal opinion from Thomas , the county attorney .
Latino community leaders say Arpaio has become more aggressive since he was stripped of some authority in the 287 ( g ) program .
“ It ’s actually gotten worse rather than better , ” said Salvador Reza , an activist who added that some immigrants do n’t dare turn the lights on in their homes at night for fear that Arpaio ’s deputies would knock at their doors .
A Homeland Security spokesman declined to comment , referring a reporter to statements Secretary Janet Napolitano gave to a liberal advocacy group in Washington .
Napolitano , the former governor of Arizona , said Arpaio “ was unwilling to accept that there were standards that needed to be met .
He wanted to go off on his own .
And so that ’s where we had a parting of ways . ”
She acknowledged , however , that state law would allow him to continue making his arrests .
The U.S. Department of Justice has launched a civil rights investigation into Arpaio ’s tactics .
The sheriff has refused to cooperate and has called for an investigation of the investigators .
As Arpaio has fenced with the Obama administration , he has become embroiled in a sometimes - surreal battle with the five county supervisors who oversee his budget .
Amid the recession , they have cut the sheriff ’s budget by 12.2 % .
Arpaio and Thomas filed a federal racketeering lawsuit against the county supervisors , administrators and several judges who have ruled against the two in prior cases .
Arpaio and Thomas contended there was a conspiracy to assign the Stapley prosecution to an anti-Thomas judge , part of an effort to cover up what they call a wasteful county effort to build a new courthouse .
County officials noted that Arpaio and Thomas have sued them six times in efforts to regain power over their budgets -- and they lost every time .
Tensions escalated this week when the county attorney filed criminal charges against the presiding judge of the county ’s criminal courts , alleging bribery and obstruction of justice for ruling against Arpaio and prosecutors in some of those previous legal battles .
Wilcox , whom Thomas charged this week with violating state laws by voting on government contracts for a charitable organization that gave one of her businesses a loan , said she had been stunned by the sheriff ’s conduct .
“ They have made life hell on everybody , ” she said of Arpaio and Thomas .
“ Every time you speak out , they investigate you . ”
“ Racketeering ?
That ’s just crazy , ” she added .
“ We ’re becoming the laughingstock of America . ”

Fetisov 's much - heralded return ended in defeat
Former NHL star turned politician Slava Fetisov has played in a top - level ice hockey match for his old team CSKA Moscow - at the age of 51 .
The defenseman featured in Moscow 's 3 - 2 defeat by SKA St Petersburg in a Continental Hockey League game .
" It is a very good game , " Fetisov told TV cameras during the first interval .
" Both teams are playing at maximum speed .
The game is very intense . "
Fetisov won two Stanley Cups with the Detroit Red Wings and retired in 1998 .
He ended his professional career aged 40 after securing a second straight Stanley Cup victory with Detroit .
The former Soviet Union captain is now a member of the Russian parliament 's upper house and president of CSKA , where he began his career .
CSKA coach Sergei Nemchinov called on Fetisov after defender Denis Kulyash was injured ahead of Friday 's game .
Some critics have dismissed Fetisov 's return as a publicity stunt and his return led the news on Russia 's state television channels throughout the day on Friday .
" It 's a super move for CSKA , " said team captain Konstantin Korneyev in Russian newspaper Sovetsky Sport .
" I can't even imagine how much the interest in our team will grow .
The fans will go out of their minds . "
Earlier Darius Kasparaitis , another NHL veteran defender who now plays for SKA St. Petersburg , told the Sovetsky Sport newspaper that Fetisov 's return would produce a wonderful " show on ice . "
But he said SKA , which leads the league 's western division , will play just as aggressively against Fetisov .
" Our team is full of angry guys , " said Kasparaitis .
" We wo n't spare our rival on the ice no matter who he is . "
Fetisov played for CSKA Moscow for 14 years from 1975 to 1989 , before defecting to the NHL .
He won two Olympic golds , seven World Championship titles , and coached Russia to bronze at the 2002 Olympics .
Liam Clancy , the man Bob Dylan described as the " greatest ballad singer " he had ever heard has died .
He was 74 .
Mr Clancy died at Bon Secours Hospital in Cork after a long battle with pulmonary fibrosis - scarring of the lungs .
His brother Bobby died of the same disease in 2002 .
In an interview with The Irish Timesin September to promote The Yellow Bittern , a film about his life , he admitted that he was on his " last legs " from the disease .
Liam was the youngest of the four Clancy brothers and Paddy , Bobby and Tom all predeceased him .
Tommy Makem died two years ago .
Born in Carrick - on - Suir , Co Tipperary , Liam Clancy emigrated to the United States to join his brothers in 1956 .
They began their singing careers around the pubs of Greenwich Village where they met a young Bob Dylan who has claimed them as one of his biggest influences .
Together the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem began a transatlantic phenomenon after a fortuitous break on the coast - to - coast Ed Sullivan Showin 1961 where they filled in for a guest who could not turn up .
They were then offered a record deal with Columbia and were hugely successful on both sides of the Atlantic resurrecting Irish songs such as Roddy McCorley , Brennan on the Moorand The Jug of Punch .
Their ability as recording artists was matched by the strength of their live performances and their gifts as songwriters .
Filmmaker Alan Gilsenen , who made The Yellow Bittern , said Mr Clancy 's passing was the " end of an era " .
" He and his brothers and Tommy reclaimed an enormous amount of folk songs for Ireland , reinterpreted in them in terms of their experience in America outselling the Beatles at one stage . "
Fine Gael Leader Enda Kenny expressed his sympathy on the sad passing of Liam Clancy , saying that Ireland has lost a brilliant musician .
" I hugely regret the passing of Liam Clancy .
His death really does mark the end of an era .
Liam ’s contribution to Irish music and culture was simply outstanding , " he said .
" As a member of the Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem , they revolutionised ballad and hope music in Ireland and later with Tommy Makem , Liam provided outstanding entertainment and promotion of his country . "
We are built to rationalize .
That is , our minds often unfairly defend our most deeply held beliefs ; when we sense such beliefs being threatened , our minds distract us , refuse to comprehend alternatives , and grab onto weak excuses as if they were timber .
La - la - la - la - I - ca n ’t - hear - you .
This makes it especially hard for those of us who want to overcome our biases to identify and question such beliefs .
But like many parasites , our unfairly held beliefs are most vulnerable when they are young , i.e. , when we first acquire them , and when they must come up to a surface , rather than staying buried deep .
For our deeply held beliefs that are passed down via genes , it can be very hard to even notice them , much less see when they are integrated into our other thoughts .
But beliefs that are passed down culturally are more vulnerable – there must be some visible social process whereby new generations learn these beliefs from older generations .
Now beliefs that we learn implicitly , from gestures and expressions of others , can still be a lot of work to identify ; you may have to watch a lot of behavior up close to notice the belief transmission .
Fortunately , many deeply held beliefs are transmitted out in the open , in explicit words , and even written down in books .
Case in point : most of us attended public instead of private schools because our governments wanted to indoctrinate us into certain beliefs ( and acts ) .
And to keep control , such schools make teachers stick to textbooks .
So one way to explicitly identify our possibly - unfair deeply held beliefs is to study the textbooks we learned from as kids .
If we could collect lists of important non-obvious beliefs we were taught as kids , and the supporting arguments we were given at the time , we could force ourselves to more directly confront the propaganda that formed us .
Yes our minds might still unconsciously bias us in their favor , but we ’d have a much better chance to apply more neutral standards we ’ve learned over the years .
In this confrontation , we ’d know to rely less on unarticulated intuitions that might just reflect teachings from when our minds were weak and vulnerable .
When propaganda is written down , saved , and organized , we have a better chance to confront and overcome it .
It is sad and suspicious that we are not in the habit of knowing and confronting our propaganda in this way .
Many say such confrontation is dangerous and harmful , that we gain important advantages from our self - deceptive acceptance of inaccurate propaganda .
But what evidence do we have that we are better off believing the lies we were told as kids ?
That belief sure sounds like the sort of self - serving propaganda we expect to have been told .
Surely as adults , at least some of us should face facts , know our propaganda , and ask how well supported it is .
Perhaps we will decide others are better off not knowing what we have learned .
But some should confront the beasts that lie within us .

The financial cost of war is often little more than an afterthought , but President Obama ’s decision to take several months to announce his decision on the Afghanistan escalation has allowed people to ask , what will this cost ?
The answer seems to be : depends who you ask .
The Pentagon is estimating around $ 500,000 per soldier , per year .
The White House estimates that it ’ll actually cost about twice that much .
The matter is contentious , but officials in both camps say the price “ could change “ over time , and in matters military that almost always means “ could go up . ”
Considering the hundreds of billions of dollars already spent , these numbers may not seem like much .
But with 30,000 - 40,000 troops each costing so much and all staying for an unknown number of years , it will rapidly add up to a bill that the Obama Administration , whose military budgets going forward foresaw a significant drop in the cost of overseas adventures , had n’t prepared for .
" proud whore "

Does the simple slut truly think that she can change God 's standards by seducing a generation of rebels into joining her in fist - raised , stiff - necked , hard - hearted rebellion against Him ?
Get real ! "
KANSAS CITY , Kansas -
A religious organization known for picketing the funerals of deceased American soldiers and vocally opposing rights for gays and lesbians have another target in sight : Lady Gaga The Kansas - based Westboro Baptist Church , led by the Reverend Fred Phelps , issued a press release Tuesday in which they claimed Lady Gaga is awho wasfor allegedly leading aagainst God .
The singer , who thankedwhen receiving the Best New Artist award at the MTV Video Music Awards earlier this year , enslaves her fans to their own corruption , Phelps writes ,
She also allegedly brings her fans into " slavery to their own corruption , teaching them to glory in their own shame . "
The press release goes on to read the church intends to picket an upcoming concert of Lady Gaga's at the Fox Theatre in Missouri on January 7th , and it " genuinely " ends with " You 're Going to Hell . "
Westboro Baptist Church is known as an anti-gay hate group that abhors Italians and Catholics .
But Lady Gaga need not fret , WBC does n't just hate her , they hate everyone else , including Americans , the Irish , Swedish , Indians , the Jews , Hindus , and more .
They have also targeted several individuals , including Jon Stewart , Stephen Colbert , Princess Diana , and Heath Ledger .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- President Barack Obama blasted Wall Street for worsening the economy 's downturn and promised to make financial markets more transparent and accountable .
In his weekly radio and Internet address Saturday , the president applauded the House of Representatives for passing sweeping financial reform legislation and said the economy is recovering from the " irresponsibility " of Wall Street firms that " gambled on risky loans and complex financial products , seeking short - term profits and big bonuses . "
It was " risk management without the management , " Obama said .
" Their actions , in the absence of strong oversight , intensified the cycle of bubble - and - bust and led to a financial crisis that threatened to bring down the entire economy . "
Obama also blamed an " era of easy credit " for some of the excesses .
" Millions of Americans borrowed beyond their means , bought homes they could n't afford , and assumed that housing prices would always rise and the day of reckoning would never come , " he said .
" It was a disaster that could have been avoided if we'd had clearer rules of the road for Wall Street and actually enforced them , " the president said .
The House on Friday narrowly approved the most comprehensive financial industry regulations since the Great Depression , including new restrictions on the biggest banks and the Federal Reserve .
The legislation also would create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency to oversee mortgage , credit card and other banking products .
Read about the House vote .
Obama urged the Senate to act quickly on its own financial reform proposals to ensure that the " risky dealings that sparked the crisis would be fully disclosed and properly regulated . "
And he criticized Republicans and financial industry lobbyists for blocking efforts to mandate tougher rules .
In an interview with CBS ' " 60 Minutes " program scheduled for broadcast on Sunday , Obama condemns bankers for taking government bailout money and are now collecting handsome bonuses .
" I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street , " Obama said , according to excerpts from the interview released Saturday .
" What 's really frustrating me right now is that you 've got these same banks who benefited from taxpayer assistance who are fighting tooth and nail with their lobbyists ... up on Capitol Hill , fighting against financial regulatory control , " the president said .
In the Republican address on Saturday , U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee focused on climate change and the international summit that Obama is slated to attend on Dec. 18 in Copenhagen .
Blackburn criticized Democrats for wanting to " impose a ' cap - and - trade ' national energy tax , a bureaucratic nightmare that would make households , small businesses and family farms pay higher prices for electricity , gasoline , food and virtually every product made in America .
" Just think of what will happen to small businesses and manufacturers hit with these skyrocketing energy bills , especially when nations like India and China do n't agree to these mandatory emissions limits , " Blackburn said .
" With Americans already facing double - digit unemployment , there could not be a worse time to unilaterally disarm our engines of job creation and economic growth . "
Blackburn said the Republican energy plan , in contrast , does n't " tax people out of their house and home " and puts " every clean , responsible energy option on the table so we can create jobs , ease the strain on family budgets , and clean up our environment . "
Norway ' the best place to live '
Children in Norway can look forward to a high quality of life Norway is the best place in the world to live while Niger is the least desirable , according to an annual report by the United Nations .
The 182 countries were ranked according to the quality of life their citizens experienced .
Criteria examined included life expectancy , literacy rates , school enrolment and country economies .
However the UN human development index used data collected in 2007 - before the global economic crisis .
Opposites
The UN Development Programme said the index highlighted the grave disparities between rich and poor countries .
Best places to live Norway Australia Iceland
Where would you like to live ?
Norway 's consistently high rating for desirable living standards , is , in large part , the result of the discovery of offshore oil and gas deposits in the late 1960s .
Niger , however , is a drought - prone country which has sometimes struggled to feed its people .
Other countries to reach the top spots were Australia and Iceland .
However , living standards in Iceland have changed since the data was collected , as it was one of the countries worst hit by the credit crunch .
The 2008 crisis exposed the Icelandic economy 's dependence on the banking sector , leaving it particularly vulnerable to collapse .
The country 's three major banks were nationalised and Iceland had to seek international support in order to stay afloat .
Human Development Report Office deputy director Eva Jespersen told the BBC News website that although the country 's now - reduced gross domestic product figure would " pull Iceland down " next year , its high life expectancy rates and commitment to education would " cushion the decline to some degree " .
Afghanistan was regarded the second least desirable place to live , just below Sierra Leone in third from bottom place .
The index shows that life expectancy in Niger was 50 years - approximately 30 years shorter than for those living in Norway .
For every dollar earned per person in Niger , $ 85 was earned in Norway .

However , the Democratic Republic of Congo has the poorest people , where the average income per person was $ 298 per year .
China has become one of the most improved because of rising income levels and life expectancy rates .
The United States is rated as the 13th most desirable place to live , while the UK takes the 21st spot .
The index also showed that half the people in the poorest 24 nations were believed to be illiterate .
The tiny principality of Liechtenstein has the highest GDP per capita at $ 85,383 .
Its population is about 35,000 .
The report 's author , Jeni Klugman , said : " Many countries have experienced setbacks over recent decades , in the face of economic downturns , conflict - related crises and the HIV and Aids epidemic .
" And this was even before the impact of the current global financial crisis was felt . "

Somewhere Else
During my competitive cross-country running days it was n’t uncommon for me to run five miles at 5 AM and another ten miles at 10 PM , six days a week .
I was competitive .
I wanted to win races .
And I was smart enough to know that if I dedicated myself to extra training , while my opponents were sleeping or socializing , I would be one step ahead of them when we crossed the finish line .
When I first started these early morning and late night runs , the experience was rather brutal .
My body did n’t want to cooperate .
It ached and cramped up .
And I found out that the only way to endure the extra training was to disassociate my mind from my body , putting my mind somewhere else while my body ran .
Ca n’t Relate
Over time , I became quite proficient at doing this .
I got so good at it , in fact , that I actually looked forward to running .
Because when I ran , my mind was clear and at peace with the world – especially when nobody else was around .
In the midst of what seemed to be a strenuous workout , my mind was in a soothingly relaxed state … similar to that of a deep meditation .
I do n’t compete in races anymore , but I still run almost every day .
Even though I no longer have to , I typically still run in the wee hours of the morning or very late at night .
And since my friends know that I have a flexible work schedule , most of them think I ’m a bit weird for running at such ‘ odd ’ hours .
I ’ve tried to explain to them why I do it , and how it soothes my mind .
But they ca n’t relate .
So I ’m still a weirdo in their eyes .
She Was Right
Last night , I went running on the Pacific Beach boardwalk at 11 PM .
It was calm and quiet out – just the way I like it .
I was about three miles into my run when a peculiar looking woman sitting on the boardwalk ’s barrier wall shouted , “ Hey , you ! ” and then waved me down .
My first inclination was to just ignore her and continue running .
But my curiosity got the best of me .
So I stopped .
The woman had long blonde dreadlocks , several piercings in her ears and nose , tattoos on both arms , and a Grateful Dead t- shirt on .
She was strumming an acoustic guitar and had a thick , white joint burning in a small ashtray beside her .
She stopped strumming her guitar and began to chuckle as soon as she saw me looking down at the joint .
“ Do n’t worry , ” she said .
“ I ’m legit .
I have a medical prescription for it . ”
“ It ’s none of my business , ” I quickly replied .
“ Anyway , ” she continued .
“ Perhaps you do n’t realize this , but it ’s pretty late to be out exercising .
I ’ve seen you out here a few times before , running after midnight . ”
“ So , what ’s your point ? ” I asked .
“ Well thousands of people run on this boardwalk every single day , but you seem to be the only runner I see in the middle of the night .
And it strikes me as being kind of weird .
So what ’s your deal ? ”
I told her about my love for a quite landscape , and the way in which running soothes my mind .
“ … like a deep mediation , ” I told her .
She smiled , strummed once on her guitar , and took a drag of her joint .
“ Well then , I ’m doing the same thing as you right now , ” she replied .
“ Only in my own way – a way that works for me .
Can you dig that ? ”
I stared at her for a second and then laughed , because I knew she was right .
“ Yeah , I can dig that , ” I said .
She winked and started strumming her guitar again .
I winked back and started running again .
Conclusion
Some of us run in the middle of the night .
Some of us strum acoustic guitars and smoke joints .
And others go to church .
Or sip expensive wine .
Or surf on dangerous waves .
Or jump out of perfectly good airplanes .
When we try to understand people by personally relating to the things that they do , we usually ca n’t make any sense of it .
Because it ’s easier to see weirdness in a sea of normality , than it is to decode the logical methods behind one ’s madness .
But when we look just a little deeper , by making a noble effort to understand people by truly listening to why they do the things that they do , they never seem quite as weird .
Actually , they begin to seem …
Almost normal .
[ digg- reddit - me ] See Part 1 : An Introduction here .
Parts 3 and 4 discussing the Democratic approach and then lessons from this moment of “ welfare scleroris / imperial overstretch ” coming tomorrow and Friday .
Republicans have called themselves , and are once again trying to position themselves , as the party of fiscal responsibility .
This is the pendulum swing of deficit politics in its second repetition – as Republicans run up massive deficits during their time in power and then attempt to pass off the blame for raising taxes or cutting programs onto the Democrats who succeed them in office .
The political challenge the Republicans face is intriguing .
Their ideology holds the solution to the deficit is to shrink the size of the government .
Yet the Republican base consists of corporate America , the military , and the elderly – the largest beneficiaries of current government spending .
Given this , it ’s not surprising that while in power Republicans have expanded rather than shrinking government .
Bush expanded Medicare further than anyone since LBJ created it all while cutting taxes and engaging in two wars and allowing Congress to engorge itself with discretionary spending increases never before allowed .
Bush was not an isolated example .
Like his apparent role model , Ronald Reagan , he saw deficit spending as a way to win politically in the short term as you gave everyone what they wanted – and protected those interest groups who supported you – while in the long term the incredible irresponsibility would force government to shrink , and perhaps even discredit the idea of a competent or sustainable government program .
In other words , deficits were the way to “ starve the beast . ”
Republicans did not jettison this approach along with Bush when they began to repudiate his legacy .
John McCain – for all his talk of fiscal rectitude – offered more of the same in his campaign agenda .
He proposed dramatic tax cuts without commensurate spending cuts ( while masking this by proposing the elimination of pork barrel spending which represents a minuscule portion of the federal budget . )
As an alternative to the stimulus , McCain and the Republicans attempted the same trick – attacking the plan for adding to the deficit with spending while proposing a plan that would add even more to the deficit through tax cuts ( which the Congressional Budget Office determined was a less effective way to stimulate the economy . )
For Republicans , increasing the deficit by cutting taxes is “ fiscally responsible ” – while increasing the deficit with spending is “ generational theft . ”
What ’s tricky is how Republicans position themselves with regards to the looming fiscal crisis .
The business conservatives who make up an influential portion of the Republican base tend to propose pragmatic but politically impossible solutions like cutting spending to the other core Republican constituencies – the elderly and the military , and sometimes , even the tax and other subsidies to big corporations .
The other groups seem primarily concerned with ensuring that their own government dollars continuing to grow .
The past two times a liberal has taken office following several terms of extreme fiscal irresponsibility by a Republican though , a semi- independent movement has sprung up , thus changing the political dynamics in the Republican party .
This movement of citizens concerned about the size of government , of government debt , and especially of liberals being in charge of this government ( which suddenly seems more intrusive now that it is in the control of those they do n’t sympathize with ) was incarnated in Ross Perot ’s two presidential campaigns , the 1994 Republican Revolution , and today , the Tea Parties .
In each instance , this movement has coalesced around an inchoate frustration with the way things are coupled with the remarkably fixed position of opposing everything the Democrats do , opposing tax increases , and supporting the reduction of the deficit .
Though this logically must lead to cutting government programs , which programs will be cut always remains vague which works well enough until a Republican gets in power .
To balance and rally these constituencies while out of power – the anti-tax fiscal hawks , the elderly relying on government programs , the military reliant on government spending , and the corporations who profit from government favors – Republicans have adopted a framework whereby they condemn any new spending as “ generational theft ” while protecting the status quo .
Within this framework , Republicans claim their protection of the status quo which is screwing over my generation is actually about protecting my generation .
This language also comforts the elderly who do n’t wish to see any reduction in their benefits .
Under the Republican approach , the only elderly who will see a reduction in benefits under the Republican plan are the eventual elderly of the younger generations – as the government programs they are now paying for cease .
The challenge Obama has given to the Republicans though is to propose a solution to the looming fiscal crisis through health care reform .
Republicans have responded by claiming that the plans will add to the deficit ( contrary to the Congressional Budget Office ) while at the same time they have been attacking any measures in the plan which might actually cut costs .
For example , Senator Coburn has said , “ If you ’re a senior and you ’re on Medicare , you better be afraid of this bill ” – which is a difficult position to maintain while at the same time holding that any deficit spending today is “ generational theft . ”
But it is of course , the only political answer they have .
The Republicans – for short term political expediency – are creating an interesting political dynamic ( and an impossible situation for the country . )
They are telling the elderly that any spending that adds to the deficit is stealing from their grandchildren and children – while telling them to be afraid of any cuts to the programs they like .
Meanwhile , as they filibuster any attempts to alleviate the situation , they inculcate the belief among the younger generation that the government cannot do anything right – pointing to the approaching fiscal disaster as proof .
The hope must be that if they are correct that this disaster cannot be averted , their obstruction of any attempt to avoid it will be forgiven , especially if the disaster itself discredits the government , thus bringing the younger generation ideologically closer to the Republican position .
Thus is the logic of deficit politics and starve - the - beast governance .

To some people who recall Seattle 's early - 90s grunge scene , it will always be Nirvana v Pearl Jam , and that 's a great pity .
A band fronted by a surf dude who smokes so much pot he recently installed a fireman 's pole in his home so he can get to his studio before he forgets anything - c'mon , these are now pretty fun guys .
Never was this more evident than on the band 's new one , Backspacer .
Less doom in big shorts , more sharp new wavey compositions , the group seem to be reconnecting with their past in an extremely profitable way .
This does n't mean PJ are total escapists , though .
Still capable of an emotive ballad , Eddie Vedder and company have found a way to reinvigorate their game while creating quality fortysomething balladry , the better to get up there in the pantheon with Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young .

Hi Blog .
What follows is an excerpt of a transcript of Michael Moore ’s press conference at the Tokyo Stock Exchange , dated November 30 , 2009 .
He too does n’t like being fingerprinted at the border .
Fortunately , he speaks up about it , unlike most celebrities that want to bask in the lucrative glow of celebrity in Japan .
I make no claims about some of the other stuff he says , of course .
Text follows , courtesy of Philip Brasor .
( NB :
The transcript does not include the questions , only the answers Mike gave . )
FYI .
Arudou Debito in Sapporo
==================================
MICHAEL MOORE :
- This is my first day ever in Japan .
I ’ve always wanted to come here , so I ’m grateful for the opportunity to do that .
I ’d hoped for many years that the island of Japan would float a little closer to America so that it would n’t be such a long trip , but that did n’t happen so I decided to finally come here .
- Can I explain why I ’m dressed this way ?
The airline lost my luggage .
It ’s one of the two Japanese airlines , I do n’t want to mention any names .
OK .
It begins with J and ends with L. I essentially decided to wear pajamas on the plane to sleep , and I got here with no clothes .
So where in Japan am I going to find clothes that fit me ?
Anyway , they took to a place where sumo wrestlers buy their clothes , so i’m dressed partly in my pajamas and partly in sumo clothing .
My apologies .
I usually do n’t look that much better anyway , so you wo n’t tell the difference .
- They asked me if I would share some of my impressions of my first 24 hours in Japan .
The people are very friendly and nice .
Well , actually , I landed at the airport and the customs people asked me for my fingerprints .
I ’m 55 years old and I ’ve never been fingerprinted in my life , partly because I ’ve never figured out the right kind of crime to commit , and partly because there ’s no reason to fingerprint me .
So I stepped up to the counter and they said please put your fingers here .
And I said , Why ?
I did n’t refuse , I just asked why .
And they immediately called in a supervisor and took me away .
They told me , You have to be fingerprinted .
And I said , I ’ve never been fingerprinted .
I have privacy rights , this is a democracy , right ?
They said , OK , so you want to be deported to the United States .
I said , No , so they took me into a room and brought in another supervisor , even higher , and he said I could either voluntarily give my fingerprints and enter the country or they would forceably put me back on a plane back the US .
So it ’s a lose - lose situation , I said , and he said , But you do this in the United States , when we visit the United States .
And I said , Well , that ’s wrong .
You have a passport , you took my picture , you X - rayed me .
I do n’t understand the fingerprint .
It ’s like , if no one stands up and says every now and then , we have rights as individuals .
This is a privacy issue .
I ’ve not committed any crime , so therefore you ’re not deserving of my fingerprints .
So we went back and forth and they read me my rights , which I brought along .
They had me read in English .
I read that .
My wife had already gone through the line and my friends were waiting , so I reluctantly gave in , but I gave them a different finger than my index one .
I was allowed in the country at that point .
- No need to make any apologies about immigration .
It was all comedy .
We ’re not robots , we ’re human beings .
I did n’t expect it to happen in Tokyo .
I would expect it in Washington D.C .
- I ’ve tried to film many times at the New York stock exchange , including inside the stock exchange for this film .
And large news organizations in the states have requested that I be allowed there so that they can interview me on the stock exchange floor .
And they ’ve all been refused .
So when they said to me this morning that we were going over to the Tokyo Stock Exchange , the Nikkei , I thought it was a joke .
And we walked right in .
No fingerprinting .
I ’m grateful , and thank you for allowing me in here to discuss “ Capitalism ” and business and the global economy .
So you ’ve seen me outside the New York stock exchange in the movie .
I ’ll tell you a funny story .
At the end of the movie when I ’m wrapping the stock exchange in crime scene tape , I was very afraid that I might be arrested–and fingerprinted .
And sure enough , I see the police coming toward me , and I think : this is it , they ’re coming to arrest me .
And then I see the police officer and I said , I ’ll be out of here in a minute .
I promise to clean all this up and be out of your way .
I wo n’t be any trouble .
And the officer says to me , That ’s OK Mike .
The guys in this building have lost a billion dollars of the New York City Police pension fund .
You take all the time you want .
So that ’s how I shot that scene .
- Generally , someone who holds some power , if they see me coming they do n’t want to talk to me , and it just makes it harder .
On the other hand , because so many of the people in the US see me as somebody who has not been bought by the establishment , and I ’m going to do what I think is the honest and right thing to do , it ’s easier for me to get the stories because the stories come to me .
At the beginning of the movie , with the family that ’s being evicted , and the police show up to bang in the door ?
The family filmed that themselves , and they sent me the videotape .
So one day I just got this package in the mail and opened it up and there was a tape .
Because they thought I might show what happened to them .
There was one place where they could send it and perhaps someone would see what has happened to them .
So in some ways it ’s easier for me because I ’m seen as someone who stands up to power , so people send me documents from work and things like that .
But I have to say it ’s not an enjoyable place to be public enemy number one for the Republicans or the conservatives or the business establishment , because it creates a lot of turmoil and hatred toward me .
It ’s not easy .
I would n’t apply for this job if I had to do it over again .
- I ’ve often spoken admiringly of Japan in my books and my movies .
I believe that there are many things you do that are right .
I know that if I lived here I would find many things that are wrong , but I do n’t live here .
For some strange reason you believe that if someone in Japan gets sick that person should be able to see a doctor without worrying about losing their savings or their home .
Why do you do that ?
I ’m guessing it ’s because you ’re all Japanese and you ’re all in the same boat , and if you let some people fall out of the boat then what ’s the purpose of the boat if people are drowning ?
An American family is evicted from their home once every seven and a half seconds .
The number one cause of people losing their homes , the number one cause of bankruptcies are medical bills .
People get sick and do n’t have health insurance , or the right kind of health insurance , and they lose everything , including their home .
The total number of Japanese who were kicked out of their homes last year because they could n’t pay the doctor ?
None . Zero .
Why not ?
Why have you decided to treat each other that way , to help each other , when you get sick , or lose your job ?
You ’ve built a safety net .
Why have you done that , and why do n’t we do that ?
This is the eternal question in all my films , because I love the US .
I love being an American .
I would n’t want to live anywhere else .
So the question I ’m constantly posing to my fellow Americans is :
Why do we treat each other this way , when no other civilized country that I ’ve seen believes that we should punish you because you get sick , or we should punish you when your factory goes out of business .
Why is that ?
You ’re not better than us .
We ’re all human beings , right ?
Why have you structured your society in such a way that this is not allowed to happen ?
Why do n’t you kill each other ?
Oh , I know , you think the murder rate has gone up , but there have been years in the past when you had zero handgun murders .
You have just a few gun murders each year , compared to what we have in the US .
In some years we have 15,000 murders with guns and then another 15,000 suicides with guns .
So why do n’t you kill each other ?
Because you ’re better than us ?
I do n’t think so .
But in the last 20 years you started to change , because you had a series of conservative prime ministers , starting around the time of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher , Kohl in Germany , Mulrooney in Canada , and a series of prime ministers here all through the Elvis impersonator .
No disrespect .
So now you ’re getting more of the problems we have in America .
There is more crime now .
More murders .
When people lose their jobs …
I remember as a young man , the thing about Japan was that it was shameful for a company to lay people off .
Is that correct ?
That ’s the way it used to be .
So your conservative governments started to cut away at the social safety net that you created for your people .
Cut money for health care .
Cut money for education .
Throw people out of work .
Make life harder for people who do n’t make as much money .
Punish them for being poor .
So the more you ’ve done it the American way , what have you ended up with ?
More crime .
Less educated young people , who do n’t know as much as they used to know , right ?
So to answer your question , as much as I love America , quit being like us .
Be the Japan you created after 1945 , a Japan that valued education , a Japan that would not throw you out of work .
A Japan that would never invade another country , and which would not support a country that would invade another country .
And let me tell you , when you supported George W. Bush in his endeavors , you gave him legitimacy , because he was able to say to the American people , The Japanese , they ’re with me .
Prime Minister Elvis - san is with me .
Tony Blair is with me .
The Italians are with me .
Even the Danish .
It ’s a legitimate war .
If the Japanese prime minister , and the British prime minister , and the Italian and the Spanish and the Danish had all refused to give him his cover , I do n’t know that he would have gotten away with it .
So the responsibility that these countries shared by supporting anything that George W. Bush did , it made it not only difficult for people in the US , but for people who suffer in this world as a result of the foreign policies of that individual .
I ’m so sorry to put it this way .
Please do n’t take personal offense , but you asked me what would I say to the Japanese people , a society I think highly of , a society structured on peace and respect , and you ’ve started to go down the other road .
And my humble plea is to get off that road with your new prime minister and return to the road you used to be on .

- My father is 88 years old and I told him I was coming to Japan .
He was in the first marine division in the South Pacific in WWII and fortunately survived and had me .
When I told him I was coming here he was very happy .
He said to me when we were discussing the wars last year , the reason Bush got us into these wars is because he ’s never known war .
If he had known war he would never have wanted war again .
He spent part of the war on Okinawa and I said I might go there to lay some flowers for all who died there , Japanese and Americans .
His brother , my uncle , was killed in the Philippines during the war .
And my dad has such a loving heart –you saw him in the movie .
His best friend at church is a Japanese man .
And both of them , 88 years old , go to the gym together every morning and work out together .
As sad and difficult as this world can be , it does eventually get better .
And I have always been filled with enormous hope and optimism that we will know war no more .
Tomorrow evening Pres. Obama will announce if he will expand the war in Afghanistan , and I have passed on to him a personal request from my father and his Japanese friend : Mr. Obama , you do not know war .
People who know war want it no more .
I ’m honored to share this message of peace with you , the people of Japan , who have been beacons of peace for the past 60 - plus years .

Education has long been preached as a way to keep kids away from drugs .
It ’s the walk to school that has Supt .
Tom Barnett worried .
This hardscrabble Northern California town has become a hotbed for medical marijuana farming .
Kids stroll much of the year past pungent plants flourishing in gardens and alleys .
The red - and - black - clad Timberjacks football team moved its halftime huddle on a recent Friday night to avoid the odor of marijuana smoke wafting over the gridiron from nearby houses .
Some students talk openly of farming pot after graduation -- about the only opportunity in this depressed timber town .
“ It ’s not a subculture here , ” said Barnett , who heads the Mountain Valley Unified School District .
“ Marijuana is drying in their houses .
It ’s falling out of their pockets . ”
Los Angeles is n’t the only place struggling with repercussions unleashed by its permissive medical marijuana laws .
Here in Trinity County , cannabis cultivation is upending the rural culture and economy of one of the state ’s most hard - luck regions .

Drawn by the sunny , cool climate -- and a local ordinance permissive of medical marijuana farming and possession -- big - city refugees have brought a decidedly urban edge to hamlets such as Hayfork , about 60 miles west of Redding .
This town has no stoplights .
No home mail delivery .
Nearly a quarter of its 1,900 residents are poor .
But that has n’t stopped outsiders from bidding up the price of real estate with sun-soaked southern exposures , all the better to cultivate plants that can grow 12 feet high or taller .
The sheriff ’s office estimates 10,000 plants are growing in a single remote subdivision known as Trinity Pines .
Lots on its southwest - facing slope sell for as much as $ 50,000 , up from about $ 3,500 five years ago , according to Steven Hanover , an area real estate broker .
Fall harvest season brings strangers with dreadlocks and cash boxes .
Some farmers guard their crops with electric fences , razor wire and snarling dogs .
Hikers have been threatened at gunpoint for wandering too close to where they are n’t wanted .

“ It ’s just torn the fabric of our society , ” said Judy Stewart , a 69 - year - old retiree who has lived in Trinity County for more than 50 years .
“ It ’s pitted people against one another . ”
‘ Pot paradise ’
How Trinity County , a sprawling , lightly populated area twice the size of Rhode Island , came to be dubbed “ Northern California ’s pot paradise ” by High Times magazine is a story of law , lawlessness and geography .
Just a little more than 14,000 residents are spread across its 3,000 square miles .
People live as they like in its mountains thick with trees , separated from civilization by windy roads and “ No Trespassing ” signs .
For decades , that ’s made it easy for some residents to grow marijuana without much interference .
Advertisement
Trinity County has “ always been a pot county .
Our climate in these little mountain valleys is conducive to great cannabis , ” said Mike Boutin , who runs Grace Farm , a collective in the western part of the county .
He said he originally moved there to grow and sell medical marijuana on the black market .
He now cultivates it legally because of California ’s Proposition 215 .
Known as the Compassionate Use Act , that statewide ballot initiative approved by voters in 1996 allowed patients suffering from cancer , glaucoma and other illnesses , as well as their caregivers , to grow and possess the drug to ease their discomfort .
Concerns by patients and law enforcement that the law was too ambiguous prompted the Legislature in 2003 to clarify just how much pot could be grown legally .
California guidelines currently allow half a pound of dried marijuana and six mature or 12 immature plants for patients who obtain a doctor ’s recommendation .
In addition , the law gave cities and counties flexibility to adopt more generous guidelines .
Trinity in 2007 upped its limits to 12 mature pot plants , 24 immature plants and 3 pounds of dried weed -- a policy that was later revoked after residents complained .
State law also permits nonprofit cultivation cooperatives where patients can , in effect , pool individual plant limits .
That opened the way for large growing operations like Grace Farm , which has 20 members from across the state .

Grace Farm family
Among them is Jacqueline Patterson , 31 , who uses marijuana to treat her cerebral palsy and a severe stutter .
The single mother of four lives in publicly subsidized housing in Marin County .
She fears she would be booted from the program if she tried to grow dope at home or buy it from street dealers .
She travels to Trinity twice a year to pick up 3 pounds of marijuana , which she gets free in exchange for working for the co-op .
The collective charges most patients about $ 170 an ounce .
The arrangement has allowed her “ to acquire medicine affordably , ” said Patterson , who moved in 2007 from Missouri , where medical marijuana is illegal .
“ Grace Farm has really given me more of a family out here in California . ”
But locals in Trinity say California law is so permissive that almost anyone can get a doctor ’s recommendation needed to grow their own marijuana or buy it at dispensaries .
Identification cards -- which patients can use as proof that they have a physician ’s recommendation for medicinal cannabis -- are voluntary .
And because state guidelines are n’t hard and fast , some doctors recommend that their patients be allowed to grow many more plants than the suggested ceiling .

Officials say they ’re powerless to do much about it .
“ All they need is a recommendation by a doctor on a matchbook , ” said Roger Jaegel , a county supervisor who represents an area that includes parts of Hayfork .
“ Dr. Seuss could be writing these prescriptions . ”
The upshot , critics say , is that a law crafted to help sick people has morphed into a lucrative trade , one in which rural farms are supplying urban dispensaries that cater to mostly recreational users armed with doctors ’ recommendations .
Growers have flocked to Northern California ’s “ Emerald Triangle ” of Trinity , Mendocino and Humboldt counties for cheap land , a good climate and loose oversight .
In the college town of Arcata , home of Humboldt State University , buildings that once housed car dealerships now host cannabis dispensaries , said Kevin Hoover , publisher of the Arcata Eye newspaper .
He said that entrepreneurs had converted entire homes into indoor greenhouses rigged with “ grow lamps . ”
That ’s blighting neighborhoods and exacerbating the town ’s housing shortage , Hoover said .
Home invasions and fires are up .

“ What ’s happened is that a lot of the people who are in it for the money have found all the loopholes , ” Hoover said .
“ They ’re gaming the whole thing to enable more of an industrial production of marijuana . ”
Out - of - towners
In Hayfork , some farmers plant pot near public roads .
Cars with out - of - state license plates pour into town during the fall harvest .
Authorities suspect that a shooting in Trinity Pines was linked to marijuana .
Many residents now avoid that area .
“ We ’re beginning to feel like Colombia , ” Jaegel said .
“ It ’s a difficult thing for small communities to have to put up with . ”

Marijuana advocates say that troublemakers are a small minority and that the true danger is drug cartels operating large illegal operations on public forestland .
Indeed , the Trinity County Sheriff ’s Department -- with a total of 15 officers -- devotes most of its drug enforcement efforts to fighting those organized gangs .
Partnering with the U.S. Forest Service , they ’ve closed 45 illegal sites in the county since June .
They ’ve arrested dozens of laborers and collected nearly 400,000 illegal plants this year , up from 250,000 last year .
Weapons have been found at nearly every site they ’ve raided .
Last summer alone in the Shasta - Trinity National Forest , the government spent nearly $ 1 million removing 29,085 pounds of debris -- including 14 illegal dams that had been built to siphon water to the farms , 1,004 pounds of fertilizer and 159,240 feet of irrigation pipe -- from abandoned marijuana farms .
Officials see a link between these cartel operations and 215 gardens : Americans ’ insatiable demand for drugs .

“ I just wish recreational pot smokers could understand what they are supporting , ” said Joshua Smith , natural resources project manager at the nonprofit Watershed Research & Training Center in Trinity County .
“ They ’re supporting clear - cutting the forest , pesticides , de-watering the streams , poaching wildlife , Mexican drug cartels and human trafficking . ”
Money talks
A lack of job opportunities is also driving the trade here .
Logging , once a major employer , has all but disappeared .
Trinity County ’s unemployment rate of 15.9 % in September was one of the highest in the state .
Its median household income of $ 35,439 is the third - lowest in the state .
Some say that the marijuana industry , for better or for worse , brings some economic benefits .
Farmers buy water tanks and other equipment at local stores ; laborers eat at area restaurants .
A scruffy young man named Jaya traveled from New York to pick up work in the recent harvest .
Eating ice cream at the Family Dairy Store in Hayfork recently , he communicated by scribbling on a notepad because , he wrote , he had given up speech “ in loving silence . ”

Locals might not cotton to these outsiders .
But at least their money spends .
“ The only thing that keeps this economy going is the growers , ” said Dennis Cooney , owner of the Northern Delights coffee shop in downtown Hayfork .
But retiree Stewart , who owns several rental properties , is sick of the changes .
She ’s tired of battling tenants who try to grow marijuana on her land .
She ’s weary of hearing gunshots and seeing rough - looking strangers loitering around town .
She fears growers will only be emboldened by U.S. Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr.'s recent statement that the federal government will halt raids on legal dispensaries .
“ It gives them the license to really be in your face , ” Stewart said .
“ I ’d leave in a heartbeat if I could . ”

Raw Deal is one of the most exposing and controversial documentaries about rape and fraternity life today .
Billy Corben ’s remarkable exposé on the contested rape of 27 - year - old Lisa Gier King in Gainesville , Florida , is sure to provoke heated discussions everywhere about rape , women ’s rights , and male privilege .
On Friday , February 26 , 1999 , Delta Chi frat brothers at the University of Florida held a party at their fraternity house and hired exotic dancer Lisa Gier King to perform .
The following morning , a half - naked and distraught King ran from the house , claiming that Michael Yarhaus had raped her .
Her most startling allegation was that frat brother Tony Marzullo had videotaped the crime .
Two days later , King herself was arrested for filing a false police report after authorities claimed the rape showed “ clearly willing and consensual sex . ”
The community was stunned by King ’s arrest after it was discovered that the videotape showed Marzullo himself repeatedly addressing the camera to gleefully describe that what he was witnessing was a rape .
Under pressure from the media and Campus NOW to charge the frat brothers with rape , State Attorney Rod Smith arrogantly responded by making the tape available to the public so people could “ make up their own minds . ”
Filmmaker Billy Corben takes Smith ’s challenge and presents the scandalizing , sexually explicit footage alongside interviews of participants involved with the case to conduct an investigation the police never did .
The result is a shocking insight on fraternity life and the politically constructed nature of “ the truth . ”

“ I think it is very unlikely that you would see this kind of tax on bonuses here in the U.S. , ” Douglas J. Elliott at the Brookings Institution in Washington said .
But , he added , “ There are going to be big bonuses this season .
There will be high levels of public anger .
Therefore there will be some bills introduced .
I just do n’t think they are going to make it through . ”
In a speech to Parliament on Wednesday , Alistair Darling , the chancellor of the Exchequer , effectively conceded that the tax on bank bonuses was mostly a political symbol :
The levy , he said , would raise only £ 550 million  an amount that would hardly make up for a yawning budget deficit , let alone the roughly £ 1 trillion the government has extended to shore up Lloyds Banking Group , Royal Bank of Scotland and other British banks that stumbled in the crisis .
A more severe version of the British tax was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in March , after an uproar over $ 165 million in bonuses paid to A.I.G. employees after the company received a huge government bailout .
But the proposal , which called for a 90 percent retroactive tax on awards of $ 250,000 and above , was seen as too punitive and never made it to the Senate floor .
Since then , President Obama and federal policy makers have taken a more measured approach to taxing banker bonuses , after considering the effect on the government ’s wider efforts to nurse the banking industry back to health and to maintain a flow of credit to consumers and small businesses .
An official briefed on the administration ’s reviews of Wall Street compensation said the government made a similar effort 20 years ago to tax bonuses  without success .
“ They simply got around the law by giving all sorts of perks and deferred compensation , ” the official said .
“ It became unworkable and had unintended consequences . ”
For much of the past two weeks , the Bay Area 's attention was focused on a previously obscure piece of structural steel on the east span of the Bay Bridge known as an eyebar .
The cracked eyebar forced the extension of a scheduled construction closure of the bridge over Labor Day weekend for emergency repairs .
Then , when that repair failed on Oct. 27 , flinging tons of steel onto the bridge during the evening commute , the bridge was barricaded for another 51/2 days while the repairs were fixed .
And in the months to come , Caltrans officials have warned , another closure to install a more permanent repair is likely .
Despite all the attention it has received , and all the complaining it has caused , the eyebar is n't the biggest danger on the eastern span of the Bay Bridge .
And it's not the reason the span is being replaced - at a cost of $ 6.3 billion - instead of retrofitted .
Like any old structure , the eastern span has many flaws , and because of its design , is considered more prone than other bridges to collapse during an earthquake .
The flaws considered most serious by engineers and geologists include the span 's foundations , its network of steel supports , and the supports for the road deck , which were what failed in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake .
Seismic experts consider the eastern span a likely candidate to collapse in another major temblor .
Caltrans issued a 1996 report that concluded the bridge could not withstand a 6.5 magnitude earthquake , and that it would be cheaper - and safer - to replace the eastern span .
But repeated delays slowed construction .
The projected opening date is now 2013 .
' Competing against time '
" I wish it would be done sooner , " said Ahmad Itani , a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Nevada , Reno , who has studied the span and reviewed the eyebar repairs .
" We are competing against time . "
Built in just three years , the Bay Bridge was considered an engineering wonder when it opened in 1936 , with the western section being built as a suspension bridge and the eastern section as a cantilever span .
But construction techniques and materials have changed , and much more is known about earthquakes and their effects on bridges .
" The foundations are the biggest part of problem , " said Bart Ney , a Caltrans spokesman .
The existing eastern span is anchored in bay mud using a series of pilings that are actually treated Douglas fir trees - the biggest that could be found .
Most are 70 to 80 feet long ; the longest , Ney said , reaches 120 feet into the muck .
In contrast , pilings for the new eastern span are 8 - foot - diameter steel pipes , pounded at an angle about 360 feet deep into more stable soil formations .
Strong shaking
With little support from the foundations , the bridge would be subjected to strong shaking and movement during an earthquake , similar to what caused a 50 - foot section - where the incline meets the cantilever section - to fall in the Loma Prieta quake after connecting bolts broke and the slab was pulled from its support .
The section that fell during the earthquake was not the only one damaged in the 1989 quake .
At least one other section was near collapse , and five other connections snapped .
Caltrans strengthened those areas during retrofitting work on the eastern span in the late 1990s " so the bridge could move more , " said Andrew Fremier , deputy executive director of the Bay Area Toll Authority and a former Caltrans engineer .
" But not enough for a major seismic event . "
Engineers also say the eastern span 's multitude of steel - to - steel connections - including the 1,860 eyebars , the narrow steel latticework supports and other steel members - that make up the cantilever structure are outdated and aging .
Some engineers , including Itani , believe the structure is nearing the end of its life expectancy .
" With steel , if you want to break something , you bend it back and forth , " he said .
" This bridge has been back and forth by loads for more than 70 years .
The steel has reached its limit . "
A case for retrofitting
However , at least one Bay Area engineer believes the span could still withstand a major earthquake and should be retrofitted .
Abolhassan Astaneh - Asl , a UC Berkeley civil engineering professor and a frequent critic of Caltrans , says the eastern span would be more resistant to earthquakes and terrorist attacks than the single - tower suspension span under construction .
Astaneh - Asl also criticized Caltrans for failing to properly maintain the existing span since it began construction of the new bridge in 2002 , and said negligence may have contributed to the crack in the eyebar .
Bay Area transportation officials disagree , insisting they have continued to maintain the bridge as a vital transportation structure and will continue to do so as long as it remains open to traffic .
" The bridge is maintained well , and we are paying attention to it , " Fremier said .
" While the ( eyebar trouble ) is a sign the bridge has started to show its age , it is in good shape .
It has to be .
But it is seismically vulnerable . "
Insurance industry studies contend that premiums would go up because various fees imposed on health insurers and health care providers to pay for covering the uninsured would inevitably get passed on to consumers .
We believe premiums would come down for several reasons .
Companies would no longer need to spend as much money on administrative costs , to screen out people with pre-existing conditions ( prohibited by all reform bills ) .
If they wanted to participate on the exchanges ( and have access to millions of new customers ) , the companies would also be forced to compete with other private plans , and possibly a public option , encouraging them to lower premiums and accept lower profits .
A hint of what might happen can be seen in an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office .
Under a version of the Senate Finance Committee bill , the average single person would pay a $ 5,000 premium for a “ silver plan ” sold on the exchanges in 2016 but would pay $ 6,000 for a plan with less generous coverage if the reform failed .
WILL THERE BE HELP ?
Right now , only the poorest Americans get help , through the state - federal Medicaid program .
The bills in both houses would expand eligibility for Medicaid to cover millions more people , and lower the contributions of the poorest Americans .
For those buying policies on the exchanges , perhaps 30 million people in all , the bills would provide tax - credit subsidies to help low - and middle - income people pay the premiums .
People would have to pay specified percentages of their income toward the premium , ranging in the House bill from 1.5 percent for those barely above Medicaid level to 12 percent for those earning four times the poverty level , or $ 88,000 for a family of four .
That sounds like a substantial hit at the upper end  $ 10,560 for a family of four before subsidies kick in .
But it is comparable to what many workers are currently willing to pay for their group policies .
And just in case the premiums might still look unaffordable to large numbers of people , the Senate Finance Committee ’s version has proposed an escape hatch .
No one would be required to spend more than 8 percent of their income on health insurance .
They would not be insured , but they would not be fined .
The giant chip maker Intel , facing antitrust challenges around the world , announced on Thursday that it would pay $ 1.25 billion to settle its long - running disputes with its smaller rival , Advanced Micro Devices .
The settlement , covering both antitrust and patent claims , ends the computer industry ’s most bitter legal war .
But the truce may not be enough to turn around the fortunes of A.M.D , which has struggled to come up with chips that give it any significant technological or performance edge over Intel , which supplies about 80 percent of the microprocessors that sit at the heart of personal computers .
At least in the short term , the settlement also does not end Intel ’s antitrust problems .
Governments in Europe , the United States and Asia have accused the company of systematically using large rebates and co-marketing arrangements to persuade computer makers to use its chips instead of those made by A.M.D .
Door - To - Door Atheists Seen As Neighborhood Nuisance
RANCHO PEÑASQUITOS — Last Thursday James and Mary Winfield were enjoying a quiet evening in their suburban home in Rancho Peñasquitos , moments away from having dinner with their two children .
Just as the Winfields began to say grace before eating a honey - baked ham , the sound of their doorbell disrupted James ’s prayer mid-Jesus .
“ I opened the door and standing on my porch were two young men dressed in black shirts and white ties .
I just assumed they were either Mormons or Jehovah ’s Witnesses , ” said James .
James would soon realize that his assumption could n’t have been further from the truth .
“ After they introduced themselves , one of them asked me if I found Jesus .
When I said yes , he told me to lose him , ” said James .
“ They were so aggressive and pushy , ” he added .
The two men standing on the Winfield ’s doorstep happen to be members of an extreme sect of Atheism known as Condescendism .
Condescendists mainly focus on making people feel insecure about their religious beliefs , with the hope of converting them into non-believers .
When Condescendists reach the age of 23 , they ’re required to go on a rite of passage where they travel to different neighborhoods on bicycles , knock on doors , and distribute their official magazine : The Atheist Monthly Void .
The Atheist Monthly Void is n’t your typical magazine .
For example , there are no subscription renewal cards stuffed inside the magazine because , as the editor explains , “ Renewal is n’t possible , once your subscription ends , it ’s over … there ’s nothing afterwards . ”
From a statistical standpoint , approximately one out of four San Diegans between the ages of 18 - 29 are n’t affiliated with any particular religion , and some worry that this trend will grow out of control and spin off more extreme forms of Atheism , which might lead to members exhibiting violent tendencies .
There have already been several threats by Atheists to destroy San Diego ’s two most popular religious monuments :
The Mount Soledad Cross and UCSD ’s Sun God statue .
Security agents have already been deployed in front of both statues .
When asked how he felt about the growing number of Condescendists in his neighborhood , James explained , “ It ’s just a shame that whenever a belief or non-belief system grows in popularity , there ’s always a small sector that manages to ruin it for everyone , ” said Winfield .

IMMUNE SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT CAN STOP INFLUENZA
By Dr. James Howenstine , MD .

T cells belong to a group of white blood cells known as lymphocytes .
These cells play the major role in cell - mediated immunity .
These are the cells responsible for the body ’s natural defense against viral cells and cancer cells .
The T in T cell stands for the thymus gland .
The thymus gland is the primary organ responsible for T cell 's maturation .
There are several different subsets of T cells that have been discovered .
Each subset of T - cells has a distinct function .
The T - cells are the cells the body produces to kill viruses and cancer cells .
They include subsets CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD19 ( natural killer cells ) CD56 ( natural killer cells ) and many others .
Without these cells functioning to their fullest extent , viral infections are able to become progressively worse and can even result in death .
For over twelve years the product LifeOne has been available as an over the counter immune enhancement supplement .
It is entirely natural , made from extensively researched naturally occurring phytochemicals , ( naturally occurring plant extracts ) .
During those twelve years , with many thousands of people using it , there have been three cases in which it has caused an upset stomach .
There has not been a single instance in which it has caused harm .
It has undergone a great deal of independent testing of its ability to enhance the immune system and hasten recovery from both viruses and cancer in the United States as well as Mexico , Venezuela , India , and Costa Rica .
Knowledgeable physicians world wide are now using Lifeone .
All clinical testing has shown the product to be effective and without side effects .
The Lifeone formulation has favorable metabolic effects including bringing blood sugars toward normal , decreasing cholesterol and triglyceride levels , lowering blood pressure and bringing about slight weight loss in the first month of use .
Of greatest importance there are significant improvements in immune function .
Why is this so relevant now ?
Because avian flu , swine flu and influenza A have combined and this event has caused fear of a quickly approaching worldwide epidemic .
You need information about how to become prepared to insure your family ’s health and safety to the greatest extent possible .
Over a 12 year period using Lifeone the developer of this product noticed that nearly every strain of influenza promptly improved with eradication of symptoms in 1 to 4 days .
Patients began to improve quickly which probably reflects killing of viruses and immediate improvement in T lymphocyte function .
[ NWV Poll :
Is this swine flu outbreak accidental or deliberate ? ]
AIDS patients are the most immune compromised patients on which LifeOne has been tested .
In all these patients significant enhancement of immune response has been documented .
In the first four AIDS virus patients treated by Dr. Carlos Alessandrini M.D. , the lymphocyte increases were very rapid and dramatic .
Average lymphocyte counts increased 550 cells / ml .
Average CD3 cell increases were 564 cell / ml .
Average CD4 cells increased 238.5 cell / ml .
Absolute CD8 cells increased an average 178.5 cells / ml , and viral load decreased an average of 70 % .
This occurred in an average of only 28 days of Lifeone therapy ..
Though this was a small pilot study , the results were far better than anyone could have expected .
It far exceeded the results using other HIV treatments .
Dr. Paul La Rochelle , M.D. ordered complete lymphocyte subset panels on patients suffering from hepatic cancer , lung cancer , prostate cancer , Non Hodgkins lymphoma , several colon cancers , bladder cancer , many breast cancers , renal cell carcinoma and ovarian cancers to determine Lifeone effects on the immune system as well .
as malignancies .
Aside from the fact that all of his patients survived , the immune responses of his patients were equally remarkable .
On average , the absolute lymphocyte count increased 306 cells / ml .
The T - cell CD3 count increased an average of 197 cells / ml .
The average CD4 count increased 149 cells / ml .
The average CD8 count increased 66 cells / ml .
The average CD19 count increased 41 cells / ml and the average CD56 cells increased 51 cells / ml .
These increases in severely immune compromised cancer patients took place in an average of less than 30 days in almost all cases .

It is this immune response that increases the chances of survival from viral infections and cancer .
Drugs have not shown anywhere near this effectiveness at increasing the body ’s T - cell mediated immune response .
In an article titled “ Flu drugs will not work if pandemic strikes ” by Sarah Bosely and Jonathan Watts , the probable response to currently used drug treatments was very well stated .
“ No evidence Tamiflu will be effective say experts Relying on medicines alone would be suicidal ”
Dr Jefferson and colleagues from the Cochrane Vaccines Field looked at all the evidence from trials of the efficacy of all four flu drugs - not just Tamiflu and Relenza - but also two older drugs from a different class , amantadine and rimantadine .
The latter two are problematic because their use has rapidly led to the emergence of resistant flu strains and they cause unpleasant side - effects , such as hallucinations .
The study , part - funded by the Department of Health , recommends that none of the four should be used for the treatment of ordinary winter flu .
Amantadine and rimantadine should not be used because they do not work and cause unpleasant side - effects .
Tamiflu and Relenza reduce the severity of real influenza , but do not work on what are known as " influenza - like illnesses " - viral infections with similar symptoms which cannot be distinguished by the GP from real flu without tests .
By the time tests are done , Relenza and Tamiflu are of no use , because they must be given within 48 hours of the onset of flu . ”
LifeOne has no such limitations for the following reasons : not only does it kill an extremely wide range of viruses , but it also increases one ’s own ability to kill viruses by increasing the bodies own T - cell count and function very quickly .
These are the cells that the healthy body produces to kill viral infections .
Do what you can to protect yourself and your loved ones .
Have a few bottles of LifeOne on hand .
It could very well prove to be the very best insurance you can have .
Over the last ten years , physicians and patients have more and more frequently turned to LifeOne supplementation to use against both colds and flu .
They have had extraordinary results .
As an example , the following case is a common response :
" My mother was ill with the flu for a month .
I sent her a bottle of LifeOne , and she began taking it as directed .
In two days , her flu was gone .
Coincidence ?
I do n't think so . "
Lee N. Sheldon , DMD
The developer states ” I do not believe LifeOne to be a panacea .
It has been only sporadically successful in the treatment of herpes viral infections .
Herpes results have varied from complete eradication of all symptoms to little effect .
However its success against flu viruses and common colds has been very consistent .
There have been very few cases of flu that have not responded both quickly and safely to LifeOne . ”
The dosage of Lifeone for viral illnesses should be one ounce three times daily taken after meals .
This can be discontinued when symptoms are gone .

Pharmaceutical industry is a giant fraud
Why celebrities need really good nutrition
( Natural News )
It 's not normal to die at age 32 of a heart attack .
To make that happen , you normally have to be taking chemical substances of some kind , either recreational drugs or prescription drugs .
Actress Brittany Murphy , who died this last weekend from a heart attack , was reportedly taking prescription drugs to treat the symptoms of the flu ( not to actually treat the flu itself , mind you , justof the flu ) .
She was found collapsed in her shower after her heart gave out .
If prescription drugs are the cause , this would be just the latest celebrity death caused by pharmaceuticals .
Other celebrity deaths recently caused by pharmaceuticals include : • Heath Ledger• Patrick Swayze• Bernie Mac• Michael Jackson• Farrah FawcettAnd from the realm of politics and the media , the following celebrities have also been killed by pharmaceuticals : • Tony Snow• Tim Russert• Peter Jennings
If you add it all up and include all the non-celebrities killed by Big Pharma , these dangerous prescription medications are racking up a body count that makes terrorists look like amateurs .
The pharmaceutical industry , as operated today , is based almost entirely on scientific fraud , bribery of doctors , misleading advertising and corrupt regulatory agencies like the FDA ..
They only mask symptoms while ignoring the underlying causes of disease .
Nearly all pharmaceuticals are sold with ... the implied ( but false ) promise that " These drugs will make you healthier . "
That 's why drug ads always show happy , healthy people popping their pills .
( Well , technically they never even show them popping the pills .
They just show them doing yoga , hiking in the woods , or whatever looks good . ) I can't think of a single pharmaceutical that actually makes you healthier .
Almost universally , prescription medications cause long - term damage to the heart , liver , kidneys and nervous system .
Over time , theyyour health , accelerate your apparent aging and promote chronic degenerative disease .
can make you healthier and prevent disease , buthave no such abilities .
That 's because the human body was never designed to digest patented chemicals .
It was , as you probably learned in high school health class , designed solely to digest natural foods and nutrients provided by Mother Nature .
Of course , pharmaceuticals are very seductive .
The idea that you can pop a pill and have all your health problems corrected is very appealing to many people .
This is perhaps what got into Brittany Murphy .
She mistakenly believed FDA - approved drugs would protect her health when , in reality , they took her life .
NaturalNews mourns her death and hopes that others will learn the truth about dangerous prescription drugs and seek out safer , more natural alternatives that can save their lives .
Being a celebrity is extremely stressful and demanding .
The long work hours , lack of time in nature , sunlight deficiency , frequent travel and poor sleep quality all add up to a lifestyle that can devastate your health .
That 's why celebrities , more than almost anyone , need to pursue a super clean diet with lots of superfoods .
Only through very powerful , potent foods can celebrities hope to maintain anything close to a healthy life while under the stresses of celebrity existence .
( And make no mistake , being a celebrity is harder than you think .
The stresses are unbelievable ... )
The smart celebrities are already on natural diets -- Woody Harrelson , Suzanne Somers , Daryl Hannah and so on .
They will tend to far out - live others who pursue extremely stressful lifestyles while trying to survive on a diet of processed foods and FDA - approved pharmaceuticals .
There is no doubt in my mind that .
If she had been taking vitamin D supplements , immune - boosting herbs and following a diet of healthy superfoods , she would very likely still be alive today .
That 's just my opinion , of course , as I do n't yet know all the medical details about her death , but for someone to die of a heart attack at age 32 , their health has to be severely compromised in one or more significant ways .
The sad part is that the conventional medical industry never tells people the truth about nutrition and disease prevention , so even people who consider themselves to be " well informed " are lacking basic knowledge about vitamin D , minerals , phytonutrients , living foods , superfoods and so on .
To my knowledge , Brittany was not known as a health food person , so she most likely followed conventional health information ( junk food , drugs and surgery ) .
And that 's almost certainly what killed her .

Electrolyte imbalance stops amphibians ' hearts .
Frogs are suffering from a fatal fungal infection .
Vance T. Vredenburg / SFSU
A fungal infection that is killing amphibians around the world acts by disrupting the flow of electrolytes across their skin , ultimately causing heart failure .
The discovery is helping to raise hopes that a treatment for the infection could one day be given to amphibians in the wild .
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , a kind of chytrid fungus that causes the skin disease chytridiomycosis in amphibians , was likely spread around the world by the South African clawed frog ( Xenopus laevis ) in the 1930s and 1940s , when the frog was widely used as a pregnancy test .
A pregnant woman 's urine , injected under the frog 's skin , would contain sufficient hormones to make the animal ovulate .
But although the South African clawed frog seems to have immunity to the disease , many other amphibians are not so lucky .
According to one study led by chytrid expert Karen Lips of the University of Maryland in College Park , chytridiomycosis can kill 80 % of amphibians in one year in an area with cool , moist conditions .
1
Until now , no one was sure exactly how the fungus killed its victim ; some researchers thought that it might secrete a poison .
Jamie Voyles , a disease ecologist at James Cook University in Townsville , Queensland , Australia , and colleagues exposed Australian green tree frogs ( Litoria caerulea ) to the fungus , and have now worked out its deadly mode of attack .
Voyles and colleagues monitored the progression of the infection , took blood and urine samples and measured electrolyte flow across skin samples .
They found that levels of two ions — potassium and sodium — were greatly reduced in infected frogs , and that the ability to move these ions back and forth across the animals ' skin had been greatly impaired .
" Frog skin is really unique because it is permeable to water but it must maintain proper concentrations of these [ electrolyte ] ions , " says Voyles .
In infected frogs , " the electrolyte balance is all out of whack " .
The low potassium levels , in particular , were probably responsible for a breakdown of the electrical regulation of the heart , and the frogs ultimately died because their hearts stopped .
The work is reported in Science2 .
Rich solution
The team found that an electrolyte - rich solution , similar to sports drinks but more concentrated , delayed death in infected frogs .
But it could n't cure them .
" Because the skin is damaged , we can't really keep them from dying unless we fix the problem in the skin , " says Voyles .
Although captive frogs can be bathed in an antifungal medicine to rid them of their infection , there is no easy way to treat the hundreds of species of wild amphibians at risk of being wiped out by the fungus .
Voyles 's work is just one piece of research that might someday lead to a treatment that could be deployed in the wild .
Geneticist Erica Rosenblum of the University of Idaho in Moscow is looking at gene expression in both the fungus and the host to determine what makes the fungus so lethal — and why amphibian immune systems do n't seem to be aware of the infection .
3 " Jamie has found that their osmotic regulation is all screwed up , they are essentially having heart attacks , " she says .
" Mine is an earlier question : why do n't they have an immune response ? "
One possible treatment is being pursued by Reid Harris , a microbial ecologist at James Madison University in Harrisonburg , Virginia .
He has found that at least some species of amphibians have beneficial bacteria on their skin that produce a protective antifungal agent .
4
He is looking into the possibility of adding more of these bacteria to the soil in ecosystems where vulnerable amphibians live , to boost their natural defences .
" People are already doing this in their gardens and larger - scale agricultural applications as well , " he says .

Harris would first like to try the technique on populations of frogs in captivity — so - called survival assurance colonies held in zoos and other institutions awaiting the day when they can be safely returned to the wild .
Despite all these advances , Lips says that she has seen too many frog populations destroyed by the fungus to retain her optimism about saving what is left .
" I do n't know that there is enough money going to the right labs quickly enough to make a difference , " she says .
" More governments and NGOs need to step up .
I mean , we are losing half the amphibians on the planet .
And throwing amphibians into zoos is a short - term solution .
It does n't solve any problems . "
WASHINGTON 
The federal government must continue to provide grant money to the national community organizing group Acorn , a federal court ruled Friday , saying that the House violated the Constitution when it passed a resolution barring the group from receiving federal dollars .
A judge at the United States District Court in Brooklyn issued a preliminary injunction that nullifies the resolution and requires the government to honor existing contracts with the group and review its applications for new grants unless the Obama administration appeals the decision .
The court ruled that the resolution amounted to a “ bill of attainder , ” a legislative determination of guilt without trial , because it specifically punishes one group .
That provision plays a crucial , but rarely necessary , role in maintaining the balance of powers , said Eric M. Freedman , a professor of constitutional law at Hofstra Law School .
“ It says that the Congress may not act as judge , jury and executioner .
That is precisely what the Congress sought to do in this case , and the district court was entirely right to enjoin it . ”

The Naked Coral Tree – Erythrina coralloides
Erythrina coralloides also known as the Flame Coral Tree is a species of flowering tree in the pea family or Fabaceae , ranges from the American state of Arizona to the Oaxaca in Mexico .
The plant with its hard , red pointed ‘ petals ’ looks like misplaced coral growing up in the middle of sparse vegetation or desert .

Looking like something out of a science fiction movie the Darcunculus vulgaris is also known as Dragon Arum , Snake Lily or the Voodoo Lily .
Native to the Balkans the planet is also found in Greece and south west to parts of Anatolia .
Recently introduced to America it can be found in Oregon , California and Tennessee .
This species has a large purple hooded spathe and spadix .
The smell is very unpleasant at least to humans .
Flies pollinate this plant as it traps them with its nightly inflorescence glow and in the morning the insects fly away loaded with pollen .

Rafflesia
These planets look , they were designed in the 1960 ’s by someone taking a psychedelic drug .
Rafflesia is a parasitic flowering planet discovered by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles guide in 1818 during an expedition through the Indonesia rain forest .
The only part of the plant visible other than the vine is the flower .
The flower has five large rounded petals and can grow up to over 100 centimeters .
Rafflesias smell like rotten flesh a tactic intended to attract insects such as flies or carrion beetles for the purpose of pollination .

Strange fruit – Barringtonia asiatica
Barringtonia asiatica also known as Sea Poison Tree is native to the Indian Ocean .
The spiky fringe of petals resembles something you might find sitting next to a lava lamp .
The middle size tree the petals sprout from produce a fruit that is almost box shaped .

If you are turned off of plants because they are n’t furry and cuddly you ’d find half the package in the Stapelia grandiflora a native of Southern Africa .
Also called Carrion Flower and Giant Zulu this plant has a soft fluffy look that belies its true business of catching the interest of insects to pollinate them .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - California on Tuesday released draft rules for its landmark greenhouse gas cap - and - trade plan that will be the most ambitious U.S. effort to use the market to address global warming .
State law requires California to cut its carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 .
Measures will range from clean vehicle and building rules to the cap - and - trade system that lets factories and power companies trade credits to emit gases that heat up the earth .
Federal rules under debate by Congress could eclipse and preempt regional plans , but California and other local governments see themselves as the vanguard of addressing climate change , especially in light of slow national action and setbacks for international talks scheduled in Copenhagen next month .
The draft released on Tuesday shows California , seen as an environmental trend - setter , may take on even more than expected in its first round of cap - and - trade , which will start in 2012 .
Gasoline and residential heating fuel suppliers could be included in the first cap - and - trade phase , which had been expected to focus on big pollution sources like power plants and refineries .
“ California is the first out of the box , ” state Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols told reporters on a conference call .
The draft rules kick off a comment period that will lead to final regulation next fall .
A less comprehensive northeastern U.S. regional trading system is already under way , focusing on carbon dioxide emissions by big emitters .
California by contrast plans to include nearly every source of emissions to reach its goal .
California businesses regularly criticize the plan as going too far too fast -- and costing too much .
Whether the net effect of the plan will be a new green economy or disaster for overburdened businesses is still hotly debated .
OUTSIZE ATTENTION
New estimates of plan costs , including suggestions on how much support to give industry , wo n’t be available until an independent advisory group issues a report next year .
The draft avoids what may be the toughest issue -- how much to rely on auctions of credits , which would require power companies and the like to buy permission to pollute .
The emitters want allowances given to them , especially early on .
But Nichols said California had shown a strong preference for moving to auction as quickly as possible and that its 2006 global warming law provided clear guidance while politicians in the U.S. Congress were still raising support for a bill .
“ Congress started this , you know , as a political exercise to see how many allowances you had to give out to which groups to get them to buy into the program .
They did n’t have a climate bill , ” she said .
“ We know how many emissions we have to reduce .
The question is how do we do it in a way that costs less , ” added Nichols , whose Air Resources Board was appointed by state law as the main regulator deciding on how to cut greenhouse gases .
The cost of a ton of carbon dioxide initially could be around $ 10 , based on how other programs operated , she said .
That is about half the current European price .
The average American has carbon production of about 20 tons per year , according to the Union of Concerned Scientists .
The cap - and - trade system will account for only about a fifth of California reductions but it draws outsize attention , in part because the state , with the largest U.S. economy and population , is part of the 11 member Western Climate Initiative , which includes U.S. states and Canadian provinces .
China , too , will watch California ’s action , partly by virtue of the state ’s partnerships with Chinese provinces , said Environmental Defense Fund California Climate Change Director Derek Walker .
“ In many ways this is similar to what you are hearing from international circles now .
Everybody is coming to the table with their opening bets , ” he said .
But unlike most , California has committed to cuts and now is working out the details .
The Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer has said it will continue its association with Tiger Woods despite the golfer 's highly public personal problems .
" We will continue , " the company spokeswoman , Mariam Sylla , told the Associated Press .
" He 's the best in his domain .
We respect his performance in the sport . "
She added that Woods 's personal life is " not our business " .
Tag Heuer has been sponsoring Woods , who last week announced that he is taking an indefinite leave from golf , since 2002 .
Financial details of the agreement have not been announced .
Tag Heuer 's comment came a day after the global consulting firm Accenture became the first major sponsor to announce it was cutting ties with Woods .
Gillette , another major sponsor , has announced that it is to phase the golfer out of its promotional material , at least temporarily .
" Tiger is still part of Gillette , " the company 's spokesman , Mike Norton , said .
" We support him as he takes a break from his professional career and that 's why we 're supporting him by limiting his role in our marketing programmes . "
Nike and the computer game company Electronic Arts both continue to support Woods .
A veteran journalist - blogger is being sued for libel by a politician who is known for espousing press freedom in Malaysia .
Zaid Ibrahim , former Minister in the Prime Minister 's Department , was offended by a blog article written by A Kadir Jasin last October .
Aside from suing the blogger , Zaid wants the writer to apologize .
What is peculiar in this case is that Zaid is known for supporting Malaysian bloggers who have been sued by powerful individuals and corporations .
Zaid himself is also a blogger .
In fact , he made a rebuttal to the “ offensive ” article written by Jasin in his own blog .
Rocky 's
Bru is surprised that Zaid is now part of an elite group of individuals who are suing bloggers
I can't explain how Zaid Ibrahim , whom I once described as “ maverick ” , has gone down this way .
Now Zaid has joined the queue of influential and wealthy individuals who are suing bloggers .
With his latest action , I no longer want to describe Zaid as a “ maverick ” .
A maverick is unique , someone who dares go against the flow , a person you respect – even grudgingly – for his principles .
Mat Cendana is worried that the case may lead to more defamation suits in Malaysia
In my opinion , this post , while certainly not flattering to Zaid , is n’t of “ saman class ” – heck , if this is ruled as defamation , then we ’ll see at least 10 such cases being filed at the courts daily !
Jebat is questioning the basis for filing the suit :
What is so wrong about the article which made him issue a writ of summon to Kadir Jasin ?
Is there any element of defamation in it ?
Did n’t Zaid write a few allegatory statements concerning Kadir Jasin in his own rebuttal as well ?
So , what is the contentious issue ?
All of Pakatan Rakyat supporters are supporting Zaid Ibrahim anyway .
Who cares if one negative article was published in blogosphere ?
You mean to say , people cannot write whatever they want ?
Since when ?
When he and all the opposition bloggers write tremendous amount of unfair accusations and uncouth articles defaming everyone else , it is fine .
But when one is confronted with a ghost from the past , he became rattled and could n’t sleep peacefully .
The irony is , he would like to be seen as liberal and the fighter of press freedom and freedom of speech .
Nevertheless , it is his right to sue people as much as it was Kadir Jasin ’s right to write that article .
Unlike some people who ran away like a coward , I am sure Kadir Jasin will commence all the necessary legal actions to defend his article based on any evidence that he can produce .
At bigdogdotcom , the writer is disappointed that Zaid is using the case to gain political and media mileage
VARANASI : Call it birth defect or wish of the Almighty , a goat with six legs , four testicles and three penis will be spared from holy sacrifice on the occasion of Id - ul - Juha ( Bakrid ) this year .
While the black - coloured goat , barely one - year - old and weighing around 10 kg , is all set to attract attention during the goat exhibition prior to the festival , the owner of the goat has ruled out any chances of sacrifice of the unique goat on the auspicious day .
" This goat is a gift of God and the sacrifice of such a goat is not allowed in Islam , " said Sher Mohammed , the owner of the goat , while talking to TOI on Sunday .
" The goat can be displayed during Bakrid exhibition , but sacrifice of the goat is strictly prohibited , " he added .
Saying the goat was born with six legs , four testicles and three penis a year ago , the owner adds it can walk freely and normally like other goats .
" It faces problems in defecating and urinating , as discharge of urine is witnessed after frequent intervals from different penis .
But still , it is a special goat that attracts attention of people , " he added .
His neighbour Sarfaraz maintained that such a goat was rare in the city and had not been witnessed till date in any parts of the region .
" I have seen goats with the name of Allah or the holy number 786 on their bodies , but a goat with six legs is definitely unique and special , " he said .
According to district veterinary officer Dr BB Singh , such abnormalities are rare but can occur in animals during the development of their body parts .
" Genetic changes or mutations can also cause such birth defects , " he informed .

The Edge of Evolution : The Search for the Limits of Darwinism by Michael Behe
Darwin's Black Box author Michael Behe takes on the limits of evolution through an examination of specific genetic examples .
Behe finds that mutation and natural selection is capable of generating trivial examples of evolutionary change .
Although he concludes that descent with modification has occurred throughout biological history , the molecular devices found throughout nature cannot be accounted for through natural selection and mutation .
Behe 's book claims to develop a framework for testing intelligent design by defining the principles by which Darwinian evolution can be distinguished from design .

In this book , biologist Jonathan Wells examines recent college and high school textbooks ( from 1998 - 2000 ) , and shows how they distort the truth about biology , often presenting information that has been falsified by recent scientific studies .

In this remarkable book , Alister McGrath challenges Dawkins on the very ground he holds most sacred -- rational argument -- and McGrath disarms the master .
It becomes readily apparent that Dawkins has aimed his attack at a naive version of faith that most serious believers would not recognize .
After reading this carefully constructed and eloquently written book , Dawkins ’ choice of atheism emerges as the most irrational of the available choices about God 's existence . "

About Tiny Core Linux
Tiny Core Linux aims to be an extremely lightweight core desktop upon which users can install their choice of applications .
It can operate in four modes : Cloud / Internet – the default boot mode where the system boots entirely in the RAM , PPR / TCE mode – the user has to specify a persistent storage partition and can use the TCE repository , PPR / TCZ mode – the same as PPR / TCE , except it uses the TCZ extension type , and the PPI / TCE mode – installs extensions on a Linux partition or a loop back file .

It is fitting that we end the current decade just like we started it , with the bursting of bubbles .
In the early part of the decade we were dealing with the fallout of the technology bust .
That was quickly replaced by the even bigger housing bubble and that has now popped as well .
The trillions lost by average Americans is incredible but in reality nothing was technically lost because the entire decade was one enormous Ponzi scheme and like all Ponzi schemes the wealth created is false .
Bernard Madoff was simply the mascot of a decade built on phony money spewed out by the corporatocracy of Wall Street .
What is even more troubling is how the actions taken by Wall Street are not being prosecuted in the same fashion as our justice system took on Bernard Madoff .
The reason for that is the corporatocracy has legalized national bank robbery .
If you had $ 10,000 and put it in the S&P 500 at the start of the decade you would have performed worse than a person who merely stuffed the money into a mattress .
The person who put their money into the NASDAQ at the start of decade is even in worse shape .
We have experienced a lost decade .
With employment , we now have the same number of people working as we did back in 2000 .
Only difference is in 2000 we had 280 million people and today we have 308 million people living in our country .
Take a look at the S&P 500 :
Even after the raging rally since the March corporatocracy bailouts , the S&P 500 is still down nearly 25 percent from its January 2000 point .
One of the broadest measures of our economy and we are still down 25 percent after a decade .
But this is n’t even the worst case .
Take a look at the NASDAQ :
The NASDAQ is down 45 percent from the start of the decade .
The only other time in history a lost decade has occurred in stocks was during the Great Depression .
Of course , many try to hide this stubborn fact but this is part of the new reality .
Much of the wealth created in the past decade was built on a weak foundation of sand .
A form of corporate chicanery that gave too much power to Wall Street .
And the power is still there since no real reform has actually taken place since the meltdown started in 2007 .
Yet if we looked more closely we would have noticed the bust more quickly .
We never recovered from the tech bust in terms of employment :
Employment has really taken it on the chin .
Our current unemployment rate of 10 percent does not include the underemployed .
With those working part - time jobs and discouraged workers included the rate goes up to over 17 percent .
The above chart is troubling because it shows that the average American did n’t really enjoy the fruits of the turbo capitalism of the decade .
Much of the gains have been wiped out but if we look at how the corporatocracy is doing they seem to be doing fine :
While the S&P 500 is up a stunning 63 percent from its March lows , some of the banking sector stocks are up 325 percent like Bank of America .
JP Morgan is up 117 percent .
Goldman Sachs is up 93 percent .
The list goes on .
The bailouts seem to be helping a few at the expense of the many .
The same pattern holds for the healthcare sector with the recent bills being proposed .
Their stocks are soaring .
Want to take a guess as to why ?
The corporatocracy is running the show in D.C. and the lost decade is a product of their bubble blowing excess .
The problem with the current system is Wall Street is run by a bunch of gamblers looking to make a quick buck .
Now this would n’t be such a problem if the U.S. taxpayer was n’t funding their shenanigans .
But now , Wall Street has the explicit backing of the U.S. government .
That is why the U.S. dollar is getting pummeled into the abyss .
And that is another thing that we have lost during this decade :
So here we are a decade later with stocks below their 2000 point , unemployment in the double - digits , the U.S. dollar down by one - third , and housing values are quickly approaching their own lost decade point .
What did we really financially gain in this decade ?
All this supposed financial innovation and this is what we get ?
I would say that the so - called innovation was an absolute failure .
It was one gigantic Ponzi scheme .
A con to convince average Americans that allowing Wall Street free reign would somehow result in them getting a piece of the gambler ’s pie .
In return , Wall Street took away any financial stability Americans once enjoyed and put the bill to them as well .
Americans also took part in this excursion .
Not demanding restraint from their leaders or pushing for financial prudence .
Many jumped into the mania and took out billions in home equity to gamble it up .
This was nonsense .
Yet this does n’t come close to the trillions in ridiculous bets Wall Street placed .
Derivatives on zany risk that had nothing to do with improving our economy .
It was merely sophisticated gambling .
And in the end , it was n’t all that sophisticated since it blew up in their faces yet here we are bailing them out .
Industrial production has also been hit :
And much of this has to do with the financial sector sucking up an inordinate amount of resources from the productive side of the economy .
Did people really think that selling houses to one another was a cornerstone to a healthy economy ?
Is a global power really the one that can have the most homes with expensive Jacuzzis financed by Wall Street debt ?
The corporatocracy learned well in this Ponzi decade .
It realized that an important line item expense was to lobby heavily .
This was a lesson not taken to the extreme in the Great Depression .
Sure you had your cronies back them but nothing like our current revolving door .
So today , we are left with those who created the financial bubble also at the helm trying to fix it .
We had serious regulatory reforms that came after the Great Depression .
One major sticking point is Glass Steagall .
That is , the division between bread and butter banking and more risky cowboy banking .
You would think that this would be done by now but little push is being made in Congress for this .
Those that try to bring this up are smacked down by the corporatocracy and their massive lobbying machine .
In fact , banks are back to making massive amounts of profits on the same gambling that got us here in the first place .
If something is n’t done soon we will be back in some major financial crisis only in a few years .
These gamblers want to call what they are doing “ investing ” but this is just another diversion to suck money away from taxpayers .
The irony of this all is the Federal Reserve which supposedly is there to ease out the bumps is actually causa prima for the problems .
Just think of all the major crises since it came about in 1913 :
- The Great Depression - 1970s stagflation - Crash of 1987 - Technology bubble - Housing bubble
And many more in between .
The fact that we still have n’t audited the Fed speaks to the Ponzi decade .
They do n’t want to show us what they are holding for $ 2 trillion because they know once we see it we will realize the gig is up .
They have exchanged good money for toxic assets .
They are hoping inflation kicks in so they can resell the junk and basically the average American wo n’t know that the Ponzi scheme is still going on .
If one man Bernard Madoff was able to keep a $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme going for 15 years can you imagine what the central bank can do ?
A lost decade indeed .
With only a few more days in the decade , many are counting down and looking forward to 2010 .
Maybe we can start by working on building a real and sustainable economy ?

At first glance , this burning bust of Barack Obama seems like an affront against the president , much in the same way that some consider burning the flag a threat against the U.S. But Chinese artist Liu Bolin claims his bronze bust , built in honor of Obama ’s visit to China , is actually a celebration of the president .
According to Bolin , the “ Burning Man Obama ” bust represents the fiery energy that the president holds , claiming “ this piece represents energy and life that Obama has given to the
world .
We ’re eager to see what he can do for China and U.S. relations . ”
But while Bolun may claim that his sculpture is a positive thing , we wonder if there is actually a deeper , darker meaning .
Even if there is n’t , the bust is virtually guaranteed to ignite a firestorm of controversy .
Or maybe the whole thing is just a publicity stunt .
Bolin is known for his mind - bending invisible man paintings , which feature the artist literally disappearing into his scenes .
What do you think of “ Burning Man Obama ” ?

Party Time at the FAA ; Critics Question $ 5 Million Gathering Beats being at work , an FAA manager said as 3,600 meet ; an excuse to party ?
Dec. 22 , 2009  --
The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) spent five million dollars this month to bring 3 , 600 managers to a conference in Atlanta that FAA whistleblowers and critics say was little more than an excuse to throw a three - week - long Christmas party .
" It 's the wrong time to spend five million dollars on a Christmas party for anybody 's employees , especially in the government , " said Tom Schatz , the president of Citizens Against Government Waste , a non-profit watchdog group .
Undercover video to be broadcast tonight on ABC World News with Diane Sawyer shows FAA managers drinking heavily and making the rounds of Atlanta bars after a day of meetings .
One FAA manager told an ABC News undercover reporter , " Anytime you get a bunch of FAA guys together , it is nothing but a party . "
Another said , " It beats being at work . "
The FAA says the purpose of the December meetings was to train managers on the new contract for air traffic controllers that went into effect on Oct.
1 .
" This is worth it because we have to get the frontline managers on - board with what we 're trying to do , " said Hank Krakowski , the chief operating officer of the FAA 's Air Traffic Operations .
The FAA managers received $ 81 per day to spend on meals and personal expenses .
The hotel room cost was $ 140 per night .
At the end of one day of meetings , an FAA manager said he and others were about to head out " to dance on tables shortly . "
He boasted he was " almost arrested " for being drunk and " dancing on the tables " at the last such FAA managers gathering in St. Louis in 2006 .
Another conference attendee asked a female ABC News undercover reporter if she was a " hooker " because " I was ready to reach for my wallet . "
FAA Morale Problems
" We expect a level of professionalism from our employees at all times , including after work hours , " said an FAA spokesperson .
" Reports of unruly public behavior are disappointing for the entire FAA . "
FAA whistleblowers also questioned why , if the meetings were so important , they were held more than two months after the contract was enacted .
The FAA said the agency scheduled the gatherings for December at a time when it believed the contract would not be in place until Jan .
1 .
Some FAA managers attending the sessions said they were held in a large ballroom and only dealt with only 12 of more than 100 separate contract articles and involved no small , break - out sessions .
The FAA told ABC News the sessions dealt with 34 articles .
" It seems a little extravagant , " said one whistleblower in a message to ABCNews.com .
" One would think a PowerPoint or even a videoconference would suffice . "
The FAA said the discussions of the new contract would not have been as effective on a tele - conference .
" Given the complexity of the contract and the need for managers to fully understand it , the training had to be done face - to - face not through a memo or webcast , " the FAA said in a statement .
The FAA also seemed to suggest the agency 's long - standing morale problems justified spending the money .
" The FAA is engaged in a process of significant cultural change , the need for which is widely acknowledged , " said the statement .
FAA manager Steve Lewis of Phoenix said he thought the meetings and an evening buffet cocktail party would help provide " a more harmonious workplace . "
The FAA said there was also a special " focus session " on improving the " safety culture " at the FAA .
" Anyone who is flying , whose flight has been delayed or canceled could find a lot better usage for five million dollars for the FAA , " said Schatz of Citizens Against Government Waste .
FAA Official Gets Governor 's Suite
The meetings took place over the course of three weeks , with 1,200 FAA managers attending each week .
The FAA said " Atlanta was deemed the best value city " and the meeting resulted in the host Omni hotel employing 700 additional workers to handle the conference .
As part of the hospitality for the FAA , the hotel threw in the cost of the buffet cocktail party for the government managers and also provided Krakowski , the senior FAA official present , with the expansive Governor 's Suite on the 28th floor .
A FAA spokesperson said Krakowski's suite was charged at the $ 140 per diem rate and that the FAA " did not pay for any Christmas parties . "
" Clearly the cost of the cocktail reception and whatever was done by the hotel was included in the cost , " said Schatz of the watchdog group .
" No hotel is going to have a party for so many guests without covering the hotel 's costs . "
The FAA has been beset by a series of technical and computer glitches that have created chaos for the country 's air passengers .
The agency is pushing for a $ 22 billion dollar upgrade to replace equipment that , in some cases , dates to the 1960s .

An additional challenge to members of Congress and the United States Senate is being issued , last night by Ed Schultz and next week , the challenge will be reinforced by Keith Olbermann .
Why has not one Congressperson or U.S.Senator had the courage to come and see this Grapes of Wrath suffering with their own eyes ?
Why do you take junkets across the globe , but you fail to take the time to bear witness to the results of your own inability and lack of resolve to deliver healthcare to the American people ?
Would you no longer sleep soundly having to look in the eye all the suffering for which you are responsible ?
I was on a conference call earlier this week with Arlen Specter .
I issued the challenge to him , and much to my delight , he agreed .
Senator Specter said that if given enough notice , and barring any extraordinary Senate business , he would make every effort to attend the next free clinic .
I will be there to escort him around and thank him .
When I further pressed him about using his power and office to include colleagues , he readily agreed to do this as well .
I 'd ask the cynics to stand down for a moment .
Yes , Senator Specter is in a tough election struggle , but let 's give him the benefit of the doubt .
And I 'll add , after an initial stumble or two , as he got his Democratic sea legs , he 's been a very loyal Democrat on healthcare .
And for me , and those waiting on line in Kansas City , that 's huge .
The Americans waiting to be seen at the clinic were for the most part ( 83 % ) working people .
They have low paying jobs but no healthcare , either it 's too expensive or their employer does n't offer coverage .
They cannot afford medications , so relatively easy to treat conditions like hypertension , go untreated and result in system wide body failure .
Any government that has allowed this catastrophe to go unaddressed for so long , does not deserve the support of the governed .
Historians will look back at us and be puzzled why we remained so docile , as those we elect fiddled around the edges -- and did nothing .
Yesterday Nancy Pelosi said she hoped to have a healthcare bill as a " Christmas present " to the American people .
All I can do right is let these good Americans speak directly to you .
Healthcare is not a Chrstmas present , it is an urgent necessity , and it 's shocking that Democrats do n't recognize this .
These are just a handful of the videos I collected , I 'll post more in the coming days .
Diandra Owens , excruciating dental pain , lost her job and her insurance .
Diane Smith , lost her job , no insurance , unaffordable insurance , no healthcare .
No regular doctor visits in seven years .
" We 're the greatest country int he world and we should have healthcare for everybody "
Dennis Cahill - two heart attacks , no medication , no insurance .
Natasha Stevenson with her three children who need dental care .
Listen to what these children say .
Madeline , age seven , " I have n't been to a dentist at all " .
Kayla : " I have cavities . "
Me : " Why did n't they get filled ? "
Kayla : " We did n't have the money . "
Sara Clarke , lost her job , new job has no benefits .
Check out and blankets -- blankets for cold Americans , Americans who can't heat their homes and Americans out of work , and my ahve to sleep on the streets .
A Christmas present , Ms. Pelosi ?
Shame on you .
Shame on this country .
It 's been a while .
If I remember correctly , a variant of Vundo was using the " overlay.xul " mechanism to hi-jack searches in the Firefox browser almost a year ago .
Now , ISC reader
Tom contacted us with a mystery that took him and his colleagues several days to unravel .
The symptoms :
You try to search with Google / Yahoo / Ask / Bing , but NoScript ( a great add - on !! ) warns you that the browser is actually trying to run a JavaScript from innoshots - dot - org .
Having checked all the usual culprits , and run all the Anti-Virus tools you have , you find : Nothing .
And the browser still redirects .
overlay.xul is a Firefox mechanism to allow applications to add elements to the browser GUI , and is used for good effect by several tools .
We do n't know which infection vector was used in Tom 's case to deposit the malicious overlay file on the machine .
All we have is the file , and the knowledge that it apparently either resides in
Documents and Settings / user / Local Settings / Application Data/{randomstring}/chrome/content -- or --
Program Files / Mozilla Firefox / extensions/{randomstring}/chrome/content
and is accompanied by a suspicious Javascript file called _cfg.js .
overlay.xul contains heavily obfuscated JavaScript , and has nice copyright headers to make it look like a valid Firefox add - on , but the " smoking gun " is still visible in the lower portion of the file :
Yup .
Some sort of matching for " google " , " ask " , " yahoo " , " aol " and " bing " is going on here .
This particular sample of " overlay.xul " is almost a month old , and yet there are still some very prominent Anti-Virus products that do not see anything wrong with it : Virustotal
Did anyone else notice a recent resurgence of " overlay.xul " and its search engine redirection malware ?
If you have a sample , or know anything about the mechanism this latest version uses to get onto the system , please let us know .
Note : overlay.xul also has good uses , so do n't go for a frantic deletion rampage now .
But take a careful and suspicious look at the files you find !
This week sees the release of Michael Avon Oeming 's " God Complex , " a comic about a man named Paul who is actually the Greek god Apollo , trying to live a normal mortal life despite his divine family 's best efforts at persuading him -- which , as this is comics , means trying to kill him .
Not only does " God Complex " sound like a lot of fun , but it 's gotten us thinking about other uses of mythology in comics .
After all , with their emphasis on super - powered figures taking an active role in the lives of mortal men , super - hero books are often looked as the modern equivalent to the myths and legends of centuries ago , and as a result , comics are carrying on the tradition to the point where there 's more gods in Marvel Comics than in an Edith Hamilton book !
So today , we 've summoned ComicsAlliance 's very own Oracle of Delphi , Chris Sims , to shed some light on some of the best uses of classic mythology in comics !
Marvel 's Mighty Thor
What with the fact that his entire deal is throwing around lightning while bashing villains ' heads in with his magic hammer , the Norse god Thor would seem like a modern super - hero even if Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had n't made him one of the core characters of the Marvel Universe .
It was writer / artist Walt Simonson , however , who perfected an expert blend of Norse myth and the Marvel Universe , a combination that allowed Thor to do stuff like battling a mad fire giant alongside a cosmically - powered cyborg horse from space .
Share digg_url = ' http://comicsalliance.com/2009/12/01/gods-mythology-in-comics/'; tweetmeme_url = ' http://comicsalliance.com/2009/12/01/gods-mythology-in-comics/'; tweetmeme_source = ' ComicsAlliance ' ;
It 's important to note , though , that characters like Volstagg were created exclusively for the comics , which we think is a definite improvement .
Marvel 's Incredible Hercules
" Thor " is n't just responsible for bringing Norse mythology to the Marvel universe ; Roy Thomas used the " Eternals Saga " to tie Thor to Germanic hero Siegfried , and Stan and Jack themselves used the Thunder God 's " Journey Into Mystery Annual " # 1 to start up the ultimate " who would win in a fight " rivalry by pitting Thor against Hercules in their first of many battles .
Herc went on to be a long - standing member of the Avengers , bringing along his half - brother Ares , who was a long - standing villain before starring in his own miniseries where the Greek gods battled against the Japanese god Mikaboshi , then landing in " Dark Avengers . "
Herc himself is currently enjoying a solo title , " The Incredible Hercules , " that follows the Simonson mold with constant references to the classic myths ...
... like a scene where he freed Cereberus -- the three - headed guard - dog of the underworld -- whom he had previously chained up as his twelfth labor .
Writers Greg Pak and Fred Van Lente even used the book as a springboard to bring in other myths with the " Secret Invasion " crossover ...
... introducing a whole host of gods and tying them into Marvel characters like Snowbird and Ajak of the Eternals .

" Ferdinand & the Panther " from Journal of Recognition Below is an article on the German Ferdinand self - propelled gun and Panther tank from the February 1944 issue of Journal of Recognition .
The Ferdinand ( officially Sturmgeschütz mit 8.8 cm PaK 43/2 ) and Panther ( officially Panzerkampfwagen V Ausf D ) both first appeared in combat during the Battle of Kursk in July 1943 .
During the battle and ensuing counterattack , the Russians captured several examples of the Ferdinand and Panther allowing for detailed analysis .
More pictures of self - propelled " 88 " and PzKw Mark V reveal details of new Nazi weapons
LACK OF RETURN ROLLERS TO TAKE UP SLACK IN TRACK GIVES MOTIVE GEAR OF FERDINAND A DILAPIDATED LOOK .
CHASSIS BOW IS LONG BUT GUN BARREL LONGER .
The Germans have been hurling their heaviest armored equipment against the Russians .
Recently silhouettes and more pictures of the two newest Nazi armored threats encountered on the Russian front , Ferdinand and the Panther ( see Journal Nov. and Dec. ) , have been made available to the Journal , are shown on these two pages .
Ferdinand is a tremendous 70 - ton self - propelled mount which carries an 88 - mm . gun on a chassis built to offer maximum resistance to enemy firepower .
The thickness of Ferdinand 's armor plate is as much as 8 in .
on the front , intended to make the mount serve as a battering ram to clear the way for lighter armored vehicles of the Nazi anti-tank battalions .
There are usually 44 of these self - propelled " 88 's " in one heavy battalion and each one carries a crew of six .
Although the mighty firepower and armor of Ferdinand make it a dangerous opponent , it has been proved to be quite vulnerable .
Unwieldy and underpowered for its great size , it can travel only 12 m.p.h. on a highway and 6 to 9 m.p.h. on rough ground ; to fire , it must come to a full stop .
When Ferdinand is attacked by more that one opponent at a time , its fixed weapon is a great handicap .
Russians concentrate their artillery attacks on Ferdinand 's mobile parts which break down readily under the great weight of the chassis ; also on the gun installation and on the gas tanks in the center of the hull .
Grenades and Molotov cocktails hurled through a large shell - case ejection opening in the rear of the mount will blast the twin electric motors located directly inside .
HUGE BOW OF PANTHER SLOPES UP TO IMPOSING HEIGHT .
TURRET HAS ROUNDED FORWARD WALL RESEMBLING RUSSIAN T - 34 .
ARMOR PLATE PROTECTS SUSPENSION .
A new heavy tank in the German arsenal , the 45 - ton PzKw Mark V series to bridge the gap between the 22 - ton Mark IV and the 60 - ton Mark VI , Tiger .
This tank , which is called the Panther , appears to be a first - class vehicle , fast , well - armored and hard - hitting .
It has the advantage of being swifter and more maneuverable than the Tiger but at the same time is easier to knock out because of lighter armor protection .
Its long - barreled 75 - mm .
gun with double - baffle muzzle brake is a new weapon which has a high velocity , considerable armor penetration , and direct sights up to a distance of 1,640 yd.
Like the Tiger , the Panther can be converted for deep stream fording .
It has a speed of 31 m.p.h. and carries a crew of five .
Its heaviest armor plate , on the front of the turret and the cannon shield , is about 3.94 in . thick .
The top and bottom of the tank are lightly armored and are especially vulnerable to grenade fire .
RECOGNITION :
The huge coffinlike gunshield of Ferdinand , set well to rear , has sloping sides and top .
Hull is rectangular and straight - sided .
Six large evenly - spaced bogie wheels support track approximately 2 1/2 ft. wide .
The Panther is built close to the ground with a low center of gravity .
Its turret sides flow in sloping line into the sides of the hull .
The turret is slab - sided and set slightly to the rear of center with a cupola at the back .
The 75 - mm. gun barrel is extremely long .
From the side , the Panther 's hull is sharply undercut behind .
Eight overlapping bogie wheels on each side with driving sprocket in front are typical of German - designed suspension systems .

Reckless Myopia
John P. Hussman , Ph.D .
All rights reserved and actively enforced .

I was wrong .
Not about the implosion of the credit markets , which I urgently warned about in 2007 and early 2008 .
Not about the recession , which we shifted to anticipating in November 2007 .
Not about the plunge in the stock market , which erased the entire 2002 - 2007 market gain , which was no surprise .
Not about the " ebb and flow " of short - term data , which I frequently noted could produce a powerful ( though perhaps abruptly terminated ) market advance even in the face of dangerous longer - term cross-currents .
I expect not even about the " surprising " second wave of credit distress that we can expect as we move into 2010 .
From a long - term perspective , my record is very comfortable .
But clearly , I was wrong about the extent to which Wall Street would respond to the ebb-and - flow in the economic data - particularly the obvious and temporary lull in the mortgage reset schedule between March and November 2009 - and drive stocks to the point where they are not only overvalued again , but strikingly dependent on a sustained economic recovery and the achievement and maintenance of record profit margins in the years ahead .
I should have assumed that Wall Street 's tendency toward reckless myopia - ingrained over the past decade - would return at the first sign of even temporary stability .
The eagerness of investors to chase prevailing trends , and their unwillingness to concern themselves with predictable longer - term risks , drove a successive series of speculative advances and crashes during the past decade - the dot - com bubble , the tech bubble , the mortgage bubble , the private - equity bubble , and the commodities bubble .
And here we are again .
We face two possible states of the world .
One is a world in which our economic problems are largely solved , profits are on the mend , and things will soon be back to normal , except for a lot of unemployed people whose fate is , let 's face it , of no concern to Wall Street .
The other is a world that has enjoyed a brief intermission prior to a terrific second act in which an even larger share of credit losses will be taken , and in which the range of policy choices will be more restricted because we 've already issued more government liabilities than a banana republic , and will steeply debase our currency if we do it again .
It is not at all clear that the recent data have removed any uncertainty as to which world we are in .
Taking the weighted average outcome for the two states of the world still produces a poor average return / risk tradeoff .
Taking the weighted average investment position for the two states of the world is somewhat more constructive .
As I noted several weeks ago , I have adapted our weightings accordingly .
As a result , we have been trading around a modest positive net exposure , increasing it slightly on market weakness , and clipping it on strength , as is our discipline .
Currently , the Strategic Growth Fund has a net exposure to market fluctuations of less than 10 % , but enough " curvature " ( through index options ) that our exposure to market risk will automatically become more muted on market weakness and more positive on market advances , allowing us to buy weakness and sell strength without material concern about the ( increasing ) risk of a market collapse .
There is no chance , even in hindsight ( " could have , would have , should have " stuff ) that I would have responded to the existing evidence in recent months with more than a moderate exposure to market risk during some portion of the advance since March .
But our year - to - date returns might now be into a second digit had I recognized that investors have learned utterly nothing from the bubbles and collapses of the past decade .
That recognition might have encouraged a greater weight on trend - following measures versus fundamentals , valuations , price - volume sponsorship , and other factors .
Still , our stock selections continue to perform well relative to the market , our risks remain well - managed through a substantial ( though not full ) hedge , and our investment approach has nicely outperformed the S&P 500 over complete market cycles , with substantially less downside risk than a passive investment approach .
We have implemented some modest changes to improve our potential to benefit from ( even ill - advised ) speculative runs , but we 've done fine nonetheless , and we can sleep nights .
Whether or not I have focused too much on probable " second - wave " credit risks is something we will find out in the quarters ahead - my record of economic analysis is strong enough that a " miss " on that front would be an outlier .
What I do think is that over the past decade , investors ( including people who hold themselves out as investment professionals ) have become far more susceptible to reckless myopia than I would have liked to believe .
They have become speculators up to the point of disaster .
Frankly , I 've come to believe that the markets are no longer reliable or sound discounting mechanisms .
The repeated cycle of bubbles and predictable crashes over the recent decade makes that clear .
Rather , investors appear to respond to emerging risks no more than about three months ahead of time .
Worse , far too many analysts and strategists appear to discount the future only in the most pedestrian way , by taking year - ahead earnings estimates at face value , and mindlessly applying some arbitrary and historically inconsistent multiple to them .
This is utterly different from true discounting - which does not rely on multiples , but instead carefully traces out the likely path of future revenues , profit margins , cash flows and earnings over time , and explicitly discounts expected payouts and probable terminal values back at an appropriate rate of return .
That 's what we actually do here .
Talking in terms of multiples can make the process easier to explain , and can be a reasonable approach to the market as a whole if earnings are normalized properly , but ultimately , an investment security is a claim to a long - term stream of cash flows .
It is not simply a blind multiple to the latest analyst estimate .
Fortunately , the evidence suggests that the long - term returns to a careful discounting approach tend to be strong even if investors repeatedly behave in speculative and short - sighted ways .
This is because long - term returns are fully determined by the stream of cash flows actually received by investors over time , and because inappropriate valuations ultimately tend to mean - revert .
In the face of speculative noise , the long - term returns from a proper discounting approach may not capture as much speculative return as might be possible , but over time , many of those speculative swings tend to wash out anyway .
In part , the market 's increasing propensity toward speculation reflects the increasing lack of fiscal and monetary discipline from our leaders .
Policy makers who seek quick fixes and could care less about long - term consequences undoubtedly encourage investors to embrace the same value system .
Paul Volcker was the last Fed Chairman to have any sense that discipline and the acceptance of temporary discomfort was good for the nation .
Our current Fed Chairman 's voice literally quivers in response to the phrase " bank failure , " even though in the present context , a bank failure implies none of the disorganized outcomes that characterized the Great Depression .
It simply means that the bondholders take a loss and the remaining part of the institution survives intact as a " whole bank " entity ( and can be sold or re-issued back to public ownership , less the debt to bondholders , as such ) .
The same outcome would have been possible with Lehman had the FDIC been granted authority from Congress to take conservatorship of a non -bank financial entity .
In my estimation , there is still close to an 80 % probability ( Bayes ' Rule ) that a second market plunge and economic downturn will unfold during the coming year .
This is not certainty , but the evidence that we 've observed in the equity market , labor market , and credit markets to - date is simply much more consistent with the recent advance being a component of a more drawn - out and painful deleveraging cycle .
Meanwhile , valuations are clearly unfavorable here , and even under the " typical post - war recovery " scenario , we are observing an increasing number of internal divergences and non-confirmations in market action .
As Gluskin Sheff chief economist David Rosenberg noted last week , " Even if the recession is over , the historical record shows that downturns induced by asset deflation and credit contraction are different than a garden - variety recession induced by Fed tightening and excessive manufacturing inventories since the former typically induce a secular shift in behavior and attitudes towards debt , asset allocation , savings , discretionary spending and homeownership .
The latter fades more quickly .
" This is why people did n't figure out that it was the Great Depression until two years after the worst point in the crisis in the 1930s ; and why it took decades , not months , quarters or even years , for the complete transition to the next sustainable economic expansion and bull market .
" Mortgage applications for new home purchases hit a 12 - year low in the middle of November ( down 22 % in the past month ! ) , fully two weeks after the Administration said it was going to not only extend but expand the program to include higher - income trade - up buyers .
Once again , there is minimal demand for autos and housing , and that is partly because the market is still saturated with both of these credit - sensitive big - ticket items after an unprecedented credit and consumer bubble that went absolutely parabolic in the seven years prior to the collapse in the financial markets an asset values .
We are probably not even one - third of the way through this deleveraging cycle .
Tread carefully . "
Andrew Smithers , one of the few other analysts who foresaw the credit implosion and remains a credible voice now , concurred last week in an interview with my friend Kate Welling ( a former Barrons ' editor now at Weeden & Company ) :
" The good news so far is that the stock market got down to pretty much fair value or even , possibly , a tickle below it , at its March bottom .
But now it has gone up ... we probably have a market which is , roughly , 40 % overpriced .
In order to assess value , it is necessary either to calculate the level at which the EPS would be if profits were neither depressed nor elevated , or to use a metric of value which does not depend on profits .
The cyclically adjusted P/E ( CAPE ) normalizes EPS by averaging them over 10 years .
It thus follows the first of those two possible methods .
Using even longer time periods has advantages , particularly as EPS have been exceptionally volatile in recent years - and using longer time periods raises the current measured degree of overvaluation .
The other methodology we use measures stock market value without reference to profits : the q ratio .
It compares the market capitalization of companies with their net worth , also adjusted to current prices .
The validity of both of these approaches can be tested and is robust under testing - and they produce results that agree .
Currently , both q and CAPE are saying that the U.S. stock market is about 40 % overvalued . "
In the chart below , the current data point would be about 0.4 , not as extreme as we observed in 1929 , 2000 , or 2007 of course , but equal to or beyond what we 've observed at virtually every other market peak in history .
This aligns well with our own analysis , where as I 've noted in recent weeks , the S&P 500 is priced to deliver one of the weakest 10 - year total returns in history except for the ( ultimately disappointing ) period since the mid-1990's .
One of the fascinating aspects of the past few months is the lack of equilibrium thinking with respect to what happened to the trillions of dollars in government money that has been spent to defend the bondholders of mismanaged financial companies .
Almost by definition , money given to corporations will show up most quickly as improvements in corporate earnings , and then slightly later , as executive compensation .
A few pieces came across my desk last week , hailing the ability of the corporate sector to bounce back from the recent economic downturn even though revenues have continued to suffer and employment has been steeply cut .
Why is this a surprise ?
Where else could the money have gone ?
Labor compensation ?
It is truly mind - numbing that a moment after a temporary surge of trillions of dollars , borrowed and tossed out of a helicopter ( though to specific corporations and private beneficiaries ) , analysts would hail a subsequent improvement in corporate results as evidence of " resilience .
"
What matters is sustainability , and unfortunately , it is clear that credit continues to collapse .
Banks are contracting their loan portfolios at a record rate , according to the latest FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile .
Even so , new delinquencies continue to accelerate faster than loan loss reserves .
Tier 1 capital looked quite good last quarter , as one would expect from the combination of a large new issuance of bank securities , combined with an easing of accounting rules to allow " significant judgment " with respect to credit losses .
The list of problem institutions is still rising exponentially .
Overall , earnings and capital ratios have enjoyed a reprieve in the past couple of quarters , but delinquencies have not , and all evidence points to an acceleration as we move into 2010 .
Urgent Policy Implications
From a policy standpoint , it is effectively too late to forestall further foreclosures absent explicit losses to creditors .
The best policy option now is to make sure that the second wave does not result in a debasement of the U.S. dollar .
The way to do that is to require three things :
First , the FDIC should be given regulatory authority to take non-bank financials into conservatorship the way they should have been able to do with Bear Stearns and Lehman .
If this authority had existed in 2008 , Bear 's bondholders would not now stand to get 100 % of their money back , with interest , as they presently do , and Lehman 's disorganized liquidation would have been completely unnecessary .
As I 've noted before , the problem with Lehman was not that it went bankrupt , but that it went bankrupt in a disorganized way .
If the FDIC had authority over insolvent non -bank financials and bank holding companies , it could wipe out equity and an appropriate amount of bondholder capital , and sell the fully - functioning residual to an acquirer , as is typically done with failing banks , without any loss to depositors or customers .
Second , bank capital requirements should be altered to require a substantial portion of bank debt to be of a form that automatically converts to equity in the event of capital inadequacy .
This would force losses onto bondholders , rather than onto taxpayers .
This policy adjustment is urgent - we have perhaps a few months to get this right .
Finally , Congress should be clear that government funds will be available only to protect the interests of depositors , not bondholders .
Specifically , any funds provided by the government should be contingent on the ability to exert a senior claim to bondholders in the event of subsequent bankruptcy , even if a category is created to allow those funds to be counted as " capital " for purposes of satisfying capital requirements prior to such bankruptcy .
Government - provided capital should be subordinate only to depositor claims , if equity and bondholder capital ultimately proves insufficient to meet those obligations .
Since early 2008 , beginning with the provision of non-recourse funding in the Bear Stearns debacle , the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have repeatedly allocated or implicitly obligated public funds to defend the bondholders of mismanaged financial companies .
This has included the outright and non-recourse purchase of nearly a trillion dollars in mortgage securities that have no explicit guarantee by the U.S. government .
By purchasing these securities outright ( rather than through a well - defined repurchase agreement ) , the Fed is effectively obligating the U.S. government to either guarantee them or to absorb any future losses .
Aside from the fraction of bailout funding that was specifically allocated by Congress through legislation , these actions represent an unconstitutional breach into enumerated spending powers that are the domain of the elected members of Congress alone .
The issue here is not whether the Fed should be independent from political influence .
The issue is the constitutionality of the Fed 's actions .
The discretion that it has exerted over the past two years crosses the line into prerogatives reserved for Congress .
That line needs to be clarified sooner rather than later .
Emphatically , the trillions of dollars spent over the past year were not in the interest of protecting bank depositors or the general public .
They went to protect bank bondholders .
Instead of taking appropriate losses on those bonds ( which financed reckless mortgage lending ) , those bonds are happily priced near their face value , for the benefit of private individuals , thanks to an equivalent issuance of U.S. Treasury debt .
But that 's not enough .
Outside of a very narrow set of institutions that are subject to compensation limits , just watch how much of the public 's money - which benefitted several major investment banks following a very direct route - gets allocated to Wall Street bonuses in the next few weeks .
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate for stocks remained characterized by unfavorable valuations and mixed market action .
The market remains significantly overbought on an intermediate - term basis , and we 've seen increasing divergences from breadth , small and mid-cap stocks , trading volume , and other internals , which have lagged the most recent advance in the S&P 500 and other cap - weighted indices .
The prospect of a debt - repayment " standstill " from Dubai prompted some weakness in foreign markets that spilled over to the U.S. on Friday .
This was interesting given that David Faber reported the issue on CNBC on Wednesday , to no reaction .
Importantly , the payment difficulties do not stem from oil revenues , but largely from tourism and financial activity , as those are Dubai 's chief industries ( Dubai is home to the tallest building and the largest man-made islands in the world , for example ) .
From that standpoint , it is difficult to imagine much in the way of contagion as a result of Dubai 's difficulties .
Whatever shock the market will get from left field is likely to come from larger financial or geopolitical risks .
The market for credit default swaps bears watching , but thus far we have n't observed spikes to indicate that something major is imminent .
Unfortunately , as I noted earlier , investors have earned an " F " for vigilance in recent years , so our lead time on new difficulties may be shorter than we might like .
In any event , I 'm pleased with the overall behavior of our stock holdings , and I expect that we 'll have plenty of opportunity to increase our exposure to market fluctuations at more appropriate valuations .
Presently , we 've got a small amount of exposure to market fluctuations , but not enough to cause any material difficulties if the market experiences some trouble .
The largest source of day - to - day fluctuations remains the difference in performance between the stocks we hold long and the indices we use to hedge .
That source of risk has also been the primary contributor to returns over the life of the Fund .
In bonds , the Market Climate was characterized last week by moderately unfavorable yield levels and generally favorable yield pressures .
We saw a good example of how the market is inclined to respond to fresh credit concerns last week , with upward pressure on the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasuries , and downward pressure on foreign currencies and commodities .
While I continue to believe that the dollar faces substantial risk of further erosion in its exchange value , as well as a near doubling of the CPI over the coming decade or so ( both reflecting the massive increase in U.S. government liabilities in recent years ) , those prospects are not likely to emerge until risk - aversion about credit default materially abates .
Credit concerns typically create a spike in demand for default - free assets such as U.S. government liabilities , so even though there is a much larger float than is likely to be sustained over time without inflation as the ultimate outcome , credit concerns tend to support the value of these liabilities and hence mutes immediate inflation pressures ( essentially , monetary velocity declines as these liabilities are sought as a default - free store of value ) .
The Strategic Total Return Fund currently has an overall duration slightly over 3 years , primarily in straight Treasuries , with a small 1 % exposure to precious metals shares and about 4 % of assets in utility shares .

Colleges are rapidly adding new majors and minors in green studies , and students are filling them fast .
Nationwide , more than 100 majors , minors or certificates were created this year in energy and sustainability - focused programs at colleges big and small , says the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education .
That 's up from just three programs added in 2005 .
Two factors are driving the surge : Students want the courses , and employers want the trained students , says Paul Rowland , the association 's executive director .
" There 's a great perception that there 's a sweet spot with energy to do good and do well , and it appears to be the place of job growth , " says Rob Melnick , executive dean of the Global Institute of Sustainability at Arizona State University .
GREEN HOUSE : Learn and share ideas
The institute started an undergraduate program in sustainability studies — with a focus on solar — a year and a half ago .
It now has about 600 students who 've declared sustainability a major .
" The growth rate is unprecedented , " even though the program has the toughest admission standards of any school at the university , Melnick says .
Other schools are also seeing big demand , including : • Illinois State University in Normal , Ill .
The school of 21,000 students has 65 majors in renewable energy , a program started in 2008 with help from a $ 1 million Department of Energy grant .
The program has " more students wanting in than we can handle , " says Richard Boser , chair of the Department of Technology .
Nearby employers , including those in wind energy , hope to hire future graduates , Boser says .
• Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
In September it launched a minor in energy studies .
A student survey said 43 % of freshmen and sophomores were very or extremely interested in it .
" That 's a very large number , " says Vladimir Bulovic , associate professor of communication and technology .
MIT 's student energy club has 1,700 members , vs. several hundred a few years ago , Bulovic says .
• University of California - Berkeley .
The school has seen student interest in its introductory energy class explode .
Ten years ago , it attracted 40 or so students .
Now , the class runs 270 , says Daniel Kammen , director of the school 's Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory .
The Obama administration has estimated that jobs in energy and environmental - related occupations will grow 52 % from 2000 through 2016 , vs. 14 % for other occupations .
That 's partly why budget - strapped schools are adding energy and sustainability programs even while cutting other majors , Rowland says .

As yall know , I have been organizing an effort to flood the offices of Senators with phone calls in support of S. 604 , the bill to require an audit of the Federal Reserve .
This effort has been successful –there are hundreds of people making phone calls in support of this bill every day .
There are now 28 Senators who have signed on to sponsor this bill .
The House version of this bill has the support of 291 Congressmen , meaning that if it were brought up in Congress it would pass with a veto - proof majority !
We need 66 Senators to support the Senate bill for it to be veto proof ( we will need 67 once Ted Kennedy ’s seat is filled ) .
Here are some talking points for your conversations with Senatorial aides .
I recommend posting the following messages on Facebook or anywhere else you think would be a good place to spread this message .
As I said above , we now have 28 sponsors and cosponsors of this bill in the Senate ( and I know of two more Senators who support the bill but have yet to cosponsor it ) .
We need to keep pushing if we want this bill to pass .
Please make your calls and pass this information onto your friends and family .

I spent eight hours this weekend watching the Senate debate on whether to proceed with debating on whether to pass a health care bill .
This was largely a sort of kabuki ritual , since Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid already knew that he had the sixty votes needed to stop a Republican filibuster .
But it tells you what the talking points are on each side , which is going to matter as the debate actually plays out .
The Republican position is fairly incoherent .
The major talking points are these :
This bill uses accounting gimmicks to front load the taxes and back load the spending , which is the only reason it 's deficit neutral over the ten year window The Democrats are refusing to let cuts to doctor payments stand , and also , doctors do n't get paid enough Millions of people are going to be added to Medicaid , which is a terrible program because providers do n't get paid enough .
Also , it would be too expensive to add people to Medicaid .
Medicare costs too much , and also , should n't be cut .
The Republicans favor " real reform " which mostly seems to consist of liability caps .
Somewhat to my surprise , John McCain was on fire , in full on " flaming sword of righteousness " mode .
He was practically shaking with anger as he called out the government for negotiating with the pharma companies , and yelled at the pharmas for raising their prices this year .
Pharma seems to have followed a standard " Memorial Day Sale " strategy -- they 've raised prices by about 10 % this year , in preparation for the deep discounts they 'll have to offer in the future .
John McCain thought that this was terrible , and said so , to awkward silence from his colleagues .
They brightened up considerably when he said " Shame on the AARP " for endorsing this plan that does its members no good , accused them of getting paid off , and told people to tear up their AARP cards .
He and Bob Corker were pretty much the high points .
The rest was mostly boilerplate .
Luckily for the Republicans , they were n't exactly playing against the varsity .
The Democrats had their own set of uncompelling talking points :
Insurance companies are evil institutions which deny everyone any care that costs more than a pack of Freedent gum .
Also , they cannot control health care costs without substantial government intervention , because they spend far too much on expensive procedures .
Ted Kennedy sure was a swell guy , was n't he ?
He'd be proud of every dang one of us today .
( It is impossible to exaggerate how great a role this point played .
There was a five minute stretch which consisted largely of people telling Ted Kennedy 's replacement that Teddy would be awfully proud of him , and him saying , " No , really , Ted would be proud of you . )
Small and medium sized businesses are groaning under the weight of their health care costs .
Also , starting next year , we 're going to force them to give you much more generous coverage from your employer , such as coverage for non-dependant " children " up to the age of 26 .
This problem is incredibly urgent , which is why we have to pass this bill , which now takes effect in 2014 , RIGHT NOW .
The best talking points on both sides were , sadly , anecdotes .
Democrats had the predictable parade of people who were denied coverage for various treatments .
Republicans had doctors who cannot afford to take Medicaid , hospitals which can't survive on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels , and Senator John Barasso , whose wife was diagnosed with breast cancer by a mammogram in her early forties .

The New American
December 25 , 2009
The prime architect of the Federal Reserve was German immigrant Paul Warburg .
Arriving in America in 1902 with brother Max , he married into the family controlling Kuhn , Loeb and Company , America ’s prime international banking firm .
By 1907 , he was earning $ 500,000 annually , an enormously generous salary at a time when there was no income tax and inflation had not begun eroding the value of the dollar .
Congressman Ron Paul has earned the thanks of all true Americans with his efforts to combat the Fed .
Already conversant with the power possessed by European central banks , Warburg insisted for the next few years that America needed a similar banking establishment .
He teamed up with Rhode Island ’s Senator Nelson Aldrich and , in 1910 , the two were among the seven who met secretly at Jekyll Island , Georgia , to plot creation of the Federal Reserve .
Enacted by Congress supposedly to curtail the power of the “ money trust , ” the Fed did exactly the opposite .
And when Paul Warburg left Kuhn , Loeb and Company to accept a post on the first Federal Reserve Board , he would earn only $ 12,000 yearly .
Warburg ’s willingness to take such a huge cut in salary is only one clue to the most important purpose of the Fed .
From its inception , the acquisition of power , not wealth , was the goal of its creators , even though many opponents of the Fed down through the years have indicated otherwise .
When Mayer Amschel Rothschild of the European banking empire bearing his name stated , “ Let me issue and control a nation ’s money and I care not who writes the laws , ” he indicated that a nation ’s political leaders would do the bidding of those who controlled money .
No one has ever proved him wrong .
Professor Carroll Quigley ’s 1966 opus Tragedy and Hope contains many important revelations .
He bared the existence of a secret society that planned to rule the world , even naming the Council on Foreign Relations as its American branch .
He labeled this secret group ’s remarkably ambitious project a “ network ” rather than a conspiracy because he had no aversion to any of its goals .
He further admitted gaining permission to examine “ its papers and secret records ” for several years .
( Where he went to do such examining has never been revealed . )
But early in his 1,350 - page book , the Georgetown University historian pointed to the “ far - reaching goal ” of the “ network ” he so admired .
He wrote that the “ powers of financial capitalism ” sought “ nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole . ”
[ efoods ]
That squares exactly with the goal of power mentioned years before by Rothschild .
Quigley then offered : “ This system was to be controlled in a feudalistic fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert , by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences . ”
Central banks of other nations would act “ in concert . ”
Did n’t the Fed rescue some European banks when the economic crisis hit ?
As for the “ secret agreements “ arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences , ” is n’t this what goes on at the Bilderberg conferences ; Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission meetings ; annual sessions in Davos , Switzerland ; and elsewhere ?
While no participant at these closed - door powwows is poor , the goal of the movements into which they have immersed themselves has always been power more than personal wealth .
John Birch Society founder Robert Welch knew well the true purpose of the Federal Reserve .
In a statement he wrote in 1972 , he scornfully dismissed the attitude held by some that the goal of the conspirators who foisted the Fed on America was simply money .
“ What all of these Insiders were after was not money but power , ” he insisted .
And he continued , “ They were even careful to plan the whole arrangement so that the bulk of any commercial profit made by the Federal Reserve would go to the federal government as a coverup for their nefarious intentions . ”
Congressman Ron Paul ( picture , above left ) has earned the thanks of all true Americans with his efforts to combat the Fed — not only to have it audited but also eventually to have it abolished .
His “ Audit the Fed ” proposal in the current Congress has been inserted into a measure calling for broad new financial regulatory powers .
Because he strongly disapproves of this addition to the federal government ’s meddling where it does n’t belong , he has indicated he wo n’t vote for the measure .
“ I will not vote for something that ’s a disaster because one or two or five percent of it is an improvement , ” he stated .
It may yet pass , and there may be some movement toward an audit .
But his calling attention to the power of the Fed , and his successful gathering of 317 cosponsors of his audit measure in the House , has already created a huge awakening about the Fed among millions of Americans .
All freedom - loving Americans should continue to alert fellow citizens about the power and overall purpose of the Fed so that it will soon be properly audited and eventually abolished .
Stressing that power is its goal , not money , should help to stimulate many to make this extremely important campaign succeed .

An outbreak of bitter recrimination has erupted among politicians and delegates following the drawing up of the Copenhagen accord for tackling climate change .
The deal , finally hammered out early yesterday , had been expected to commit countries to deep cuts in carbon emissions .
In the end , it fell short of this goal after China fought hard against strong US pressure to submit to a regime of international monitoring .
The Chinese prime minister , Wen Jiabao , walked out of the conference at one point , and sent a lowly protocol officer to negotiate with Barack Obama .
In the end , a draft agreement put forward by China – and backed by Brazil , India and African nations – commits the world to the broad ambition of preventing global temperatures from rising above 2C .
Crucially , however , it does not force any nation to make specific cuts .
" For the Chinese , this was our sovereignty and our national interest , " said Xie Zhenhua , head of China 's delegation .
Last night , some delegates were openly critical of China for its intransigence .
Asked by the Observer who was to blame for blocking the introduction of controlled emissions , the director general of the Swedish environment protection agency , Lars - Erik Liljelund , replied : " China .
China does n't like numbers . "
At the same time , others have criticised the Americans for pushing China too hard .
" President Obama 's speech blaming China did n't help , " says John Prescott , writing in today 's Observer .
The accord was formally recognised after a dramatic all - night plenary session , during which the Danish chairman was forced to step aside , a Venezuelan delegate cut her hand , and Britain 's climate and energy secretary , Ed Miliband , salvaged the deal just as it appeared on the verge of being rejected .
The tumultuous events concluded a fortnight of fraught and sometimes machiavellian negotiations that saw a resurgent China link forces with India , Brazil and African states to thwart efforts by rich nations to steamroller through a binding treaty that would suit their interests .
Although hailed by Obama , the deal has been condemned by activists and NGOs , while the European commission 's president , José Manuel Barroso , admitted he was disappointed after EU attempts to introduce long - term targets for reducing global emissions by 50 % by 2050 were blocked .
Last night Miliband was being credited with helping to rescue the summit from disaster .
He had been preparing to go to bed at 4 am , after the main accord had been agreed , only to be called by officials and warned that several countries were threatening to veto its signature .
Miliband returned to the conference centre in time to hear Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping comparing the proposed agreement to the Holocaust .
He said the deal " asked Africa to sign a suicide pact , an incineration pact , in order to maintain the economic dominance of a few countries " .
A furious Miliband intervened and dismissed Di-Aping 's claims as " disgusting " .
This was " a moment of profound crisis " , Miliband told delegates .
The proposed deal was by no means perfect , and would have many problems , he admitted .
" But it is a document that in substantive ways will make the lives of people around this planet better because it puts into effect fast - start finance of $ 30 bn ; it puts into effect a plan for $ 100bn of long - term public and private finance . "
The deal was then agreed by delegates .
The accord makes reference to the need to keep temperature rises to no more than 2C , and says rich countries will commit to cutting greenhouse gases , and developing nations will take steps to limit the growth of their emissions .
Countries will be able to set out their pledges for action in an appendix .
In addition , there are provisions for short - term finance of up to $ 10bn a year over three years to help poorer countries fight climate change , and a long - term funding package worth $ 100 bn a year by 2020 .
However , the original plan was for the Copenhagen talks to deliver a comprehensive , legally binding international deal to tackle climate change .
This has not materialised and last night leaders of NGOs united in condemning the limited nature of the deal .
" This accord is not legally binding , it 's a political statement , " said Nnimmo Bassey , chair of Friends of the Earth International .
" This is a disaster for the poor nations – the urgency of climate change was not really considered . "
Dame Barbara Stocking , Oxfam 's chief executive , agreed .
" World leaders in Copenhagen seem to have forgotten that they were not negotiating numbers , they were negotiating lives , " she said .
JPMorgan 's aggregate global manufacturing and services indicators both tell the same unfortunate story -- the global economic recovery slowed down in November .
JPMorgan : " The global economic recovery continued in November , but a growth pause in services hit the overall rate of expansion .
However , new business is still rising and this should support growth looking ahead .
In addition , official activity data continue to advance , suggesting the underlying recovery remains intact . "
Yet while both the global services and manufacturing indices are slightly above the 50 - level , which indicates continued expansion , it 's clear that the up - trend in the data has lost steam .
They also are n't far from suddenly dropping below 50 next month .
( Via JPMorgan , Growth of the economy slowed in November , 3 December 2009 )
Note that these global indices are built from manufacturing and services indices for countries around the world , such as from the ISM in the U.S. and from Markit for many other countries .
A deal is on the table that could make China happy ( Image : Attila Kisbenedek / AFP / Getty )
New Scientist has seen a leaked draft of the agreement that the 115 heads of state at the Copenhagen climate talks are expected to sign before they leave here tonight .
The document is circulating among Danish delegates .
It shows that the conference will end with a deal , including money and quantified cuts in greenhouse gas emissions .
It is a political statement and leaves it to negotiators to create the legal framework , including the final fate of the Kyoto Protocol .
The text suggests that China is on the verge of winning its war to keep its national target for slowing carbon dioxide emissions out of a formal international agreement .
The document says that such “ mitigation actions ” taken by developing countries “ will be subject to their domestic auditing , supervision and assessment ” .
It includes critical words that will settle the dispute between western governments and China to track developing countries ’ promises to cut the carbon intensity of its economy .
It formalises the promise of the rich world to pay developing countries $ 100 billion a year by 2020 to cope with climate change .
But although it does not yet include specific numbers for rich nations to cut their emissions , these appear in the text as “ x ” and “ y per cent ” .

But those countries will have to report back in detail every two years and will be expected to provide “ clarification on request ” .
This may meet the US demand for transparency about progress in meeting those commitments .
A further check proposed in the text is “ a review of this decision and its implementation in 2016 , including in light of the convention ’s ultimate objective ( sic ) ” .
This review clause offers the chance to formally challenge any developing countries not living up their promises .
It also means that if the science changes , countries can review whether they need tougher standards before the 2020 deadline .
Promises from poor world
China has promised to cut the carbon intensity of its economy by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020 ; India by 20 to 25 per cent and South Africa by 34 per cent .
Brazil has promised cuts of 40 per cent below “ business as usual ” economic development .
Others may follow .
The $ 100 - billion promise reflects statements by Hillary Clinton , US secretary of state , yesterday and by Gordon Brown , UK prime minister , earlier this year .
The United Nations has been suggesting that $ 200 billion might be necessary to help developing countries cut their emissions and adapt to climate change .
At the other extreme , Malaysia wants seven times more : $ 1.5 trillion dropped into the piggy bank each year .
According to the draft , the $ 100 billion will be augmented by $ 10 billion a year in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 .
“ The funding will come from a wide variety of sources , public and private , bilateral and multilateral , including alternative sources of finance ” – word for word the language used by Clinton in her press conference on Thursday .
The document affirms “ the scientific view that the increase in global temperatures ought not to exceed 2 °C ” .
But it does not acknowledge an official UN study leaked last night suggesting that current commitments are only sufficient to peg warming to 3 °C .

Cairo , Egypt ( CNN ) --
In a slightly musty gym in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis , three young women in head scarves are learning how to defend themselves .
Their teacher , a huge man in loose black trousers and a white tunic , is instructing them in the finer points of Aikido , a Japanese martial art .
The women , among them 21 - year - old Dawlat Sami , are learning to become " lady guards . "
That 's what Sami 's employer , Falcon , an Egyptian security company , calls its growing army of female bodyguards .
It is a profession that seems somewhat out of place in conservative Egypt .
" At first , my father objected , " Sami told CNN .
" But when he came with me and saw what we did , he changed his mind . "
When they 're not practicing Aikido or pumping iron under an old black - and - white poster of Arnold Schwarzenegger , the bodyguards get classroom instruction .
The emphasis is on staying alert , maintaining a professional demeanor , and not getting too cozy with clients .
In the last three years , Falcon , one of Egypt 's leading security companies , has trained more than 300 female body guards .
Demand for the service is growing , according to Falcon Managing Director , Sharif Khalid .
" In our society women do n't want to be searched or have their bags inspected by men , " Khalid told CNN .
Falcon 's clients include movie stars , foreign visitors and patrons Khalid refers to as " society women . "
Lady guards do not carry weapons .
They defend clients first through diplomatic means but , if all else fails , they can disable attackers .
Female body guard training emphasizes quick thinking above all .
" The body is n't so important , " said Khalid .
" What matters is that [ female body guards ] can pick out suspicious people and react quickly , because with security , if you delay just a moment , things can go very wrong . "
The women who join Falcon know , however , that the skills they learn may well come in handy outside of work .
" If I have any problems , or somebody bothers me , now I know how to defend myself , " Amani Mahmoud , another trainee female body guard told CNN .
Sexual harassment is a growing problem in Egypt .
According to a 2008 poll conducted by the Egyptian Center for Women 's Rights ( ECWR ) , 83 percent of Egyptian women and 98 percent of foreign female visitors polled have experienced sexually harassment .
Egypt has made some efforts to crack down on this problem :
Last year a court sentenced a man to three year in prison for groping a woman on the street .
But that was the exception .
For the most part , Egyptian police -- under paid and in many cases poorly educated -- shrug off complaints from women .
So , it should come as no surprise that some women are starting to take matters into their own hands : " It 's also about making a point , " trainee Randa Mohammad told CNN .
" People say women can't work as bodyguards , but I want to change that idea .
I want to show that women can defend themselves , and defend others , " said Mohammad .
Falcon is n't the first in the Middle East to come up with the idea of female bodyguards -- Libyan leader , Moammar Gadhafi has been using them for years .
Gadhafi often appears in public with a phalanx of hefty " Amazons , " who are armed and aggressive .
In fact , back in the 1980s , a Libyan body guard rifle - butted a CNN producer who got too close to Gadhafi .
Falcon 's lady guards , I 'm happy to report , were nothing but polite and courteous with this correspondent .
With the year almost over , it 's time to look back and wonder if 2009 actually left any wisdom for future generations behind in its whirlwind of franchise - maintenance , Obama - adoration * and dream - crushing .
Here are some potential morals from the last 12 months .

Get The Nostalgia While The Nostalgia Getting 's Good
The failure of Jennifer 's Body at the box office punctured the myth of Megan Fox , but in doing so left Transformers : Revenge Of The Fallen 's epic success even more inexplicable .
You mean that everyone who went to see that genuinely wanted to see giant robots fighting for the right to appear in a story that made sense instead of Megan Fox 's ass ?
Really ?
( To be fair , maybe it was John Tuturro 's ass they could n't resist . )
Of course not ; they wanted to relive memories of their childhood / the first Transformers movie / the Go-Bots by proxy .
Same reason that Star Trek was such a hit , and the dismal Terminator Salvation made money at all .
The problem with this for movie studios is that there 's only a limited number of things to be nostalgic about , and they 're burning through them quickly ( Next year 's Tron Legacy and The A - Team show that we 're already up to the mid-'80s ) ; when there 're already plans to reboot Battlestar Galactica as a movie franchise months after its conclusion as a ( rebooted ) television show and restarting the Fantastic Four movies from scratch just a few years after the failure of Rise Of The Silver Surfer , you can tell that there 's nervousness .
With good reason ; the lawsuit over the rights to Superman show that nostalgia could get more expensive for filmmakers in years to come .
Maybe one day , Disney 's $ 4 Billion buyout of Marvel Entertainment 's IP will look like a bargain .
Find A Voice With Something To Say , Then Let It Speak
2009 was a year of extremes when it came to the creation of movies and television that did n't ( entirely ) rely on IP graverobbing .
On the one hand , it was the year when the phrase " production hiatus " became widely known as code for " The Powers That Be do n't like what 's being done and are about to ' fix ' it " as the trains seemed to come off the usually - smoother - running TV production track more often , and more publicly , than usual ( See : Dollhouse , FlashForward and V , which has had two such hiatuses , and " coincidentally " switched showrunners twice , as well ) .
On the other , it was the year when smaller movies like District 9 and Moon garnered critical acclaim - and , in the case of D9 , a pretty amazing box office haul - for being individual , unusual and something other than generic production line blockbusters .
Avatar , too , is being hailed for being the singular vision of James Cameron and , maybe most importantly , that being a good thing .
Maybe this was the year that started a renaissance in an appreciation for the auteur theory after all ?

On Television , Burying The Lede Will Kill You
We 've said this more than once recently , but the fact that Dollhouse 's second season was promoted to critics with its lackluster first episode may have damaged the show 's chances irreparably .
You can't blame the promotions people , because it makes sense to sell something based on the product itself ; the " blame " lies with those making the show , who thought that they had the time and space to ramp up the season slowly , reiterating the central concept of the series with episodes that ( sadly ) repeated the rhythm of the first season .
As the creative teams behind V ( Put on hiatus after its first four episodes , and before we 'd even seen a complete lizard reveal and / or any rodent eating ) and the upcoming Day One ( Restructured from a full season to a four episode mini- series to test the waters for a regular show ) can attest to , there 's no time for a slow build on network television anymore .
Both Fringe and FlashForward sped up their timetables to try and meet demand for near - instant gratification , and both are still dogged with rumors of cancellation .
Remember , television people :
Put your best foot forward immediately .
Goodbyes Should Always Be Brief
Yes , yes : We loved Russell T Davies ' run on Doctor Who as much as anyone , but the year of special episodes seemed weighed down by a sense of its own self - importance that reached epic proportions during this weekend 's " The End of Time , Part One " ( On the plus side , Now we know that Barack Obama will save the world with his economic announcement or something .
Not that that 'll seem horribly dated , oh , anytime after February 2009 ) .
Battlestar Galactica , too , approached epic levels of pomp and pretension during its final days .
It 's not that we would rather have rushed either show offstage unfinished , but there 's something to be said for brevity and not getting too wrapped up in your own ego .
Lost , consider yourself on notice .

Just Because You Can Does n't Mean You Should
One word : Watchmen .
Yes , we get it ; we have the technology to make Doctor Manhattan look like he exists in a particularly shiny version of reality .
But , months after all the hype , hoopla and multiple versions on DVD , it 's still worth asking : Did Watchmen gain anything from the transition from comic to movie ?
Besides Zack Snyder 's bank account , did anything ?
Sometimes it 's okay to leave the original alone .
It is not just the model of consumerism that both parties are accepting – that 's a bit 1980s , after all – but the idea that there is something morally wrong with the state holding so much power over the lives of individuals .
The Conservatives have changed their language on this to distinguish it from the old Thatcherite approach : they do not wish to equate healthcare or school choices with buying a washing machine or booking a holiday villa .
They recognise that the ethical implications of distributing medical or educational services are qualitatively different from the purchase of more trivial things .
They are now making the case for choice in terms of political freedom , and the self - respect that comes with personal responsibility .

In the months after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , C.I.A. officials were not eager to embrace killing terrorists from afar with video - game controls , said one former intelligence official .
“ There was also a lot of reluctance at Langley to get into a lethal program like this , ” the official said .
But officers grew comfortable with the program as they checked off their hit list more than a dozen notorious figures , including Abu Khabab al - Masri , a Qaeda expert on explosives ; Rashid Rauf , accused of being the planner of the 2006 trans -Atlantic airliner plot ; and Baitullah Mehsud , leader of the Pakistani Taliban .
The drone warfare pioneered by the C.I.A. in Pakistan and the Air Force in Iraq and Afghanistan is the leading edge of a wave of push - button combat that will raise legal , moral and political questions around the world , said P. W. Singer , a scholar at the Brookings Institution and author of the book “ Wired for War . ”
Forty - four countries have unmanned aircraft for surveillance , Mr. Singer said .
So far , only the United States and Israel have used the planes for strikes , but that number will grow .
“ We ’re talking about a technology that ’s not going away , ” he said .
There is little doubt that “ warheads on foreheads , ” in the macho lingo of intelligence officers , have been disruptive to the militants in Pakistan , removing leaders and fighters , slowing movement and sowing dissension as survivors hunt for spies who may be tipping off the Americans .
Yet the drones are unpopular with many Pakistanis , who see them as a violation of their country ’s sovereignty  one reason the United States refuses to officially acknowledge the attacks .
A poll by Gallup Pakistan last summer found only 9 percent of Pakistanis in favor of the attacks and 67 percent against , with a majority ranking the United States as a greater threat to Pakistan than its archrival , India , or the Pakistani Taliban .
Interestingly , residents of the tribal areas where the attacks actually occur , who bitterly resent the militants ’ brutal rule , are far less critical of the drones , said Farhat Taj , an anthropologist with the Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy .
A study of 550 professional people living in the tribal areas was conducted late last year by the institute , a Pakistani research group .
About half of those interviewed called the drone strikes “ accurate , ” 6 in 10 said they damaged militant organizations , and almost as many denied they increased anti-Americanism .
Dr. Taj , who lived at the edge of the tribal areas until 2002 , said residents would prefer to be protected by the Pakistani Army .
“ But they feel powerless toward the militants and they see the drones as their liberator , ” she said .
MELBOURNE house prices could double to hit a median of $ 1 million in a decade , according to the Real Estate Institute of Victoria .
REIV chief executive Enzo Raimondo said population growth and a shortage of housing stock would make million - dollar homes the norm .
'' What we have seen in the last 20 years is the doubling of the median every 10 years , '' he said .
'' There has been such growth it would n't be unrealistic to see a median in Melbourne of around $ 1 million .
You have another million people moving into Melbourne in the next 10 years , which is going to put additional pressure on a fairly stretched marketplace . ''
Melbourne 's median house price , the midpoint between the highest and lowest sales , reached a record $ 480,000 in September .
And for the first time , there were 18 mostly eastern and bayside suburbs that recorded a median of $ 1 million or more .
A member of the Abu Dhabi ruling family accused of torturing an Afghan grain merchant may have been disoriented and impaired by drugs he used for health problems , his defense argued in court on Monday .
A video that came to light in May appears to show the defendant , Sheik Issa bin Zayed al - Nahyan , torturing the merchant with whips , cattle prods and a plank with a protruding nail , then driving over him with an S.U.V .
Sheik Issa , a half brother of the Emirati president , has pleaded not guilty .
A forensics expert testified Monday that he was taking a combination of dozens of drugs , including medicine for heart and back conditions .
Dining trends came and went in 2009 , but one seemed to practically define the year :
Chefs and owners completely , and totally , losing their cool .
Whether it be exploding at customers , telling off critics , or even graffiting their former restaurant spaces , in 2009 , New York restaurant industry personalities ponied up a seemingly endless supply of outbursts and hotheaded reactions to issues both big and small .
Here 's a rundown of the 10 Best Chef / Owner Freak Outs of 2009 .
10 ) Jim Lahey vs. Bruni :
When former Times critic Frank Bruni filed a onespot review of Jim Lahey 's pizza spot Co. , Lahey made it clear that he was n't pleased .
So like any responsible chef , he took to the pages of the Observer .
What resulted was an epic rant , covering everything from Bruni 's thoughts on their Bianca pie to being reviewed too early : " What the fuck are we being reviewed by the New York Times for , you know , 90 days into being open ?
It makes no sense . "
Plus , he did n't even want to be reviewed ( because , after all , that 's how the system works ) : " Otherwise , I would have made the food a lot differently .
I would have bought really nice plates and beautiful stemware . "
9 ) Ryan Skeen vs. New York City : Before Ryan Skeen took to Twitter ( certainly a major innovation in Chef Freak Outs this year ) to vent about his latest woes , he was already known as a talented chef with an unlucky track record .
A sure sign his latest gig at troubled LES spot Allen and Delancey was nearing an end , Skeen fired off a number of tweets about how much he disliked A&D and NYC in general : " Get me the fuck out of NYC I can't do it anymore I will always love this city but our industry here has become a fucking hollywood joke !!!!! "
The restaurant fired him the next week .
8 ) Agua Dulce vs. TONY : When TONY filed their admittedly harsh review of Pan - Latin newcomer Agua Dulce earlier this year , they slammed the place saying it was “ as inauthentic as it is spread geographically thin . ”
It was n't long before Agua Dulce chef Ulrich A. Sterling himself weighed in on the action , by sending a letter to TONY and other magazines , calling out the review 's alleged errors and inaccuracies .
After an exhausting rundown of all of the ways that the review misrepresented Ulrich 's restaurant , he noted " If anything else however , the only thing truly inauthentic , has to be this article . "
7 ) Mario Batali vs. The King and Queen of Spain :
One of the great originators of the chef outburst brought the artform to new heights of comedy , by completely losing his shit at a $ 1000 a head dinner honoring the King and Queen of Spain at the SOBE Wine and Food Fest .
In an attempt to quiet the crowd , Molto Mario screamed " All you weasel f*** wads in the back corners , can I have ten seconds of your time ? "
Mario continued to drop F - bombs in front of his rapt audience , later noting that Jose Andres has " The most motherf *** ing stars of any Spanish restaurant in the US . "
Soundbites from the freak out inspired a line of ringtones that became popular in Spain .
6 ) Posto vs. Jimmy Fallon .
Generally , restaurants love celebrity guests , but that was not the case with Posto and Jimmy Fallon .
As a part of a pizza round up for Grub Street , Fallon remarked of Posto 's sister restaurant Spunto , " I think they use a blow dryer on the cheese .
That would be the best Ritz cracker pizza .
I assume they have a place named Crusto . "
When Fallon tried to dine at Posto a few weeks later , he and his family were not only denied a table , but ceremoniously laughed out of the place by the staff , and banned for life at any of the group 's restaurants .
Thankfully , this freak out was broadcast in real time via Fallon 's twitter .
5 ) Daniel Boulud vs. Adam Platt :
Even some of the world 's most esteemed chefs lose their cool every once in a while , and Daniel Boulud is no exception .
After receiving a disappointing one out of five star review for DBGB 's from New York Magazine critic Adam Platt , Boulud referred to Platt as " miserable " and " a bitch " .
Sam Sifton was smart enough to give D - Biggity a deuce when it was his turn .
4 ) Isabella 's Oven vs. Their Landlord :
At least one great freak out of 2009 incorporated actual implements of destruction .
When the chef / owners of LES pizza spot Isabella 's
Oven were evicted and forced to close up shop , they left a parting gift for the landlords in the form of taking to the walls , pipes , and fixtures of the space with sledgehammers and spraying offensive and derogatory graffiti wherever they could .
More than just your average freak out , this particular case of batshit craziness also paid homage to the LES ' gritty past .
3 ) Paradou vs. Their Staff : Vadim Ponorovsky , owner of MePa restaurant Paradou revealed a few things in an email to his employees obtained by Gawker .
Most importantly , dude likes to curse : " GET THE FUCK OUT YOU FUCKING LAZY DISRESPECTFUL ASSHOLES !!!!! "
What could have warranted such a tirade ?
Servers were n't collecting enough customer email addresses !
Lashing out on the media is one thing , but subjecting your own employees to this type of stuff on a regular basis takes a different breed .
2 ) JoeDoe vs. The Blogosphere : Joe Dobias , owner of East Village restaurant JoeDoe , graced the world with two major flare ups in as many years .
Last year , he did n't take kindly to a few of the comments about his restaurant in this Eaters Journal piece , banning the Eater staff .
Well , things must be quiet over at JoeDoe , because the outspoken chef hit the internet again , this time targeting small review blog NY Journal with a string of comments : " Stop your malicious bullshit and stop this site !
YOU ARE NOT A FOOD WRITER AND WILL NEVER BE YOU NASTY LITTLE MAN !!... It is 9:30 am time to cook brunch hopefully not for some nasty little bald men like you . "
1 ) Neil Ganic and Lobster vs. Unsuspecting Patrons :
In what is certainly one of the most bizarre entries on the list , we have lobster toting chef Neil Ganic of Petite Crevette .
As detailed in a call to the Eater Complaints Department , Ganic did n't take kindly to a pair of diners sending back their lobster because they felt it was n't cooked properly .
He came out of the kitchen with a live lobster , threw it on the table and shouted " You think my fish is not fresh ?
Look how fresh this is ! "
Classic meltdown .

He said that he would outline his Afghanistan strategy after Thanksgiving , adding , “ I feel very confident that when the American people hear a clear rationale for what we ’re doing there and how we intend to achieve our goals , that they will be supportive . ”
Though he and his advisers have drawn up benchmarks to measure progress and put pressure on the Afghan government to do its part , Mr. Obama offered no details in his public remarks on Tuesday .
He was also silent on precisely what would constitute finishing the job in Afghanistan or how soon he envisioned being able to begin extricating the United States from the war there .
While the troop levels he orders will go a long way toward defining his position , the White House has stressed that Mr. Obama ’s review has gone far beyond the numbers to better define the military and civilian - aid components of the effort in Afghanistan , how they fit into efforts to combat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and how to ensure that the American commitment in the region is not open - ended .
At the meeting on Monday night , Mr. Obama went around the table in the White House Situation Room asking his senior advisers for summations of their individual assessments and to voice any concerns they still had , said an administration official who was briefed on the two - hour meeting .
“ There was a lot of back and forth , ” said the official , with Mr. Obama interjecting questions and top aides cutting each other off at times .
When the meeting finished shortly after 10 p.m. , some of the senior advisers lingered in small groups to continue their discussions , said the official , who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the meeting ’s confidentiality .
Buffett called Berkshire 's acquisition of Burlington Northern an " all - in wager " on the United States .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway said Tuesday it will buy railroad operator Burlington Northern Santa Fe for $ 44 billion .
Berkshire ( BRKA , Fortune 500 ) , which already has major stake in Burlington Northern , said it would acquire the remaining 77.4 % of the company in a cash - and - stock offer worth $ 100 per share .
Widely regarded as both one of the world 's richest men and the investment community 's more brilliant minds , Buffett called his firm 's investment an " all - in wager on the economic future of the United States . "
" Our country 's future prosperity depends on its having an efficient and well - maintained rail system , " Buffett said in a statement .
Burlington Northern ( BNI , Fortune 500 ) shares soared 28 % in morning trading on the news .
Separately , Berkshire said it was announcing a 50 - for - 1 split of its Class B common stock .
The majority of stock issued by the company in its purchase of Burlington Northern will be its pricier Class A shares , the company said .
The deal , which would rank as the largest acquisition in Berkshire Hathaway 's history , would also include $ 10 billion of Burlington Northern debt .
It would also expand the already massive portfolio of companies Berkshire already owns .
Brand - name businesses such as auto insurer Geico , See 's Candy and Fruit of the Loom are all subsidiaries of the Omaha , Neb . - based firm .
Matthew Rose , Burlington Northern 's chairman and CEO , said the sale of the Fort Worth , Texas - based firm was a " strategic fit " for both the company 's customers and employees , during a conference call with investors Tuesday .
No management changes are expected at Burlington Northern as a result of the deal , which is expected to close sometime in early 2010 .
Berkshire 's purchase , of course , will require the approval of shareholders and will have to undergo regulatory review by the Justice Department .
Recently , AT&T has been vocally combating Verizon 's ad campaign by using semantics and Luke Wilson to paint their competitor 's 3G network as inferior .
Now , Ralph de la Vega , chief executive of AT&T Mobility , is taking on a new opponent : customers .
De la Vega has come out to candidly admit that wireless coverage in Manhattan and San Francisco is , as most customers already know , subpar ( but , they 're working on it ) .
However , while discussing efforts to improve the AT&T experience in those cities , de la Vega also insinuated that the carrier could start treating some customers differently , with different pricing plans that financially reward or penalize based on data usage .
The Wall Street Journal is reporting that heavy smartphone users only represent about 3 percent of the customer base , but their mobile activities are accounting for 40 percent of data traffic .
That imbalance is disconcerting to AT&T , and they 're going to do everything in their power — reportedly inline with net - neutrality and FCC regulations — to , as de la Vega says , " keep those subscribers from hampering the experience for everyone else . "
So what will AT&T do to curtail their users ?
Apparently de la Vega is considering offering these data hogs ( i.e. me ) incentives to alter their mobile consumption rates .
The incentives sound more like a warning :
" Many customers do n’t know how much bandwidth they ’re consuming , Mr. de la Vega added .
When AT&T conducted a broadband test , customers often reduced their data use .
Longer - term , he said , a pricing scheme based on usage is likely , though it will be determined by industry competition and regulatory guidelines . "
Although the details are vague , we can't imagine iPhone owners , who are the most likely culprits here , will be keen on de la Vega 's " incentives . "

" It 's a financial scheme that does n't actually cost the employees anything except , some say , their trust . "
And this :
" Nobody 's really being hurt , but it 's so clearly creepy .
So how do you get at what really is wrong with this ? "
Rep .
Gene Green tries to give her a progressive answer , but what he comes up with is weak and does n't make a whole lot of sense :
" We hope our laws are based on not only fairness but morals , and to me , it 's immoral to benefit from your death if I do n't know you . "
Um , people benefit all the time in all sorts of ways from the deaths of people they do n't know .
The problem is n't that .
The problem is that it's A CORPORATE TAX DODGE !
Erin Weir at the Canadian economics blog Progressive Economics Forum explains it well :
For example , on corporate - owned life insurance , Moore notes that one cannot take out fire insurance on a neighbour ’s house because doing so would provide a financial incentive to burn the house down .
The apparent implication is that companies may be killing off their workers to collect insurance payouts .
There is no evidence of such skullduggery , or at least Moore does not present any .
The real issue , which Capitalism fails to mention , is that corporations can use such insurance policies to avoid paying taxes .
Whereas interest on money borrowed to pay premiums is tax - deductible , the resulting insurance payouts are tax - exempt .
" Dead peasant " insurance is not a new and sinister corporate scheme to profit from death , but an old and sinister corporate scheme to drain the public treasury .
They avoid paying taxes on money used to pay the premiums , and the benefits are tax - free .
So , yes , it does cost the employees , and yes , everyone is being hurt by it .
How ?
There are millions of such policies involving billions of dollars that are protected from taxation for no earthly reason than insurance industry clout with lawmakers .
Taxes are what fund the social safety net .
If you do n't collect them you never have enough for those little extras like universal health coverage for all your citizens .
Claiming he ’s " misunderstood , " Jon Gosselin of the blockbuster reality series " Jon & Kate Plus 8 " has been seeking spiritual guidance from fellow TLC star Rabbi Shmuley Boteach to repair his relationships and reputation .
" [ Jon ’s ] a man with a good heart who sincerely wants to correct … mistakes he 's made , " says the Rabbi , who is counseling Gosselin , 32 , to stop dating 22 - year - old Hailey Glassman .
But does this exercise deserve to be taken seriously ?
( Watch Rabbi Shmuley Boteach call on Jon Gosselin at a panel )
This is about narcissism , not religion : Boteach is a " snake - oil salesman , and a publicity whore . "
In fact , " both of them " might be , says Foster Kamer at Gawker .
" I 'm not sure which behavior here begets the other , but whatever it is , wherever it comes from , this can't be good for The Kids , The Jews [ or ] Anybody Who's Ever Devoted Faith To Anything . "
" John Gosselin 's public shot at forgiveness with celebrity - obsessed Rabbi Shmuley "
If it ’s for real , this consultation should n’t be happening in public :
If the goal is to wean Jon Gosselin from his reckless addiction to fame , asks Vicki Hyman in the Newark Star - Ledger , " maybe [ Boteach ] should have continued Gosselin 's counseling in private as opposed to this public gawkfest ? "
" Jon Gosselin schmoozes with rabbi "
Let ’s give him the benefit of the doubt : " Maybe it 's just the Halloween vibe or something , " says Maria Gonzalez at BuddyTV , " but it sounds as though Jon Gosselin is serious about finding his inner peace . "
" Kate Plus 8 : Jon Gosselin turns spiritual , apologizes to public "
Apparently , there ’s a global oil scam making Bernie Madoff look like a petty thief .
If serial entrepreneur and Seeking Alpha columnist Philip Davis is to be believed , the world is being scammed out of $ 2.5 trillion , 50 times greater than the sum Madoff took from the duped investors .
According to Davis , the scam starts in 2000 with the formation of the ICE – the Intercontinental Exchange .
The ICE – founded by Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , BP , Total , Shell , Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale – is an online commodities and futures marketplace that exists outside the US and operates free from the constraints of US laws .
After a Congressional investigation into energy trading in 2003 , the ICE was found to be facilitating “ round - trip ” trades .
This is where one firm sells energy to another , and then the second firm sells the same amount of energy back to the first company , at the same time and at the exact same price , as told by Davis .
No commodity ever changes hands
Quite shockingly no commodity ever changes hands , but the transactions still send a signal to the market , artificially boosting company revenue .
Angry yet ?
There ’s more .
Because the trading is unregulated by Washington , its difficult to gauge the scale on which “ round - trip ” trading takes place .
But when DMS Energy were investigated by Congress , the company admitted that 80 percent of its trades in 2001 were round - trip trades .
This means 80 percent of all trades in that year were false trades .
Not a drop of oil changed hands , but the balance sheets showed increased revenue .
The idea is to hike up commodity prices .
For example , according to Davis , after the ICE turned commodity trading into a “ speculative casino game where pricing was notional and contracts could be sold by people who never produced a thing , to people who did n’t need the things that were not produced ” , Goldman Sachs were able to triple the price of commodities in just five years .
ICE can create artificial shortages and drive speculative demand
The beauty ( or rather the horror ) of the scam outlined by Davis is that because they control the oil markets , the ICE can create artificial shortages and drive speculative demand in order to charge consumers an extra dollar per gallon of gas .
And whereas this may not seem like much , this $ 1 soon becomes $ 50 billion A MONTH as global drivers consume 1.7 billion gallons of gas every single day .
Whereas , at this stage , it would not be accurate or indeed wise to suggest what Philip Davis claims is either true or false , one cannot ignore the issue .
There have been concerns for many years that global markets are controlled by a monopoly of mega-organizations , but there could be a strong case for suggesting the ICE is close to becoming just that – a super - organization with the power to push oil prices up or down .
Good luck Washington , you might just be getting a deluge of mail demanding answers .

Responding Australia 's refusal to classify upcoming shooter Aliens vs. Predator , developer Rebellion says it will not cut violent content for " territories where adults are not considered by their governments to be able to make their own entertainment choices . "
Ouch .

The refusal to classify Aliens vs. Predator in Australia is effectively a ban , as the country will not allow the sale of a game that does n't fall under its maximum allowed game rating of MA15 + , and Rebellion agrees that its game does n't qualify for that rating .
The following is from a statement issued by the developer .
" Rebellion is disappointed that its upcoming title Aliens vs. Predator has been banned in Australia .
However , as we understand the law in that country the authorities had no choice as we agree strongly that our game is not suitable for game players who are not adults . "

Rebellion 's problem is the same that many Australian games and gamers are forced to deal with - the fact that while films can carry R18 + and X18 + ratings , labeling them as adults only , video games can not .
This has caused many developers over the years to modify titles , including Bethesda , which altered the drug references in Fallout 3 to suit Australian censors .
Rebellion , true to its name , refuses to make changes .
" The content of AVP is based on some of the most innovative and iconic horror movies , and as such we wanted to create a title that was true to the source material .
It is for adults , and it is bloody and frightening , that was our intent .
We will not be releasing a sanitised or cut down version for territories where adults are not considered by their governments to be able to make their own entertainment choices . "

President Obama criticized China for blocking its citizens from using Twitter and Facebook , saying , " I'm a big supporter of non-censorship . "
But few Chinese heard the remarks , which Obama made at a town - hall - style meeting Monday in Shanghai .
Chinese censors blocked Obama 's comments online , and only one local TV station aired them .
Will censors prevent Obama from reaching the people of China on his first visit to their country ?
( Watch Obama field a question about Twitter and China 's " firewall " )
China blocked out Obama 's charm : China 's censorship has made it hard for President Obama " to bring his trademark charisma to bear , " say Ian Johnson and Jonathan Weisman in The Wall Street Journal .
The town - hall meeting was a " tightly scripted affair , " and Obama 's televised remarks after his Tuesday meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao will be his only chance to address the public directly .
" The net effect is that the trip , which is n't expected to yield major substantive agreements , is n't likely to give Mr. Obama much of a symbolic victory either . "
" Beijing limits Obama 's exposure "
Obama did what he could : Give President Obama credit , says Robert Mackey in The New York Times .
Sure , many people in China were n't able to see him take on China 's Twitter ban .
But he at least tried to " push at the boundaries of the Chinese system of state censorship of the Internet . "
China Digital Times , which monitors the Chinese Web from the U.S. , " reported that some Chinese bloggers saluted " Obama for bringing up an issue that , in the words of one Twitter user , " only a foreign leader can discuss . "
" Obama walks China ’s ‘ Great Firewall ’ "
China won the battle but will lose the war : China can block Twitter -- and President Obama 's remarks -- in the short term , says Isaac Mao in Britain 's Guardian .
But the Beijing government will learn that containing the Chinese blogosphere is n't as easy as locking up dissidents .
" The booming Internet can not be controlled for much longer . "

Alert : Egypt – Two MB students remain in detention despite court ’s decision
The Islamic Human Rights Commission ( IHRC ) has received reports about two students from the Muslim Brotherhood ( MB ) who were arrested by the security forces on the 4th of November 2009 .
They were charged with assaulting a University Guard , which they deny .
On the 5th November 2009 they were sent to Al - Mansoura Police Department , but a release order from the court was issued two days later .
However , the State Security Prosecution disregarded the court decision and a new arrest warrant was issued on 9th November 2009 .
Thereupon they were immediately transferred to Wadi - Al - Natron prison .
There has been no further review by the State Security Prosecution .
The students are : 20 year old Khaled Abdel Wahhab Mohamed Ali-El - Din from Abu Ali in Gharbeya governorate and 21 year old Abdel Fattah Othman Omar Zaher from Sandoub - Daqahleya governorate , both of whom are students at Al Azhar University .
The students were believed to be arrested due to their political activities on behalf of the Muslim Brotherhood .

There is definitely an art to writing scripts that do n’t suck .
It is n’t enough to just get the job done .
It ’s everything to make your script do the right thing , with messages , with errors , and over time ( like years from when it was written ) .
1. Always use absolute paths for everything .
You cannot assume what your environment will be .
You can’t .
If your script executes via cron it ’s likely it wo n’t have any of the environment variables you depend on .
Including PATH .
Or HOME .
The working directory will probably not be what you expect , either , so do n’t write to files in the directory you ’re in without thinking about it .
Especially if you ’re running as root .
You ’ll actually have permission to write files as root , and all you ’ll do is clutter up some filesystem and make me go looking for the problem later .
Usually when a developer complains to me that their script is n’t writing output a simple search ( find or locate ) will show their output in some completely unexpected location .
Like the root filesystem .
Oops .
2 . Fix the environment in the script , not the default environment .
Think of OS defaults as an electronic Switzerland .
There are so many competing interests that an OS has to satisfy that the defaults are generic and neutral .
If your script needs environment variables , like database settings ( ORACLE_HOME ) , put them in your script .
Do n’t ask your sysadmin to change the system defaults .
The reason I hate changing defaults is mainly because it ’s inevitable that another script , running on the same machine , will want different defaults .
Besides , if you want the defaults changed you ’re probably making assumptions in the script , and I do n’t like that .
3 . If you do n’t want to hard - code , use a configuration file .
You have four scripts that need to have the same environment ?
The same variables ?
Use a configuration file and read it in at the beginning of each .
This also gives you a chance to do cool things , like detecting the host you ’re running on ( / bin/hostname ) and setting the variables properly for development , test , or production .
That ’ll make moving between environments easier .
While you ’re at it , name the configuration files , and the variables inside , intelligently .
Names like “ config ” and “ config.pl ” work nicely .
Names like “ appwebprd ” are slightly more confusing .
4. Write errors to syslog .
The UNIX gods gave us a system logging service .
It has its problems but it is well understood , and the logs it writes are usually rotated and handled properly by default .
Many monitoring systems also watch the system ’s log files , like / var / log / messages , and so things you send there will get handled .
Check out the ‘ logger ’ command if you want to do this from a shell script .
5 . Write nothing to stdout or stderr unless you are debugging .
I do n’t want to see the output of your script on the console of my server .
Why ?
Because when I ’m trying to work at the console of the server ( fixing a problem ) your script will write all over my terminal session .
Icky !
If I am not there then nobody sees the output .
What good is that ?
This also goes for programs you call in your script .
Do n’t let them write crap to stdout or stderr , either .
6 . Do n’t do error handling in loops .
Do n’t send error email from inside a loop .
Do n’t write to syslog from inside a loop .
Set a flag for the error and handle it once , at the end .
If you want to do things differently while you ’re developing , fine , but in production your error loops will fill mail spools and logs when something goes wrong .
When that happens I suddenly have three or four problems , not just one .
7 . Have a debug mode that is not the standard operating mode of your script .
I ’m not talking about for your development environment , either .
In production , if your script is malfunctioning , I ’d like to be able to run it in debug mode and get useful output to see where the problem lies .
8 . Throw useful errors when you choose to .
Filesystem full ?
Permission problem ?
Tell me where you were writing so I can fix it .
Ca n’t connect to something ?
Tell me what it is you ’re connecting to , hostname or IP and port .
Installation scripts are notorious for useless filesystem errors .
I also noticed that Red Hat ’s up2date script gives you information like “ Requires 200 MB additional space ” without telling you where it needs it .
It ’s only experience that tells me that it ’s complaining about / var / spool , and a less experienced admin is n’t going to know that .
9 . Become a daemon properly .
If your script is meant to run in the background , the “ production ” mode of the script should just put itself fully in the background , also known as “ daemon ” mode .
Scripts that need to be explicitly backgrounded need more care and feeding , and if you do the right thing and add the few lines of code to become a daemon you score points with your admins .
This is also an opportunity for doing interesting things for debugging .
Add a “ foreground ” mode that also turns on debugging , and you ’ve dealt with two problems at once .
10 . Write a PID file .
It ’s so nice to be able to “ kill `cat / var / run / yourprogram. pid` ” than it is to cobble some killall or pkill command together .
This should also serve as your lock file , so that two copies of the program do n’t run at the same time unless you mean them to .
This also means it should delete the lock file when the script dies , so you ’ll have to add a little bit of signal handling code .
There are countless examples of this out there , all findable with Google .
11 . Create temporary files in / tmp .
Many OSes have programs that clean / tmp automatically , so if your script leaves stuff lying around in / tmp the stuff will get cleaned up .
Besides , that ’s what /tmp is for .
You might want to make this a variable in your configuration file , just so it ’s easy to change someday .
12 . Make a unique temporary file every time .
What if two copies of the program start ?
What if the file does n’t get deleted properly ?
Use a function like mktemp ( ) or program like / bin / mktemp .
13 . Absolutely know what happens if a variable is empty .
This is especially important if you are deleting things .
What happens if mktemp fails and all you have is an empty variable ?
I was n’t thinking and wrote something like this recently :
$ TEMPDIR = `/bin/mktemp -d`
…
rm -f $ TEMPDIR /*
rmdir $ TEMPDIR
Yeah … mktemp failed and my rm statement became “ rm -f /* ” .
Great .
And it was all because I was paranoid of using “ rm - rf ” in a script .
14 .
Do the right thing at system shutdown , and do n’t require special shutdown procedures .
I alluded to this in # 10 with the PID file cleanup .
I absolutely hate rc.shutdown scripts because inevitably the script fails and then the system wo n’t shut down when I need it to .
I also hate adding things to the rc.d directories because it ’s one more thing to deal with .
Generally I put scripts that need to start at boot in rc.local , and then let them die at system shutdown .
This means that if you ’re a script and I ’m your admin you need to catch a TERM signal , at least , and quickly do whatever you need to do before you die .
What am I missing here ?
Anything ?
These are all the annoyances I can recall from the past month or so , but maybe the developers I support have a limited repertoire of shenanigans to pull . :-)

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A very large , 30 - year study of just about everyone in Scandinavia shows no link between cellphone use and brain tumors , researchers reported on Thursday .
Even though mobile telephone use soared in the 1990s and afterward , brain tumors did not become any more common during this time , the researchers reported in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .
Some activist groups and a few researchers have raised concerns about a link between cellphones and several kinds of cancer , including brain tumors , although years of research have failed to establish a connection .
“ We did not detect any clear change in the long - term time trends in the incidence of brain tumors from 1998 to 2003 in any subgroup , ” Isabelle Deltour of the Danish Cancer Society and colleagues wrote .
Deltour ’s team analyzed annual incidence rates of two types of brain tumor -- glioma and meningioma -- among adults aged 20 to 79 from Denmark , Finland , Norway , and Sweden from 1974 to 2003 .
These countries all have good cancer registries that keep a tally of known cancer cases .
This represented virtually the entire adult population of 16 million people , they said .
Over the 30 years , nearly 60,000 patients were diagnosed with brain tumors .
“ In Denmark , Finland , Norway , and Sweden , the use of mobile phones increased sharply in the mid-1990s ; thus , time trends in brain tumor incidence after 1998 may provide information about possible tumor risks associated with mobile phone use , ” the researchers wrote .
They did see a small , steady increase in brain tumors , but it started in 1974 , long before cellphones existed .
NO SIGNIFICANT PATTERN
“ From 1974 to 2003 , the incidence rate of glioma increased by 0.5 percent per year among men and by 0.2 percent per year among women , ” they wrote .
Incidence of meningioma tumors rose by 0.8 percent a year among men , and rose by 3.8 percent a year among women starting in the mid-1990s .
But this was mostly among women over the age of 60 , who were already among those most likely to have brain tumors , they noted .
In addition , it became easier to diagnose these tumors because of better types of brain scans .
Overall , there was no significant pattern , they said .
“ No change in incidence trends were observed from 1998 to 2003 , ” they added .
That would have been when tumors would start showing up , assuming it took five to 10 years for one to develop , they said .
It is possible , Deltour ’s team wrote , that it takes longer than 10 years for tumors caused by mobile phones to turn up , that the tumors are too rare in this group to show a useful trend , or that there are trends but in subgroups too small to be measured in the study .
It is just as possible that cellphones do not cause brain tumors , they added .
Most scientific studies show no association between cellphone use and brain tumors and researchers trying to find a connection have failed to find any biological explanation for how a mobile phone might cause cancer .
“ Because of the high prevalence of mobile phone exposure in this population and worldwide , longer follow - up of time trends in brain tumor incidence rates are warranted , ” Deltour ’s team advised .

I will now share with you a small section of the Monty Program AB 's submission to the EU Commission , including its suggestion to replace the GPL with a more proprietary - friendly license , specifically the Apache license .
I mentioned it in my first article on the Oracle / Sun deal , telling you that the submission [ PDF ] they made public was n't the only one :
But that is n't the only submission they have made .
They suggested to the EU Commission in a questionnaire submitted by an August 13th deadline that the license on MySQL be changed to the Apache License .
It was sent to me , along with others in the press , to educate us on the issues .
It seems some in the media contacted Florian Mueller , and he apparently denied the accuracy of what I wrote .
So let me show you just this one piece of the document I was describing , and I 'll let you decide for yourself , from page 19 :
We would like to draw attention to the fact that some major concerns about the effects of the proposed transaction could be somewhat alleviated by requiring that all versions of MySQL source code previously released under the GPL v2 license ... must be released under a more liberal open source license that is usable also by the OEM users and would also create an opportunity for other service vendors to compete with offerings comparable to MySQL Enterprise .
A good candidate is the Apache Software License .
So .
Did I tell you the truth or not ?
The document that they made public is a narrative .
But the EU Commission also has a number of questions they posed in a questionnaire .
The document I was referencing is titled " COMP / M.5529 -- ORACLE /SUN , Questionnaire to Competitors Databases , Deadline for reply : 13 August 2009 . "
It begins with a Preliminary Note :
We are providing this questionnaire accompanied by another document named " COMP M 5529 Req to protect disruptive innovation.pdf " , hereinafter referred to as the " supplementary document " for referencing purposes .
The replies in this document are self - sufficient , but select references to the supplementary document point to more detailed and coherent information on certain topics .
So , this document is the real one , the main submission , and the document they have shared with the public , " COMP M 5529 Req to protect disruptive innovation.pdf " , is the supplementary document , amplifying and providing a more detailed narrative .
As I mentioned , some in the media were given both documents .
I was .
And Florian tells me that he knew it was being given to me .
On the first page , they describe what Monty Program AB does , namely provide support for MySQL and develop features for their fork of MySQL that are not found in MySQL itself , and here is their hope for the future : Michael Widenius is the founder of the Open Database Alliance , through which we plan to establish a market around MariaDB / MySQL for support , training , tuning , optimization and customization of databases , database tools and also development of software that utilizes databases .
Our vision is to get hundreds of small and medium - sized companies to join , which would provide a lot of work opportunities and also help to keep up the infrastructure around MySQL .
The extent to which these plans can materialize will heavily depend on the future of MySQL itself .
So that is why they care .
They have big plans for a business around MySQL , and they want to make some money from it .
MariaDB is their fork of MySQL .
Of course , there 's nothing wrong with making money .
Notice the role of the Open Database Alliance in all this , in case anyone tells you there is no connection .
There is .
So , what stands in their way ?
In their mind , the GPL .
They scorn the idea of a community project of GPL'd code and view Linux 's commercial success , despite it being GPL code , as an aberration .
What did they tell the EU Commission about licenses , then , and how to make money from FOSS ?
That the two most successful open source business models are dual licensing , like MySQL , or open core , as in EnterpriseDB , the core of the code being open source , but with proprietary modules , and that is what they want to turn MySQL into : Outside of the business of Linux distributions ( aggregation of thousands of software packages into a single supported product ) , dual licensing has historically been the most successful business model for Open Source companies , and was largely popularized by MySQL .
It combines most benefits of open source with a traditional licensing revenue .
The main advantage of licensing revenue is that unlike many other Open Source business models , it is not strongly dependent on the company 's headcount or other factors driving up fixed costs , unlike service - based models such as consulting , support and contract engineering .
Even so , there have been many other successful open source business models that do not use this approach .
A comparably successful model ( used in particular by IBM for Java middleware , EnterpriseDB for databases ) is known as open - core , which combines closed source modules with the open source core software .
This business model is possible with open source licenses like Apache or BSD , but not on the basis of the GPL , which is presently used for MySQL ....
That 's on page 16 .
Then on page 19 , when asked to provide any other comments on the proposed Oracle / Sun deal , they wrote this , the actual suggestion of the change , and here it is in full and in context :
We would like to draw attention to the fact that some major concerns about the effects of the proposed transaction could be somewhat alleviated by requiring that all versions of MySQL source code previously released under the GPLv2 license ( whether in a General Availability , Release Candidate , Beta , Alpha release , or as public bazaar or bitkeeper revision control trees ) must be released under a more liberal open source license that is usable also by the OEM users and would also create an opportuity for other service vendors to compete with offerings comparable to MySQL Enterprise .
A good candidate is the Apache Software License .
We believe this could be a FOSS - specific approach to addressing the ownership of some of the key assets involved , as an alternative to conventional conditions imposed on such transactions .
Section 5.5 of the supplementary document discusses this possible measure .
So there you have it .
They absolutely did suggest that the license should be changed from the GPL to another license , suggesting the Apache license as the best candidate .
In fact , they used the word " must " .
Even the public submission included this :
The " copyleft / infection " principle of the GPL license represents a particular obstacle not only to revenue generation by the fork vendor but also to the overall adoption and market penetration of MySQL , MySQL forks and MySQL storage engines ....
Under such open source licenses as the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) license and the Apache license , proprietary derivatives are legal .
The only obligation might be attribution .
So , they view the GPL as a hindrance to their business opportunities .
They argue that some large vendor must take MySQL over , but not Oracle .
I wonder who they have in mind ?
SAP maybe ?
Is SAP a member of the Linux Foundation or OIN ?
Does it have any FOSS credibility at all ?
Who would be better ?
Some other Microsoft partner ?
Seriously .
Who ?
They should have to tell us , I think , who they would view as a " suitable " purchaser .
Otherwise , some of us , like me , will probably assume they have an agenda that is n't so FOSS friendly and this entire episode is just another attempt to strangle the GPL and kill off MySQL as a competition threat to Microsoft .
I already do view it that way , actually .
I view this not as an effort to protect MySQL , but to take it proprietary by getting rid of the barrier to the theft of the code , the GPL .
By the way , I have two questions .
First , on what basis would anyone have the right to deny Oracle the dual - licensing business model if it pays for the MySQL copyrights ?
All prior owners had that exclusive right .
MySQL , when it owned all the copyrights , was the only one allowed to do a proprietary version .
Sun , after it purchased MySQL , then had that same right .
Why should n't Oracle have a similar right if it pays millions for the copyrights , and why does it suddenly become a danger , dual licensing ?
And what is the difference ?
That Monty Program AB has plans for a competing business ?
Let them pay for all the copyrights then .
That 's how it works .
And whoever does that gets the right to sell certain pluses that you do n't get for free .
Second , has anybody mentioned the MySQL FOSS Exception to the EU Commission ?
If folks are going to talk about interoperability issues with the GPL , I think they should at least point out that the exception allows " distribution of certain MySQL Client Libraries with a developers FOSS applications licensed under the terms of another FOSS license listed below , even though such other FOSS license may be incompatible with the GPL . "
In other words , it " permits use of the GPL - licensed MySQL Client Libraries with software applications licensed under certain other FOSS licenses without causing the entire derivative work to be subject to the GPL . "

There are some limitations ( " The FOSS License Exception does not apply to the MySQL database server ... " ) , but it 's really quite flexible otherwise .
The only thing you can't do , if I 've understood the language ( " You distribute Independent Works in object code or executable form with the complete corresponding machine - readable source code on the same medium and under the same FOSS license applying to the object code or executable forms " ) , is refuse to provide source , under the exception .
And that 's what proprietary folks hate .
They want the GPL'd code , but they do n't want to abide by the license terms .
They only like the Apache and BSD licenses because they can take the code dark .
Even when you fudge things and allow other Open Source licenses in derivative works without triggering the GPL 's requirements to make your code GPL too , as MySQL did , they are still not satisfied .
So , that should tell us what this Monty opposition is about .
I do n't view it as protecting Open Source .
Clearly it 's not about protecting the GPL 'd version of MySQL .
Let 's be clear about that .
It has to do with making money from Open Source code , but by forcing it to go proprietary , open core , in effect .
A cunning plan , to use the EU Commission to accomplish such a goal .
That 's their dream , as I see it .
Is it yours ?
It surely is n't mine .
Update : Reuters reports that Microsoft and SAP and Monty Widenius will be at the meeting on the 10th at the EU Commission , and not a single customer .
Oracle has eight customers committed to being there to support Oracle 's position .
Eben Moglen will also participate .
Spend some time to catch up on what ’s been happening in Haskell this year .
In this edition of the Web News , we look back on the major Haskell news of 2009 .
You can also read this edition in PDF form .
The Haskell Web News brings you what ’s been happening with the Haskell programming language as voted by readers of The Haskell Reddit .
Community
Haskell 2010 : A major event in 2009 was the release of the Haskell 2010 standard — the first official revision to the language since Haskell ’ 98 , and the first result of the Haskell Prime process .
The new language standard will form the core of a rolling language upgrade in coming years .
The New Logo : Along with the new language standard came a new logo for Haskell – again , the first since Fritz Ruehr ’s proposal back in the day .
To produce the logo , a community competition was launched , and via anonymous condorcet voting from - cafe@ members , a winner was chosen !
Hackathons go global :
For the past 3 years , a series of Haskell hackathons have been held in Europe , one or two a year , as the Hac series .
In 2009 , we held 4 hackathons , and for the first time , two in North America : in Portland , Edinburgh Philadelphia and Utrecht .
The next Hackathon is in Zurich in March 2010 .
New user groups :
For a long time the Haskell community relied on conferences for our user groups .
By the end of 2009 however , the Haskell user group concept has become widespread , with nearly 30 groups around the world , including ten groups in North America , and twelve in Europe , and six across Australia , Asia and South America .
Summer of Code : Haskell.org participated in the Google Summer of Code , for the fourth consecutive year .
This year , Google funded development of 5 Haskell projects : Gergely Patai to improve space profiling , Isaac Dupree to work on Haddock , Niklas Broberg on Language .
Haskell , Petr Ročkai on scaling Darcs to large repositories , and Thomas ten Cate on EclipseFP .
In addition , Jane Street funded a Haskell project for the first time , under the Jane Street Summer Projects series , supporting development of the Lambda Cube 3D rendering engine .
Books
Real World Haskell : a year ago , Real World Haskell was published , the first O’Reilly book on Haskell , the first Haskell book for professional programmers , and went on to win the Jolt Award for best technical book of the year .
It has since also been translated into Japanese .
It was notable also for having the entire book available in pre-pub and post - pub as a wiki .
LYAH : a quirky and accessible online book was produced , Learn You a Haskell for Great Good , becoming something of an internet sensation .
LYAH is set to be published in book form in 2010 .
Functional Programming Fundamentals : Erik Meijer produced a 13 part video lecture series based on Graham Hutton ’s Programming in Haskell , which went on to have 500k downloads in 2009 .
Compilers and Infrastructure
GHC 6.12 : Version 6.12 of the primary Haskell implementation , GHC , occured in 2009 , with major improvements for parallel performance , support for ThreadScope profiling , dynamic linking on Linux , and with I/O libraries Unicode - aware .
The improvements to parallel performance where benchmarked , and documented in the paper “ Runtime Support for Multicore Haskell “ .
The GHC team also published their latest status report .
An LLVM backend for GHC ?
In something of a tour de force , David Terei designed an LLVM backend for GHC , implemented and benchmarked it :: PDF , finding that the current code gen was competitive , but that LLVM wins out on the numeric - based loops typical in data parallel code .
Dataflow Optimizing Backend : ﻿ Norman Ramsey and João Dias presented a new dataflow optimizing backend for GHC , making it easier to do some very aggressive low level optimizations late in the compilation phase .
Data Parallelism : Data Parallel
Haskell progressed further , and GHC 6.12 is significantly better than prior GHC’s .
The current status of the data parallel extensions to Haskell was described at the HIM .
Supercompilation for GHC ?
Yet more work on the optimization front , a design was developed for adding a supercompilation phase to GHC , making possible whole new classes of aggressive code transformation optimizations that were previously quite difficult .
GHC with shared libraries : Well - Typed , funded by the Industrial Haskell Group , completed the work of enabling shared libraries to be produced by GHC .
That means “ Hello world ” in Haskell is now only an 11 k executable using GHC .
JHC progress :
There was a new major release of jhc , the whole program optimizing Haskell compiler .
UHC : At the Utrecht Hackathon on April , the first release of UHC , the Utrecht Haskell Compiler was announced , a new Haskell compiler with a GRIN - based intermediate representation , which makes extensive use of attribute grammars in its construction .
Libraries and Distribution
The Haskell Platform : in 2009 , a major effort was launched to provide a single “ batteries included ” library suite for Haskell , suiting commercial , open source and research needs .
The result is The Haskell Platform , ( also now available in Debian ) , a single installer for a complete GHC - based Haskell system , including extensive libraries .
By the year ’s end there had been 450 thousand downloads of the binary installers !
Hackage : Hackage is the central repository for Haskell libraries and applications , and , along with Cabal , provides a publishing , distribution , and dependency resolution system for all Haskell code .
Hackage continues to grow in 2009 , faster than in 2008 .
There have been 3500 + package updates this year , so we now have 1750 Haskell packages available on Hackage in total , up from 750 a year ago .
The size of Hackage is phenomenal , as you can see when you visualize the Haskell Universe .
Earlier in the year , we reached one million Haskell downloads on Hackage .
November 2009 was the first month with more than 100k downloads from Hackage in a single month .
Industry
The Industrial Haskell Group :
For the first time , in 2009 , a consortium of companies came together to fund continued development of Haskell and its toolchain .
The result is the IHG , launched earlier in the year .
The initial round of funding resulted in several improvements to the ecosystem .
The group is seeking to expand membership in 2010 to further consolidate the commercial strength Haskell .
The Birth of the IHG was presented at the “ Commercial Users of Functional Programming ” workshop .
CUFP : This year ’s Commercial Users of Haskell workshop was held in Edinburgh , and included talks on Real World Haskell , teleconferencing on maps in Haskell , FP at Facebook .
Next year ’s CUFP will be held in Baltimore .
Industrial reports :
As part of Galois ‘ 10th birthday , Don Stewart presented a talk at the LondonHUG on Engineering Large Projects in Haskell , celebrating a decade of use of Haskell by Galois .
TypLAB , a new startup talked about why they use Haskell .
Facebook released its lex - pass tool to automate changes to a PHP codebase , by writing abstract - syntax - tree transformers in Haskell .
And Starling Software described building a real time financial trading system in Haskell :: PDF .
Tom Hawkin ’s Atom EDSL for control systems went into production use in trucks and buses , and is starting to be used on a NASA runtime monitoring project .
The Cryptol release got slashdotted .
Tupil.com talked about their experiences building commercial web apps in Haskell .
Conferences
The major conferences of the year were in Edinburgh , and for the first time we have video of the entire week , including videos of the International Conference of Functional Programming , the Haskell Symposium , the Commercial Users of Functional Programming , and the Haskell Implementors Meeting .
Hooray for Malcolm Wallace for compiling these videos .
Libraries
New IO library : the major news in libraries included a rewrite of the IO library ( to support native unicode encodings on IO , in - memory IO buffers , and more ) .
See Simon Marlow Wander Through GHC 6.12 ’s New IO Library .
Associated Types for Optimizations : Another popular post was on self - optimizing data structures , by Don Stewart , showing how to statically specialize the layout of Haskell container data types , improving data density and performance .
The Text Library : A major revision of the Haskell text library was announced by Bryan O’Sullivan , giving the Haskell community a packed , unicode text type suitable for large scale unicode text processing .
LLVM adventures :
One of the most interesting new libraries of 2009 was the high level LLVM bindings for Haskell .
Lennart Augustsson and Bryan O’Sullivan had various adventures with it , including beating GHC ( and GCC ) and producing a BASIC embedded in Haskell via LLVM .
New tools
Vacuum :
The biggest tools of the year included vacuum , Matt Morrow ’s tool for extracting graphs of heap objects in running Haskell processes .
With it you can vizualize Haskell data structures live in GHCi .
Benchmarking : Another great new tool is criterion , a library for statistically robust microbenchmarking , by Bryan O’Sullivan .
You can read more about it in the release notes .
The Leksah IDE : major announcement was made at the Utrecht Hackathon : Leksah , a Haskell IDE in Haskell by Juergen Nicklisch - Franken .
﻿ ThreadScope : Finally , another key new tool addresses the problem of profiling in a multicore setting .
The result is threadscope ( a tool for profiling concurrent and parallel Haskell programs ) .
ThreadScope lets you visualize graphically events in the GHC runtime system , including GC , thread migration , execution , spark activity and more .
You can watch this video to see it at work .
Haskell in New Domains
Linux Kernel : Thomas DuBuisson showed us how to write Linux Kernel Modules in Haskell .
Barrelfish OS : Microsoft ’s new Barrelfish OS was built on domain specific languages written in Haskell :: PDF
seL4 : the first machine - verified microkernel : the Secure Microkernel Project ( seL4 ) announced it ’s major result : the world ’s first formal machine - checked proof of a kernel , and they used Haskell as a key part of their development methodology .
i Phones : GHC was modified to allow native Haskell on iPhone .
Haskell for Theorem Proving : Haskabelle was released , a tool to convert Haskell source into Isabelle theory files , suitable for theorem proving activities .
A little fun with Haskabelle can be had .
Open Source
xmonad :
The xmonad tiling window manager continued to be the most popular open source app on Hackage in 2009 , with the xmonad 0.9 release occurring .
gitit : another significant new project is gitit , a feature - rich wiki running on top of git or darcs , with pandoc support ( meaning you can write your wiki in markdown / tex / html / … )
happstack : the happstack web framework ( the Haskell equivalent of Django ) was in active development , with happstack 0.4 released .
happstack powers gitit , and patch - tag.com , amongst other things .
You can also read about why Happstack scales , and SQL fails !
darcs : the darcs revision control system world was extremely active this year , with darcs 2.2 and darcs 2.3 released ( along with a Summer of code project ) and great strides in scalability via a new storage mechanism .

See you in 2010 !
Here 's an idea : sell off our prisons to the highest bidders , reap a pile of short - term cash to inflate near - empty state coffers , then lease back the prisons for 20 years at a cost to the state that far exceeds the original purchase price paid by the companies .
While we 're at it , let 's completely privatise medical and mental health services – and mandate that bidders come in with lower per prisoner cost estimates than those currently paid out by the state .
And , to cap it off , privatise the day - to - day operations of all the prisons , including supermaxes and death row sites , and , in an incentive to cut corners , split the savings 50 - 50 between the state and the private companies doing the administering .
Conservative fantasy ?
Alas , no .
This is the set of kooky proposals recently embraced by legislatures in a near - insolvent Arizona , looking to trim dollars from their state budget .
A boondoggle to the private sector ?
Sure .
A recipe for disaster as poorly paid , under - trained private prison guards assume control over supermax prisons – an environment in which private guards have had little - to - no prior experience ( historically , private prison companies looking for easy criminal justice pickings have shied clear of hard - to - manage high security facilities ) ?
Almost certainly .
An invitation for prisoners to sue as medical and mental health services are farmed out to low - ball bidders ?
Yes , again .
" I 'm telling you , it takes the cake , " says Caroline Isaacs , programme director of the prison - reform group the Arizona Friends Service Committee .
" I 've lived here for 15 years , and I 'm completely blown away by this .
This has never been done anywhere . "
A couple of weeks ago , the Pew Centre on the States , a division of the Pew charitable trusts , found that 10 states were facing particularly devastating budget implosions .
Not surprisingly , many of these – including California , Arizona , Nevada , and Florida – were states hit particularly hard by the bursting of the housing bubble .
Much has been written about California 's crisis .
But in many ways smaller states like Arizona are in even bigger trouble ; and as they teeter on the brink , so increasingly bizarre policy proposals are gaining traction .
Arizona 's even contemplating selling off its capitol building , for Pete 's sake .
A few years ago , in my book American Furies , I compared the reactionary practices of the Maricopa county jails – centered in Phoenix and run by the infamous Sheriff Joe Arpaio – to the progressive reforms being implemented in Arizona 's state prisons by then - corrections commissioner Dora Schriro .
Schriro had made a name for herself in correctional circles through modernising prisons in the state of Missouri , developing a reform theory she labeled the " parallel universe " .
Her results had been impressive : lower recidivism rates , lower in - prison rates of violence , educational successes with inmates , drug - treatment programs that actually worked .
In Arizona , too , she brought outside - the - box thinking to a large , and violent , system .
For a few years , Arizona became something of a poster - child for prison reform .
But Schriro moved to DC to work for the Obama administration , researching and writing on conditions of confinement for illegal immigrants awaiting deportation , and then recently moved on to run the jail system in New York City .
She left behind a new , and relatively ineffectual , corrections administration in Arizona , one unable to defend its reforms from a conservative , and increasingly fiscally desperate , legislature and governor ( Janet Napolitano , the previous , Democratic governor , also went to DC to work in the new administration , and her successor , Jan Brewer , is a Republican ) .
Now , the vacuum might soon be filled , as Arizona stands poised to go where no American state has gone before : sending out a request for proposals that could soon see an almost entirely privatised state prison system .
That 's a leap back not just a few decades but a few hundred years in correctional thinking .
Private prison companies in America have a dismal track record : a slew of escape scandals and prisoner abuse allegations brought major companies to their knees about a decade ago ; workers at the facilities are paid abysmally low wages ; and medical services , along with access to education , drug treatment , and vocational training frequently are on - paper fictions rather than genuine realities .
Privatisation might generate a few tens of millions of dollars for Arizona in the short - term ; but the long - run costs – both financial and moral – of farming this basic state function out to for - profit private companies will likely be immense .

An independent review into a fatal 2006 Nimrod crash , which killed 14 service personnel , has accused the MoD of sacrificing safety to cut costs .
The highly critical report , by Charles Haddon - Cave QC , said the Afghanistan crash occurred because of a " systemic breach " of the military covenant .
A safety review of the Nimrod MR2 carried out by the MoD , BAE Systems and QinetiQ was branded a " lamentable job " .
Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth apologised to victims ' families .
Fourteen crewmen , based at RAF Kinloss in Moray , died when the aircraft - XV230 - blew up after air - to - air refuelling over Afghanistan when leaking fuel made contact with a hot air pipe .
Graham Knight , whose son
Ben died in the explosion , said his son and all the other servicemen " doing their job " in Afghanistan " a hundred per cent " had been let down by " those people who are behind them " .
Joe Windall , whose son , also Joe , died on board the Nimrod , said the findings had been astonishing .
ANALYSIS Caroline Wyatt , BBC defence correspondent
The Nimrod review is the most devastating attack on the MoD and the defence industry in living memory .
Its language is direct , its criticisms unsparing .
Charles Haddon - Cave describes " deep organisational trauma " at the MoD as resulting from the strategic defence review of 1998 .
Internal promotion resulted not from being on top of safety but from being on top of a budget .
He recommends a host of solutions , including a new military airworthiness authority that is independent of the MoD .
However , the alarming insights offered by the Nimrod Review will lead many to wonder if if such whole - scale change to the culture can be achieved - not least at a time when financial pressures are even greater than they were in 1998 .
Nimrod report individuals criticised " The inefficiencies of someone caused me to lose my son , " he said .
Mr Haddon - Cave condemned the change of organisational culture within the MoD between 1998 and 2006 , when financial targets came to distract from safety .
He quoted a former senior RAF officer who told his inquiry : " There was no doubt that the culture of the time had switched .
" In the days of the RAF chief engineer in the 1990s , you had to be on top of airworthiness .
" By 2004 you had to be on top of your budget if you wanted to get ahead . "
Mr Haddon - Cave 's report also criticised two RAF officers - Air Commodore George Baber , who was a group captain at the time , and Wing Commander Michael Eagles .
Air Comdr Baber led the MoD integrated project team responsible for a safety review of the RAF 's Nimrods , which took place between 2001 and 2005 .
The report 's author accused him of a " fundamental failure of leadership " in drawing up the " safety case " into potential dangers in the fleet .
Mr Haddon - Cave wrote : " He failed to give the NSC ( Nimrod safety case ) the priority it deserved .
In doing so , he failed , in truth , to make safety his first priority . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
As head of air vehicle for the Nimrod , Wing Cdr Michael Eagles was supposed to be in charge of managing production of the safety review .
The report found that he delegated the project " wholesale " to an MoD civilian worker who was too inexperienced and not competent enough to manage it .
It stated : " Michael Eagles failed to give adequate priority , care and personal attention to the NSC task .
" He failed properly to utilise the resources available to him within the Nimrod IPT to ensure the airworthiness of the Nimrod fleet . "
Mr Ainsworth told the Commons the two officers had been moved to staff posts which held no responsibility for safety and the RAF would now consider if any " further action " would be taken against them .
He also said Mr Haddon - Cave , one of Britain 's leading aviation law barristers , had been critical of both the MoD and its industrial partners at both organisational and individual levels .
Mr Haddon - Cave said he had criticised 10 individuals in the report - five at the MoD , three at BAE Systems and two at QinetiQ - while throughout the review BAE Systems had been a company " in denial " .
NIMROD REPORT
Independent review into broader issues surrounding loss of RAF Nimrod in Afghanistan in 2006 [ 4.62 MB ]
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here A safety review of the ageing Nimrod MR2 a year before the crash , carried out by the MoD , BAE and QinetiQ , was a " lamentable job " which failed to identify " key dangers " , he said .
" Its production is a story of incompetence , complacency and cynicism .
The best opportunity to prevent the accident to XV230 was tragically lost , " he said .
Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox said the report was a " formidable indictment " and " genuinely shocking " , containing information that previous incidents and warning signs had been ignored .
Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Nick Harvey said : " This is a tragic case of an accident that could have been avoided . "
The Ministry of Defence has grounded all Nimrods whose engine - bay hot air ducts had not been replaced .
However , Mr Haddon - Cave found no reason to recommend the grounding of the entire Nimrod MR2 fleet .
He has written to the families of the servicemen who died .
Mr Ainsworth said the " rigorous " report would make distressing reading for the relatives of those who died .
HOW THE NIMROD CRASHED 1 .
Nimrod refuels in mid-air 2 .
Possible fuel over - flow from number one tank 3 .
Second possible source of leak is pipe couplings behind number seven tank 4 .
Leaked fuel contacts hot pipe and ignites 5 .
Fire and smoke alarms triggered in bomb bay and underfloor by sensitive wiring
Nimrod crash review raises hopes Reaction to Nimrod crash report " On behalf of the MoD and the Royal Air Force , I would like again to say sorry to all the families who lost loved ones , " he said .
" I am sorry for the mistakes that have been made and the lives that have been lost as a result of our failure .
Nothing I can say or do will bring these men back . "
Mr Ainsworth said the MoD had already implemented measures to improve safety and airworthiness of the Nimrod fleet , insisting the department had not been " idle " while Mr Haddon - Cave 's review was being carried out .
This included the ending of air - to - air refuelling .
The MoD has since admitted negligence in relation to the explosion .
BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said the review , which began in January , had a broad remit .
It has looked at the airworthiness of the Nimrod MR2 fleet since its introduction into service in 1979 .
The 14 men killed on the Nimrod were : Flt Lt Steven Johnson , 38 , from Collingham , Nottinghamshire , Flt Lt Leigh Anthony Mitchelmore , 28 , from Bournemouth , Dorset , Flt Lt Gareth Rodney Nicholas , 40 , from Redruth , Cornwall , Flt Lt Allan James Squires , 39 , from Clatterbridge , Merseyside and Flt Lt Steven Swarbrick , 28 , from Liverpool .
Flt Sgt Gary Wayne Andrews , 48 , from Tankerton , Kent , Flt Sgt Stephen Beattie , 42 , from Dundee , Flt Sgt Gerard Martin Bell , 48 , from Newport , Shropshire , and Flt Sgt Adrian Davies , 49 , from Amersham , Buckinghamshire , Sgt Benjamin James Knight , 25 , from Bridgwater , Sgt John Joseph Langton , 29 , from Liverpool and Sgt Gary Paul Quilliam , 42 , from Manchester .

Three men alleged to be Al Qaeda associates were charged Friday with conspiring to smuggle cocaine through Africa -- the first U.S. prosecution linking the terrorist group directly to drug trafficking .
The three suspects , who were charged in federal court in New York , are believed to be from Mali and were arrested in Ghana during a Drug Enforcement Administration sting .
Although U.S. authorities have alleged that Al Qaeda and the Taliban profit from Afghanistan ’s heroin trade , the case is the first in which suspects linked to Al Qaeda have been charged under severe narco - terrorism laws , federal officials said .
The 18 - page complaint describes a convergence of mafias and terrorists in northwest Africa that has caused increasing alarm among European , African and U.S. investigators .
Cocaine traffic has risen sharply in West Africa in recent years .
Exploiting states that are weakened by corruption , poverty and violence , Latin American mafias have made the region a hub for moving cocaine across the Atlantic and into the booming drug markets of Europe .

Al Qaeda in the Maghreb -- a North African ally of Osama bin Laden ’s organization -- has muscled into the lucrative cocaine smuggling routes of the Sahara , according to Western and African officials .
It existed for two decades under other names before declaring allegiance to Bin Laden in 2006 .
Al Qaeda in the Maghreb finances itself partly by protecting and moving loads along smuggling corridors that run through Morocco into Spain and through Libya and Algeria into Italy , according to the complaint and Western investigators .
“ We ’ve known about this for a long time , but this is the first actionable thing we ’ve done in response to it , ” DEA spokesman Rusty Payne said .
The stakes are high because of the potential for Al Qaeda in the Maghreb to use cocaine profits in attacks on the West .

Anti-terrorism investigators cite a harbinger : An Al Qaeda - connected cell of North Africans financed their 2004 Madrid train bombings , which killed 190 people , by dealing hashish and Ecstasy .
Moreover , officials said , conversations among informants and suspects have suggested that the lawless region around the Gulf of Guinea is a crossroads for groups united by hatred of the United States -- Al Qaeda , Mexican gangsters , Colombian guerrillas and Lebanese militant groups .
“ For the first time in that part of the world , these guys are operating in the same environment in the same place at the same time , ” said Michael Braun , a former chief of DEA operations .
“ They are doing business and cutting deals .
What ’s most troubling about this is the personal relationships that these guys are making today , between drug organizations and terror organizations , will become operational alliances in the future . ”
Authorities say the three suspects charged Friday are not members of Al Qaeda in the Maghreb but allege that they are associates .
The case against them is based largely on conversations in which , authorities say , the suspects described the smuggling trade and Al Qaeda ’s involvement to informants posing as representatives of the FARC guerrillas of Colombia .
In recent years , Western and African investigators have pointed to concrete signs of the convergence of drugs and terrorism in the region .

In 2007 , two accused operatives of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , a major player in cocaine trafficking , were arrested in Guinea - Bissau -- described by many as Africa ’s first “ narco- state . ”
And last year , Morocco ’s interior minister asserted that Al Qaeda in the Maghreb fighters were enriching themselves by taxing the cocaine smuggling routes in Mali and Mauritania to the south .
“ It is a zone where there is a lot of money circulating , with cocaine traffic that is growing fast , ” Interior Minister Chakib Benmoussa said .
“ A certain number of terror networks exploit this situation because these groups guarantee , secure the routes . ”
The charges unsealed Friday allege that the conspiracy began in Ghana in September , when one of the suspects , Omuar Issa , made contact with a DEA informant .
The informant presented himself as an anti-Western “ Lebanese radical ” working with the FARC .
That link was not farfetched , Western investigators said , because Lebanese mafias with a presence in West Africa have long played a role in helping Latin American drug lords carve out trafficking routes .

Issa was a facilitator working for a criminal organization active in Ghana , Mali and neighboring countries , the complaint alleges .
He discussed a deal to transport cocaine from Ghana through North Africa and into Spain with the protection of Al Qaeda in the Maghreb at a price of $ 4,200 per kilogram ( 2.2 pounds ) , the complaint said .
At meetings in October , Issa introduced the informant to Harouna Toure , another of the suspects , who authorities say is the leader of a criminal organization that works closely with Al Qaeda .
According to the complaint , Toure said his organization would use Land Rovers to drive the load across the desert to Morocco , and he described “ two different transportation routes , one through Algeria and Libya and the other through Algeria and Morocco . ”
He told the informant that his group “ provides protection for planes that land in their area , including planes from Colombia , ” the document said .
The complaint also said Toure had described his strong relationship with the Al Qaeda groups that control areas of North Africa : “ Toure stated that he has worked with Al Qaeda to transport and deliver between one and two tons of hashish to Tunisia and that his organization and Al Qaeda have collaborated in the human smuggling of Bangladeshi , Pakistani and Indian subjects into Spain . ”

Al Qaeda in the Maghreb has carried out attacks primarily in Algeria , Mali and Mauritania .
The Algeria - based militant group ’s stated goal is to wage holy war across North Africa and Europe .
The militants could use cocaine profits to better arm themselves , expand recruitment and buy off corrupt government allies in the region , investigators said .
And the case that was detailed Friday , Braun said , reveals the dimensions of a threat that has not gotten enough attention in the West .
“ The Moroccans have been pounding on the table , warning about the involvement of Al Qaeda in the Maghreb in drug trafficking , ” he said .
“ This shows they were right .
Nobody in [ Washington ] has been talking about this threat .
The only agency that has really gone after it is the DEA . ”

The government of Israel seems to be embracing the Christmas spirit .
This week it is organizing carols and tree giveaways in Jerusalem , bus service to Bethlehem and even a fireworks show in Nazareth with an apparent eye on burnishing the nation ’s reputation for religious diversity .
But Israel wo n’t be giving the Christmas gift near the top of the Vatican ’s wish list this year : possession of a Mt. Zion holy site where Jesus is believed to have gathered his disciples for the Last Supper .
The Roman Catholic Church has been fighting for more than 450 years to win back control of the Crusader - era sanctuary , also known as the Holy Cenacle , which was seized from Franciscan monks around 1551 during the Ottoman Empire .
Vatican officials had hoped to made a deal with Israel this year , but the latest round of negotiations ended this month without an agreement , leading some to say that the impasse is souring diplomatic relations between the two sides .
Danny Ayalon , Israel ’s deputy foreign minister , who traveled to Rome this month , said he was hopeful that a compromise could still be reached .
But though Israel might consider giving the Vatican a greater role in operating the site , he said that turning over sovereignty was unlikely .
“ It is part and parcel of Jerusalem , and nobody can expect us to split sovereignty or possession , ” Ayalon said , adding that high - level talks were n’t likely to resume until mid-2010 .
Franciscan officials in Jerusalem , who serve as custodian for several Christian holy sites in Israel , expressed hope that the location would one day return to their hands .
“ It ’s one of the most important holy places , ” said Father Athanasius Macora , secretary of a Franciscan commission monitoring holy sites .
He noted that the Holy Cenacle is also revered as the site where , according to the Christian faith , the Holy Spirit appeared before the disciples on the first Pentecost .
Franciscans “ have a special attachment , ” Macora said .
“ It was our mother house and headquarters .
We still have the deed to the property . ”
Macora , a Texas native , said Franciscan control of the Last Supper room would open the site to regular Christian prayer services , Masses and other ceremonies , which have been prohibited since the Ottoman era .
“ If we get the place back , we would allow everyone to have access to it , ” he said .
But as is true of many holy sites in this deeply religious city , the Holy Cenacle , on a hill just outside the Old City walls , is the object of conflicting historical claims .
It sits atop the Tomb of David , where some Jews believe their ancient king was buried .
And during the Ottoman period , the Holy Cenacle was used as a mosque .
Evidence of the competing claims is apparent in the stone - walled compound , where crosses are mixed with stars of David .
In the Last Supper Room is a carved stone niche pointing toward Mecca that once was used by Muslims during prayer .
Some experts worry that reopening the debate over control will inflame religious tensions and lead to more clashes over holy sites in a city that is home to hundreds .
“ It ’s a typically complex Jerusalem problem , ” said Daniel Rossing , head of the Jerusalem Center for Jewish - Christian Relations and a former Israeli government advisor on Christian communities .
“ Once you start to turn back the clock , you open a Pandora ’s Box and throw things into chaos .
Maintaining the status quo is usually the general policy . ”
Issues of sovereignty are particularly sensitive in Israel , where border and land disputes lie at the heart of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Last year , when Israel returned a small parcel of land once owned by the Russian czar to the Russian government , the gesture of goodwill sparked condemnation among Israelis who feared that the deal would lead to other “ territorial demands . ”
The structure on the Holy Cenacle site is believed to have been built in the 12th and 13th centuries , although parts of the foundation are said to date to the 2nd century .
Israel seized Mt. Zion during the 1948 Arab - Israeli war in the wake of British rule .
Efforts by the Vatican to regain control began while the British were in charge , but faltered .
In 2005 , then - Israeli President Moshe Katsav reportedly drafted a proposal to swap control of the Holy Cenacle for a synagogue - turned - church in the Spanish city of Toledo , but that plan fizzled .
Some say the lack of progress is a reflection of the often - strained relationship between Judaism and Catholicism , and between Israel and the Vatican , which did not formally recognize the Jewish state until 1993 .
“ If things were friendly , such matters would be solved in months , not years , ” said Sergio Itzhak Minerbi , a longtime Vatican watcher and former Hebrew University professor .
Many Jews blame the Vatican for fueling centuries of anti-Semitism .
Old wounds were recently reopened when the Vatican moved forward with seeking sainthood for Pope Pius XII , whom many Jews fault for failing to speak out against the Holocaust .
For its part , the Vatican is often critical of Israel ’s treatment of the approximately 150,000 Christians living in Israel , the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Despite the high - profile Christmas tree giveaways each year , the mostly Arab Christians complain of inequality in matters of employment , housing and social services .
Christians also have complained in recent years about Israel ’s renovations to Christian holy sites and efforts to seek taxes from Christian - run schools and monasteries .
Minerbi said he suspects that the primary bone of contention is the Vatican ’s request for tax - exemption for most religious sites .
Once the financial issue is resolved , he said , the conflict over the Last Supper site will be settled .
In the meantime , he has offered a novel compromise :
Put the site back under control of Muslims , who ran it for four centuries before the British took control after World War I .
The idea has provided Israel and the Vatican with something they can finally agree on .
Both are vehemently opposed .
“ At this stage , ” said Ayalon , the Israeli deputy foreign minister , “ it would not be helpful to involve other parties . ”

Nebraska will receive $ 100 million in assistance for its state Medicaid program under provisions negotiated by Sen. Ben Nelson ( D ) in the Senate 's healthcare reform bill .
The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) informed lawmakers on Sunday night that the section of the manager 's amendment to the Senate 's health bill would cost $ 1.2 billion over 10 years .
Nelson managed to win a share of the section of the manager 's amendment on Equitable Support for Certain States , which will provide Nebraska , along with Massachusetts and Vermont , support in paying its share of additional costs to Medicaid in the health legislation .
ADVERTISEMENT
The provision , which Republicans have derided as the " Cornhusker Kickback , " actually provides Nebraska the least of the three states .
Vermont will receive $ 600 million over 10 years , while Massachusetts will receive $ 500 million .
The money to Nebraska had previously been reported to be $ 45 million .
Nelson defended the provision during an appearance on CNN on Sunday , saying he was simply seeking to work with Nebraska 's governor and fellow senators to secure fair treatment .
" Well , you know , look , I did n't ask for a special favor here .
I did n't ask for a carve - out , " Nelson said .
" What I said is the governor of Nebraska has contacted me , he said publicly he 's having trouble with the budget .
This will add to his budget woes .
And I said , look , we have to have that fixed .
" Nebraska 's governor , Dave Heineman , a Republican , rejected that characterization .
" Nebraskans did not ask for a special deal , only a fair deal .
Under no circumstances did I have anything to do with Sen. Nelson ’s compromise , " he said .
" Sen . Nelson negotiated this special deal , rather than a fair deal for both Nebraska and America .
The responsibility for this special deal lies solely on the shoulders of Sen. Ben Nelson .
” Democratic lawmakers defended the deal with Nelson , as well as one in November with Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - La. ) before debate began on the health bill , as simply examples of senators fighting for their states .
I had already planned on what today ’s post was going to be about .
We have been in Detroit for just over a year now , we arrived December 9th of last year .
So I was going to do a rundown of our highs and lows during our first year in Detroit .
I was going to talk about all the fabulous places we ’ve been in and around metro Detroit and all the cool events we ’ve attended .
I would have probably mentioned meeting Gordie Howe and Ronnie James Dio , going to the Tigers game , and the horrible weather and outcome of the U of M game we attended .
We have also had many trials and tribulations since our arrival .
Months and months and months of unemployment did not help our emotional well - being or bank account .
We knew what we were getting into , moving to Detroit in December of 2008 , but it still took its toll .
My biggest trial has been sharing a car with my husband .
The husband and I share our fabulous 2001 mini-van .
And by share , I mean that my husband uses it all the time and I get dropped off and picked up like a teenager .
It truly sucks .
Not only do I get stranded at home quite often but also I miss out on social situations and covering events for Detroit Moxie .
This needs to be fixed .
Anyway , I decided not to talk about all that today .
Saturday night after attending the awesome Mayer Hawthorne gig at the Magic Stick we found our car had been broken into .
The passenger side window was smashed to bits and glass was everywhere .
The thieving rats only took our GPS , $ 60 of goods we just bought , and our bag of quarters that we keep in the glove box to feed those pesky meters .
My stupid husband had most of his tools in the car .
His tools are his livelihood .
He dotes on them .
They are a part of his soul .
And they did n’t get stolen .
We are very fortunate .
I shiver just thinking about all the whinging I ’d be hearing if they took his blessed tools .
But no , the post is n’t about that either .
What is it about then ?
The comments and the Detroit bashing I ’ve heard since the break - in pissed me off , you know , “ well , you WERE in Detroit . ”
Ugg !
Yes , my car got broken into while we were in Detroit .
People , cars get broken into everywhere !
My friend Beverly Cornell recently had her laptop stolen from her car , ON HER DRIVEWAY , in Madison Heights .
Miraculously , she got it back due to an angel .
Seriously , if it happened today we'd be calling it a Christmas miracle .
Crime happens everywhere and more so in big cities .
While living in Chicago , my apartment got broken into two days before Christmas .
I was in the apartment at the time , sleeping off a hangover from the Christmas party the night before .
It took me awhile to realize what was happening but I scared the intruder away .
He did , oddly , get away with my plunger .
Also in Chicago , my car got broken into .
Same situation as here , the passenger side window was smashed .
Luckily , there was nothing in it to steal .
Oh , and Milwaukee , have I got stories about Milwaukee !
My college sweetheart had a soft top Jeep .
It did n’t even have door locks ; this Jeep did n’t even have keyholes !
People would bend back the plastic windows to get in the car .
Or , they ’d cut through the soft top .
Just open the door , ya freaks !
It ’s open !
But no , they were so stupid that they had to cause damage to get into the vehicle .
The big winner was the person who knew they could just open the door .
They also figured out they could pop the hood .
We found a Danish sitting on the engine one day .
It was quite a nice looking Danish too !
No , we did n’t eat it .
Did I mention that I lived a few blocks away from the psycho Jeffrey Dahmer while he was cannibalizing young men in Milwaukee ?
Yep , it ’s true .
Bad things happen everywhere .
This was a small inconvenience .
Am I going to stop going into Detroit ?
Hell no !
I ’m going to keep on embracing this city , just like I have been doing .
Things happen .
We move on .
We get back up .
You want to know what I ’m most annoyed about ?
I only had that damn Garmin lady out of my life for one day .
She was replaced today , an early Christmas present for the husband .
Barack Obama owes his presidency in no small part to the power of rhetoric .
It 's too bad he does n't appreciate the damage that loose talk can do to America 's tax system , even as exploding federal deficits make revenues more important than ever .
At his Arizona State University commencement speech last Wednesday , Mr. Obama noted that ASU had refused to grant him an honorary degree , citing his lack of experience , and the controversy this had caused .
He then demonstrated ASU 's point by remarking , " I really thought this was much ...

Update - April 18 , 2006 ***
Here is another
that
will show you a few more pictures of this great Joseph Smith Nativity scene .
Apparently some of you out there do n't consider this to be a Nativity scene at all .
Let 's see , he is laying in a crib( instead of some straw ) , laying in a replica log cabin ( instead of a manger ) , it was Christmas time ( when most people celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ ) and they even had the modern day decorations of today , that did n't even exist in Joseph 's day ( namely a Christmas tree with lights ) .
By the way , for those that are n't aware , this little set up was like 30 seconds from the office of the President of BYU , right inside the main door of the admin building , so that everybody entering the building would see it .
I 'm sure it gave him and everybody else , warm fuzzies , every time they walked past it .
Talk about a bosom inferno !!
Do you think that they ever considered setting up a Jesus Nativity scene in the Admin building , instead of Joseph Smith ?
Well , since he was greater than Jesus Christ , according to Joseph himself , I highly doubt it !!
Websters dictionary defines Nativity as , " the process or circumstances of being born , the place of origin , or the act or instance of being born . "
Encarta describes nativity as , " birth or origin , especially the place , process , or circumstances of being born . "
What would you guys call it , the " Joseph as a very small infant , lying in a crib , at Christmas time scene ? "
So , call it whatever the hell you want , but , give me a break , it 's a damn nativity scene folks , no matter how some of you want to split hairs or deny reality .
Is it actually possible that some of you missed out on all of the Joseph Smith obsession , worship and extravaganzas , that took place all year long , culminating with the 200 year birthday party on December 23rd ?
Maybe it 's just me , but I seem to remember Hinckley , Ballard ( direct descendant of Joseph Smith ) and Packer in Vermont ( tape recorded , not live ) and Faust , Monson and the rest of the gang , in a sold out conference center , specifically to celebrate the birth of Joseph Smith ?
Oh yeah , " PRAISE TO THE MAN " , RIGHT ?
This nativity scene was just part of it !!
Hey , did any of you ever wonder , why the Church did n't and has n't ever , specifically had a birthday party for Jesus Christ , with Hinckley and co. over in Bethlehem , at the birth sight of Jesus Christ ?
Hell , they could have thrown a party for Jesus this past December , filled the conference center and celebrated his 2006th anniversary of being born , right ?
They could do it ever year !!
Oh well , I guess that Hinckley and Joseph Smith are just more important .
Now , I 'm not talking about a Christmas devotional either , rather a " birthday party ( bash ) for Jesus . "
You know , like Hinkcley has every 5 years and Joseph every 100 years .
Of course , they'd have to throw the party on April 6th every year , since that is actually when he was born and the exact date , according to Joseph Smith .
I guess they could still do it in December , just as long as they made it clear that his actual birthdate was April 6th , so that nobody got confused .
It could become a tradition , like Hinckley 's birthday bashes !!
Maybe they could even change the words of " We Thank The O God For A Prophet " , to " We Thank Thee O God For Jesus Chirst . "
Nah ..... what am I thinking , that will never happen !!
By the way , for those than just have to have a DVD of that incredible birthday celebration of the greatest man to ever live on this earth , it 's only $ 4.50 , plus shipping .
Now , that 's one hell of a deal and a steal !!
I just called and verified it myself , but you can go to this page and order as many as you need .
They will make great birthday and Christmas gifts for everyone .
The line is pretty busy though , so you may have to hold for 5 - 10 minutes and they will try to get your name , before giving you any information .
Kolob is a very busy place .
I just wanted to give everyone a heads up !!
LOL !!
Just think , once you own it , you and your friends , can watch it over and over , until your bosom explodes from the joy .
Even better , you can invite your NON - MEMBER friends and family over , to " feel and partake of the spirit " , while watching this flick .
Just keep a very close eye on them during the show , to see if you can sense them getting emotional or spiritual .
That would be a sure sign that they know the Church is true , that Joseph Smith was a Prophet and they will be on their way to becoming a Mormon God someday , with exaltation in the highest degree of Celestial glory .
Also , I highly suggest having some Mylanta on hand , just in case your bosom or their bosom gets out of control and goes haywire .
Those burning bosom episodes can be pretty damn dangerous , especially when watching a " Joseph Smith worship show . "
Also for those that can't get enough of Joseph Smith and worshiping him ( Praise to the man ) , here is another link , which is a very special Christmas tribute I did , to the man that Kings and nations revere and extol , showing more pictures of this GLORIOUS NATIVITY SCENE .
( Personally , I like the Moroni birds - eye view )
Also , please do n't miss out on my 200th Birthday Tribute To Joseph Smith , as I 'm sure you TBMS will just love it !!
Is n't it all just so wonderful ?!!
Where 's the fire extinguisher ?
***
Smithians .
They have never been Christians and are as far away from that as they 've ever been , especially with Hinckley large and in charge .
Hinckley may not even believe in Jesus or the Father , since he considers himself to be a God .
Did you see his birthday bash / worship party , this last summer ?
He did the same thing for his 90th birthday and is already planning his 100th birthday bash .
Many common members , may consider themselves to be Christians , but I 'm talking about the Mormon Hierarchy , not the common members , for the most part .
But , you 'll see on December 23rd , when the Mormon Church throws yet another birthday bash and their Conference Center is packed with Morgbots .
Everyone will have stars in their eyes and just be so grateful to be able to worship Joseph Smith for Christmas .
What a blessing !!
Makes sense does n't it ?
A supposedly " Christian " Church , throwing a massive worshiping party for their founder , two days before Christmas .
Yep , is sure does , if you really worship Joseph Smith instead of Jesus , it 's makes perfect sense !!
Thanks for making it so clear !!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh yeah and just for fun , lets all remember now , what Joseph Smith himself had to say in regards to who was greater , himself or Jesus plus a bonus quote on denying that he was ever a polygamist .
This was a great day for Joseph Smith but a better day for those of us that see the light .
Joseph said :
Quote :
I have more to boast of than ever any man had .
I am the only man that has ever been able to keep a whole church together since the days of Adam .
A large majority of the whole have stood by me .
Neither Paul , John , Peter , nor Jesus ever did it .
I boast that no man ever did such a work as I .
The followers of Jesus ran away from Him ; but the Latter - day Saints never ran away from me yet .
What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing adultery , and having seven wives , when I can only find one .
I am the same man , and as innocent as I was fourteen years ago ; and I can prove them all perjurers .
I labored with these apostates myself until I was out of all manner of patience ...
( History of the Church , Vol. 6 , p. 408-412 ) .
Merry Smithmas everyone and a happy new smear !!

29 Dec A selection of amazing , spellbinding images from the past ten years .
TEL AVIV
– Israel is a racist state that commits war crimes and resorts to terrorism worse than that employed by the Palestinians , former Education Minister Shulamit Aloni charged in an unusually scathing interview with Nazareth - based Arab - Israeli newspaper Kul al - Arab .
Other highlights from the interview include “ ( Prime Minister ) Sharon should face justice , ” “ Israel is following Mussolini ’s way , ” and “ some soldiers behave like animals . ”
When asked how she characterizes the prime minister , Aloni responded : “ Sharon is a big , arrogant nationalist .
He suffers from megalomania and does n’t mind sacrificing the lives of others , as happened in the invasion of Lebanon . ”
“ Sharon and the Israeli leadership always try to make Israelis believe the lie that the Palestinians want to throw us to the sea , ” the former minister charged .
“ In fact , we are the ones who commit war crimes against humanity , and I hope Sharon will face justice . ”
‘ Government , settlers coordinate anti-pullout campaign ’
Turning her attention to the disengagement plan , Aloni leveled more charges , saying she fears the evacuation from Gaza will turn Palestinian life in the West Bank “ into hell . ”
“ I want to note that National Union Knesset Member Benny Elon recently said that settlers intend to embitter the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank , until they emigrate from here , ” she said .
“ I see testament to that in the existence of an IDF unit comprising radical religious soldiers , who are no different than animals in their daily behavior . ”
Aloni also expressed her surprise that Israelis continue to play the “ role of victims ” and the American President accepts that image while declaring that “ Israel has the right to defend itself , while ignoring the fact we have one of the most powerful armies in the Middle East . ”
The former minister also resorted to apparent conspiracy theories , claiming the government and settlers were “ secretly coordinating ” anti-pullout resistance in order to create a “ national shock ” and convince the world of the difficulties inherent in withdrawing from the West Bank .
‘ Israel no different than South Africa ’
Turning her attention to the Palestinians , Aloni said had she been a Palestinian she would have called for the cessation of suicide bombings and the adoption of the non-violent approach of Mahatma Ghandi .
“ It ’s true that the terror utilized by Israel in the territories is worse than Palestinian terrorism , but the Hamas movement gives the occupation the opportunity and means to deepen , ” she said .
When asked about how she views Israel ’s future , Aloni responded : “ I can show you Mussolini ’s books about fascism .
If you read them you ’ll reach the unequivocal conclusion that ministers in the current Israeli government are walking on the same path . ”
“ Only in a country like this can a murderer … reach the post of Defense Minister , ” she charged .
“ Israel , in fact , is no different than racist South Africa as long as it presents itself as Jewish state instead of a state of all its citizens . ”
However , when asked about the chances of a leftist revival in Israel , Aloni was pessimistic , and chose to level some more charges .
“ If you look for the Left , you wo n’t find it , ” she said .
“ Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak killed it .
The Left ’s collapse resulted from several reasons , including the Labor party ’s participation in Sharon ’s former government . ”
by Timothy P. Carney by Timothy P. Carney Previously by Timothy P. Carney : The Forgotten Man
The following is an excerpt from Tim Carney 's new book , Obamanomics : How Barack Obama Is Bankrupting You and Enriching His Wall Street Friends , Corporate Lobbyists , and Union Bosses , published November 30 by Regnery Publishing .
A staple of Obamanomics is the regulations , pitched as consumer protection , that functions as Big Business protection .
We have seen this at work in the toy industry .
u201CThe year of the recall , u201D as some people called it , saw recalls of Dora the Explorer and Barbie dolls due to excessive lead in the toys ' paint .
Mattel , the largest toymaker in the world , recalled more than two million toys .
All the recalled toys were made in China .
Obama , after backing away from a pledge to ban all Chinese - made toys , put his support behind a bill called the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act ( CPSIA ) .
This bill passed Congress in July when Obama was on the campaign trail , so he missed the vote .
But he issued a joint press release with another Democratic senator reading , in part , u201Cu2018 Keeping America 's children safe from dangerous products must be a top priority ' said Senator Obama .
. . . u2018I urge the President to sign this bill into law as quickly as possible .'u201D [ 1 ]
When Obama entered the White House , he made enforcing this law a priority .
His nominee to head the Consumer Products Safety Commission , Inez Tenenbaum , testified during her confirmation hearings that u201 Cone of the things that is urgent is the full implementation of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement
Act which you passed last year.u201D [ 2 ]
Although standing up for child safety is a pretty safe bet politically , this bill is n't all puppies , rainbows , and smiling babies .
Like most Washington regulation , it has a sordid backstory .
And , as with most instances of Obamanomics , Big Government has been a boon for Big Business and a bane to smaller competitors .
Mattel wins the game
Pulling more than two million toys off the shelf in 2007 was a blow to Mattel 's reputation — it 's hard to generate worse PR than you get for selling over - leaded toys to kids .
Mattel responded to its critics by immediately instituting a new testing regimen for its toys and by working to standardize and streamline the process . [ 3 ]
While Mattel was investing in its factories , it was also investing in Washington .
The company had spent a steady $ 120,000 per year on lobbying from 2002 through 2006 , [ 4 ] but the number ballooned to $ 540,000 in 2007 , the year of the recall .
In 2008 , its lobbying expenditures hit $ 730,000  more than six times what the company had spent two years before . [ 5 ]
In August 2007 , during the recall scandal , Mattel retained the lobbying firm Johnson , Madigan , Peck , Boland & Stewart . [ 6 ]
The company 's lobbyists included Sean Richardson and Sheila Murphy , who had recently been the chief of staff and legislative director , respectively , for Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar .
A month later , Klobuchar became a co-sponsor of CPSIA .
The bill imposed new but bearable costs on Mattel .
Perhaps more important , it promised to provide a government stamp of approval on Mattel 's toys which had  justly  earned the distrust of consumers .
CPSIA established a principle that any children 's product was guilty until proven innocent  or in this case , unsafe until proven safe .
The bill required every manufacturer of children 's products to submit its products to third - party testing for lead and other toxins before selling them .
It also promised to crack down on second - hand sales of products violating the new lead standards .
The law sent shivers through the world of thrift stores .
Products that were perfectly legal to make and sell in 2008 might be outlawed in 2009 .
u201CThis has gotten so serious and it is so frightening because we serve consumers that sometimes have no other way to clothe their children , u201D said Adele Meyer , executive director of the National Association of Resale and Thrift Shops .
She added , u201CYou could wipe out a whole industry .u201D [ 7 ]
Thrift stores did n't have a powerful lobby in Washington , but they had plenty of public sentiment behind them .
In its final days , Bush 's CPSC tried to allay the fears :
The new safety law does not require resellers to test children 's products in inventory for compliance with the lead limit before they are sold .
However , resellers cannot sell children 's products that exceed the lead limit and therefore should avoid products that are likely to have lead content , unless they have testing or other information to indicate the products being sold have less than the new limit .
Those resellers that do sell products in violation of the new limits could face civil and / or criminal penalties . [ 8 ]
You got that , Salvation Army ?
The bill does n't require you to test your products for lead .
But if you sell a product with 301 parts - per-million of lead  even if nobody gets sick  you could get sued or go to jail .
And small craftsmen were threatened by the testing requirement .
Every manufacturer , including grandpa in his woodshed , would need to submit its products to an accredited outside testing facility .
This would be costly and burdensome .
But written into the law was a provision that , while common sense , seriously favored mass - producers .
Look at this guidance from the CPSIA :
If your products need to be tested , and they are materially identical and made in the same fashion with no change in assembly , equipment used , etc. , then a single sample may be all that is necessary for testing purposes .
A change in materials or design can be enough to alter testing results . [ 9 ]
So if you 're rolling 10,000 petroleum - based Barbies off an assembly line in Shanghai , you need test only one .
If you 're making ten sets of children 's rosary beads to donate to the kids in your parish receiving their first communion , you also need to test one  unless these rosaries are unique , or if you made some at home , some at your office , and some while visiting your grandchildren .
In those cases you need to get each one tested — not just each rosary , but each component : the little beads , the big beads , the crucifix , and the string .
Mattel was deploying the u201COverhead Smashu201D : crowding out smaller competitors and potential start - ups by lobbying for stricter regulation .
Obama 's CPSC , to its credit , moved fairly quickly to exclude certain safe materials from testing requirements . [ 10 ]
And come late August  six months after the law took effect  the government lifted the testing burden on Grandpa 's all - wood , unpainted chair  depending on what sort of screws , nails , or joinery he used .
But the CPSC issued another , crucial exemption : the commission voted unanimously to allow Mattel — and only Mattel — to test its own products on - site rather than submit samples to an outside tester . [ 11 ]
Now , this exemption was not given out lightly .
Mattel spent considerable resources developing its own testing facilities , which the company u201Cfirewalled u201D to protect it from corporate influence .
Mattel , through extraordinary effort and expenditure , had earned the right to test its own products .
The company made its case to the CPSC , and the CPSC agreed .
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
There 's no evidence of cronyism or any sort of wrong - doing here , and the law explicitly provided for such exemptions .
But this episode gets at the heart of the problems with Obamanomics .
First , Mattel had already begun developing its own in - house testing regimen before the CPSIA even passed .
We also can tell  thanks to their lobbying filings  that Mattel had significant input into the bill 's drafting .
The relationship was probably a two - way street : Mattel lobbyists guided the bill 's testing requirements to match the company 's testing plans , and lawmakers ' demands on testing helped shape Mattel 's testing process .
And after the law went into effect , the world 's largest toymaker had decent access to Obama 's CPSC .
One day in late August , according to CPSC notes , Mattel executives met with CPSC Chair Inez Tenenbaum and other CPSC commissioners , at the request of Mattel executive Jim Walter . [ 12 ]
Do you think grandpa in the back shed would get meetings with three CPSC commissioners ?
No , Mattel was exploiting the First Law of Obamanomics : u201 CDuring a legislative debate , whichever business has the best lobbyists is most likely to win the most favorable small print .
u201D
Playing the u201CInside Game , u201D Mattel found it easier to follow all the rules because it was there as the rules were being drafted .
Also , consider that no small manufacturer could afford to build its own in - house testing facility .
This was all typical of Big Government , one - size - fits - all regulation : the smaller businesses , many serving the poorer communities , do n't have their own K Street lobbyists ( and certainly not a former chief of staff and a former legislative director for a U.S. Senator ) .
And they get steamrolled .

UPDATE : Officers involved in incident identified
EAST GRAND RAPIDS —
As Stephen Bolick replayed the scene of his son ’s death , he said the details did not add up .
Why , Bolick asked , did it take police three or four Taser stun gun shots to subdue 30 - year - old Matthew Bolick , who , at 5 feet 6 inches tall , weighed just 135 pounds ?
Bolick , described by his family as a loving brother and caring son who loved jazz and camping with friends and was a year away from a bachelor ’s degree in meteorology at Central Michigan University ,
died Monday night while in the custody of East Grand Rapids public safety officers
.
The East Grand Rapids resident was shot by a Taser three or four times after he allegedly struck a police officer in the face outside his family ’s home , 2110 Heather St. SE , shortly before he died about 9:45 p.m. Monday .
Police and an ambulance were dispatched to the home shortly after 9 p.m. , after Stephen Bolick said he called 911 to report injuries his son suffered after he went through a ground - floor picture window .
“ The initial 911 call was for help , not an arrest and certainly not for the use of Tasers , ” Stephen Bolick said Tuesday night .
“ I said , ‘ I need to get this kid to the hospital . ’ ”
Family members struggled to cope with the loss .
Gathered at the home of his 27 - year - old sister , Kellie Kettner , they shared stories about an energetic man who was quick with a joke and committed to social justice .
“ He had a lust and joy for life , ” she said of her brother .
“ He enjoyed life on a daily basis . ”
An autopsy Tuesday determined Bolick did not experience internal trauma from the incident , authorities said .
Forensic pathologist Dr. David Start said there was no indication the Taser caused Bolick ’s death .
Toxicology tests and exams of his heart , lungs and tissue are pending , but the struggle left no internal injuries or head wounds , Start said .
Bolick ’s injuries were consistent with puncture wounds from the Taser probes , with cuts from jumping through the window and scratches from wrestling with officers , Grand Rapids Police Capt .
Jeff Hertel said .
It likely will be several weeks before toxicology results are available , Start said .
At a news conference Tuesday , East Grand Rapids Public Safety Chief Mark Herald said two of the department 's veteran officers arrived Monday night outside the Bolick family 's home when Matthew Bolick confronted them and hit one in the face .
Bolick was struck once with a Taser “ with no apparent effect ” and then ran into the home where “ there was a lot of wrestling around , ” he said .
Bolick was hit with the Taser again before Grand Rapids police arrived .
An ambulance crew called in to treat Bolick ’s injury from the broken window helped officers treat him at the scene .
Bolick is the East Grand Rapids department ’s first in - custody death , Herald said .
The incident also was the first time any East Grand Rapids officer had used one of the Tasers , purchased in January , he said .
Tasers fire electrically charged darts to temporarily immobilize a subject .
Asked when officers can use the device , Herald said : “ They can deploy the Taser whenever there is active resistance . ”
The two East Grand Rapids officers involved have been placed on administrative leave , which is standard procedure in such cases , he said .
“ There is some indication ( Bolick ’s ) behavior pattern has become more unstable over the past couple of weeks , ” Grand Rapids Police Chief Kevin Belk said .
Grand Rapids officers searched Bolick ’s home after his arrest , but Belk declined to say what , if any , evidence was found inside .
Herald said the Tasers are equipped with video cameras that record incidents and that two police cars on the scene also had cameras .
The Grand Rapids police ’s major case team and internal affairs are investigating the death .
Bolick had a pair of 1999 charges in Portage and pleaded guilty to misdemeanors of failure to display a license and being a minor in possession of alcohol , according to Michigan State Police records .
Tears welled for Stephen Bolick as he described the incident and losing a son who “ would never hurt anybody . ”
“ When he came into my house , he was alive , ” Bolick said .
“ When he came out he was dead . ”
Funeral services are 11 a.m. Saturday at First Evangelical Free Church , 3950 Burton St. SE .
Visitation is 2 to 4 and 7 to 9 p.m. Thursdayat Zaagman Memorial Chapel , 2800 Burton St. SE .
Survivors include his parents , Stephen and Ann Bolick ; two sisters , Kettner and Allison Helmholdt ; and two brothers , Kevin Bolick and Jonathan Bolick .

( last updated 9:05 a.m. 9 December 2009 ) .
I get so many questions from readers about a variety of global warming issues that I thought I would whip up some Q&A for those who want to understand the views of skeptics a little better .
I will try to update these with links and additional answers as time permits .
Climate science is complex and the study of it is highly specialized .
Nevertheless , there is a common theme that runs through the claims of the global warming establishment , from Al Gore ’s movie An Inconvenient Truth , to the UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) : Weather and climate events that happen naturally are being increasingly blamed on the activities of humans .
So , causation is at the root of most beliefs about global warming and climate change .
As one digs further into the science , the direction of causation also emerges as a key theme , and it is one that can totally change the degree to which it appears humans affect the climate system .
In my own area of research I have found that mixing up cause and effect when examining how cloud cover varies with temperature has greatly misled the scientific establishment regarding how sensitive the climate system is to our addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere .
Not all skeptics believe the same things , though , so some skeptics will object to some of what I have listed below .
These represent my opinions , not all of which are necessarily ascribed to by other skeptics .
Additional details on many of these issues can be found throughout this website , including a Q&A list I published on April 19 , 2009 .
The following list , in no particular order , are my responses to common claims and accusations about global warming skeptics .
If other scientists or laypersons want me to add to the list , or want to argue for changes , email me and I will update it as appropriate .
Please be sure to check back for the latest update ( posted above ) .
1. Skeptics deny global warming .
No , we deny that warming has been mostly human - caused .
2. Skeptics are paid by big oil .
The vast majority of skeptics have never been paid anything by Big Oil ( me included ) .
3 . Skeptics do n’t publish in the peer reviewed literature .
Wrong … but it is true we do not have nearly as many publications as the other side does .
But it only takes one scientific study to destroy a scientific hypothesis , which is what anthropogenic global warming theory is .
4. Skeptics are not unified with an alternative explanation for global warming .
Well , that ’s the way science works in a field as immature as climate change science .
The biggest problem is that we really do n’t understand what causes natural climate variability .
Kevin Trenberth has now famously admitted as much in one of the Climategate emails , where said it ’s a “ travesty ” that we do n’t know why warming has stopped in the last 7 to 10 years .
For century - time - scale changes , some believe it is cloud cover being modulated by cosmic ray activity , which is in turn affected by sunspot activity .
A few others think it is changes in the total energy output of the sun ( possible , but I personally doubt it ) .
In my opinion , it is internal , chaotic variability in the ocean and atmosphere circulation causing small changes in cloud cover .
Since clouds are a natural sunshade , changing their coverage of the Earth will cause warming or cooling .
The IPCC simply assumes this does not happen .
If they did , they would have to admit that natural climate change happens , which means they would have to address the possibility that most of the warming in the last 50 has been largely natural in origin .
5 . But the glaciers are melting !
Many glaciers which have been monitored around the world for a long time have been retreating since the 1800 ’s , before humans could have been responsible .
A few retreating glaciers are even revealing old tree stumps … how did those get there ?
Planted by skeptics ?
6 . But the sea ice is melting !
Well , the same thing happened back in the 1920 ’s and 1930 ’s , with the Northwest Passage opening up in 1940 .
It was just as warm , or nearly as warm , in the Arctic in the 1930’s .
Again , this is before humans could be blamed .
There were very low water levels in the Great Lakes in the 1920 ’s too , just as has happened recently .
We have accurate measurements of sea ice cover from satellites only since 1979 , so there is no way to really know whether sea ice cover is less than it was before .
7 . But we just had the warmest decade in recorded history !
Well , if thermometer measurements had started in , say 200 , AD ( rather than in the 1800 ’s ) , and it was now 850 AD , the same thing might well have been said back then .
The climate system is always warming or cooling , and the Industrial Revolution ( and thus our carbon dioxide emissions ) just happened to occur while we were still emerging from the Little Ice Age …a warming period .
8 . But the Antarctic ice shelves are collapsing !
Well , sea ice around Antarctica has been expanding since we started monitoring by satellite in 1979 …. so which do we use as evidence ?
There is no convincing evidence of warming in Antarctica , except in the relatively small Antarctic Peninsula , which juts out into the ocean .
Just as glaciers naturally flow to the sea , ice shelves must eventually break off .
It is very uncertain how often this happens through the centuries , and what has been observed in recent years might be entirely normal .
Similarly , it was warmer in Greenland in the 1930 ’s than it has been more recently .
9 . But the sea levels are rising !
Yes , and from what we can tell , they have been rising since the end of the last Ice Age .
Again , the more recent rise might be just a consequence of our emergence from the Little Ice Age , which bottomed out in the 1600’s .
10 .
But we keep emitting carbon dioxide , which we know is a greenhouse gas !
Yes , I agree .
But the direct warming effect of moré CO2 is agreed by all to be small … and I predict that when we better understand how clouds change in response to that small warming influence , the net warming in response to more CO2 will be smaller still .
This is the “ feedback ” issue , which determines “ climate sensitivity ” , the area of research I spend most of my time on .
I and a minority of other scientists believe the net feedbacks in the climate system are negative , probably driven by negative cloud feedback .
In contrast , all twenty - something IPCC climate models now exhibit positive cloud feedback .
11 . But we ca n’t keep pumping CO2 into the atmosphere forever !
No , and we wo n’t .
Assuming fossil fuels will be increasingly difficult to find and access in the coming decades , the continuing demand for energy ensures that new energy technologies will be developed .
It ’s what humans do…adapt .
12 . But we should n’t be interfering with nature !
Actually , it would be impossible to NOT interfere with nature .
Chaos theory tells us that everything that happens , naturally or anthropogenically , forever alters the future state of the climate system .
I predict that science will eventually understand that more CO2 is good for life on Earth .
This does n’t mean it will be good for every single species … but when Mother Nature changes the climate system , there are always winners and losers anyway .
In the end , this is a religious issue , not a scientific one .
Interestingly I have found that the vast majority of scientists also have the religious belief that we should not be impacting nature .
I believe this has negatively affected their scientific objectivity .
Bascially , several dozen Tea Baggers held an anti-immigration rally on the steps of the Minnesota State Capitol where they were met by an only slightly smaller group of counter - protesters .
The highlight of the event is the speech by " Robert Erickson , " a " concerned citizen from Minneapolis . "
Erickson launches into what seems like a standard red-meat anti-immigrant speech .
His real intentions are betrayed only by a slight smirk .
It is only when he accuses immigrants of spreading disease and then indicts them for " killing millions " with small pox that it becomes clear that the immigrants he has in mind are the European conquerors of North America and their descendants .
The Tea -Baggers seem pretty clueless , and for the most part do n't even seem to realize they have been punk'd , even when Erickson closes out with a chant of " Columbus Go Home ! "
UPDATE
Here , from http://twincities.indymedia.org/... is the text of Erickson 's prepared speech :
" Columbus Go Home ! " : Prepared transcript of " Robert Erickson 's " speech :
Hi , my name is Robert Erickson and I ’m really excited to be here .
Its people like all of you , and events like this that make our country great !
Give yourselves a round of applause !
I just want to talk about a couple themes this afternoon because I love this country and I want to see America be the best place it can be .
Mr. Gutierrez is getting ready to propose an immigration bill in just a few short days , and we have to make sure he knows that we want a bill that ’s tough on immigration .
Now is the time for us to stand up and make our voices heard !
In Minneapolis , where I ’m from , we have a huge immigrant population that ’s been causing a number of problems .
With the economy in recession , and so many people getting laid off , and unable to find work , immigrants should not be competing for the few jobs that are out there .
Its just not fair to the folks who have a claim to this land and the right to be here .
All across America , they are contributing to the flooding of our job markets making it hard for American ’s to find jobs .
Well I ’m fed up and its time to let our politicians know that enough is enough , and we ’re not gonna take it any more !
We need to secure our borders to protect our country .
We need to restore order and put an end to the anarchy that ’s sweeping the nation .
We need tougher immigration laws to make sure that we send these people back where they came from .
We need to protect the sovereignty of the real Americans .
We need to hold our politicians accountable .
Its no secret that with an invasion of immigrants , comes waves of crime .
We see them involved in massive theft , in murder , and bringing diseases like smallpox , which is responsible for the death of millions of Americans .
These are n’t new problems though , they have been going on for hundreds of years , and continue to this day .
I say its time for us to say enough is enough !
Are you with me ?
Are you with me ?
Lets send these European immigrants back where they came from !
I do n’t care if they are Polish , Irish , English , Italian , or Norwegian !
European immigrants are responsible for the most violent and heinus crimes in the history of the world , including genocide and slavery !
Its time to restore the sovereignty of people native to this land !
I want more workplace raids , starting with the big banks downtown .
There are thousands of illegals working in those buildings , hiding in their offices , and taking Dakota jobs .
Let 's round them up and ship them out .
Then we need to hit them at home where they sleep , I do n’t care if we separate families , they should have known better when they came here illegally !
If we are n't able to stand up to these European immigrants , who can we stand up to ?
We need to send every one of them back home , right now .
Thank you very much , and we ’ll see you in the streets !
Columbus go home !
Columbus go home !
Columbus go home !

Toro from Boston -
This was arguably the best toro sashimi I 've had in all my Urasawa visits .
It was incredibly unctuous and oozed oil upon chewing , but yet , at the same time , it remained light , delicate in flavor .
It was delicious on its own , but even better when balanced by the wasabi and soy .
Tai from Kyushu - A clean , crisp cut of snapper , this was textbook tai , with a mild flavor that was good with the wasabi , but superb with the tart red cabbage .
Uni from Hokkaido -
Perhaps the perfect uni : unabashedly sweet , yet kissed with the briny essence of the ocean .
Even better when paired with the seaweed .
Hamo -
The king eel had a surprisingly rich flavor , as well as a soft , spongy texture .
It went superbly with the sweet ponzu .
Hotategai - Next to go was the scallop -- firm and unconscionably sweet .
Kagoshima Wagyu -
My favorite of this set , this had the perfect amount of fat , giving the beef an absurdly pleasing texture , and a flavor that was deftly offset by the use of scallion .
Foie Gras -
Cooked the longest , the foie had a firm , yet yielding texture and a subtle , sublime sapor that just lingered in my mouth .
Even James , who was n't previously a fan of the liver , enjoyed this .
Kombu -
I made sure to eat the kombu separately this time , and it was some of the best kelp I 've had .
It was from Sendai , Miyagi Prefecture , and possessed a sweet , satisfying smack and a wonderfully crisp consistency .
This post documents my fifth visit to Urasawa , which was actually gratis to me , thanks to a little bet I " won " from a friend and former colleague of mine ( thanks James ! ) .
As such , I 'll skip the pleasantries and get right into the amazing experience that is Urasawa .
As usual , I booked the entire bar ( 10 persons max ) , and joining me this time were Ann of Menu Taster , Jasmine & Jeff of Recipe Mama , Ryan of Only Eat What Feeds Your Soul , as well as other non-bloggers .
For my previous visits , see March 2009 May 2008 , and November 2006
Here we see the fish case for the night , which would be nearly emptied by the time we were through with it .
Can you identify all the various items ?
Click for my attempt .
Assistant Ken-san shows off a massive chunk of beautifully - marbled wagyu beef from Kagoshima Prefecture .
A rib eye cut perhaps ?
A dinner at Urasawa requires libations that will pass muster with the victuals .
Thus , for this outing , we brought the " Three Wise Men " of Champagne : Vintage Krug , Cristal , and Dom Perignon ( provided by James , myself , and Bruce , respectively ) ...... But we also knew that three bottles of bubbly would n't be enough to completely wet our whistles .
We thus requested to see the drink list , shown above ; click for larger versions .
I always appreciate Urasawa 's sake list , and on this visit , I noted the addition of two sakes from Miyagi Prefecture : the Hakurakusei Junmai - Daiginjo and the Katsuyama Junmai - Daiginjo .
Gone is the Horeki - Daishichi Junmai - Daiginjo from Fukushima , previously the most expensive bottle on the list ; that spot is now taken up by the " cult " favorite Juyondai .
The note about the " special sake " we had last time was also removed .
No changes in terms of Champagne or red wine , though there were a couple new Chardonnays from Peter Michael and Kistler .
And unfortunately , no new beers , just the " big three " Japanese macrobrews of Asahi , Kirin , and Sapporo ( which is why I 've never had beer at Urasawa ! ) .
I 've been liking namazake more and more as of late .
The term refers to unpasteurized sake , which requires refrigeration and has a short shelf life , but which is also greener , more rustic , more in - your - face .
The namazake rotates regularly at Urasawa , given that the beverage is somewhat seasonal , and the example tonight was the Watari Bune , Shiboritate Namazake Genshu , Junmai - Ginjo from Ibaraki Prefecture [ $ 80 ] .
Watari
Bune is the name of the rice strain used to brew this sake , a varietal that was popular in the early 1900's for its quality , but which fell into obscurity thanks to the rise in prominence of the hardier Yamada Nishiki type .
The old school rice was reintroduced by Takaaki Yamauchi of Huchu Homare brewery when he planted some seedlings in 1988 , subsequently introducing the Watari Bune brand in 1990 .
In any case , getting back to the sake at hand , I found it sweet , viscous , and bright , with subtle melon notes and a bit of fire on the finish .
Quite refreshing .
Here we see Hiro - san prepping our first course of the night .-
Hiro -san usually likes to start with a light toro tataki dish , and tonight 's iteration had seared toro wrapped around an amalgam of shrimp , uni , and shiso , topped with radish , scallion , and shiso flower , garnished with yuzu juice and skin , soy , vinegar , and sweet sake ( mirin ) .
The attack was a mixture of sweet and tangy , a somewhat bracing sensation that eventually gave way to the sweeter , creamier midpalate , thanks to the uni and ebi , no doubt .
The finish was flush with citrus and it was here that the flavor of the fish finally came to the fore .
The shrimp , meanwhile , provided a pleasing snap and crunch that livened up the dish texturally . -
Next up was an egg custard with shiitake mushroom and shiro ebi , covered with ikura and topped with mitsuba and 23 - carat gold .
Dipping into the silky chawanmushi , I noted a fantastic contrast between the briny , salty roe and the rich , luscious egg custard .
The mitsuba gave the dish a sharp tang while the mushroom and shrimp added a palpable weight and provided a bit of textural variation as well .
Very good .-
I loved the presentation of this one : a big wooden spoon heaping with chopped wagyu beef , pickled radish , caviar , scallion , and shiso , all topped with uni .
A luxurious dish , I first experienced a tangy attack on account of the radish , which really tempered the decadence of the beef .
At the same time , the uni acted as a moderating element , while the generous dollop of caviar was relegated to a supporting player .
The long , lingering finish was dominated by the admixture of beef and pickles .
With our sake dispensed with , it was time to break out the bubbly .
First up was the 1996 Moët & Chandon Champagne Cuvée Dom Pérignon Rosé .
I 'm a sucker for pink , so I reveled in the DP 's balanced , subtly sweet commixture of citrus , floral , and mineral notes , along with its fresh , florid , alluring structure -- gorgeous .
Ken-san helps with the sashimi .-
The sashimi course is one of the constants at an Urasawa dinner .
Placed in a hand - carved block of ice were : Garnishes include the aforementioned freshly - grated wasabi ( from Shizuoka I believe ) , soy ( from Wakayama ) , red cabbage , and seaweed , as well as carrot , white daikon , and green daikon .
The flowers ( not sure what type ) are usually garnered from local flower markets . -
Ichigoni refers to a type of summer soup , typically made with awabi and uni .
The name means " wild strawberries , " and refers to the strawberry - esque appearance of cooked sea urchin .
Here , we were treated to a more upscale version : served in a tagine - like vessel were abalone from Chiba , shrimp , Japanese shark 's fin ( fukahire ) , and the Hokkaido uni .
I started with the awabi , which was tender , yet satisfying to chew , with a uniquely gelatinous consistency that was n't what I was expecting .
I then had the abalone entrails , which were sweet and gamy , a stark contrast to the mild flavor of the mollusk 's adductor muscle .
The shrimp was plump , snappy , and satisfying , but the standout here was the shark fin : gossamer , ethereal , imbued with the flavor of all the other ingredients .
It reminded me of why it 's considered such a desirable delicacy .
A now , a bit of pyrotechnic action : for the next course , Hiro - san poured sake into our pots , thereby releasing enveloping clouds of steam as the sake evaporated upon contact with the pots ' sizzling stones . -
The pot contained Japanese beef wrapped around shrimp , shiitake , and uni , steamed with sake ; it came with an oroshi ponzu ( ponzu with daikon radish ) dipping sauce .
What struck me about the dish was the temperature contrast between hot and cold -- the interplay between warm beef and its cool fillings -- fantastic .
Flavor - wise , the morsels were sweet initially , with the richness of the wagyu coming in afterwards , while the ponzu provided a tart complement .
The finish , meanwhile , was uniquely uni-tinged while the ebi did wonders texturally . -
It 's hard to go wrong with tempura , and here we had a fine example of anago , or sea / conger eel , from Tokyo Bay ( the top spot for eel I 'm told ) .
This was actually my first time with anago tempura , and I really appreciated its delicate white flesh , mild flavor , and crispy , savory battered exterior .
As usual , the tempura was paired with a tentsuyu dipping sauce and a mound of grated daikon and ginger .
The sauce elevated the dish , adding a sweet / tangy component to the anago that really made for a great pairing .
Our second sake was the Hiroki , Special Classic , Tokubetsu Junmai from Fukushima [ $ 90 ] , which I 'd had at Hachi previously .
As I understand it , Hiroki is part of a " new school " style of sake that 's become very popular as of late .
The president of Hiroki Brewing is also its toji ( brew master ) , and interestingly , he 's apparently never formally studied sake - making .
This gives him an unconventional , unorthodox style that leads to the creation of the bold , distinctive sakes that the company is known for .
A 55 % seimaibuai sake made from Yamadanishiki , the Hiroki was floral , fruity , light , crisp yet full - bodied , and most importantly , delicious . -
The stone - seared toro is always one of Urasawa 's most highly anticipated courses , and for good reason !
Upon touching the stone , the toro released a cloud of rich , savory smoke that whetted our appetites even more .
Eating the toro was almost like eating a ridiculously - marbled piece of beef -- it pretty much broke apart in my mouth upon mastication .
I absolutely adored the unabashedly unctuous consistency of the fish , and how the fat , flesh , and char interacted in my mouth .
The paired ponzu , meanwhile , did its part in cutting the decadence of the toro , but the fish 's sapor lived on in a ridiculously lingering finish . -
Next to the seared toro above , the shabu shabu course is also one of the most sought after dishes at Urasawa .
There are always slight variations in the assortment of shabu items , and this time we were given the following : -
The resultant shabu shabu broth is always a treat to imbibe .
The key here is the foie gras ; note how the liver 's fats are visible on the soup 's surface .
This provides for a heavy , hearty stock absolutely saturated with the pure essence of foie gras .
Yet , it was not overwhelming , thanks in part to the light , vegetal tang of the scallion .
And with that , it was time to move on to the sushi portion of the meal .
The gari signals the start of the nigiri gauntlet , and Urasawa 's is probably the best I 've had , with a certain sweetness you wo n't find in the mass - market variety -- this taught me to appreciate ginger .
Above , we see Hiro - san crafting and serving the first piece of sushi .
Nigiri is served with all the accoutrements applied already - - a brush of soy , a sprinkle of grated sudachi , a splash of yuzu juice -- all that 's required of the diner is to chew and savor . -
Unlike at just about every other sushi place , Urasawa 's omakase starts with toro , and that 's perfectly fine with me .
The fish was certainly deserving of the moniker melt - in - your - mouth , enveloping my palate with its luxuriousness .
The fat was mitigated by the application of wasabi , resulting in something decadent , yet delicate .
Superb .
For our next potable , we decided to tap the 2002 Louis Roederer Champagne Cristal Brut .
Though the wine was still quite floral and citrus-y , it was a bit more austere than I remembered , with a pronounced dryness backed by subtle toasty notes .
Still very good -- light and bright .
Note the different flute used here vis-à - vis the Dom Perignon and Krug ; this was , I 'm sure , due to the fact that the Roederer was a much younger wine ( 2002 vs. 1996/1995 ) .-
Given how good the toro is , you 'd think that you should just leave well enough alone .
However , lightly searing the tuna yields wondrous results , making the fish even more unctuous , even more profound , with the taste of the char contrasting beautifully with the toro 's natural succulence . -
Flavor - wise , the kanpachi was n't terribly distinctive -- clean , mild , and nicely accented by the wasabi .
What wowed me here was the impeccable texture , a stunning combination of snap and yield . -
Aji's arguably my favorite sushi fish , and this quintessential example merely reinforced that notion .
The flesh was firm , a satisfying chew , while the taste was very fine , not fishy at all .
Note the lovely scoring of the skin . - From Kyushu island comes this belly of tai .
Snapper is a fitting nomenclature for the fish , given its snappy texture !
Truly a paragon of tai , the combination of soy and sudachi was perfect , and note the crosshatch pattern on the fish 's top surface .
Hiro-san and tuna : a winning combination .-
Regular tuna can be a bit boring , but this was just about the softest , most buttery piece of maguro I 've ever had , more buttery than many pieces of toro I 've eaten in fact !
In terms of taste though , it was very mild , so the texture was key here . -
On my May 2008 visit , the shima aji was my favorite piece of sushi , and though it did n't reach quite the same lofty heights this time around , the shima aji was nevertheless quite tasty , with a light , refined flavor accented by a sharp wasabi finish .
The best part about the fish was its firm , crisp texture . -
From Japan comes this creamy , palate - coating squid that gave my mouth quite the workout .
Taste - wise , the ika was subtly sweet , aptly accented by the grated sudachi and salt . -
I 've had shiitake nigiri on every visit here so far , yet Urasawa remains the only place where I 've seen it done .
The preparation really brings out the smoky , woody , earthy nature of the mushroom , balanced by the rice and wasabi .
Our final bottle was this 1995 Krug Champagne Brut .
I noted a bit of citrus on an otherwise oaky nose , but on the palate , this was quickly overcome by intense notes of caramel , toast , and stone .
Brazenly dry , with a silky body , laser - tight focus , and a protracted , prolonged finish .
Very typical of the Krug style , and reminiscent of the 1990 I had at Sasabune - I must say , this was some of the best uni I 've ever had .
Delicate , sweet , and super - creamy , it was a model of what sea urchin should be .
And the wasabi kick at the end ?
Beautiful .
It even managed to convince James , who 'd previously had an uni aversion . -
I 've had plenty of toro and plenty of maguro at Urasawa , but amazingly , this was the first time that chu -toro was served .
As expected , it had a richer , fattier flavor than the standard tuna , though it obviously was n't up to the level of toro .
What surprised me however was that the texture was a bit more unyielding than the standard hon maguro . -
Urasawa remains the only place where I 've been served nigiri made from shiro ebi , small white shrimp gathered off the coast of Toyama Prefecture .
Given their small size , about a score of shrimp was needed to construct a single piece of sushi , and the mass broke apart instantly upon mastication .
Their flavor was mildly sweet , and very creamy , with a gelatinous body . -
From Japan came this abalone , with a subtle sweetness that was perked up by the application of tangy grated sudachi and fiery wasabi .
Texturally it was firm , though somewhat supple , not overly crunchy .
Note the scoring on the surface of the awabi .-
The award for crunchiest item of the night would be taken by this mirugai , a .k.a. giant clam or elephant truck clam .
It was a very pleasing crispness though , not tough at all , but satisfying .
In terms of flavor , it had an intense , briny smack , backed by a bit of sweetness .-
At this point , Hiro - san asked us if we 'd like more toro .
The correct answer is , of course : " yes please ! "
It was much the same as the previous one : scrumptious . -
Kohada is also known as Japanese gizzard shad , or Japanese herring as Hiro - san likes to call it .
It was an oily fish , with a strong yet slightly sugary taste , lovely skin , and a uniquely firm consistency .
Quite nice .-
Containing chopped toro , negi ( leek ) , and takuan ( pickled daikon , which aids in digestion ) , this is just about the only maki roll you 'll see at Urasawa .
What struck me was the texture of the pickle , which gave the roll a wondrous crunch and sour flavor .
The leek , meanwhile , providing a bracing tang that tempered the lavishness of the toro .
The roll is shown here sitting in soy sauce .-
Of the nigiri , the gyusashi is one of the ones that I look forward to the most .
It did n't disappoint this time either , with an incredible beefy sumptuousness balanced by the mitigating tang of citrus .
One of the tastiest bites of the night !-
Another round of uni .
What happened was that Hiro - san accidentally got more uni than he needed , and thus had to " get rid of it , " which was fine by us !
I 've only had Santa Barbara uni on my previous visits , so it was nice to have the Hokkaido version this time , considered the finest in the world I understand , with a season running from May to October .
What I 'd really like to do is compare Santa Barbara and Hokkaido back - to - back and see if I can discern a difference .
Hiro - san then surprised us by bringing out live shrimp from tanks beneath the counter .
Here we see him and Ken- san breaking them apart . -
This was pretty much the acme of amaebi : sweet yet briny , creamy yet crunchy .
It was heightened by the use of a sauce made from the shrimp 's innards , which gave the amaebi a distinctly sweet - metallic tinge .
One of my dining companions called it the best amaebi he 's ever had , and I can see why . -
Here 's something I did n't know : at Urasawa , you can request sashimi versions of the nigiri sushi , as we see here .
Instead of entrails sauce , the amaebi is accompanied simply by a dollop of wasabi .
The end result is a very different experience than with the sushi : the texture was even more apparent in this case , and the flavor was much milder , with the sweetness accentuated . -
Here we have another item that I 've only seen at Urasawa -- an amalgamation of chopped aji , Kyoto miso , scallion , shiso , and ginger .
This is one that I always look forward to , as it has a great base of aji to begin with , which is then accented by the sweetness of the miso and the invigorating savor of the shiso - scallion - ginger complex .
Excellent .-
Our second round of chu -toro here .
Think of a fattier maguro .
Delish !-
Compared to the first , I liked the texture of this one even better .-
I usually tend to favor unagi over anago for its more unctuous nature , but this version would give unagi a run for its money .
It was suitable fatty , suitably lush , and well - accented by the included sweet sauce ( we told the newbies that it was chocolate sauce ! ) .
I think this might 've been the best anago I 've had yet at Urasawa . -
Unlike most places ' tamago , the example here resembles a cake more than an omelet , perhaps even resembling datemaki in that regard .
Dense , heavy , and moist , its flavor was an intriguing interplay of sweet and savory . -
And with that , we were on to desserts .
The first was this gelée of peach , topped with goji berry ( a.k.a. wolfberry ) and gold foil .
The gelatin had a surprisingly unyielding consistency , and a taste that was like eating liquefied peach .
Chunks of the fruit made for a nice textural variation . -
Urasawa 's sesame ice cream always satisfies .
We asked Hiro - san what was in it and he responded that soy milk , cream cheese , and honey were used .
No matter , the result was an ice cream absolutely infused with the pure quintessence of sesame .
I wish I could take a pint or two home !
Using a chasen , Hiro - sans whisks up some matcha tea to serve with the desserts .
Note the decorative place mat employed ; does it carry any significance ?-
Matcha is a variety of powdered green tea , often used in Japanese tea ceremonies .
The tea's texture was frothy , gritty , and grainy , with a strong , bitter flavor that cut right through the sugariness of the desserts .-
The second tea was a roasted green tea .
Mild and easy - drinking , it was a nice way to close out a meal and Urasawa , and I always find myself having multiple cups of it .
As has become Urasawa tradition , we now present the sum of the night 's damage .
Though not as heinous as last time , it still came out to $ 500 per person .
What can I say about Urasawa that has n't already been said ?
Though this is now my fifth visit , I can say that the place never disappoints , and that I look forward to and treasure every meal I have here .
James described the experience as a " symphony of food " in terms of a progression of flavors , and I think that the phrase sums things up nicely .
During the meal , Hiro-san and I discussed how the vaunted Michelin guide was leaving LA , and the reasons behind the move .
Urasawa may never get its third star , but if there 's any place in the City that deserves it , this 'd be the spot .
Alright , I need some help here .
I 've definitely been around the Internet quite a bit , but I do n't think I can figure every single meme hidden in this picture .
Like that poster to the right of Pedobear .
What 's that about ?

As some of you have pointed out , this image is a collection of memes loved by the fantastic folks of reddit and created by the talented licenseplate as part of the reddit secret Santa gift exchange .

Java Platform Enterprise Edition ( EE ) 6 , featuring a capability for function - based profiles , has been approved by the official Java standards body , with an implementation of the specification to follow from Sun Microsystems in about two weeks .
Sun 's enterprise Java implementation has dominated the industry .
The official specification for Java EE 6 , Java Specification Request 316 , received final approval late - Monday evening by the Java Community Process 's Executive Committee for SE / EE .
Deliberations on the proposal had transpired for about three years .
[ See how the vendors stack up in InfoWorld 's Test Center survey of Java in the cloud .

With the profiles capability , profiles can be built for specific functions such as a Web profile for Web developers .
Other profiles , such as one for telecommunications , have been anticipated .
Other features in Java EE 6 include a pruning process for making parts of the platform optional , as well as backing for scripting languages and REST ( Representational State Transfer ) .
" In the past eight years , the Java EE platform has grown and matured and is now able to cover a wide range of enterprise and Web application development needs , " the official description of JSR 316 states .
" In addition , the Java EE platform has fostered a vibrant community and marketplace for additional technologies , frameworks , and applications that work with the platform .
Some of these provide facilities that are missing from the platform .
Others provide alternatives to platform facilities .
A major theme for this release is to embrace and support those technologies as part of the overall Java EE landscape while also continuing to simplify the platform to better target a wider range of developers .
To that end we propose two goals for this release - extensibility and profiles . "
The vote to approve JSR - 316 passed with 12 yes votes , one no vote , one nonvote , and two abstentions .
Voting in favor of the measure were companies such as Sun , Oracle ( which is in the process of trying to acquire Sun ) , IBM , Google , and Red Hat .
The Apache Software Foundation , citing a long - standing dispute with Sun over a technology compatibility kit for its Harmony version of Java , voted against the specification , while adding its vote was not reflective of the technical merits of the proposal .
IBM also said its vote was based on the technical merits of the JSR but not on the licensing terms .
IBM did , however , express concerns about injection programming support defined by the platform and pledged to continue to support development of a single integrated , extensible injection programming model .
" We remain concerned that the injection support defined by the platform will create unnecessary difficulties for the community , " IBM said .
SAP and Intel abstained , while SpringSource did not vote .
Red Hat , in an e-mail , cited inclusion of its JBoss Seam framework for Web 2.0 applications in Java EE 6 .

A Vietnamese man has been sleeping next to his wife ’s corpse for the last five years .
Le Van , a 55 - year - old man from Quang Nam province , Vietnam , lost his wife in 2003 .
Because he could n’t go to sleep at night without hugging his beloved spouse , he slept on top of her grave for about 20 months .
When he could n’t stand the rain and wind anymore , he decided to dig a tunnel into the grave , so he could sleep with his wife .
When the kids heard his crazy plan , they did everything they could to stop him , so Le Van had to think of another way he could cuddle up to his wife at night .
In 2004 he unearthed her remains , wrapped them in pieces of paper and a clay mould and put a dummy mask on her face .
The man has been sleeping next to his dead wife ever since .
Toyota Dethroned as World ’s Largest Automaker
A year after Japanese manufacturer Toyota took the number 1 spot as world ’s largest automaker from General Motors , the crown was wrestled away and took in by German Volkswagen - Porsche ( VW ) .
Owing to state - backed stimulus packages around the globe , VW produced 4.4 million vehicles compared to Toyota ’s 4 million units .
Since VW gained the crown by stimulus packages , analysts believe that the hold to the number ones spot may not last long .
Toyota may move back again once those package deals run out not to mention that the production demands of Toyota is picking up again .
Toyota has the capacity to produce 10 million units in a single year .
The remaining edge of VW over Toyota after the packages dry up will be it ’s huge sales in the Chinese market .
VW also reached the milestone after a forced take - over of Porsche earlier this year when the latter failed to take - over the former .
Another contributing factor is the benefits garnered by VW in the clash - for - clunkers programs in Europe .
These benefits may have been better than Toyota ’s sales win over Volkswagen in the United States ’ own car - swap program .
American General Motors was world number 1 three years ago , now sits third globally .

OTTAWA–Angry Liberals Wednesday accused the Conservative government of reaching a new political low by circulating flyers characterizing the Liberals as anti-Semitic .
The flyers , which feature a photo of Prime Minister Stephen Harper , target ridings with large Jewish communities .
They accuse the Liberals of participating in the 2001 UN racism conference in Durban , South Africa , which the pamphlets describe as overtly anti-Semitic , and of supporting terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah .
The flyers go after Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff for accusing Israel of committing war crimes .
" It is the lowest that I have seen in all of my experience on Parliament Hill .
...
Nobody could have ever imagined that the Prime Minister of Canada and a Conservative party could stoop this low .
It 's the worst of the worst , " Toronto Liberal MP Joe Volpe ( Eglinton - Lawrence ) told reporters .
The one - page flyer , which is a type known on Parliament Hill as a " 10 - per- center " for the rule that allows them to be mailed outside an MP 's riding to a number of households equivalent to 10 per cent of those in the MP 's riding , contrasts what it says are the Conservative and Liberal records on global anti-Semitism , Israel and Hamas .
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said the flyer notes a difference in records on issues of interest to supporters of Israel and to the Jewish community , and he denied the Conservatives were trying to suggest the Liberals were anti-Semitic .
" Anyone who 's suggesting that is being completely over the top and mischievous , " he told reporters .
The pamplets ask voters to choose which federal leader " is on the right track to represent and defend the values of Canada 's Jewish community . "
And they compare Harper 's strong support for Israel to alleged waffling on the part of the Liberals .
They say , for instance , that Harper 's Conservatives " led the world " in boycotting the second UN - sponsored conference on racism in Durban , dubbed a " hate fest against Israel . "
By contrast , the previous Liberal government " willingly participated in ( the ) overtly anti-Semitic " first Durban conference in 2001 , the pamphlets say .
Whereas Harper " strongly backed Israel 's right to self - defence against Hezbollah " during the bombardment of Lebanon in 2006 , Ignatieff " accused Israel of committing war crimes , " the pamphlets say .
And whereas the Harper government " led the world " in halting funding to the Hamas - led Palestinian Authority , the leaflets say , Liberals opposed the move and wanted Hezbollah delisted as a terrorist organization .
Montreal Liberal MP Irwin Cotler , who is Jewish , was visibly shaken by the flyer , which went to his Mount Royal riding as well as Volpe 's riding , Liberal MP Anita Neville 's Winnipeg South Centre riding , Liberal MP Bernard Patry 's Pierrefonds - Dollard riding and New Democrat Thomas Mulcair 's Montreal riding of Outremont .
" This is totally misleading , it 's false ... and it basically seeks to associate the Liberal party with anti-Semitism .
This is shocking ... this has no place in Canadian politics , " Cotler said .
The former Liberal justice minister noted it was a Liberal government that banned financial support to Hamas and Hezbollah .
" Let the facts show ... that it was the Liberal party in 2002 ( that ) listed Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations .
This notion that we somehow sought the delisting of Hezbollah or somehow ( we are ) indulging terrorism is a scandalous misrepresentation , " Cotler said .
The reference to Durban , the controversial UN World Conference against Racism held Aug. 31 to Sept. 8 , 2001 , which provided a platform for anti-Israeli sentiment , is also misleading , the Liberals said .
Cotler said he went to Durban as an observer and he noted the Israeli government of the day specifically asked Canada to remain at the conference " and make its voice felt and bear witness to what was happening . "
Cotler said Ignatieff did accuse Israel of committing war crimes in one instance during the 2006 conflict in Lebanon , but later publicly apologized .
Volpe described the flyer as the most " egregious example of misrepresentation of facts that I have seen in all the years I 've served in Parliament . "
New Democrat and Bloc Québécois
MPs agreed the pamphlets represented a new low in the partisan use of " 10 - per- center " mailings .
Mulcair , the NDP 's deputy leader , called for " an examination of conscience as to how much taxpayers ' money we 're spending on these very partisan attacks . "
Historically , Canada 's Jewish voters have stood with the Liberal party , voting for it at a rate 20 per cent higher than the national average during the 1970s .
However , that support fell to 8 to 10 per cent above the average in the years leading up to Harper 's first minority government in 2006 .

I 'm not sure if my SS is clairvoyant , or just incredibly awesome / lucky .
My SS got me multiple gifts : a pair of drinking glasses from a Brewery and Co-op in their area , and John Hodgman 's book , " More Information Than You Require " .
The first gift , the pair of glasses , would be great even if they were just the high - quality , totally killer drinkin ' glasses that they are .
Add in the fact that they 're from my SS ' locale , and they 're absolutely amazing .
They 've found their place amongst a very limited number of glasses in our cupboard that I consider " mine " .
The second gift , though , the copy of Hodgman 's book , is so freakishly spot on that I can't believe it .
I 've been wanting to read this book for just shy of a year now , having finished Hodgman 's first book back in January .
I have n't had much time for the book store as of late - and when I did , I somehow always forgot to grab this one .
With all that said , thank you , SS .
You absolutely nailed it .

1942 : Nearly a year after the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States fully into World War II , the Americans get around to imposing nationwide gasoline rationing .
A fuel shortage was not the problem .
America had plenty of that .
What it lacked was rubber .
Both the Army and Navy were in desperate need of rubber for the war effort .
Imports had fallen off to a trickle , because many of the traditional sources were now in Japanese hands .
The construction of synthetic - rubber factories was just beginning .
Mandatory gasoline rationing had been in effect in the eastern United States since May 1942 , but a voluntary program in other parts of the country had proven unsuccessful .
The Baruch Rubber Report , presented to President Franklin Roosevelt on Sept. 1 , 1942 , concluded that the United States was " a have - not nation " when it came to rubber .
Meeting the military 's enormous needs would be nearly impossible if the civilians at home did n't cut out nonessential driving to conserve on tire wear .
The best way to achieve that was to make it more difficult for people to use their cars .
And the best way to do that was to limit the amount of gasoline an individual could purchase .
Proving it could remain obstinate even in the face of a national crisis , Congress balked at imposing nationwide gas rationing .
Forcing Americans to curtail their driving would be bad for business , many legislators argued .
They evidently feared voter backlash more than they did Hitler or Hirohito .
They pushed for a delay at the very least , but FDR would have none of it .
Backed by government procurement agencies and military leaders , the president ordered gasoline rationing to begin on Dec. 1 and to last " the duration . "
Americans were presented with FDR 's fait accompli on Nov. 26 , giving them less than a week to prepare .
The story shared the top of Page 1 in The New York Times , alongside a report of the developing Soviet offensive at Stalingrad .
Thus , Americans soon became acquainted with the ration card , which had to be presented on every trip to the filling station .
To be out of ration stamps was to be out of luck .
Drivers who used their cars for work that was deemed essential to the war effort were classified differently and received additional stamps .
There were five classifications :
Class
A drivers were allowed only 3 gallons of gasoline per week .
Class B drivers ( factory workers , traveling salesmen ) received 8 gallons per week .
Class C drivers included essential war workers , police , doctors and letter carriers .
Class T included all truck drivers .
Class X was reserved for politicians and other " important people . "
The last three classifications were not subject to the restrictions .
The griping did n't stop , not in Congress and not on Main Street , USA , despite assurances from William Jeffers , the War Production Board 's rubber director .
He said , " [ T ] he worker can obtain enough gasoline for his necessary driving .
The farmer can obtain enough for getting his produce to market .
Every citizen can get enough gasoline for essential driving . "
The whining was loudest in the western states , where gasoline was especially plentiful , rationing had come late , and the distances were great .

At work recently we had a need to build a large Rails application that we then wanted to , for lack of a better word , subclass .
Unfortunately there is no real good way of doing that .
Rails Engines and templates have way too may limitations .
We wanted to bundle up the entire Rails app ( models , controllers , views , routes , migrations , configurations , libs , assets , etc… everything ! ) , but there was no good way of doing that .
Well , now there is , it ’s called the Warp Drive .
I ’ve decided to just include my README file below to explain what it is , since it ’s a bit lengthy , and I do n’t feel like retyping .
This is still in it ’s early stages , so use with care , but it does seem to be working for us on a daily basis .
Let me know what you think !
What is Warp Drive ?
Warp Drive is what Rails Engines wish they could be , and more !
They kick Rails templates in the ass , and they beat keeping an ever evolving base Rails app up to date .
What are Rails Engines ?
Rails Engines allow you to package up some of a Rails app ( controllers , models , views , routes , libs ) and put them in a plugin that can be included into a new Rails app , thereby giving it the functionality you had in the engine .
That sounds good , but what about the downsides of using an engine ?
Well , you ca n’t override or extend any of the functionality from the engine in your main application .
You can hack at the plugin , but now you ’ve made it difficult to update .
So what do you do if you want to add or alter a method to a controller or model ?
What do you do if you want to change the look and feel of a view ?
You have to copy everything into your main application .
Boo !
Rails Engines also do n’t allow you to package up migrations , assets , plugins , initializers , etc …
All the fun stuff that you ’ve come to know and love about a Rails application .
Enter the Warp Drive !
So what is a Warp Drive ?
Great question .
To put it simply a Warp Drive is a standard , full featured , Rails application that you can easily bundle up into a Ruby Gem , and include into another Rails app .
That second Rails app now has all the power of the first Rails .
That is all there is to it .
Creating a Warp Drive .
Let ’s assume we have an application that implements AuthLogic for handling user registration / authentication .
We have controllers , views , models , plugins , initializers , configurations , migrations , tasks , etc … it ’s a full featured fully functional Rails application , we call it authenticator .
We want to turn our authenticator application into a Warp Drive .
We can do it in three simple steps , the first two steps you only need to do the first time , to set everything up .
$ gem install warp_drive
$ warpify That will add a little bit of code to your Rakefile .
That code simply requires the Warp Drive gem , and gives you hooks to configure the gem of your Warp Drive application .
That will add a little bit of code to your .
That code simply requires the Warp Drive gem , and gives you hooks to configure the gem of your Warp Drive application .
$ rake warp_drive : compile ( $ rake warp_drive : install )
This will either compile your gem for your ( warp_drive : compile ) or compile and install your gem ( warp_drive : install )
That ’s it !
You should now have your Rails application bundled up and / or installed as a RubyGem !
Using a Warp Drive .
With your fancy new Warp Drive , authenticator , built and installed how do you use it in that new application your building ?
Again , it ’s stupid easy , and it only takes one step , that only needs to be run once :
$ install_warp_drive authenticator
That will put a few lines of code in your Rakefile , so you have access to all the Rakefile tasks in your Warp Drive , and a line in your config / environment.rb so that it will load your Warp Drive when you launch your application .
That ’s it !
You ’re done .
Now you can run rake db: migrate to run the migrations from both your Warp Drive and your new application .
Enjoy !
Overriding , Extending , and Other Such Fun Things
Overriding and Extending
You ’ve been enjoying your new Warp Drive back application for a little while now , but you decide you really need to change an action in your controller , how do you go about that ?
Simple , just like you would any normal alteration to a Ruby class .
Example :
Here is what the action looks like in our Warp Drive UsersController :
def new @user = User .
new end
In our new application we can just open up the UsersController like this :
class UsersController < ApplicationController def new_with_default_name new_without_default_name @user .
login = ' default_name ' end alias_method_chain :new , : default_name end
Viola !
The same works for any thing else in the system , models , libs , etc …
In our example we used alias_method_chain to retain the original method , but we could have completely rewritten the method as well .
You can also plop in a new view and it will override the view that was in your Warp Drive .
The sky is really the limit .
Assets
You can easily bundle assets from your public directory in your Warp Drive .
Just make sure they are in folders called warp_drive .
Those folders will then be symlinked to your new project ’s public directory when the application starts up .
Keep Those Rake Tasks Private !
We all them , Rake tasks we have created to help us do all sorts of things , and we usually do n’t want them to ship .
Well , Warp Drive has you covered there .
Just place your tasks in folders called private and Bob ’s your uncle they wo n’t be available in the compiled gem .
lib / tasks / foo .
rake private / bar .

The New York Times highlights a a report published by the University of California , San Diego claiming that the average American consumes 34GB of content and 100,000 words a day .
How is that possible , you ask ?
It 's all about bathing in the data .
This does n't mean we read 100,000 words a day — it means that 100,000 words cross our eyes and ears in a single 24 - hour period .
That information comes through various channels , including the television , radio , the Web , text messages and video games .

In fact , the report focuses primarily on our insatiable appetite for information ( 11.8 hours of information a day fills our gluttonous info - bellies ) .

Trailer for Clash of the Titans .
In Clash of the Titans , the ultimate struggle for power pits men against kings and kings against gods .
But the war between the gods themselves could destroy the world .
Born of a god but raised as a man , Perseus ( Sam Worthington ) is helpless to save his family from Hades ( Ralph Fiennes ) , vengeful god of the underworld .
With nothing left to lose , Perseus volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus ( Liam Neeson ) and unleash hell on earth .
Leading a daring band of warriors , Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds .
Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts , he will only survive if he can accept his power as a god , defy his fate and create his own destiny .
As they say , you ca n’t make this stuff up .
You can only read it and weep .
Today ’s Los Angeles Times includes a front - page piece by Tom Hamburger and Kim Geiger on an itty - bitty provision in one Senate health care bill that would require insurers to cover Christian Science “ prayer treatments ” as medical expenses .
Hamburger and Geiger write that the measure , introduced by Utah Republican Orrin Hatch , would put prayer treatments “ on the same footing ” as clinical medicine and would prohibit discrimination against “ religious and spiritual health care . ”
Oh , my .
It does n’t matter to me — and I hope it wo n’t matter to you — that the sums of money that might be paid to spiritual healers are relatively small .
It matters hugely to me — and I hope it will matter to you — that a spokesperson for the Christian Science Church could tell Times reporters with a straight face that public funding of prayer treatment is part of “ finding effective health care . ”
It matters greatly that this appalling provision , if enacted into law , will undoubtedly invite other faiths to get into the healing business in order to compete with Christian Science for those subsidized insurance payments .
The Hatch provision is not yet in the consolidated healthcare bill that Majority Leader Harry Reid will bring to the floor — it is only in the bill reported out of the Senate Committee on Health , Education , and Labor — so we might pray that Reid will have the good sense to strip it out , as Speaker Pelosi has already done on the House side .
We all know that the Christian Science mother church is in Boston , but it was still a bit shocking to learn from the Times piece that the Hatch madness is also supported by Massachusetts Sen.
John Kerry .
Kerry ’s spokesperson said it is merely about nondiscrimination against a form of “ care ” that is recognized by the IRS as a legitimate medical expense .
OK , then may I also ask why the IRS still treats prayer as a itemized medical expense that can be deducted from one ’s taxes ?
Am I the only person who thinks this is an insane provision to have in the tax code ?
Medical science is evidence - based and faith is the “ evidence of things not seen , ” according to the eleventh chapter of the Letter to the Hebrews .
So I guess they ’re really the same , right ?
Let ’s fund them both !
But no , no , and NO to any federal dollars for abortion , saith the good senator from Salt Lake .
Hatch narrowly lost his push to get this prohibition into the Senate Finance Committee ’s health bill , but he vows that he ’s not finished : he will fight again on the floor .
If Hatch gets his way , women who purchase comprehensive private insurance packages that include abortion services would have to pay for the entire cost of the package ( even if they qualify for federal subsidies ) and obtain a separate rider for abortion coverage .
Michigan ’s Sen. Debbie Stabenow said that Hatch would impose an “ unprecedented restriction on people who paid for their own health care insurance . ”
I say look on the bright side , Sen. Stabenow !
Women who lose existing abortion coverage thanks to Hatch will have nothing to worry about .
They can get paid for prayer sessions to make their pregnancies magically disappear .
Hatch taketh away , but he also giveth .
What ’s not to like ?
The ancient Mayans may have had enough engineering know - how to master running water , creating fountains and even toilets by controlling water pressure , scientists now suggest .
Perhaps the earliest known example of the intentional creation of water pressure was found on the island of Crete in a Minoan palace dating back to roughly 1400 BC .
In the New World , the ability to generate water pressure was previously thought to have begun only with the arrival of the Spanish .
Scientists investigated the Mayan center at Palenque in Chiapas , Mexico .
At its height , this major site , inhabited from roughly 100 to 800 AD , had some 1,500 structures — residences , palaces , and temples — holding some 6,000 inhabitants under a series of powerful rulers .
The center at Palenque also had what was arguably the most unique and intricate system of water management known anywhere in the Maya lowlands .
These involved elaborate subterranean aqueducts to deal with the spring - fed streams that naturally divide the landscape and could otherwise cause flooding or erosion .
" The ancient Maya called this city Lakamha ' or ' Big Water ' because of its nine perennial waterways , 56 springs , and hundreds of meters of cascades , " said researcher Kirk French , an archaeologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park .
One peculiar finding at Palenque was a buried , spring - fed conduit some 216 feet long ( 66 m ) .
While other aqueducts under the site 's main plaza stayed relatively level and maintained a roughly constant width , the rectangular conduit was located on a steep slope and abruptly narrowed at its end .
Assuming this sloping conduit was smoothly plastered as the aqueducts were at Palenque , the researchers calculated the resulting water pressure could drive a fountain shooting water roughly 20 feet high ( 6 m ) .
" This finding is yet another technological achievement made by the Maya independently of the Old World , " French said .
" The Maya of Palenque had water pressure technology by 750 AD at the very latest and most likely much earlier . "
French noted it has been speculated for decades that the palace in Palenque had running water for toilets .
" Getting running water to the palace was impossible without water pressure , " he said .
Because of this new find , " the toilet theory is n’t so far - fetched . "
Running water would have been a luxury , not a necessity .
" I actually think that the creation of water pressure at Palenque was a sign of wealth , " French said .
" It was definitely not necessary .
They had water everywhere .
The Maya of Palenque were never more than 150 meters ( 492 feet ) from a source of water .
Water pressure technology would have been useful through the display of power and knowledge , similar to how priests and shamans used astronomical events . "
There may be other examples of Precolumbian water pressure throughout the Americas that have been unseen or misidentified , French said .
For instance , ceramic tubes have been found at several sites throughout central Mexico .
" There is a widely held view that the Maya were not necessarily great engineers because their buildings were relatively simple , " French told LiveScience .
" But in regards to water management their engineering expertise was by all accounts very impressive . "
During the next five years , French plans to use this focus on water in " hydroarchaeology " to shed light on aspects of past life such as droughts , population levels and settlement patterns .
French and his colleague Christopher Duffy , a hydrologist at Pennsylvania State University , detailed their findings online December 16 in the Journal of Archaeological Science .
Sticky Situation : Unrolling Household Tape Produces X - Rays
If you have ever ( for whatever reason – that ’s none of our business ) locked yourself in a dark closet and peeled Scotch tape from its holder , you may have noticed a tiny bit of light .
The tape actually emits a faint luminescence when it ’s being separated .
It ’s due to a phenomenon known as triboluminescence , which has been documented as far back as the 17th century .
In the 1950s , Soviet researchers claimed that unrolling sticky tape resulted also in the release of X - rays , but no one really bothered to follow up on that study until now .
A group of researchers at UCLA decided to test the X - ray claims recently .
Using a machine to unroll the tape at 3 centimeters / second in a vacuum , they measured the electromagnetic output .
The short bursts of X - rays lasted for about a billionth of a second each and output 300,000 X - ray photons .
The researchers were even able to prove the presence of the X - rays by producing pictures of their finger bones .
There ’s no need to worry about getting a super - dose of radiation while taping the paper on birthday presents , though ; the phenomenon seems to work only when the tape is in a vacuum .
The applications for this new knowledge are kind of sketchy at this point .
The research team thinks that it may be useful for making cheaper X - ray machines or even for aiding in nuclear fusion .
Both seem a little far - fetched , but harnessing this little - understood physical phenomenon may even create new , unforeseen possibilities in the future .
Brooetal Legend ( the umlaut lifts the sound ) seems like something that Tim Schafer has been working towards for a while .
I do n't think there 's been a single one of his games that has n't had some heavy metal inspiration in there somewhere .
Even Grim Fandango's fiery beaver parts had a bit of a Rammstein feel to them .
Christ , that was a weird sentence .
Tim Schafer is a " name , " and that 's always a good thing .
By " name , " I mean someone who can help sell a game by having the words " A game by name " emblazoned on the front of the box .
The modern industry has become so commercial and design teams have become so committee - driven that very few new names are created - all the current names are old hands , like Schafer , Peter Molyneux , Will Wright , most of the original Doom team , etc .
But while names are perfectly healthy in a creative industry , there tends to be the delusion that a name can do no wrong , and a name is always human , just as flawed and squishy as the rest of us .
Schafer earned his stripes with incredibly good writing , but I 'm yet to be convinced that he knows what he 's doing gameplay - wise .
Let 's go through his resume .
Day of the Tentacle - back in the days of old LucasArts , when the business model extended beyond rattling a stick around the Star Wars feed bucket , Schafer 's first game in a lead role was this sequel to one of the company 's earliest point - and - clickers , Maniac Mansion .
As for its gameplay , well , you can never ask for much of that from the retro adventure , where you generally push piles of random objects around and throw them randomly at the scenery ( also known as the " crazy homeless woman simulator " ) .
But that said , DOTT 's time travel mechanics made for uniquely compelling puzzle - solving , so for a point and click adventure the gameplay was decent , which is kind of like saying that for a shopping trolley full of cream cakes the wheels were pretty nice .
Full Throttle - Schafer 's second LucasArts adventure was a grim and macho tale of biker gangs in the near future , pioneering a new , more intuitive " verb coin " style of interface that Monkey Island 3 would later use , but was unfortunately enamored with teeth - grindingly unskippable minigames .
On - bike combat sequences were roughly equivocal to a fighting game in which all the characters are inflatable clowns , and some of the puzzle design was shockingly bad , especially that one memorable moment where the puzzle solution is to spend half an hour kicking various parts of a wall .
Grim Fandango - often held up as Schafer 's magnum opus , Grim Fandango was one of the last official LucasArts adventures before the great betrayal and , indeed , story - wise , it eats the entire adventure genre for breakfast on a bed of noir waffles .
But with Full Throttle having soured everyone on minigames , GF was back to pure crazy homeless woman simulation , mired by a very tedious inventory system in which you scroll randomly through all your items one at a time like you 're looking for the end on a roll of sticky tape .
And the game was n't above some seriously bizarre puzzle logic , as in the point where you have to make your monster sidekick vomit gelatin over a set of dominoes so they wo n't fall over and detonate a bomb .
Yeah .
Other institutions , notably the University of Hull in England , have also developed similar devices .
However , the palatometer is the only such invention that operates without any kind of surgical implant .
The downside of the South African device , however , is a 0.3 - second delay between when the tongue and mouth move , and when the computer calculates the right word .
This leaves the mouth and the voice out of sync , giving the user the appearance of being dubbed over in a bad kung - fu movie .
the coffee shop had n’t a toaster and all their bagels were plain pale pathetic and frigid rings wrapped up in tight cellophane
cold were the shivers this sent to me freezing the spine in my back how could a business still operate with such an obvious lack ?
no answer from the barista gazing with big doughy eyes half of me thought i would hear from her do i with that want some fries ?
lifeless and bleak was the future in such a desolate place no crumbs to clean from the toaster tray no onion mess on my face
that ’s why i doused it with gasoline struck the matchbook and then ran – not ‘ cause the doe - eyed barista jilted me for my best man

Kétéves pihenés után most új formában , a Norvég Alap pénzügyi segítségével élesztenék ú jra a Mindentudás Egyeteme ismeretterjesztő sorozatot , megszületett a műsort készítő kht .
tulajdonosainak vitáját lezáró megállapodás - írta a Népszabadság .
Mostanáig úgy tűnt , hogy személyi és koncepcionális ellentétek miatt a projekt kútba esik .
Most végre pont került a folytatás feltételeit rögzítő megállapodásra , de már csak 16 hónap maradt a támogatási szerződés teljesítésére , a 16 műsorblokk elkészítésére .
A Mindentudás Egyeteme Kht. - amely időközben kft .- vé alakult - idén egy új műsorötlettel pályázott a Nemzeti Fejlesztési Ügynökséghez ( NFÜ ) a Norvég Alap támogatása érdekében .
A sikeres pályázatban egy olyan televíziós sorozat szerepel , amely 16 tematikus blokkból áll , minden blokkhoz egy előadás , egy riport és egy szakértői vita tartozik .
A témák a kortárs alkalmazott tudomány legnépszer űbb topikjait járják körül .
A pályázatot a kft .- nek a - cégben társtulajdonos , és a korábbi sikeres sorozat fő mecénása - Magyar Telekomhoz köthető munkatársai állították össze .
A pályázaton a kft .
700 millió forintot nyert .
Pálinkás József , az Akadémia elnöke a lapnak elmondta : a megállapodás immár megszületett , a műsor időben el fog indulni , azt azonban meg kell értenünk , hogy az MTA ragaszkodik hozzá , hogy olyan garanciákat kapjon , amelyek biztosítják az új műsorfolyam szakmai és tudományos színvonalát .
Az elnök érzékeltette , hogy ezt a garanciát az jelentheti , ha az MTA képviselője megfelelő súlyú helyet kap a kft .
menedzsmentjében .
A Népszabadság úgy tudja , a Nemzeti Fejlesztési Ügynökség is igyekszik nyomást gyakorolni a történet szereplőire a mielőbbi megegyezés érdekében , a szervezetnél ugyanis attól tartanak , hogy ha egy - két hónapon belül nem kezd ődik el a műsorok gyártása , akkor kifutnak az időből .
Ebben az esetben a pénzt vissza kellene fizetni , ami az azonnali presztízsveszteségen túl akár a későbbi pályázati keretek szűkítését is maga után vonhatja .

“ The Amendment lost today but now the work will be to take this Bill and come out with the same good news when the Senate and House work together , ” Quinn said .
Citing a poem about the Virgin Mary , Quinn noted the providential date of the amendment ’s defeat .
“ I was reminded of being with men and women from the Unitarian faith tradition last year as they celebrated Mary who by her [ ascent ] , they believed , was one of the first women in the New Testament to express Choice , ” Quinn said .
It ’s one of those increasingly frequent stories demonstrating that ecologically , the whole globe is connected — and why that ’s not always a good thing :
Pesticides , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls are among the contaminants hitching an airborne ride to the United States and other parts of the Western Hemisphere on dust storms blowing out of West Africa .
That ’s according to new research presented at the just - completed annual meeting of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry .
The findings are worrisome because some of the chemicals carried on the trade winds originating in Africa are persistent in the environment , they bioaccumulate , and they are known to be toxic at low concentrations , said U.S. Geological Survey researcher Ginger Garrison , who presented the findings at the SETAC conference in New Orleans .
It ’s been known for some time now that dust storms blowing off North Africa make their way across the Atlantic and deposit fine particles of dust .
I covered that in my Florida days , the Sunshine State being the U.S. region getting the highest concentrations of the superfine dust .
The dust travels as far west as the Rockies and as far north as New England , and tongues of it have reached out across Central America into the Pacific .
It also blankets the Amazon and is a major source of nutrients there .
This finding of contaminants in the dust is a new twist on the story — one that might go on to help explain why coral reefs off Florida are n’t recovering after they are damaged .
Research in Australia showed that low doses of individual pesticides caused coral larvae to fail to attach to reefs , meaning they do n’t recover from various environmental insults , Garrison said :
One of the things we ’ve been wondering about is … why are n’t the reefs rebuilding ?
Because they ’re not .
This would explain one thing .
And who knows what else the contaminants in dust might be doing to the health of humans and ecosystems ?
Among the pollutants are some known to cause cancer , disrupt the reproductive and nervous systems , suppress the immune system and act as liver toxins .
The dust particles we ’re talking about here are far smaller than the PM2.5 particulates that are small enough to have prompted special EPA emphasis ( PDF ) earlier this year .
Garrison said the findings must be followed up :
We need to be concerned and we need to do further examinations to see what affect it has on the ecosystem and human health .
Along with the modern contaminants in the reddish - brown African dust are old - fashioned metals found in the Earth ’s crust , including iron , which is known to have some inflammatory properties , Garrison said .
Getting particles that small in the lungs is bad enough ; what happens if there ’s iron in there , too ?
Or copper , or cadmium ?
USGS researchers are trying to find out .
And where are these contaminants coming from ?
Here ’s where that notion of a connected globe really shows up :
The Niger River valley in Africa runs right past Timbuktu in Mali , the country where Garrison went on her own dime to check out conditions .
It ’s not a pretty sight :
It ’s a flood plain and so once a year it overflows its banks .
Everything is going into the river .
Farmers growing rice and cotton there use pesticides , as do farmers fending off locusts from food crops .
DDT is still sprayed to control malaria - carrying mosquitoes .
Pesticides wash into the river , then are deposited in the floodplain to be blown away after flood season .
And where the people once burned bushes for fuel , they now also burn garbage — including plastic and tires that give off a pretty good - sized dose of dioxin and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons when burned at relatively low temperatures .
Air quality there is terrible , Garrison said , making breathing difficult .
What can be done to control the transport of these contaminants ?
Garrison stresses that she just does the science , not the policy .
But if you want to keep the dust down , you ’d do things that would help the Africans as well as anyone downwind :
Improved land use practices would mean less deforestation .
Better management of soils and lighter use of pesticides would help .
So would better sanitation , and doing something with garbage other than burning it .
As with almost any environmental story nowadays , this one includes a climate angle :
This dust is blowing off the Sahara Desert as well as the Sahel region to its south , which appears to be turning more desert - like in the face of global warming , combined with deforestation .
More desert would presumably mean more dust being blown toward the New World .
As Dateline Earth has discussed before , the continental United States , including Rain City , also gets hit from time to time by contaminant - laden dust blown out of Asia .
And studying where these air masses move globally shows that we ’re all living in the same snow globe .
Said Garrison :
It ’s almost looking as if we have global burden , a background of these pollutants , these pestsicides , these PCBs and we get pulses added to the environment .

The ban may have been timed for the release of Modern Warfare 2 Thousands of Xbox 360 owners who have been cut off from Microsoft 's Xbox Live service will have to buy a new console if they want to play online again .
Microsoft told BBC
News that banned machines will be permanently barred and " unable to connect to Xbox Live " .
A message displayed on affected consoles said there was " no recourse for terms of use violations " .
Microsoft has barred as many as 1 m gamers from Xbox live for modifying their consoles to play pirated games .
" Users of banned Xbox consoles can recover their profile to another , unmodified Xbox 360 console to resume their Live service , " the firm told BBC News .
" The banned console will be unable to connect to Xbox Live . "
However , modified consoles will still work offline .
' No recourse ' Microsoft said barring gamers was part of an ongoing drive to curb piracy .
But a statement from them suggests this latest wave was timed to prevent people from playing pirated versions of the widely - anticipated Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 .
We believe that even one modified console on the system is one too many
Microsoft " We can assure you that if an Xbox Live member follows the Xbox Live terms of use , purchased a retail copy of Modern Warfare 2 and played the game on an unmodified Xbox 360 , no action will be taken , " the firm said .
Microsoft said that it had banned a " small percentage " of the 20 million Xbox Live users worldwide .
Many gamers modify their consoles by installing new chips or software that allows them to run unofficial - but not always illegal - programs and games .
Xbox gamer on being cut off Read more of your reactions Some BBC
News website readers claimed that they had " modded " their consoles to allow them to make back - ups of games that they had already bought .
" Discs are very fragile things and some users like to have their games backed up , " said Donald Glass of Aberdeen .
" After all you will have paid £ 40 for a new disc .
It is my opinion that once you buy a disc you should be allowed to do whatever you want with the media as long as you do not break copyright laws . "
Microsoft has not said how it was able to determine which gamers to disconnect .
" We do not reveal specifics , but can say that all consoles have been verified to have violated the terms of use , " the firm said in a statement .
It said that gamers who had been barred were using their modified consoles to " play illegally pirated games " .
" We believe that even one modified console on the system is one too many " .
Industry figures suggest that piracy may cost the video game industry as much as £ 750 m a year .
Reports have speculated that new " mods " could soon be on the market that allow gamers to get round the blocks .

From Great Depression to Great Credit Crisis : Similarities , Differences and Lessons
NBER Working Paper No. 15524
Issued in November 2009
NBER Program(s ) : Development of the American Economy , International Finance and Macroeconomics
The Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Credit Crisis of the 2000s had similar causes but elicited strikingly different policy responses .
It may still be too early to assess the effectiveness of current policy responses , but it is possible to analyze monetary and fiscal policies in the 1930s as a " natural experiment " or " counterfactual " capable of shedding light on the impact of recent policies .
We employ vector autoregressions , instrumental variables , and qualitative evidence for a panel of 27 countries in the period 1925 - 1939 .
The results suggest that monetary and fiscal stimulus was effective - that where it did not make a difference it was not tried .
The results also shed light on the debate over fiscal multipliers in episodes of financial crisis .
They are consistent with multipliers at the higher end of those estimated in the recent literature , consistent with the idea that the impact of fiscal stimulus will be greater when banking system are dysfunctional and monetary policy is constrained by the zero bound .

In Haskell the Monad typeclass is defined as
class Monad m where
(>>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
return :: a -> m a
It 's tricky to translate this directly to a C# interface because you need to be able to reference the specific implementing subtype ( " m a " or ISpecificMonad < a > ) within the definition of the general IMonad interface .
OK , instead of trying to have ( for example ) IEnumerable < T> implement IMonad < T > directly , we 'll try factoring the IMonad implementation out into a separate object which can be passed , along with the specific monad type instance , to whatever needs to treat it as a monad ( this is " dictionary - passing style " ) .
This will be IMonad < TMonad > and TMonad here will be not the T in IEnumerable < T> , but IEnumerable < T> itself .
But wait -- this can't work either , because the signature of Return < T > for example has to get us from any type T to a TMonad < T > , for any TMonad < > .
IMonad would have to be defined as something like
interface IMonad < TMonad <>> {
TMonad < T> Unit <T >( T x ) ;
TMonad<U> SelectMany<T , U>( TMonad < T> x , Func<T , TMonad<U >> f ) ;
}
using a hypothetical C# feature that would allow us to use type constructors ( like TMonad < > ) as generic type parameters .
But of course C# does not have this feature ( higher - kinded polymorphism ) .
You can reify type constructors at runtime ( typeof ( IEnumerable < > ) ) but ca n't refer to them in type signatures without giving them parameters .
So besides the - 100 points thing , implementing this " properly " would require not just adding another ordinary interface definition , but deep additions to the type system .
That 's why the ability to have query comprehensions over your own types is kind of hacked on ( they just " magically " work if the right magic method names with the right signatures are there ) instead of using the interface mechanism etc .
The CBO score obliterates the arguments opponents of health care reform have been using for months .
They ’ve been claiming the Senate health plan will be a ‘ costly ’ government takeover and it will lead to ‘ delays ’ and ‘ denial ’ of care .
For months , the Minority Leader has claimed that Americans will be " forced into a government plan they do n’t like . "
These false claims are deplorable scare tactics .
The American people deserve better .
They deserve the truth .
Truth–
The bill will reduce the deficit by $ 127 billion dollars and brings down health care costs for individuals and businesses .
Truth –
This bill will result in health care coverage for 94 % of all Americans .
Truth –
The bill includes a public option which will create much - needed competition with the private industry and give Americans more choices .
Truth –
The bill will ban the egregious practice of insurance companies denying care on the basis of pre-existing conditions and will make it illegal for insurance companies to drop your coverage if you get sick .
Truth –
The bill will end arbitrary lifetime limits and unreasonable annual caps that limit care to people who need it the most .
Truth –
The health care bill increases patient care by investing in preventive care , wellness programs and helps families grapple with the high cost of long - term care .
Opponents of health care reform are not only peddling lies created by manipulative messengers like Frank Luntz , they ’re also doing whatever they can to obstruct progress .
My colleagues across the aisle are going to use every weapon in their arsenal to block health care .
They have no qualms about delaying and stonewalling this critical piece of legislation – after all , they have just spent two weeks blocking a bill providing vital health care services for our veterans .
This is shameful .
Members of both parties know this bill will reduce the deficit .
They know what a difference this bill could make in the lives of the uninsured and the under - insured .
They know that it will help improve the bottom lines of the small businesses on Main Street .
We have a duty to ensure that patients do n’t have to worry whether they ’ll be dropped from their coverage if they get sick .
Small business owners should n’t have to break the bank to provide coverage to their employees .
And families should not be forced into bankruptcy because of a medical crisis .
Congress has a choice to make .
We can provide affordable , accessible health care to Americans , or we can continue with the status quo health care system that leaves millions of Americans behind .
Now is the time for members of Congress to engage in real leadership , do what we were elected to do , and allow this bill to the Senate floor for debate .
Arsene Wenger has admitted that he would consider sending out Jack Wilshere out on loan if the right deal came about .
Gunners boss would only let youngster go to competitive side
Arsene Wenger has admitted he would consider sending Jack Wilshere out on loan if the right deal came about .
The 17 - year - old became Arsenal 's youngest player ever in both the UEFA Champions League and Premier League last season but so far this term the midfielder has had to bide his time and wait for opportunities .
The youngster has made just five appearances this campaign , three coming from the bench , and his relative lack of first - team chances have reportedly encouraged the likes of Celtic , Rangers and Middlesbrough to express an interest .
Wilshere is highly rated at the Emirates and has been tipped to be a big star for the future for some time now although Wenger insists he would only consider a bid if it came from a top flight side or one in the higher echelons of the Championship .
" There is a chance ( for a loan ) , if we have an interesting opportunity , " he said .
" I would prefer it to be in the Premier League , but at the top level of the Championship could be interesting as well .
" It is important for Jack to play , so if we find a good opportunity , we will consider it . "
The Indianapolis Colts pulled off a remarkable comeback Sunday evening vs. the New England Patriots .
Fans watched arguably the two most dominant franchises in the NFL for the last decade , each led by unbelievable quarterbacks , go head - to - head for 60 minutes .
For most of the game , the visiting Patriots controlled the game , leading 31 - 14 early in the 4th quarter .
Peyton Manning and his teammates quickly responded with two touchdowns , sandwiched around a New England field goal .
Trailing 34 - 28 , it appeared Indianapolis would get the ball back on a punt when New England faced a 4th and 2 from its own 28 yard line .
Instead , legendary New England Coach Bill Belichick left his offense on the field to try to seal the game with one more first down .
New England lined up to snap the ball as announcers began to question the strategy .
When New England completed a pass , but was short of the first down , the Indianapolis crowd erupted .
Peyton Manning had only 28 yards to go , and he won the game with a touchdown to Reggie Wayne with 13 seconds left .
The comeback was amazing , but many felt it paled in comparison to the decision Coach Belichick made to go for the first down .
Conventional football says to punt the ball away and let the defense hold the lead .
The response from the media to Belichick 's decision was generally one of disbelief .
One of Belichick 's former All - Pro defenders , Rodney Harrison said on NBC 's postgame show , " This is the worst decision I 've ever seen Bill Belichick make .
It was a really bad coaching decision by coach Belichick .
I have all the respect in the world for him , but he has to punt the ball .
The message that you are sending in the locker room is : I have no in my young guys on my defense . "
Trent Dilfer , an ESPN analyst and former NFL quarterback and Super Bowl Champion was asked if the decision reflected arrogance on Belichick 's part .
He responded , " Wisdom should outweigh that confidence and arrogance .
You have to make decisions that are wise and discerning ... and that was n't one of them ... This is an unparalleled decision right now in coaching in the National Football League .
It is absolutely crazy . "
Harrison and Dilfer were not alone in their scathing criticism of Belichick .
Although the decision clearly did not turn out well , a closer look at statistical probabilities indicates that Belichick 's decision may not have been unwise or lacking discernment .
I began calculating the probabilities based on rough estimates of success rates for the likelihood of the Patriots getting a first down and the Colts scoring a touchdown , after either stopping the Pats on 4th down or receiving a punt backing the Colts up into their own territory .
Fortunately , there is a website that provides actual stats on each of these scenarios :
http://www.advancednflstats.com/2009/09/4th-down-study-part-1.html
Scenario 1 : " Play it safe " and punt :
If the Pats punted the ball , the expected net punt would be 38 yards , leaving the Colts with the ball at their own 34 .
Based on historical data , the Colts would score a touchdown approximately 30 % of the time ( one could argue that we might expect the Colts to be more successful than the average team ) .
Scenario 2 : Take the " risk " and go for it :
If the Patriots converted the 4th down try , they could kneel on the ball and run the clock out .
This would happen 60 % of the time based on historical data ( just as we did above with the Colts , one could also argue that we might expect the Pats to be more successful than the average team in converting on 4th down ) .
If the Pats failed to make the 1st down , the Colts would get the ball at the New England 28 with two minutes left , a position where teams score 53 % of the time .
In this case , the Patriots would still win 47 % of the time .
Combining these two probabilities leads to New England winning 79 % of the time by going for it on 4th down .
60 % + ( 47 % * .40 ) = 78.85
Thus , playing it safe would lead to a new England victory 70 % of the time , whereas " taking the risk " would actually not be a statistical risk , but rather a wise decision that would lead to a victory nearly 79 % of the time .
So why the uproar over Belichick 's decision ???
Part of the answer lies in our aversion to risks when we have something to lose .
Imagine this scenario :
You win a prize of $ 250 .
You can either
a) Take the $ 250 , or
b ) Have a 1 in 4 chance at $ 1000
Now , the expected value of each of the choices is $ 250 .
If four people chose A , their average payout would be $ 250 .
If four people chose B , their average payout would also be $ 250 ( one would typically win $ 1000 , and the other three would get nothing ) .
Amazingly , more than 85 % of participants choose option ( A ) , the more conservative strategy .
When options are framed in terms of a gain ( or win ) , people become quite conservative .
This helps explain why Bill Belichick 's decision received so much - most people tend to avoid risks in these situations .
This may be particularly true in professional sports , where the heavy turnover among coaches is often referred to as the coaching carousel .
One catastrophic loss can cost a coach and his assistants their jobs .
Interestingly , when options are framed in terms of a loss , we observe the opposite pattern of results .
For example , imagines these two choices :
a) You lose $ 750 , or
b ) You have a 3 in 4 chance of losing $ 1000
In this case , nearly 90 % of participants will choose ( b ) , the riskier strategy in terms of a larger loss .
Once again , both options have the same average payout , but when options are framed in terms of a loss , we tend to make riskier choices .
This helps explain why gamblers at a casino may set a limit of losing $ 100 , but once they are down $ 100 , they will frequently continue to gamble , willing to take risks when they are already behind because they feel they have less to lose when they are already behind .
Making a risky decision ( whether it is actually risky or simply perceived that way ) puts a coach in jeopardy of being criticized , and even fired .
In Coach Belichick 's case , his team 's prior successes will certainly insulate him from some perceived risks like the one he took on Sunday evening .
Other coaches who lack the same job security as Coach Belichick are more likely to go along with the masses , making conservative , conventional calls that contradict the statistical evidence .
One final point that was made about Belichick 's decision concerned the seeming lack of confidence he demonstrated in his young defense by going for it on 4th down .
Many perceived going for it on 4th down as Belichick telling his team there was no way they could stop the Colts .
Of course , it is just as likely that Belichick was showing supreme confidence in both his offense and his defense .
Although I doubt many of his players are statisticians , it seems possible Belichick could take a page out of the framing research described above and instill confidence in both his offense and defense with his decision by telling his players something along the lines of , " I have so much confidence in our offense that I think we 'll make this first down .
Furthermore , I have so much confidence in our defense that I do n't care if the Colts get the ball on their 28 or our 28 yard line , I know we 're going to find a way to keep them out of the end zone . "
I do n't think Belichick was conceding a loss if the Colts got the ball back .
Frankly , I do n't think Belichick was showing exaggerated or diminished confidence in his defense , nor do I think he was making a " risky decision " .
Rather , I think Coach Belichick was merely playing the percentages , and ignoring potential criticism , in an attempt to give his team what he believed ( and what statistics support ) was their best chance possible to defeat the Indianapolis Colts .
Kudos to the Patriots and the Colts for an entertaining ( and thought provoking ) game on Sunday !
The appearance and usability of certain interface elements and functionality are crucial to the success any websites in today ’s market .
Studies have demonstrated that even a split - second delay in thinking on the user ’s part will weaken their perception and interest in a website and ultimately lower the website ’s conversion rate .
In certain niches and industries , having UI elements that are not obvious in their use may be perfectly acceptable .
The blogging and web development industry are perfect examples .
But when we design user interfaces for non -tech - savvy audiences — which is usually the case with client work — we have to ensure that certain UI elements do not stray too far from what users are accustomed to .
This article discusses some best practices and usability traits of six user interface elements and the conventions for each , so that developers can create user experiences that are both beautiful and simple .
1. Appearance of the Search Box
On large information - rich or product - heavy websites , search is king .
Users here generally forgo conventional navigation bars in favor of the search box .
A search box that is not immediately visible will have one of two effects : 1 ) the user will assume no search functionality is available , or 2 ) the user will find the search functionality after a delayed , and possibly irritating , period .
Ensure that the search box on your website is easy to see .
Dark backgrounds and fancy graphics will impair usability , so keeping it white or light gray is best .
Also , make sure the search box is large enough relative to other important elements on the page , thus maintaining its position in the visual hierarchy .
The search box on Domain by IP fits the visual theme of the website nicely , being orange and graphically consistent with its surroundings .
But if a search box on a busier website were given this treatment , it would probably be difficult to spot .
The design is not a hindrance on Domain by IP because the website has one function : search , which is right in the middle of the page .
Plus , being in a technology niche , its developers have less of an incentive to stick with convention .
But this degree of creativity should be avoided on larger websites , whose target audiences may not be as technically savvy .
Adventure Time , meanwhile , keeps its search box white , conveniently sized and easy to find on the page :
Despite being in a foreign language , Adventure Time has a very clear search box , even for English - speaking users .
The size and color of the box is complemented by the magnifying glass graphic , which has become the universal symbol for online search .
A user looking for this functionality will not have a problem here .
This pattern should be followed in all projects targeted to a diverse user base .

2. Clearly Marked Collapsible / Expandable Content
Websites benefit from collapsible panels and drop - down menus because they make for cleaner and less cluttered layouts .
The hidden content in these interface elements can , however , impair a website ’s usability if their presence is not clearly indicated .
When a user clicks on a bare link or button , they expect to be taken to a new page .
But when a user clicks a link or button that has a hidden content indicator , they expect the new content to be instantly displayed ( via JavaScript or AJAX ) and have the option to hide it subsequently .
Thus , a website should sharply differentiate between normal links and links that reveal new content via JavaScript .
Collapsible content , such as in side panels and menu trees , can be indicated with an arrow , triangle , or Windows Explorer - like plus / minus indicator .
The panel that logged - in users see on CSS Globe clearly indicates that it is collapsible :
Below is the same page after the panel has been expanded to reveal a group of functions :
With the content in the panel now expanded , the arrow is rotated 90 degrees , suggesting that the same content can now be hidden or collapsed .
This same principle can be applied to drop - down or fly - out menus , although these would not require a rotating arrow .
Surprisingly , this feature is often omitted even on professionally designed websites .

3. AJAX Loading Indicator
When you improve the user experience by loading content through asynchronous requests , make sure to inform the user that an AJAX request is being processed .
Without this indicator , the user may give up waiting or wonder why nothing has happened in response to their click .
You can accomplish this in a number of ways ; one way is to highlight a “ Loading ” or similar message in or near the location where the action will occur , as Google ’s RSS reader does :
At the top of the screenshot is yellow highlighted text , which appears when the “ Mark all as read ” button is clicked , telling the user that something is happening .
Another way to indicate this is with animation or a revolving hour glass , which would be familiar to Windows users .
An animated indicator is used on numerous websites , including Twitter , where users click a “ More ” button to view older tweets :
Once the button is clicked , and depending on the speed of the client ’s connection to the server , a familiar animated swirling graphic appears , telling the user that their request is being processed .
AJAX loading graphics are available for free from a number of different websites , many of which allow you to customize the graphics with size , color and other options .
This type of visual indicator is important for asynchronous requests that do n’t provide client - side clues about what activity is loading .
An AJAX - like indicator could also be used to enhance non-AJAX functionality that behaves like AJAX and takes time to load .
This could include a photo gallery that loads a larger image when a thumbnail is clicked .
AJAX loading graphics and other indicators do n’t actually speed up a page , but they do improve the “ perceived ” load time , which is often just as valuable as improving the actual load time .

4. Location of Shopping Cart and Log - In and Register Functions
When users scan a page for the “ Shopping cart ” button or “ Register now ” link , the first place they look is the top - right corner of the page .
Unless you have a compelling reason to do so , keep this functionality in its familiar location , or else you risk slowing down and disrupting the user experience .
Options and functions that would fall under this category include “ View cart , ” “ Check out , ” “ Log in , ” “ Log out , ” “ Register , ” “ Submit link , ” “ Forgot password ? ” and even “ Contact us . ”
This last item would usually be the last one in a horizontal navigation bar .
TasteBook includes four such links in the top - right corner of its layout :
Maui Divers
Jewelry is another good example and also includes a shopping bag graphic :
5. Expiration Date Format on Credit Card Forms
When a form asks for your credit card ’s expiration date , the format is always the same : the month , represented by two digits , followed by the year , represented by two or four digits ( e.g. 03/11 or 03/2011 ) .
The four - digit format is how the expiration date appears on the credit card itself .
The best way , then , to collect this information and strengthen the user experience is to use two separate select boxes , one for the month and the other for the year .
Do n’t make the user enter the expiration date in a single text box , even if you provide instructions .
Here is a good example from the payment page of Maui Divers Jewelry :
And here is an example of a poorly designed expiration date field :
Moreover , the month selector should not display the names of the months , but instead should list the numbers 01 through 12 .
There is no reason to slow users down by making them figure out that “ 08 ” means “ August . ”
6. Easily Identifiable Links
This should never be a problem , but unfortunately some websites still do not clearly distinguish between links and regular text in the main body .
In most cases , the best way to indicate this difference is by making links a different color and underlining them .
In some cases , a strong contrasting color alone is enough ; but only underlining or just changing the color slightly is rarely enough and will often impair accessibility .
Cameron .io makes this distinction well :
These links would not be as visible if they were merely underlined but not changed in color .
You would n’t design a button that did n’t look like a button , so why let text links blend into the main body ?
As most users scan text online , designers should ensure that all links are identifiable long before a mouse is rolled over them .

Jag åkte förra året till Tjeckien .
Många hade talat så varmt om Prag så jag kände att det var dags att åka dit .
Vi hittade ett billigt flyg under en semestervecka som vi villa använda till en resa .
Eftersom så många hade rekommenderat huvudstaden var jag både nyfiken och samtidgt rädd för att ha för stora förväntningar .
Men det var verkligen vackert .
Stadskärnan var fantastisk .
Vi bodde hyffsat centralt och hade nära till många platser som jag även kan rekommendera för andra som har funderat på att åka dit .
Det jag nästan tyckte mest om var alla broarna och annan gammal arkitektur och stadens gator .
Det är som att gå tillbaka i tiden .
Självklart var vi tvugna att kolla in Karlsbron och närliggande Galma Staden .
Bron tar en tillbaka till medeltiden med sin arkitektur och alla statyer .
Även Gamla Staden är vacker och man kan gå runt och titta på alla gamla byggnader en hel dag utan att tröttna på det .
Det som är skönt är att inga bilar är tillåtna här och det är så härligt att de kan låta det vara så .
Vi fick som tur var även en dag extra till att åka och titta på något annat än bara Prag .
Eftersom både jag och min sambo gillar öl så tog vi tillfället i akt och åkte till Plzen som ligger i västra Tjeckien .
Vi besökte ett ölmuseum och provade öl för fulla muggar .
Självklart fick det bli en Pilsner Urquell eftersom den kommer just härifrån .
Sista dagen spenderade vi i Prag igen och gick till borgen Karlstein som ligger på en höjd .
Det tog visserligen en stund att gå dit men det kändes som ett härligt farväl av denna underbara stad .
Om någon frågar om jag rekommenderar en att åka dit , så säger jag absolut , ni kommer inte att ångra er !
Both the House and Senate health care bills contain an unwelcome surprise for those whose current health care plans allow “ flexible savings accounts ” for out - of - pocket medical expenditures .
FSAs enable people to spend pre-tax dollars on medical expenditures , including doctor visit co-pays and drug costs .
Money is deducted from an employee ’s paycheck , pre-tax , and placed in a separate account that can only be used to reimburse for medical expenses incurred over the course of a year .
In 2003 , the federal government concluded that FSA dollars could be used for over - the - counter medicines .
This was a boon for consumers , and helped reduce health care costs by making it less expensive for many consumers to substitute less expensive OTC remedies for prescription drugs .
In my own case , it was much cheaper for me to use a prescription allergy medicine than an equally effective OTC drug because my drug co-pay was lower than the cost of the OTC product .
Allowing FSA reimbursement for OTC drugs helped close the gap .
It was also a major benefit for families , as expenditures on things like Pedialyte and pre-natal vitamins were also eligible .
This is all going to change if the current health care bills become law , however .
As John Berlau reports , both the House and Senate bills would restrict the use of FSAs ( and Health Savings Accounts ) to prescription drugs and insulin .
This will be a boon to drug makers insofar as prescription drugs are more profitable than OTC medicines , but could increase medical costs for many Americans — and is also likely to increase health care costs overall .
This sort of thing is nothing new .
In 2005 , Pfizer began supporting greater regulation of pseudophedrineto force it behind the pharmacist ’s counter , just as it prepared to market products containing a less - effective alternativephenylephrine ( PE ) ahead of its competitors .
The profit motive may induce drug companies to develop life - saving ( and profit - making ) medicines — and that ’s a wonderful thing — but it is also encourages efforts to game the regulatory system .
In this case , a small shift in the rules for FSAs allows drug makers to gain at consumer expense .
Alas , I doubt it ’s the only corporate goodie stuffed inside the health care overhaul .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
What 's all the fuss about ?
After all the noise over Democrats ' push for a government insurance plan to compete with private carriers , coverage numbers are finally in : Two percent .
That 's the estimated share of Americans younger than 65 who 'd sign up for the public option plan under the health care bill that Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif . , is steering toward House approval .
The underwhelming statistic is raising questions about whether the government plan will be the iron - fisted competitor that private insurers warn will shut them down or a niche operator that becomes a haven for patients with health insurance horror stories .
Some experts are wondering if lawmakers have wasted too much time arguing about the public plan , giving short shrift to basics such as ensuring that new coverage will be affordable .
" The public option is a significant issue , but its place in the debate is completely out of proportion to its actual importance to consumers , " said Drew Altman , president of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation .
" It has sucked all the oxygen out of the room and diverted attention from bread - and - butter consumer issues , such as affordable coverage and comprehensive benefits . "
The Democratic health care bills would extend coverage to the uninsured by providing government help with premiums and prohibiting insurers from excluding people in poor health or charging them more .
But to keep from piling more on the federal deficit , most of the uninsured will have to wait until 2013 for help .
Even then , many will have to pay a significant share of their own health care costs .
The latest look at the public option comes from the Congressional Budget Office , the nonpartisan economic analysts for lawmakers .
It found that the scaled back government plan in the House bill would n't overtake private health insurance .
To the contrary , it might help the insurers a little .
The budget office estimated that about 6 million people would sign up for the public option in 2019 , when the House bill is fully phased in .
That represents about 2 % of a total of 282 million Americans under age 65 .
( Older people are covered through Medicare . )
The overwhelming majority of the population would remain in private health insurance plans sponsored by employers .
Others , mainly low - income people , would be covered through an expanded Medicaid program .
To be fair , most people would not have access to the new public plan .
Under the House bill , it would be offered through new insurance exchanges open only to those who buy coverage on their own or work for small companies .
Yet even within that pool of 30 million people , only 1 - in - 5 would take the public option .
Who 's likely to sign up ?
The budget office said " a less healthy pool of enrollees " would probably be attracted to the public option , drawn by the prospect of looser rules on access to specialists and medical services .
As a result , premiums in the public plan would be higher than the average for private plans .
That could nudge healthy middle - class workers and their families to sign up for private plans .
" The concern was that the public option would destabilize the bulk of private insurance , but in fact what Congress has fashioned is very targeted , " said economist Karen Davis , president of the Commonwealth Fund .
" It 's not going to be taking away the insurance industry 's core business . "
It 's unclear whether there are enough votes in the Senate for a public plan .
The version that Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , has offered would let states opt out , probably leaving a smaller plan that the House would want .
Insurers are n't buying the budget office analysis .
Asked if it might soften that opposition , industry spokesman Robert Zirkelbach of America 's Health Insurance Plans responded with a curt " No . "
While a government plan might start out modestly , insurers fear that Congress could change the rules later , opening it up to all people and setting take - it - or - leave payments for hospitals and medical providers , instead of negotiating , as the House bill calls for .
For the same reason , employer groups also remain wary .
Big companies do n't want to lose control of their health care budgets and instead have the government send them a tax bill .
" That cost is going to come back to you one way or another ... and it's coming back in the way of taxes and liabilities , " said Eastman Kodak 's chief executive , Antonio M. Perez , speaking for the Business Roundtable .
" We just do n't believe that there are miracles out there . "
If Congress passes a public plan that 's not much of a sensation , Democrats might have reason to regret all the time and energy they invested in it .

Three years after the gory Nithari killings rocked the country causing widespread outrage over the cannibalistic and necrophiliac traits of convict Surinder Koli , 18 out of 19 cases continue to linger on .
While businessman Moninder Singh Pandher , at whose D - 5 Noida house the crimes were committed , and his servant Koli were sentenced to death by a CBI court in February this year for the rape and murder of 14 - year - old girl Rimpa Halder , 16 more cases are under judicial process .
The Allahabad High Court had on September 11 this year acquitted Pandher while confirming death sentence of Koli .
The victims ’ families want the courts to take up the Nithari killing cases on a fast track mode .
“ The next hearing could be in the case of another victim Aarti who was allegedly raped and murdered at Pandher ’s house .
We hope the courts take the cases on a priority basis .
The families want justice , ” Khalid Khan , a lawyer representing families of Nithari victims , said .
“ Chargesheets have been filed in 16 cases , while one case is under investigation .
In two other cases the closure reports have been filed , ” Special Public Prosecutor for CBI J P Sharma said .

The new scheme features bold posters A controversial NHS pilot is providing the contraceptive pill to teenage girls without prescription in pharmacies .
Southwark and Lambeth , two inner-city areas in London with the highest teenage pregnancy rates , are the first to try the approach .
Experts have warned the government is struggling to meet its target of halving teenage pregnancies by 2010 .
But opponents said there was no evidence providing the pill over the counter would make a difference .
It may be pouring petrol on the flames
Mark Haughton
Christian Medical Fellowship
Each local area has been given a target of a reduction of between 40 % and 60 % , for which responsibility is shared between the health service and local authority .
In England in 2007 , 42 of every 1,000 girls under the age of 18 became pregnant - the majority unintentionally .
Half of those pregnancies ended with an abortion .
In Southwark the teenage pregnancy rate is 76 out of every thousand girls under 18 .
The idea of training pharmacists to provide the contraceptive pill was first proposed two years ago by then Health Minister Lord Darzi .
He said there was strong evidence that better provision of contraception would significantly reduce unintended pregnancies .
Southwark PCT has been working for the past year to set up the project , developing a training course with King 's College London that could be adopted if the pilots were replicated elsewhere in the UK .
Private consultation Initially , three pharmacies have been given permission to offer contraceptive consultations to girls aged over 16 .
The key thing about this service is that it is in a place which is accessible to young women
Jo Holmes
Southwark Primary Care Trust
At Ridgeway pharmacy they are getting ready to put up bold , colourful posters advertising in large letters " the pill without prescription " .
For the past six weeks , young women asking for emergency contraception - the morning after pill - have been offered a private consultation on longer term alternatives .
So far around 50 have chosen to switch over to an oral contraceptive after being taken through similar checks to those which would be carried out by a GP .
Pharmacist Cuthbert Churinder has been trained by King 's College .
He said the pilot had been surprisingly successful in the first few weeks - despite not being advertised .
" We do a lot of morning after pills here , I think the highest number in Southwark and Lambeth , about 220 consultations every month , " he said .
" I think the PCT is doing the right thing to have chosen us to offer longer term and more reliable contraception to these young girls . "
The pilot project is likely to attract criticism from those concerned that making contraception more readily available to 16 - year - old girls might encourage them to have sex .
' Sexually active ' Mark Haughton , from the Christian Medical Fellowship , is not convinced providing the pill without prescription will make any difference to teenage pregnancies .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He said : " I 'm not aware of any evidence this is going to be effective .
It may be pouring petrol on the flames .
" Doctors and pharmacists are at the end of the chain .
What we need to do is to work on the whole area of relationships - that is what is effective . "
But Jo Holmes , from Southwark PCT , said it was taking a responsible approach to the reality that many teenage girls over the age of 16 were sexually active .
Focus groups run by the NHS with young women suggested that some found it difficult to approach their family doctor .
" I think the key thing about this service is that it is in a place which is accessible to young women , " said Ms Holmes .
" They may already go there to buy cosmetics or medicines .
" In the GP surgery they sometimes worry they might bump into a neighbour or a member of their family . "
Modest progress
The project has the approval of the Department of Health , which has previously used this approach of trying out potentially controversial policies in small - scale pilots .
The morning after pill became available in pharmacies nationally not long after pilot projects in Manchester provided enough data to allay concerns over safety .
There has been a reduction of 11 % in the under - 18 pregnancy rate since the target for England was set in 1998 .
However , that is modest progress against a much more ambitious target .
If the pilot projects manage to make any contribution to reducing the rate they will be watched with great interest around the UK .

EARLIER this month , a study published in the journal Science answered a question that medical scientists had been asking since 2006 , when they learned of a novel virus found in prostate tumors called xenotropic murine leukemia virus - related virus , or XMRV : Was it a human infection ?
XMRV is a gammaretrovirus , one of a family of viruses long - studied in animals but not known to infect people .
In animals , these retroviruses can cause horrendous neurological problems , immune deficiency , lymphoma and leukemia .
The new study provided overwhelming evidence that XMRV is a human gammaretrovirus  the third human retrovirus ( after H.I.V . and human lymphotropic viruses , which cause leukemia and lymphoma ) .
Infection is permanent and , yes , it can spread from person to person ( though it is not yet known how the virus is transmitted ) .
That would have been news enough , but there was more .
XMRV had been discovered in people suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome , a malady whose very existence has been a subject of debate for 25 years .
For sufferers of this disease , the news has offered enormous hope .
Being seriously ill for years , even decades , is nightmarish enough , but patients are also the targets of ridicule and hostility that stem from the perception that it is all in their heads .
In the study , 67 percent of the 101 patients with the disease were found to have XMRV in their cells .
If further study finds that XMRV actually causes their condition , it may open the door to useful treatments .
At least , it will be time to jettison the stigmatizing name chronic fatigue syndrome .
The illness became famous after an outbreak in 1984 around Lake Tahoe , in Nevada .
Several hundred patients developed flu - like symptoms like fever , sore throat and headaches that led to neurological problems , including severe memory loss and inability to understand conversation .
Most of them were infected with several viruses at once , including cytomegalovirus , Epstein - Barr and human herpesvirus 6 .
Their doctors were stumped .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the nation ’s presumed bulwark against emerging infectious diseases , dismissed the epidemic and said the Tahoe doctors “ had worked themselves into a frenzy . ”
The sufferers , a C.D.C. investigator told me at the time , were “ not normal Americans . ”
Two days after he delivered his Afghanistan address last week at the United States Military Academy at West Point , Mr. Obama sat down in the Oval Office with two speech writers , Ben Rhodes and Jon Favreau , and began to offer an outline for what he would like to say in Oslo .
Mr. Obama is the third sitting American president to be awarded the peace prize .
A student of history , he read the lecture of Theodore Roosevelt , who won the award in 1906 for his role in bringing an end to the war between Russia and Japan .
He also studied the words of Woodrow Wilson , who sent a telegram to the committee  he was ill and could not attend a ceremony  for his 1919 award in recognition of his 14 - point peace program for ending World War I .
With so few former presidents to seek guidance from , aides said , Mr. Obama also spent time looking back at the speech of George C. Marshall , who was awarded the prize in 1953 for helping to rebuild the post - World War II world through the plan of economic aid that bears his name .
Mr. Obama also was intrigued by the lectures of more recent honorees , aides said , including Mr. Mandela in 1993 and Dr. King in 1964 .
The lessons of history , though , provided only a limited amount of instruction , considering that Mr. Obama ’s circumstances are starkly different than those of previous winners .
So in addition to explaining his strategy for Afghanistan  outlining why war is necessary to bring peace  the president ’s advisers said they will reprise the words of humility that Mr. Obama delivered on Oct. 9 , hours after learning he had won the award .
“ It ’s not necessarily an award he would have given himself , ” Mr. Axelrod said .
“ In that sense , it poses a challenge , but thinking through these issues is not burdensome .
He spends a lot of time thinking about how you promote a more peaceful and secure world , about the appropriate use of power and about the value and importance of diplomacy . ”
To minimize his time away from Washington , where a vigorous debate over health care and Afghanistan is under way on Capitol Hill , Mr. Obama is leaving the White House on Wednesday evening and flying overnight to Oslo .
He will formally enter the history of the 108 - year - old Nobel prize when he delivers his lecture in a ceremonial room of Oslo City Hall , which offers a view of the picturesque bay of Oslofjorden .
It was then , aides said , they realized that they would not be able to tailor the setting of the lecture in the way they usually do to project Mr. Obama exactly how they wish .
When presidents deliver their most important speeches , like Mr. Obama ’s April address on nuclear threats from the central square of Prague or his June speech to the Muslim world from Cairo University , the White House choreographs the backgrounds , camera angles and crowds .
But in this case the venue , like the award itself , is something that this president cannot control .
Since April 2007 , New York magazine has posted online sex diaries .
People send in personal accounts of their nighttime quests and conquests .
Some of the diaries are unusual and sad .
There ’s a laid - off banker who drinks herself into oblivion and wakes up in the beds of unfamiliar men .
There ’s an African - American securities trader who flies around the country on weekends to meet with couples seeking interracial sex .
( He meets one Midwestern couple at a T.G.I. Friday’s . )
But the most interesting part of the diaries concerns the way cellphones have influenced courtship .
On nights when they are out , the diarists are often texting multiple possible partners in search of the best arrangement .
As the journalist Wesley Yang notes in a very intelligent analysis in the magazine , the diarists “ use their cellphones to disaggregate , slice up , and repackage their emotional and physical needs , servicing each with a different partner , and hoping to come out ahead . ”
Often the diarists will be on the verge of spending the evening with one partner , when a text arrives from another with a potentially better offer .
To guard against not being chosen at all , Yang writes , “ everyone is on somebody ’s back - burner , and everybody has a back - burner of their own , which they maintain with open - ended texts . ”

Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 broke records this year as the biggest ever entertainment launch in history .
With 4.7 million units sold in the US and UK during the first 24 hours , it pulled in revenues totaling $ 310 million .
In five days the game ’s worldwide sales climbed to $ 550 million , crushing previous record holders Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince ( only $ 394 m ) and The Dark Knight ( just $ 203.8 m ) .
“ In just five days of sell through Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 has become the largest entertainment launch in history and a pop culture phenomenon , ” Activision CEO Bobby Kotick said commenting on the game ’s success .
This is , of course , reflected in the number of pirated copies being traded on BitTorrent .
With 4.1 million unauthorized downloads of the PC version alone , the game more than doubles the achievement of last year ’s ‘ winner ‘ Spore .
Modern Warfare 2 leads both the PC and Xbox 360 lists , by a landslide .
The overall trend across all platforms is that , unlike last year , all of the games are 2009 releases .
What makes Modern Warfare 2 ’s chart - topping even more impressive is that this has been achieved after just two months of availability .
We further see that the figures for the most downloaded titles have more than doubled compared to last year , equaling the growth in uTorrent users .
PC games are by far the most downloaded titles , with on average more than three times the number of downloads compared to Xbox 360 and Wii releases .
As expected , Mario titles are in high demand on the Wii .
The data for these lists is collected by TorrentFreak from several sources , including reports from all public BitTorrent trackers .
All the data is carefully checked and possible inaccuracies are systematically corrected .

Although the slightly blurry images of Nonja 's climbing rope , food and companion 's shaggy red - brown fur have won lots of admiring comments from fans , the photographer herself is not so interested .
" Of course the apes do n't care about the pictures , they are just an accidental side product , " zoo spokesman Gerhard Kasbauer said .
" They just know that when they press the button , a raisin pops out . "

Google is developing an operating system ( OS ) for personal computers , in a direct challenge to market leader Microsoft and its Windows system .
Google Chrome OS will be aimed initially at small , low - cost netbooks , but will eventually be used on PCs as well .
Google said netbooks with Chrome OS could be on sale by the middle of 2010 .
" Speed , simplicity and security are the key aspects of Google Chrome OS , " the firm said in its official blog .
The operating system , which will run on an open source licence , was a " natural extension " of its Chrome browser , the firm said .
The news comes just months before Microsoft launches the latest version of its operating system , called Windows 7 .
' Back to basics '
" We 're designing the OS to be fast and lightweight , to start up and get you on to the web in a few seconds , " said the blog post written by Sundar Pichai , vice - president of product management , and Google 's engineering director Linus Upson .
So at long last Google is making its move .
It is poised to strike at the heart of Microsoft 's software empire .
Tim Weber , Business editor , BBC News website
Charge of Google 's light brigade Both men said that " the operating systems that browsers run on were designed in an era where there was no web " and that this OS was " our attempt to rethink what operating systems should be " .
To that end , the search giant said the new OS would go back to basics .
" We are completely redesigning the underlying security architecture of the OS so that users do n't have to deal with viruses , malware and security updates .
" It should just work , " said Google .
Google already has an operating system for mobile phones called Android which can also be used to run on netbooks .
Google Chrome OS will be aimed not just at laptops but also at desktops for those who spend a lot of time on the web .
' Truly competitive '
The announcement could dramatically change the market for operating systems , especially for Microsoft , the biggest player with around 90 % share .
" This announcement is huge , " said Rob Enderle , industry watcher and president of the Enderle Group .
" This is the first time we have had a truly competitive OS on the market in years .
This is potentially disruptive and is the first real attempt by anyone to go after Microsoft .
" Google is coming at this fresh and , because it is based on a set of services that reside on the web , it is the first really post - web operating system , designed from the ground up , and reconceived for a web world , " Mr Enderle told the BBC .
It 's a few hours since Google used its company blog to announce its entry into the operating systems market , and already opinion is strongly divided
Rory Cellan- Jones
BBC 's technology correspondent
Read Rory 's thoughts in full Last year Google launched the Chrome browser , which it said was designed for " people who live on the web - searching for information , checking e-mail , catching up on the news , shopping or just staying in touch with friends " .
Stephen Shankland at CNET said the move had widespread implications .
" One is that it shows just how serious Google is about making the web into a foundation not just for static pages but for active applications , notably its own such as Google Docs and G - mail .
" Another , it opens new competition with Microsoft and , potentially , a new reason for anti-trust regulators to pay close attention to Google 's moves . "
Some commentators said Google 's motivation in all this was pretty clear .
" One of Google 's major goals is to take Microsoft out , to systematically destroy their hold on the market , " said Mr Enderle .
" Google wants to eliminate Microsoft and it's a unique battle .
The strategy is good .
The big question is , will it work ? "
At the popular blog , TechCrunch , MG Siegler said : " Let 's be clear on what this really is .
This is Google dropping the mother of all bombs on its rival , Microsoft . "
Microsoft releases Windows 7 later this year to replace Windows Vista and Windows XP , which is eight years old .
The Redmond - based company claims that 96 % of netbooks run Windows to date .
Out of beta
In a separate announcement Google also revealed that many of its most popular applications had finally moved out of trial , or beta , phase .
Gmail , for example , has worn the beta tag for five years .
" We realise this situation puzzles some people , particularly those who subscribe to the traditional definition of beta software as being not yet ready for prime time , " wrote Matthew Glotzbach , the director of product management in the official Google blog .
The decision to ditch the beta tag was taken because the apps had finally reached the " high bar " mark , he wrote .
More than 1.75 million companies use Google apps , according to the firm .

I do n't know about you , but I like a President who can throw a funny , geeky sci - fi reference once in a while .

Obama said those words while presenting his " Educate to Innovate " campaign , which aims to promote the development of new inventions by students all around the country .
A few days ago we reported that Lady Gaga earned a measly $ 167 for more than a million plays on the music streaming service , Spotify .
According to new information received from music industry insiders , it turns out that Spotify is n't ripping off the artists , the labels are .
By allowing its users to access millions of songs for free , the music streaming Spotify has revolutionized the music industry by handing them a potential competitor to illegal downloading .
Unfortunately , the labels themselves are not as enthusiastic as most users are , as they doubt the service ’s ability to generate enough revenue .
Indeed , if we take a look at the numbers relating to Lady Gaga that we reported a few days ago , Spotify is barely generating more revenue than most artists make from illicit file - sharing .
With an income of only $ 167 for more than a million plays , he / she is not going to be able to pay the rent .
However , it turns out that this might not be the fault of Spotify ’s business model , but rather the involvement of some of the major labels in the project .
As reported before , Sony BMG bought 5.8 % of Spotify for 2,935 Euros , Universal Music got 4.8 % for 2,446 Euros , Warner Music paid 1,957 Euros for 3.8 % and EMI pocketed 1.9 % for an investment of 980 Euros .
Lady Gaga is signed by Def Jam ( Universal ) which partly owns Spotify , which probably has a significant impact on the revenue she makes .
After all , the major labels would n’t pay the artists from their own pockets would they ?
This was confirmed recently by Lily Allen who commented on Twitter : “ Did you know the major [s ] own hold massive stakes in Spotify , and earn advertising revenue at yet another loss to the artist ? ”
Of course , this diminished revenue would n’t be a problem if Lily signed her music up for digital distribution with a service like RouteNote , who offer the full per track rate , and only take 10 % on the back end .
In fact , Torrent Freak has heard from various sources that independent distributors can get deals of at least $ 0.03 per play with Spotify .
This adds up to a pay day of $ 30,000 instead of $ 167 for a million plays , which suddenly sounds like an altogether better deal .
White House computer technicians have found 22 million e-mails that were believed to have been lost during President George W. Bush 's administration , according to the Associated Press .
The discovery was announced Monday by the National Security Archive and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , or CREW , which filed lawsuits against the Executive Office of the President , or EOP , over the e-mails in 2007 .
The two groups had initially filed a Freedom of Information Act request for e-mails in the wake of a scandal involving the Justice Department , which had fired U.S. attorneys around the country in an apparent political bid to rid the department of prosecutors who did n't adhere to the White House 's conservative agenda .
The missing e-mails were also potentially crucial to the investigation into the Valerie Plame–CIA leak scandal .
The groups eventually filed lawsuits after the EOP revealed that it had lost about 5 million e-mails from its servers between January 2003 and July 2005 , because the e-mails had not been archived properly per the Presidential Records Act .
Among other things , CREW sought records about the EOP ’s e-mail management system , about retained and missing e-mails , and about any audit reports that might have revealed potential problems with the e-mail system .
The newly discovered e-mails were apparently mislabeled and were recently uncovered by contractors hired by the White House .
The e-mails will eventually be made available to the public , after they are archived through the National Archives and Records Administration .

A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the early morning attack , saying it was meant as an assault on the upcoming presidential election .
Later , a rocket struck the " outer limit " of the presidential palace but caused no casualties , presidential spokesman Humayun Hamidzada said .
Another slammed into the grounds of the luxury Serena Hotel , which is favored by many foreigners .
The device failed to explode but filled the lobby with smoke , forcing guests and employees to flee to the basement , according to an Afghan witness who asked that his name not be used for security reasons .
President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack as " an inhuman act " and called on the army and police to strengthen security around all international institutions .
The chief of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan , Kai Eide , said the attack " will not deter the UN from continuing all its work " in Afghanistan .
A security guard working nearby said the attackers were wearing police uniforms .
He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was n't supposed to talk to media .
UN spokesman Adrian Edwards said six UN staff were killed and nine other UN employees were wounded in the assault , which began about dawn in the Shar - e - Naw area of the city .
Terrified guests fled the building during the assault — some screaming for help and others jumping from upper floors as flames engulfed part of the three - story building .
Afghan police and UN officials said 12 people in all were killed , including the UN staff , three attackers , two security guards and an Afghan civilian .
The bodies of the attackers were taken out of the house and sent for autopsies , said Gul Mohammad , an officer at the scene .
It was not immediately known how the victims were killed or how the fire started , but witnesses said they heard prolonged gunfire ringing from the house before police arrived at the scene .
It also was not immediately clear whether there were any other attackers besides the three killed .
Police were seen pulling the charred body of what appeared to be a woman from a second - floor bedroom .
One officer carried an injured German man by piggyback away from the scene .

A US Embassy statement said an American was killed but did not identify the victim .
Edwards said officials were trying to account for several other UN workers who were staying at the guest house .
He did not know their nationalities but said they were non-Afghans .
" This has clearly been a very serious incident for us , " Edwards said .
" We 've not had an incident like this in the past . "
Edwards said the UN would have to evaluate " what this means for our work in Afghanistan . "
The Aug. 19 , 2003 , truck bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad , which killed 22 people , prompted the UN to pull out of Iraq for several years .
A security guard , Noor Allah , said he saw a woman screaming for help in English from a second - story window and watched as terrified guests leapt from windows .
Afghan police using ladders rescued at least one wounded foreigner .
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack on the guest house and the Serena in a telephone call to The Associated Press , saying three militants with suicide vests , grenades and machine guns carried out the assault .
He said three days ago that the Taliban issued a statement threatening anyone working on the Nov. 7 runoff election between Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah .
" This is our first attack , " he said .
Afghans vote Nov. 7 in a second round election after UN - backed auditors threw out nearly a third of Karzai 's votes from the Aug. 20 ballot , determining widespread fraud .
That pushed Karzai 's totals below the 50 percent threshold needed for a first round victory in the 36 - candidate field .
The Taliban warned Afghans to stay away from the polls or risk attacks .
Dozens of people were killed in Taliban attacks during the August balloting , helping drive down turnout .
Mir Ahmed Formoly , 64 , who lives near the guest house , said he heard the commotion and went outside where he saw muzzle flashes in the early morning light .
" I was so scared , " he said .
" I went back inside the house . "
He said gunfire and explosions lasted about two hours , punctuated by shouts and screams .
Mohammad Ayub , a shopkeeper who lives a few doors down from the attacked house , said he heard gunfire shortly before dawn .
He assumed at first that it was an attack on a house belonging to relatives of President Karzai nearby , then saw that it was a different building .
" It was early morning , but I did n't have a watch on to know when .
It was dark .
Shooting started around this private guest house .
I heard some shouts coming from inside the house , " Ayub sai
" I heard ' Boom ! Boom ! ' several times .
The fighting went on inside for about 10 or 15 minutes before the police came , " he said .
The guesthouse attack was the third major assault in the capital in recent weeks .
On Oct. 8 , a suicide car bomber detonated his vehicle outside the Indian Embassy , killing 17 people — mostly civilians — and wounding at least 76 more .

On Sept. 17 , a suicide car bomber killed six Italian soldiers and 10 Afghan civilians on one of Kabul 's main roadways .
Going Small
Aid Workers as Targets
The Islamabad office of the United Nations ' World Food Program ( WFP ) was struck by a suicide bomber just after noon local time Oct.
5 . The bomber , who wore an improvised explosive device ( IED ) concealed under his clothing , was wearing the uniform of the Frontier Constabulary , a paramilitary force , and reportedly made his way past perimeter security and into the facility under the ruse of asking to use the restroom .
Once inside the facility , he detonated his explosive device , killing five WFP employees — one Iraqi national and four locals — and injuring six others .
The attack , claimed by the Tehrik - i- Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , would be the first successful TTP attack in Islamabad since June 6 , and the first attack against Western interests in a Pakistani city since the June 9 attack against the Pearl Continental hotel in Peshawar using a vehicle - borne improvised explosive device ( VBIED ) .
In his Oct. 6 call to The Associated Press and other media outlets to claim responsibility for the attack , TTP spokesman Azam Tariq said the group is planning additional attacks against similar targets .
" The WFP is promoting the U.S. agenda , " Tariq said , and " such types of suicide attacks will continue in the future .
We will target all people and offices working for American interests .
We have sent more suicide bombers in various parts of the country and they have been given targets . "
The WFP office in Islamabad is located in an upscale part of town but outside of the diplomatic enclave .
While the roads leading into the area are blocked by police checkpoints , the sector is not nearly as heavily locked down as the diplomatic enclave , which made it easier for an attacker to approach the WFP office .
The office does have an exterior security wall , but that wall provides very little standoff — in other words , there is not much distance between the building and the road .
From an attacker 's perspective , the WFP is a far softer target than a facility such as the U.S. Embassy , which has a significant standoff .
The only thing that provides protection from a large explosive device is distance , and due to the small amount of standoff at the WFP office , if that office had been attacked using a large VBIED like the one used in the September 2008 attack against the Marriott hotel in Islamabad , the attack would have been devastating .
However , the attack against the WFP office was not conducted with a massive device but with a small one .
It appears that the pressure the Pakistani government has placed upon the TTP ( with U.S. assistance ) has reduced the group 's ability to conduct high - profile attacks .
Indeed , following the attack on the Pearl Continental hotel , there had been a noticeable lull in the TTP 's operations — even before the Aug. 5 death of TTP leader Baitullah Mehsud in a U.S. missile strike .
The WFP bombing serves as a message that while the TTP is down , it is not yet out and more low - level attacks can be expected in the near term .
Small - scale attacks like the one the TTP launched against the WFP office are relatively easy to conduct and require very few resources .
This makes them far easier to sustain than large - scale VBIED attacks .
The approximately 2,000 pounds of explosives used in the massive VBIED deployed against the Islamabad Marriott could be used to create scores of suicide IEDs like the one used against the WFP .
There has been a trend in the last few years in which militant groups have shifted away from larger devices in favor of smaller ones .
This trend is especially noticeable when the group is under intense pressure , like Tanzim Qaedat al - Jihad in Indonesia ( and the TTP at the present time ) .
Small - scale attacks require fewer resources , and smaller devices can be built and transported more clandestinely than huge VBIEDs .
They can also be manufactured more quickly , which allows for a higher tempo of operations .
However , these smaller devices must be used in a different type of attack and are often taken into the targeted site using a ruse , like a Frontier Constabulary uniform in Islamabad ; posing as hotel guests and workers in Jakarta ; or even hidden inside the bomber 's body , as we saw in Saudi Arabia on Aug. 28 .
In the wake of the WFP attack and the TTP 's warning that more attacks are coming , security measures at the offices of humanitarian aid , intergovernmental , and nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) are certain to be inspected and tightened up ( at least until complacency sets in ) to protect against this type of ruse attack using a small suicide device .
One of the other advantages of using these small devices is that they provide attackers a great deal of flexibility in employing them — a flexibility that is often used to bypass security measures .
However , identifying gaps in security requires surveillance — often extended surveillance — and during that surveillance attackers are susceptible to being identified .
Historically , aid organizations simply do not have the security budget to afford the types of physical security equipment and guard coverage afforded to embassies or even commercial establishments like large hotels , and this makes them relatively soft targets .
But even if these offices are hardened by increased security and by proactive measures such as employing countersurveillance teams and the offices thus become more difficult to strike using small devices , the employees of these organizations will remain vulnerable as they do their work in the field .
By its very nature , the work conducted by an aid group is very different from that conducted by a diplomatic mission .
While diplomats like to travel to different parts of the country they are assigned to and meet with a variety of people , their primary mission is to be the representatives of their home government to the foreign government where they are assigned and accredited .
This means that , while they may balk at strict security measures , they can still perform many of their functions in dangerous locations like Islamabad or Baghdad , even though their movement outside of the embassy is tightly restricted and requires considerable security .
The same is simply not true for organizations like the WFP , the United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) , Doctors Without Borders or the United Nations High Commission for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , among others .
These organizations exist to bring shelter , food and medicine to refugees and displaced people , and such people are often found in conflict zones such as Afghanistan , Pakistan and Somalia .
This means that aid employees are very vulnerable to being targeted when they are outside of their offices .
Last October , STRATFOR discussed the growing trend of jihadists attacking aid workers and the tension the trend was creating among jihadist ideologues .
Some ideologues , such as Isam Mohammed Taher al - Barqawi , more popularly known by the nom de guerre Abu-Muhammad Asem al - Maqdisi , have taken a clear stand against targeting " genuine " humanitarian organizations .
In his writings , al - Maqdisi has specifically referred to the International Committee of the Red Cross , noting how it is a legitimate humanitarian organization with no hidden agenda and that its valuable services to the poor and dispossessed should be appreciated .
However , many jihadist leaders do not differentiate between the political aspect of the United Nations and the separate organizations that operate under the aegis of the United Nations for humanitarian purposes , such as the WFP , UNHCR , UNDP and UNICEF .
In addition to the Oct. 6 message from the TTP spokesman who noted that the WFP is an infidel organization that promotes the U.S. agenda , other jihadist leaders have also spoken out against the United Nations .
In an April 2008 speech , al Qaeda second - in - command Ayman al - Zawahiri said , " The United Nations is an enemy of Islam and Muslims :
It is the one which codified and legitimized the setting up of the state of Israel and its taking over of the Muslims ' lands . "
Clearly , over the past year this ideological battle inside jihadist circles has been decided in favor of those who advocate attacks against humanitarian workers , since such attacks are increasing — and the problem is not just confined to Pakistan .
A recent report by the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office noted that attacks against aid workers in Afghanistan are twice as frequent as they were last year — and 2008 had seen significantly more fatalities than 2007 — so things are clearly getting worse there , and the Afghan Taliban are launching more frequent ambushes and roadside IED attacks against clearly marked white aid vehicles .
In Pakistan , at least three UNHCR employees have been assassinated so far this year , and a UNHCR employee and UNICEF employee were among those killed in the June bombing of the Pearl Continental Hotel in Peshawar .
The Pearl was essentially the headquarters for many of the aid organizations in Peshawar .
Outside of Afghanistan and Pakistan , aid workers also have been attacked in Iraq , Somalia , Yemen and Sudan , among other places .
For these aid workers , the perception by groups like the Afghan Taliban , the TTP and al Qaeda that they are a part of the U.S. agenda — and this translates into a war against Islam — means that they will be targeted for attacks .
The increase in attacks has often led to the drawdown of Western aid employees in a given country , and this has forced these organizations to rely heavily on local , mainly Muslim , employees to conduct most of the relief work in the most dangerous places .
However , the track record over the past few years has demonstrated that local employees are every bit as likely to be targeted as their Western colleagues .
This is in part due to the fact that jihadists declare that all Muslims who work with infidels are apostates and therefore no better than infidels themselves .
( This is called the doctrine of Takfir , or apostasy , and the fact that the jihadists claim to have the ability to declare another Muslim an apostate is very controversial within Islam , as is the killing of non-combatants such as humanitarian workers . )
In Pakistan , local aid workers are dedicated to reaching the hungry , sick and dispossessed people they serve , and this makes them extremely vulnerable to attack because they operate in some very remote and dangerous places .
They are far more likely to be working outside of the larger , more secure organizational offices and in smaller , more vulnerable clinics and food distribution points .
Because of this , there is a high likelihood that if the organizational offices present too hard a target , these lower - level aid workers and smaller aid distribution points could be targeted in lower - level TTP attacks .
This would be part of the TTP effort to derail what it perceives as the U.S. agenda to stabilize ( or , in the TTP 's eyes , influence and control ) Pakistan by providing aid to the people displaced by the fighting between the government of Pakistan and the TTP and its foreign allies .
Such attacks will hurt the TTP as far as public opinion goes , as have its attacks in Islamabad , Peshawar and elsewhere .
But in light of the losses it has taken on the battlefield in places like Swat and in light of the coming offensive in South Waziristan , the TTP 's priority is to prove that it is still a force to be reckoned with — and more important , negotiated with .
So the attacks will continue , and we can anticipate that many of them will be against humanitarian workers .
Sometimes Jerry Coyne makes me spray my coffee .
This gem from a post of his on detente in the new atheist - theist wars :
Atheists have been “ humble ” for centuries ( who was more humble than Spinoza ? ) and it has n’t gotten us anywhere .
It ’s that crop of new atheist books that have finally created a climate in which atheists need not feel like pariahs …
Humble ?
Atheism ’s first assumption of power at the level of the nation - state was in the French Revolution .
“ Humility ” does n’t do justice to the carnage wrought by French atheism - in - power , nor to the Napoleonic wars and millions of dead that followed in the ensuing decades of “ atheist humility . ”
In the 19th century “ atheist humility ” incubated in the minds of men like Marx , and again gained the reins of power in 1917 .
The 20th century was the century of atheism in power .
Here is the death toll of its “ humility ” ( from The Black Book of Communism ) :
65 million dead from Atheism in People ’s Republic of China
20 million dead from Atheism in Soviet Union
2 million dead from Atheism in Cambodia
2 million dead from Atheism in North Korea
1.7 million dead from Atheism in Africa
1.5 million dead from Atheism in Afghanistan
1 million dead from Atheism in the Communist states of Eastern Europe
1 million dead from Atheism in Vietnam
New Atheists like Coyne sell a toxic ideology ; atheism ’s transparent nastiness in “ humble ” exile is nothing compared to its record of totalitarianism and atrocities on assumption of power .
There ’s a lot more to atheism than “ humble Spinoza . ”
Atheism - in - power is mankind ’s deadliest ideology , bar none .
December 9 , 2009
AMHERST , Mass .-- Around 40 people gathered in the snow outside the Birthright Crisis Pregnancy Center December 4 to highlight what these so - called " pregnancy help centers " really are : anti-woman centers .
Crisis Pregnancy Centers ( CPCs ) are located in cities across the county and prey on women considered " abortion vulnerable . "
These are fake clinics , where no medical staff is present , and anti-abortion volunteers use manipulation and deceit to convince women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term .
Hampshire County , where Amherst is located , is typical of many counties in the U.S. in that there are multiple CPCs , but not a single accessible abortion provider .
Protesters at the Birthright Center aimed to raise awareness about the CPCs ' deceptive practices , and demand that federal funding go to health care ( and abortions ) , not these fake clinics .
The demonstration was called after students and community members learned that a CPC was located in the center of Amherst .
Organizing had been in the works for over a month , but the passage of the Stupak Amendment during the House debate on health care legislation struck a nerve with many people .
The amendment , if it is part of final legislation , would bar insurers who are part of the " exchange " through which the uninsured will have to purchase a policy from covering abortion services .
The Stupak Amendment has sparked anger at both Democrats and Republicans for throwing women under the bus .
As one protester from Hampshire College remarked , " If you throw me under the bus , you might just get your tires slashed . "
As soon as protesters arrived , they were told by the property manager that Birthright was on private property , and the cops had already been called and were ready to act if anyone ventured off the public sidewalk .
Apparently private property has more rights than women in our society .
This did n't deter protesters , who continued a steady stream of chants outside the fake clinic like " Help women ?
That 's a lie , you do n't care how many die ! " and " Support women 's rights , shut down Birthright ! "
PROTESTERS THEN rallied in the town common for a speakout , where people talked about how to rebuild a fighting women 's movement .
Michelle , a UMass student , gave a vivid picture to the how CPCs can affect women 's lives : " Recently , " she said , " I was the victim of a sexual assault on campus , and if it were up to Birthright , I would have had to drop out of school and have an unwanted child .
No one should have to go through that for lack of a simple health care procedure .
Other speakers made the connections between abortion rights and other struggles .
Safia , also a UMass student , spoke about budget cuts at the university that led to hours at the UMass Health Services being cut -- which means that if you are the victim of a rape after 7 p.m. , you must wait until the next day to get a rape kit .
Gary , a health care worker and member of Equality Across America , drew the connections between women 's rights and LGBT rights .
" The same people leading the attack on women 's rights are attacking the rights of LGBT people , from Uganda to the U.S. , " Lapon said .
" So we have the same right - wing bigots attacking a woman 's right to chose an abortion involved in criminalizing homosexuality .
The Family , a right - wing religious organization that claims Stupak and Pitts as members , supports politicians in Uganda who seek to criminalize homosexuality , with penalties including life imprisonment and the death penalty .
We have to stand in solidarity with one another and fight back . "
Everyone agreed that this protest was only the first step in a long struggle to win reproductive rights for all .
Our side needs to start building the kind of movement that the right has -- a movement where we can set up outside these anti-woman centers every day and make them feel ashamed of their bigotry .
Women are more than just child - bearers .
We are students , sisters , friends , partners and co-workers , and until abortion is free and on demand , we will continue to be subjugated to second - class status because of our reproductive organs .
Enough is enough !
Abortion is health care , health care should be a human right !
( CNN ) --
About 700,000 units of Vicks Dayquil cold medicine were recalled Friday after a finding that the packaging was not child - proof , according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission .
The recall affects Vicks Dayquil Cold & Flu 24 - Count Bonus Pack Liquicaps with the UPC no.
3 23900 01087 1 , according to the product safety group .
The medicine was sold between September 2008 and December 2009 .
The packaging -- which is not child - resistant and lacks the statement , " This package for households without young children " -- should be kept out of the reach of young children .
If a child swallows several of the pills , the child could suffer " serious health problems or death , " the commission said .
No injuries have been reported in relation to the recall .
People who bought the product can request a refund or coupon from manufacturer Proctor and Gamble Co. by calling them at 800-251-3374 .

In keeping with the theme of the launch , actors dressed as soldiers mingled with the celebrity - studded crowd .
Business as usual – except that this glittering event did n't celebrate the launch of a Hollywood movie but a videogame , Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 .
The show of confidence marked the moment that gaming claimed its crown as the largest entertainment industry in the world .
For the first time last year , sales of videogame software topped $ 40 bn ; making the global cinema box office takings of around $ 28 bn look rather puny .
And it 's not just about size , it 's trajectory .
Game sales have grown at a rate of at least 10 % a year over the last two decades , while the movie market is stagnant by comparison ( it grew by only 1.8 % in 2006 - 07 ) – and the music industry is contracting .
There is real excitement over the release of new games .
Andrea Phillips , who designed the promotional game for the film 2012 , and writes the Deus Ex Machinatio games blog says , " People are waiting in line outside their local games store to pick up the new hot game when it goes on sale at midnight . "
The 2008 midnight launch of a World of Warcraft expansion pack at HMV Oxford Street was the biggest the store had ever seen – 2,500 people .
But this ascent to global dominance has happened quietly .
Radio 4 does n't have a regular games - discussion slot .
Game - creators do n't sit on Jonathan Ross 's sofa to chat about their latest project .
When I asked Kirsty Lang , presenter of Radio 4's arts and culture programme Front Row , why computer games do n't feature more at the forefront of media coverage of culture , she was candid : " I think it 's because the people who are making and commissioning these programmes are still too old .
Those of us in our 40s and 50s , who are making the decisions about what will feature in the programmes , do n't really play computer games .
When we 've had ideas put forward about gaming , they 've tended to come from the younger members of the team . "
Adrian Hon , co-founder of London - based games company Six to Start , agrees games are still seen as being " for young people " even though many now carry 18 certificates .
" People seem reluctant to talk about the fact that they 're gamers , " he commented .
" It 's perfectly fine for an MP to say that they 're into noir movies , or crime fiction , or Coldplay – but if they said , " Yeah , I 'm a big Modern Warfare fan , " they 'd come off looking bad . "
Yet this is changing .
James Wallis , lecturer in game design at the University of Westminster , says that the traditional " twitch " game , with its need for fast reflexes and its casual violence , is no longer the key growth market for computer games .
" Lots of people out there have never played a computer game .
Well , you will !
All the advertising for Nintendo's DS and Wii consoles has been aimed at non -game - playing demographics .
Young women .
The over -60s .
Families – not just the boys .
Casual gaming is also a vast market : the Facebook game Farmville has 60 million players worldwide .
That is more people than live in the UK .
The people who sit down in front of a console to play Modern Warfare 2 are in the minority of gamers . "
Female gamers are certainly on the rise .
Research earlier this year by the NPD group found that the proportion of female console gamers went from 23 % in 2008 to 28 % in 2009 , while figures from Nielsen suggested that women aged between 25 and 54 now make up the largest group of PC gamers .
As a lifelong gamer myself ( starting with Skool Daze on my 48 K Spectrum , and currently obsessed with the atmospheric faux - Victorian online game Echo Bazaar ) , I 'm certainly glad to feel that I 'm no longer in such a small minority .
Tom Chatfield , arts and books editor of Prospect magazine , is hardly a sterotypical gamer .
And in his forthcoming book about the games industry , Fun , Inc , he explains , " Games are n't standalone any more ; they increasingly overlap with other things people like doing .
Music , for instance – Guitar Hero and Rock Band are each worth well over $ 1bn .
No big movie now is without its gaming counterpart .
When talking about his new movie Avatar , James Cameron describes the filming process as being like in a videogame . "
In fact he says , console games are now just a small fraction of the worldwide gaming industry .
" Boxed and mainstream games come out of the US , mostly the west coast and Texas , from Japan and some – including the Grand Theft Auto series , which was originally created by a Scottish game developer – from the UK .
But other markets are also crucial , including free , micro-payment - based online gaming that has hundreds of millions of people involved , especially across Asia .
The biggest example is Maple Story , a role - playing game with more than 100 million subscribers – these games are free or very cheap to play , but allow players to pay very small amounts of cash for a huge spectrum of in - game items , abilities and advantages . "
He suggests that it 's the very playfulness of games that makes them seem juvenile : " We are programmed on a very deep level to want to play , but with our Protestant work ethic , play is viewed as pretty subversive .
We still think that we have to put play behind us as part of what the adult and working worlds mean . "
This is a fascinating thought .
Non-gamers often think of gaming as a " pointless " pastime , but perhaps that pointlessness is really the point : instead of constantly having to be productive , why can't we spend time on activities purely because they 're enjoyable ?
As games continue to grow in size and strength , as they are played in greater numbers by women , by older people and by people who can't afford expensive equipment , the playful way of approaching the world may also spread .
If Chatfield is right , it might be in breaking down the boundary between work and play , and in encouraging us all to play more , that games will end up making their greatest contribution to our culture .
C’est pas évident de détruire une culture culinaire dans un pays comme la France .
Mais ce processus n’est pas propre à notre seul pays .
On sait bien que les bonnes choses s’élaborent lentement , qu’il faut du temps pour les réaliser et aussi pour les transmettre .
C’est sans doute pour ça que la production de livres de cuisine est toujours aussi prolixe .
On passe moins de temps en famille , il faut donc trouver de nouvelle manière d’acquérir ces savoirs .
Dans l’imagerie populaire , la grand mère est la personne qui opère cette transmission .
Elle est à la retraite et a donc du temps , elle a du recul sur la vie , détachée des futilités de la mode , elle peut se consacrer aux vraies valeurs , cette multitude de petits plaisirs qui font toute la saveur de la vie .
Les seul problème aujourd ’hui qui compte pour un publicitaire et son commanditaire est comment pourrait - on casser cette tradition pour tirer un max de fric de la nouvelle situation ?
Il faut donc commencer par rassurer « comme Mamie » et conforter et produit , le goût ne va pas changer , ce sera aussi bon .
Puis ensuite dénigrer lourdement « sans Mamie » et ses manies stupides de pincer les joues à la limite de la maltraitance .
Il faut faire croire que l’on peut remplacer l’humain avec toutes ses imperfections par une chaine de production alimentaire industrielle parfaite à coup d’OGM , d’ajout de conservateurs , d’irradiation des aliments et… d’agents de saveurs !
Ce n’est pas sur la qualité du produit , les frittes de Mamie ou la supériorité du nouveau , un meilleur goût , que le publicitaire attaque mais sur le médiateur de l’existence même du produit .
Il faut déstabiliser le rapport humain sur lequel se fonde toute culture pour le remplacer par un rapport marchand .
Il faut déconnecter le plaisir de manger avec l’histoire de l’individu ( la personne qui vous a fait découvrir ce plat , chez qui vous aviez l’habitude de le manger , la période pendant laquelle vous y aviez accès ( les weekend à la campagne , les vacances … ) … ) bref un mélange affectif de votre vie personnelle avec la culture d’une société transmise par un membre de votre famille vous ayant précédé .
Le publicitaire ne veut garder que le plaisir pour en faire une pulsion .
Vous n’êtes plus alors qu’un consommateur doté d’un estomac qu’il faut satisfaire .
On pourrait craindre que les frittes chimiques n’avaient pas tout à fait le même goût , ce qui est évident puisque désormais qu’importe la saison ou la pomme de terre utilisé ou le pays où sont vendu les frittes : elles ont justement toujours le même goût !
En fait , c’est sans importance , le lien de transmission ayant été rompu , le goût sera perdu et remplacé par celui de la marque .
Il suffira de refaire , de temps en temps , une nouvelle campagne publicitaire et annoncer un nouveau goût pour relancer l’intérêt et les ventes du produit .
Les cultures de chaque pays basculent ainsi dans l’homogénéisation globale de produits uniques à l’arrière goût de marchandise .

Aluminum is common in antiperspirant / deodorant products
( Natural News )
Most consumers do n't know it , but antiperspirant deodorant products often contain extremely toxic chemicals and heavy metals that can cause severe harm to the human nervous system .
To rub such products under the arms is inviting the absorption of these harmful chemicals , which many believe will inevitably lead to cancer or neurological problems ( such as Alzheimer 's disease ) .
Here , we present a rather alarming collection of information from some of the industry 's top health authors who discuss the toxic chemicals commonly found in antiperspirants and deodorants .
Do n't rub another product on your skin until you read this information !
The use of antiperspirant deodorant formulas has been subject to a lot of controversy due to the aluminum base and parabens ( chemicals used as preservatives ) - among other harsh and toxic substances such as solvents and some fragrances - that are used in many commercial products .
Aluminum compounds - particularly aluminum chlorohydrate - are easily absorbed through the skin and have , in the only reported trial to date , already been linked with higher risks of Alzheimer 's .
Nature 's Gate Spring Fresh deodorant , which is aluminum - free , still contains DEA .
Nature 's Gate Spring
Fresh deodorant also includes propylene glycol , a common solvent in toothpastes , deodorant , mouthwash , and other personal care items , that is a penetration enhancer and best to avoid .
Another kind of ingredient in deodorants and anti-perspirants that may contribute to breast cancer are hormone - disruptive parabans .
I prefer their unscented Nature 's Deodorant ( you may initially catch a mild whiff of coriander when first putting it on ) , which has the rare characteristics of being both highly effective and safe .
But , naturally scented versions of these are also available .
Be cautious of " natural " deodorant crystals as they may contain aluminum , and would therefore not be something you would want to use .
Most good health food stores , like my local one , Sunseeds , in Cocoa Beach , Florida , are very helpful and can get most things in for you if they do n't already have them in stock .
Use deodorant instead of antiperspirant , since sweat is normal and blocking the pores is not .
Especially avoid aluminum , which is found in high levels in the brain plaques linked to Alzheimer 's disease .
And with deodorants , avoid phthalates , which are plastics used to help the fragrance stay on our skin and block endocrine function , especially in the male fetus .
Parabens , which are used as preservatives in these products , should also be avoided since they could be linked to breast cancer .
Read your deodorant label carefully to see if it contains this substance .
Not all of them do , especially those made from natural substances .
Even though we all know that good personal hygiene is important , you may want to switch to a personal care product that does not contain aluminum hydroxide .
During the two decades prior to the first world war , an unprecedented number of creations were unveiled that would transform the formulations of cosmetics , and create a personal care products industry : A deodorant invented in Philadelphia and marketed as " Mum " was followed by other deodorants and anti-perspirants containing aluminum chloride as the active ingredient .
The first synthetic hair dye , called " Aureole , " was created in the lab of a French chemist .
Another chemist , in New York , formulated a synthetic mascara and named the product Maybelline , after his sister Mabel .
Most contain aluminum zirconium , which is toxic to the nervous and reproductive systems , a chemical called BHT , which is believed to be a hormonal disrupter and neurotoxin , and various chemicals that give your deodorant stick that distinctive smell .
You 'll also get another dose of propylene glycol , which helps the deodorant go on so nicely but is linked to irritation and immune toxicity .
Think about the last time you drank a canned beverage , put on deodorant , ate fish , or had a cavity filled at the dentist .
Any one of these typical activities potentially exposes the body to toxins from metals .
The canned drink and deodorant both contain aluminum , and mercury is a component of dental fillings , and both are extremely toxic metals .
Buying organic food , refusing vaccines with mercury , and buying deodorant without aluminum will create a ripple effect throughout our economy and environment .
You can make changes in your life and in your world with the choices you make .
What 's more , you can make changes in your personal health .
You can heal yourself from brain damage by improving your diet , limiting your exposure to toxins , and changing the way you live .
You can reverse the effects of depression , anxiety , bipolar disorder , autism , Alzheimer 's , ADHD , and more - if you know how to .
The following conditions can inhibit or impede your body 's absorption and / or utilization of phosphorus : too much iron in your cookware or your diet ; aluminum deposits from your deodorant , antacid , or cook - ware ; vitamin E deficiency ; diuretics ; alcohol ; coffee , tea , or cola ; stress ; X rays , thyroid medication , cortisone , and aspirin ; any other drug ; too little vitamin D , or too much ; too little calcium , or too much ; too much sugar ; too much protein ; diabetes ; starvation ; and excess exercise .
Whew !
Look for aluminum - free deodorant .
As with everything else on this program , finding new products and your rhythm with them may take time .
You may have to try one or two shampoos before you find one that works for you .
Do 45 minutes of restorative exercise , preferably outside .
Practice one core - strengthening exercise today .
If you decided to include licorice root and salt in your program , continue taking them .
Eliminate all conventional home care and personal care products from your life : Shampoo , deodorant , soap , cleaners , detergents , dryer sheets , air fresheners , hair spray , hair dye , cosmetics , etc .
Replace them all with " green home " and " green personal care " products .
Stop eating out of plastic , styrofoam , Teflon and aluminum foil .
Eat out of Pyrex or glass containers .
For cooking , use iron or stainless steel .
Clean your air and water .
Never drink tap water .
Invest in a good water filter ( Lotus Water Treatment System at www.Tersano.com ) .
Most deodorant products in health food stores are made without aluminum .
They contain natural ingredients that fight bacteria , such as tea tree , clay , coriander , lichen and chamomile .
One product to look for is Lavilin .
It contains calendula and arnica , which kill bacteria .
You expressed surprise that someone might use milk of magnesia as an underarm deodorant .
I have been using milk of magnesia for several years .
Despite my initial skepticism , I 've found it to be a remarkably effective antiperspirant .
I apply it directly from the bottle using my fingers .
It is inexpensive ( a bottle lasts months ) , goes on quickly and easily , has no odor , dries clear , does not stain clothing , and is completely effective in stopping odor and perspiration .
It contains no aluminum .
A typical deodorant contains an ingredient that inhibits odor - causing bacteria on the skin , such as triclosan chloride .
Most also contain some sort of fragrance to help mask odors .
And some contain moisture - absorbing powders such as cornstarch or talc .
Antiperspirants , however , contain an additional ingredient that inhibits sweat secretion .
" A common sweat - stopping ingredient is aluminum chlorohydrate , which seems to work simply because the pasty material plugs up sweat glands , " says Donald R. Miller , Pharm .D. , an associate professor of pharmacy at North Dakota State University in Fargo .
She does n't use aluminum kitchen utensils , and she wo n't use any deodorant that has aluminum mentioned on the label .
There has been a lot of controversy in the past few decades over whether aluminum plays any role in the development of Alzheimer's .
Scientific studies have come down on both sides of the question .
Until this debate is settled once and for all , there 's no harm in avoiding aluminum , says Dr. Park .
" It 's absolutely unclear what the cause and effect is , " she says .
" Personally , although I seriously doubt there is a connection , I nevertheless threw out my aluminum pans .
" Antiseptics may be incorporated into deodorant soaps .
Deodorants , formerly called " unscented toilet waters " and " sanitary liquid preparations , " once contained formaldehyde or benzoic acid , which have been replaced with quaternary ammonium compounds .
Deodorant - action , liquid antiperspirants today usually contain aluminum chloride , urea , propylene glycol , and about 75 percent water .
Deodorant - action , cream antiperspirants contain aluminum chlorhydroxide , sorbitan monostearate , polox - amers , stearic acid , boric acid , petrolatum , perfume , propylene glycol , and water .
For six months you ’ve worked really hard to stick to a diet , and it ’s paying off .
Not only have you lost weight , but now more than ever you ’re better able to restrain your impulse to eat fattening foods .
Your friends are telling you how impressed they are with your resolve , and truth be told you ’re feeling pretty damn good about yourself as well .
Which is why , around month seven , you decide that your impulse control is sufficiently strengthened that avoiding being around ice cream , nachos , chicken wings , soda — and all the other things you used to eat out with your friends — is no longer necessary .
You ’ve spent half a year changing the way you think about food and it worked .
Maintenance wo n’t be difficult with a new mindset .
Time to live again .
I probably do n’t have to end this story for you to know how it turns out .
It ’s a classic tragedy with which many of us are already too familiar .
Pride comes before a fall , but even more often it ’s our sense of inflated self - restraint that precedes a tumble into relapse .
A new study in the journal Psychological Science investigated the dynamics underlying why we repeatedly convince ourselves that we ’ve overcome impulsiveness and can stop avoiding our worst temptations .
This particular tendency toward self - deception is called restraint bias , and four experiments were conducted under this study to test the hypothesis that it ’s rampant in our bias - prone species .
In one of the experiments , people walking in and out of a cafeteria were approached with seven snacks of varying fattiness , and asked to rank the snacks from least to most favorite .
Once they finished ranking , participants were told to pick one snack , and further told that they could eat it at anytime they liked , but if they returned the snack to the same location in one week they ’d receive $ 5 and could also keep the snack .
After choosing the snack , participants indicated if they would return it for the money , and then filled out a questionnaire which assessed their hunger level and impulse - control beliefs .
Participants who were walking into the cafeteria said they were hungry , and those leaving said they were full ; so the first evaluation was whether those leaving with full stomachs would indicate stronger impulse - control beliefs – and they did .
The next evaluation was whether the not - hungry participants claiming the most impulse - control would choose the most tempting ( and most fatty ) snacks .
They did .
Finally , would those who selected the most tempting snacks be least likely to return them a week later ?
Indeed , they were .
In another experiment , heavy smokers were asked to take a test to assess their level of impulse - control .
The test was bogus , designed only to label roughly half of the participants as having a high capacity for self - control , and half as having a low capacity .
Being told which label they earned seeded participants with a self - perception in either direction .
Participants were then asked to play a game that pitted the temptation to smoke against an opportunity to win money .
The goal of the game was to watch a film called “ Coffee and Cigarettes ” without having a cigarette .
They could select among four levels of temptation , each with a corresponding dollar value : ( 1 ) keep a cigarette in another room : $ 5 ; ( 2 ) keep a cigarette on a nearby desk : $ 10 ; ( 3 ) hold an unlit cigarette in their hand throughout the film : $ 15 ; ( 4 ) or hold an unlit cigarette in their mouth throughout the film : $ 20 .
Participants earned the money only if they avoided smoking the cigarette for the entire movie .
As predicted , smokers told they had high self - control exposed themselves to significantly more temptation than those told they had low self - control .
On average , low self - control participants opted to watch the movie with a cigarette on the table ; high self - controllers opted to watch with a cig in their hand .
The result : the failure rate for those told they had high self - control was massively higher than for the low self - control group , to the tune of 33 % vs. 11 % .
Those who thought themselves most able to resist temptation had to light up three times as much as those who suspected they ’d fail .
One way to view these results is as reinforcement of a very old cliché : we ’re our own worst enemies .
Restraint bias has a place high on the list of biases we trip on routinely , and tripping on it once is no guarantee of not doing so again , and again … and maybe again .
Dieters relapse , smokers relapse , anyone with anything approaching a compulsion or addiction relapses — usually more than once .
This study suggests that part of this repetition is due to thinking we can handle more than we can .
Another takeaway is that an entire industry is based on bolstering impulse control .
Self help books and motivational speakers aplenty play on a dubious concept , that there ’s a “ gold ring ” of restraint we all can reach — just follow X system to get there .
But what this study suggests is that even if you think you ’ve arrived “ there , ” you ’ll eventually find out that “ there ” never existed .
You were sold a mirage in the form of an inflated self - perception of restraint .
No refunds .
Reality is , psychological bias–restraint bias included –is a lot like conflict .
You ca n’t avoid it .
You just manage it .

" There is no question that there is an orchestrated effort by the government of Iran to acquire weapons in violation of our laws , " said John Morton , assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security for Immigration Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) .
" This is serious business , not a flash in the pan .
Unfortunately , there 's a whole network of these guys out there trying to get weapons and sophisticated technology , and not just for Iran . "
JERUSALEM — Sometimes a quitter really does quit for good .
The Palestinian Authority president , Mahmoud Abbas , announced last week that he would n’t run for re-election in the proposed January elections .
Back when he was Yasser Arafat ’s deputy in the Palestine Liberation Organization , Abbas sulked off to his home in the Persian Gulf several times .
As Arafat ’s prime minister , he quit in the middle of the intifada , accusing the Palestinian leader of undermining him and slamming the U.S. for failing to back him fully .
Each time , he slipped back from exile , until he took over from Arafat on his death and was elected to office , in January 2005 .
But the 74 - year - old now says that he ’s exhausted by the political events of this past year , particularly the failure of the Obama administration to pressure Israel on continued settlement - building in the West Bank .
At first , Abbas ’s announcement was interpreted as a ploy to press Washington and the Israelis .
Israeli , European and Arab leaders called Abbas to beg him to stay on .
The West has long banked on Abbas , one of the formulators of the Oslo Peace Accords , as the best hope for a deal with Israel .
If he were to go , things might look bleak for peace .
( Not that they do n’t look bleak right now . )
Despite the phone calls to Ramallah , most leaders assessed Abbas ’s move as a tactic rather than a genuine expression of finality — like an actress pouting in her trailer until the director strokes her ego .
After all , Abbas said only that he would n’t run in the January elections .
It ’s far from certain that those elections will be held , because Hamas wo n’t allow a poll in the Gaza Strip , which it controls .
That would leave Abbas in office , in spite of his announcement .
Then Palestinian officials started talking to local and international media about what they claimed were Abbas ’ true feelings .
To sum up :
He ’s really had it with the Israeli government ’s intransigence , and the way the U.S. backed down over settlements was the last straw .
Abbas ’ supporters added that if he were to quit , the entire Palestinian Authority might collapse .
It is , after all , fairly unloved among Palestinians .
The only politician to have told his aides he would run to replace Abbas , Marwan Barghouti , is serving a series of life sentences in an Israeli prison .
There are also plenty of Palestinian leaders who hanker for the old days of backroom political deals and lucrative private trade monopolies , which were nixed by Abbas and his Prime Minister , Salaam Fayyad , a U.S. - trained economist .
Still an institution that receives more than $ 1 billion in international aid each year is unlikely to just go away .
For that kind of money , someone will be found to keep it rolling .
The threat of collapse seems like an attempt by Abbas ’ friends to demonstrate how peeved he is .
So why is Abbas out of patience ?
Early in the year , the new U.S. administration pushed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a true freeze on building in Israel ’s West Bank settlements .
Washington insisted the freeze include so - called “ natural growth , ” which Israel uses to expand its building in the West Bank under the guise of new housing for existing residents .
But Netanyahu did n’t cave .
During an Oct. 31 visit to Jerusalem , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised Netanyahu for showing “ restraint ” on settlement building .
Restraint , Arab leaders pointed out , is not quite a freeze .
U.S. diplomats seemed to have been slipping toward this climb down for some weeks .
Abbas already called Obama late last month to complain about it .
That was when he first broached the idea of quitting .
Abbas had , after all , conditioned the resumption of peace talks on a total Israeli settlement freeze .
He edged out onto that high diplomatic branch because he thought the U.S. was behind him .
Gradually he saw that he was going to be left on that limb .
Backing down on the settlements is n’t an option for Abbas .
He ’s already seen as weak and vacillating by ordinary Palestinians .
Over the summer , he backed off when the U.S. pressed him not to insist on an International Court of Justice trial for Israel , after the release of a U.N. report into the Hamas - Israel war in Gaza at the turn of the year .
Palestinian public outcry forced him to shift his position .
But it was too late .
He appeared to have confirmed long - standing suspicions that he lacked strength .
Perhaps really quitting is the only thing that will show he can make a plan and stick to it .

So at last we 've had our fight , and Ian Plimer has cause to regret his challenge to me .
Back in July , Plimer , an Australian professor of geology and a climate change denier championed by the right wing media all over the world , challenged me to a debate in London , to be hosted by the Spectator magazine .
I agreed , as long as he met a simple condition : to answer a list of questions about the claims in his book , Heaven and Earth .
Plimer eventually accepted this condition .
My questions were straightforward : I asked him only to explain or reference the claims he made .
Any reputable scientist would have answered them without hesitation .
But Plimer used a series of excuses and evasions to put me off .
Eventually I gave him a deadline .
Four days before it expired , the Spectator cancelled the debate , and gave Plimer a platform to himself .
It was a shocking episode , which suggested to me that neither Plimer nor the Spectator wanted to face the facts .
Anyway , the Australian television network ABC renewed the invitation .
Knowing that Plimer might use any conditions as an excuse for wriggling out again , this time I agreed without terms .
The debate , which was hosted by Tony Jones , took place live on ABC's Lateline last night .
You can watch it here .
It began with a general discussion about Copenhagen , climate denial and , of course , the hacked emails .
Plimer described the contents of the Climatic Research Unit 's emails as " the biggest scientific fraud in history " .
I replied that , though I deplore some of the behaviour revealed by the emails , Plimer 's own behaviour is highly questionable .
He continues to restate facts after they have been shown to be wrong .
For example , he maintains that volcanoes produce more carbon dioxide than human activity .
The US Geological Survey ( USGS ) reports that human beings produce 130 times as much CO2 as volcanoes .
Jones took up my charge and asked Plimer whether he stood by his claim that volcanoes produce more CO2 than all the world 's cars and industries .
Plimer replied " I 'm very heartened that a journalist is correcting me on my geology " , then launched into a disquisition on how I know nothing about science .
Both of us pressed him to answer the question .
So Plimer said that neither of us had read his book .
We both replied that we had and pressed him again .
Plimer tried to argue that the US Geological Survey only measured emissions from terrestrial volcanoes – not from submarine volcanoes .
Jones , who had plainly done his homework , pointed out that a UK journalist ( I think he was referring to the Guardian 's James Randerson ) had gone back to the USGS and asked them whether or not submarine volcanoes were included in its calculations .
They were .
Plimer went off at a tangent , starting to list the numbers and kinds of submarine volcanoes .
This , I soon found , was a characteristic tactic : when faced with a tricky situation , he starts throwing out random facts .
I pointed out that he had been told many times that the USGS figures include submarine volcanoes : he was making a claim on national television that he should know is wrong .
Jones raised another of the questions I had tried to put to Plimer : the professor has stated that the Met Office 's Hadley Centre has shown that warming stopped in 1998 .
Where , Jones asked , does the Hadley Centre say that ?
Again the random facts came thick and fast .
Plimer said there are four major centres that measure temperature .
Some of them use thermometers ( would you believe it ? ) ; some use radiosondes ; some use satellites .
And if you look at page 481 of my book , you 'll find that I nailed the University of East Anglia , which is actually just a few yards down the road from where Monbiot lives , and , and …
It was a weird form of free association , which might have contained answers to any number of questions – but not the one he was asked .
I pointed out that he had cherry - picked his start date : his claim that temperatures had fallen this century was based on his selection of the hottest year ever – 1998 – as the starting point .
Had he picked 1997 or 1999 , or any other year in the 20th century , he would have seen that temperatures had risen .
Tony Jones asked Plimer to respond .
His answer ranged from the correspondence we had had , to my absence of qualifications , to Roman warming , medieval warming , to the Met Office saying the UK would have a barbeque summer this year , to the temperature 4,000 years ago – in fact any temperature series except the one he was asked about .
Whenever I pressed him to answer the question , Plimer said it was " the height of bad manners " to interrupt him .
When Jones pushed him again , he started talking about wheat farming in Greenland and grapes in Roman Britain .
In my quarter century as a journalist I have never seen anyone go to such lengths to avoid answering a simple point .
Jones asked Plimer about another of his howlers : he had exactly reversed the findings of a paper he cited .
In his book , he claims that " satellites and radiosondes show that there is no global warming " , and gave as his reference a paper by Charles F Keller .
Here 's what the paper actually says :
" The big news [ is ] the collapse of the climate critics ' last real bastion , namely that satellites and radiosondes show no significant warming in the past quarter century .
Figuratively speaking , this was the centre pole that held up the critics ' entire ' tent ' . …
But now both satellite and in - situ radiosonde observations have been shown to corroborate both the surface observations of warming and the model predictions . "
Off Plimer went with another series of random facts , about corrections of satellite data , different datasets : anything but address his reversal of the findings of the paper he referenced .
Yet again I pointed out that he was evading this question , and this time he veered off on to a completely different subject : the websites I read and who is funding them .
He did n't explain what this had to do with his misrepresentation of the satellite paper .
I finished by pointing out that throughout the discussion Plimer had used evasion and distraction when faced with straight questions .
As soon as the interview ended , the emails started pouring in .
Scores of them .
The overwhelming message was that Plimer had been soundly thrashed .
You can judge for yourself .
If you bought his book or read the articles about him and you believed what he said , watch the interview , then tell me you still stand by him .

It ’s been a long wait .
We ’ve sat by and watched as other parts of Missouri have enjoyed beers from Lagunitas Brewing Company for the past few months .
Well , our wait is over .
I just received word from John Griesedieck of Summit Distributing that we should begin seeing Lagunitas beers next week .
According to John , we ’ll begin by seeing a limited amount of Brown Sugga ’ on draught .
We also should be seeing draught Lagunitas IPA on a regular basis .
I should hopefully have a full lineup soon of exactly what will be available in St. Louis .
Nice to have another taste of the West Coast in the Midwest .
General Electric has reached a tentative agreement with the French media conglomerate Vivendi that clears the way for the sale of NBC Universal , including the flagship NBC network , to Comcast , the nation ’s largest cable operator , people briefed on the deal said Monday .
Under terms of the deal , G.E. will buy Vivendi’s 20 percent stake in NBC Universal for about $ 5.8 billion .
It removes one of the few remaining hurdles in its plan to sell control of the television and movie company to Comcast in a $ 30 billion agreement that reflects the changing landscape of broadcast television .
While a deal between G.E. and Comcast still could hit a snag over the final price , it is considered highly likely : G.E. wants to sell NBC because of rising losses , and Comcast wants to buy it to control more of the television programs and movies that flow through its cable systems .
The final threads may take days to sew up and there is a tentative plan to announce a final deal on Thursday , according to these people , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are not complete .
Bernard Madoff is serving a 150 - year sentence
A close friend of jailed US fraudster Bernard Madoff has been found dead at the bottom of his own swimming pool in the US state of Florida .
Police say they are treating the death of 67 - year - old Jeffry Picower as a possible case of drowning .
Mr Picower 's body was pulled from the pool of his $ 33 m ( £ 20 m ) Palm Beach home by his wife and a housekeeper .
Mr Picower , who made a name for himself as a philanthropist , is reported to have been in poor health .
A family spokesman told The Wall Street journal that he had been suffering from Parkinson 's disease .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Local television reported that a fire chief was told by Mr Picower 's wife that he had gone for a swim and was found lying at the bottom of the pool 15 minutes later .
His close friendship with Madoff had placed him in the media spotlight .
Lawyers acting on behalf of the victims of Madoff 's fraudulent investment scheme recently accused Mr Picower of receiving at least $ 7bn from it .
But Mr Picower 's legal team said their client was a victim , not a beneficiary , of the Madoff scam .
Madoff is currently serving a 150 - year sentence after pleading guilty to running a $ 65 bn Ponzi scheme .
MICROSCOPES are invaluable tools to identify blood and other cells when screening for diseases like anemia , tuberculosis and malaria .
But they are also bulky and expensive .
Now an engineer , using software that he developed and about $ 10 worth of off - the - shelf hardware , has adapted cellphones to substitute for microscopes .
“ We convert cellphones into devices that diagnose diseases , ” said Aydogan Ozcan , an assistant professor of electrical engineering and member of the California NanoSystems Institute at the University of California , Los Angeles , who created the devices .
He has formed a company , Microskia , to commercialize the technology .
The adapted phones may be used for screening in places far from hospitals , technicians or diagnostic laboratories , Dr. Ozcan said .

I had a fantasy in which the Fed and the TSA ( Transportation Security Administration ) switched roles .
If a bank failed at 9 a .m. one morning and shut its doors , the TSA would announce that all banks henceforth begin their business day at 10 a.m .
And , if a terrorist managed to get on board a plane between Stockholm and Washington , the Fed would increase the number of flights between the cities .
well yesterday me and my friends are hanging out at my friends house , his parents being out of town so we were playing a version of spin the bottle .
basically if you get picked you put on a blindfold go into a dark room and wait for one of the girls to go in and make out with you .
in essence the girls get the choice of making out with the guy they like or whatever and the guys get to feel some titties and ass , granted it may be some ugly chick , but that is what the blindfold is for .
so after a few beers and joints everyone is a winner .
well i got the bottle and had to go in to await my mate .
pretty soon she comes in and i go to town licking her armpits and tits and grabbing her ass and just generally stopping short of inserting my manhood into the moist confines of this broad .
everyone outside is laughing , but with the beer and joints who would n't i figure i got one of the homely chicks , but i do n't care cause she can kiss good .
finally i notice she has a blindfold also and go WTF ?
so i say why are you wearing one .
and then she speaks ...... and it 's my godamn sister !!!
she had gotten to the party with one of friends right after i had gone in .
and they told her party rule was she had to go in and make out with the guy in the next room , which was me .
i spent the rest of the night puking .
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was fined at least $ 100,000 in September for violating a gag order by suggesting that revenue sharing was on its way out .
Turns out , he was only tipping the owners ' hand .
In a significant move that could impact the flow of money to potential free agents and the competitive balance of teams , the NFL has notified the players ' union that effective in March , owners will pull the plug on the $ 100 million - per - year revenue - sharing program that has subsidized lower - revenue clubs , multiple sources said .
Expert : E -mails show perils of ' activist ' science
By Andrew Freedman
Interview series : Controversial climate e-mails
* How much Saturday snow ?
Full Forecast | Photo contest winners *
The controversy over the unauthorized release of years worth of private e-mail correspondence between a handful of top climate researchers , stolen or leaked from computers at the University of East Anglia 's Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) , has now attracted the attention of top government officials in the United States and abroad .
On Wednesday , two of the Obama administration 's key climate science advisers were grilled about the matter before a congressional committee , and yesterday the climate negotiator for the oil - rich Kingdom of Saudi Arabia made it clear to the BBC that he will raise the issue at the impending Copenhagen climate talks .
Critics of climate science have trumpeted the e-mails as evidence that climate data is not nearly as solid as some researchers and officials had portrayed , with some touting the messages as evidence of a conspiracy on the part of scientists to convince the public and policymakers that climate change is an urgent issue .
Investigations have begun in Britain and the U.S. into how the emails were released , and whether any rules or research practices were violated in the conduct of specific climate science research studies .
In addition , Phil Jones , the director of CRU , has temporarily stepped aside pending the results of his university 's inquiry into the e-mails .
As part of my continuing series of interviews with climate experts , today I bring you an email conversation I had this week with University of Colorado environmental studies professor Roger Pielke Jr. Unlike the subjects of my previous interviews in this series , Pielke sees this controversy as a very significant one , if not for climate science itself then at least for the public perception of that science .
Roger Pielke Jr .
Pielke , not to be confused with his father , climate scientist Roger Pielke Sr. , specializes in the intersection between science and policy , particularly concerning global climate change .
He has conducted research studies on natural disaster trends , and is the author of " The Honest Broker : Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics . "
Andrew Freedman :
What is your general view of the seriousness of the e-mail controversy ?
Does this have major scientific significance , or does it have a greater impact on the public perception of climate science ?
Roger Pielke Jr. :
At this point there is no doubt that the email controversy is quite serious .
Its scientific significance remains to be seen , but the fact of the matter is that credibility of climate science has taken a big hit ( warranted or not ) and this will have consequences for the practice of climate science .
AF : You have been sharply critical of the behavior of the researchers whose e-mails were hacked and published online , writing on your blog that " the emails show a consistent pattern of behavior among the activist scientists to redefine peer review in accordance with their own views of climate science .
In doing so , they sought to turn the entire notion of peer review on its head . "
Do you think they succeeded in redefining peer review , thereby corrupting and distorting the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) process , or is it unrealistic to think that such a small number of scientists could have such a large influence , as many people are claiming ?
RP : I have been critical of the behavior of activist climate scientists for many years .
Their efforts to wage a battle with their political opponents ( who they call " skeptics " in the emails ) on the turf of science has contributed to the excessive politicization of climate science .
The appropriate place to wage political battles is out in the open , and in full consideration of the many factors beyond science that shape our political agendas .
While it is clear that the " skeptics " were / are often hiding their political agendas behind science , that does n't make it right for the activist scientists to do the same .
In fact , there is much more at stake for the scientific community from the activist scientists than the " skeptics " because the activist scientists have claimed to be representing the scientific establishment and are in fact part of leading scientific institutions like the IPCC , and thus a loss of credibility is disproportionately more consequential .
" ʻIf it seems like the issue of politicized science falls in the favor of the skeptics , that is correct .
They can politicize science with less consequences than can the activist scientists .
That is just a fact .
No one said that politics is fair . "
If it seems like the issue of politicized science falls in the favor of the skeptics , that is correct .
They can politicize science with less consequences than can the activist scientists .
That is just a fact .
No one said that politics is fair .
Despite the stated intentions in the emails , the reality is that no one controls peer review in all of academia or even in a field like climate science , and it is futile to try to do so , though apparently this did not stop some of these activist scientists from at least talking about trying to manage the peer review process in ways favorable to their work and unfavorable to their perceived opponents .
No matter how well the succeeded in this effort , seeing their efforts described in the emails looks really bad to most observers .
The IPCC is different however , in that it is controlled by a much smaller group of people .
I 've had my own experiences with the IPCC that lead me to believe that a few individuals can indeed successfully serve as gatekeepers to keep certain peer - reviewed science out of the report .
In areas where I have expertise -- disasters and climate change specifically -- the IPCC has failed miserably .
[ Note : Pielke laid out this argument in more detail in a June blog post . ]
AF : An alternative view of the e-mails would be that they reflect the results of the assault that climate scientists have been under for years from climate skeptics and vested interests who seek to convince the public that climate change is not a major problem and risk management policies are unnecessary .
Would you agree the e-mails show researchers on the defensive ?
Does that in any way mitigate their actions ?
RP : Your question clearly presents these scientists as activists .
How did we get into a situation where some believe that it is the responsibility of climate scientists to engage in a battle with " climate skeptics and vested interests who seek to convince the public that climate change is not a major problem and risk management policies are unnecessary " ?
It is not the job of these scientists to try to influence vested interests or shape public opinion on climate policies through science or using scientific institutions .
Or more precisely , if these scientists wish to engage in overt advocacy , they should do what NASA 's Jim Hansen has done , quite admirably , and be open and up front with their agenda and politics .
They cannot have it both ways - they cannot claim to be focused on truth and advancing knowledge while at the same time engaging in a political battle over climate policy .
The public may not understand the technical details of climate science , but they know politics when they see it .
The IPCC has a formal directive to be " policy neutral " but this is routinely flouted .
I understand that some of these scientists are under the illusion that they are simply pursuing truth .
But the reality is that they have been engaged in a political battle that reflects badly upon them and their institutions .
When political battles take place through science , it is science itself that usually loses out .
AF : What actions would you recommend for climate scientists , including the IPCC , to take regain the public confidence that may have been lost in this scandal , and improve the peer - review process ?
Is an ' open ' peer - review system , using online communications , a viable option ?
Or is the current system not as broken as it might seem ?
RP : More openness , more transparency , more diversity , and more attention to the social construction of expertise is needed .
The IPCC was more or less " outsourced " by decision makers to the academic community .
That was a mistake .
We do n't run military or economic policies based on the work of independent academics working in campus - based research centers .
Instead we create institutions that pay close attention to their legitimacy and credibility in the public eye as a matter of good practice .
Why ?
Because such institutions move markets and shape wars -- serious stuff .
If climate policy is to be equally serious stuff we have to take knowledge production equally as seriously .
We have not to date .
From this perspective , the current situation is not the fault of the climate scientists , but those who allowed such conditions and incentives to develop that have fostered the unhealthy politicization of climate science .
Fixing it will take some work and some institution building , and will require a new generation of leaders to step up to the challenge .
The climate science community can help by supporting the depoliticization of its leading institutions , but this could very well and understandably face some resistance from those who benefit from the status quo .
AF : You have stated repeatedly that you believe climate change is a serious public policy concern and that risk management measures are needed to mitigate and adapt to it .
Does this controversy change your conclusions ?
RP : Not in the slightest .
AF : What would you say to members of the public who had confidence in the underlying science of climate change but are now questioning it to a greater extent , and also what would you say to the many skeptics who are using this controversy to bolster their claims that the data has been manipulated , and the problem is not so bad after all ?
RP : Over time , the public has been strongly in support of action on emissions reductions in the US and elsewhere .
This support has been broad but not deep , as people consistently rank climate well down on the list of top priorities , behind issues like the economy , health , war , crime , etc .
This is highly unlikely to change .
At the same time , the public 's views of a human influence on climate has also been high , with a few ups and downs over the years .
I would bet that the public 's views of climate scientists will take the biggest hit among these issues .
But it is important to remember that action to decarbonize the economy and better adapt to climate are n't simply a direct consequence of what climate scientists have said about a human influence on the climate system .
An important part of depoliticizing climate science will be to recognize that there are many good reasons for decarbonizing the economy and better adapting to climate .
In fact , I can make a compelling case for doing both , with climate science playing a complementary role in the justification and one where certainties are not required .
When skeptics argue that uncertainty means that no action is necessary , they are also laying a trap , one that many environmental advocates and activist scientists have fallen into .
We do not need to settle very many scientific questions to justify policies that lead to reduced emissions or better adaptation .
The best response to skeptics is to say , yes there are uncertainties , but there are other very good reasons for action .
The questions we should be debating are thus not about science , but what action ?

On the morning of October 30th , 2009 , one of my closest friends and fellow cyclist Rodolfo Rojo age 17 was killed by a speeding vehicle on Biscayne Boulevard between Miami Shores and North Miami while we were on the way home from our friends house .
We had just got him on a bike a week before and he was thrilled with the thought of using a bicycle as a form of transportation .
I convinced him many times that it was safe to ride in the streets with lights .
Rodolfo Rojo attended DCS ( Doctors Charter School ) and is remembered dearly by his family , friends and teachers who attended his viewing Sunday afternoon at the Gregg L. Mason Funeral Home in Miami Shores .
Rodolfo had the proper safety lights on his bicycle , yet a speeding car took his life .
The reality of what happened has really made me believe safety is the most important thing when it comes to cycling .
Rodolfo was the funniest most positive guy I grew up with and has really made me who I am today .
I think we can all learn from what has happened and know that when we push our pedals we are not invincible .
Losing a best friend had never crossed my mind before and now it has become my reality .
Hopefully we can raise awareness of cyclists using the street so this will not happen to anybody else .
All my love goes out to his mother Claudia and his two sisters Emilia , age 12 , and Ana who just turned 16 today , Monday November 2nd . "
Sincerely
Bradley Kelly
------- There will be a memorial bicycle ride for Rodolfo Rojo .
I never had the pleasure of meeting Rodolfo , he was planning on attending his first Critical Mass the day of the accident .
My condolences to all of his family & friends during this difficult time .

Each month the employment numbers are released , and each month the numbers are worse .
In fact , for 22 of the 26 months since the first minimum wage increase in July 2007 , month to month employment in the United States has been declining .
Source : Bureau of Labor Statistics
Prior to July 2007 , only 1 of the 30 months preceeding showed a month to month decline in total employment .
July 2007 was well over a year before the “ financial crisis ” and the housing markets collapsed .
July 2007 was before the stock markets peaked ( October 2007 ) .
So the stock markets were not a forward looking indicator of what was going to happen with employment .
All we needed to look at was government intervening in the labor markets to raise wages above what the markets would support to have an indication of what would happen .
Common sense says if you raise minimum wage , someone will lose their jobs .
The government denies that .
The unions deny that .
But companies that hire will confirm it .
So do the numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Before the first minimum wage increase in this latest cycle of government intervention , there were many metropolitan areas where the minimum wage offered by employers was higher than the minimum wage mandated by government .
On the north side of Atlanta , you would have had difficulty finding a job that started at minimum wage .
Why ?
The demand for labor by business could justify paying more money for that labor .
Yet when government intervenes , and the minimum wage rises higher than what business can justify , job cuts ensue .
Money is not free ( unless you are printing it ) , and these companies had to find the money to pay higher wages somewhere .
This money for the higher wages came out of profits .
At the end of the second quarter of 2007 , corporate profits were $ 1,594.9 billion .
They have declining ever since .
For the most recent quarter reported they were $ 1,226.5 ( second quarter 2009 ) .
This is a decline of 23 % .
Less profit by companies means less hiring going forward .
Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis
Minimum wage increased by 40.5 % during that same time frame .
Do you really believe there is no correlation here ?
Labor is a resource in the United States .
It is the most important resource ( after our Constitutional Freedoms ) .
To increase the cost of this resource arbitrarily by raising the minimum wage has been a disaster .
This action had a cost .
It may have been your job .
When another resource we use rose sharply we all felt the impact .
We all changed the way we did things .
What was that resource ?
Gasoline .
Most of us may use one tank per week , and we felt the pain .
So what do you think companies who had to increase the pay to it 's minimum wage employees felt ?
They felt the pain of raising wages and seeing their profits decline .
Companies are not in bsusiness to earn less and less going forward .
Yet we had no Congressional investigations into the rise in the cost of labor .
For they were the cause .
And today we continue to feel the impact .
I mentioned the minimum wage in February 2009 .
Have we Forgotten the Minimum Wage ?
The labor situation is much worse today .
Despite that , we raised the minimum wage anyway .
Delaying the last increase was not even a consideration .
Minimum wage increases have had the maximum impact they could on employment , and in a very negative way .
If you have lost your job , or had hours reduced , be sure to give the credit to those that have earned it .
Let your Senators and Congressmen know how much they have contributed to this problem .
The American economy is right sizing itself at a rapid rate .
If only Congress could truly understand the role they have played in all of this .
Unfortunately , they would never believe it .
The wage structure in America starts like every building : from the ground up .
Minimum wage is the ground level in terms of employment .
To arbitrarily raise it is destructive to the balance of employment .
And now we are suffering the consequences .
Before the increases , most small businesses were already operating on narrow margins of profitability .
It 's one of the reasons the businesses are still small .
To force them to pay higher wages has forced them to reduce their head count .
Higher unemployment is a direct result of raising wages beyond what the economy can support .
There are so many substantive reasons why Thursday ’s op - ed in the New York Times by Alan Kuperman was just awful that one hardly knows where to begin .
Fortunately , Marc Lynch and Helena Cobban , among others , have covered most of the ground ( except , for example , the environmental and health impacts of an attack on the Bushehr facility , as noted by a recent study by Anthony Cordesman and Abdullah Toukan ) .
To me , a key question , one that should be addressed to the Public Editor at the Times , is why the newspaper , which has opposed military action against Iran , is devoting such an unusually large amount of space ( 1500 words ) to this argument by this particular author at this time .
I would certainly expect something like this on the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal ( which runs John Bolton ’s fulminations against Iran on a regular basis ) or in the Washington Post ( which prefers Gen. Chuck Wald , and former Sens. Chuck Robb and Dan Coats ) , albeit not at such length .
Kuperman , who served at one time as Sen. Chuck Schumer ’s Legislative Director , has recently focused his work almost exclusively on the issue of humanitarian intervention .
Among his many scholarly publications , one can discern no discernible expertise on Iran or on the Gulf region in general .
( He did publish a letter to the Washington Post in February , 2007 , in which he also argued that there was no reason to expect Iran ’s reaction to a strike against its nuclear facilities would be any more hard to handle than Iraq ’s reaction to the 1981 Israeli attack on the Osirak reactor or to the 1998 U.S. air strikes against military targets in Operation Desert Fox . )
The Times notes that he directs the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Program at the Robert S. Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas at Austin ( where he was given tenure last year ) , there does n’t seem to be much of content to that program , at least judging by the Center ’s website and the lack of one for his program .
( He also coordinates the Center ’s International Security Film Series . )
He is currently a fellow at the Wilson Center where his project is to complete a book on “ the moral hazard of humanitarian intervention . ”
It ’s no secret that there has been a major campaign by AIPAC and other groups associated with the so - called “ Israel Lobby ” to ramp up pressure on Iran , but the focus of the mainstream debate until now has been on the desirability and effectiveness of unilateral and multilateral economic sanctions .
All of a sudden , the Times accepts a 1,500 - word piece that argues for a U.S. military attack “ the sooner …. the better ” by someone who has some expertise on nuclear proliferation but none at all on Iran and the Gulf .
How does that happen ?
UPDATE : The NYT op - ed by Kuperman seems increasingly bizarre given Kuperman ’s opposition to a pre-emptive attack on Iraq which he wrote for USA Today Nov 12 , 2002 .
It begs the question of what made him change his views about pre-emptive attacks .
It follows
Pre-emption : Should USA punch first ?
No By Alan J. Kuperman NO Imagine : National security officials tell the president that our adversary possesses rudimentary weapons of mass destruction and is fast developing more sophisticated ones .
The enemy already has used military force to occupy neighboring countries .
Moreover , he has ruthlessly killed millions of his own people to wipe out domestic opposition .
Hawkish advisers say the only way to stop him from becoming an even greater threat is to attack now — preventively .
I hate to ruin the suspense , but the outcome is already known .
The case does not involve Saddam Hussein or George W. Bush .
Rather , the adversary was the Soviet Union of the late 1940s .
The dictator was Josef Stalin , who occupied Eastern Europe , perpetrated massive purges and ethnic cleansing and was on the verge of adding nuclear weapons .
The president contemplating a first strike was Harry Truman .
Fortunately , by rejecting that option , Truman averted World War III .
Instead , the USA pursued containment and deterrence policies that protected us until the Soviet ’s flawed government imploded .
Perhaps a preventive attack could have averted the Cold War .
But the costs would have been so high and the prospects so uncertain that almost no one would advocate such a policy , in retrospect .
President Bush needs to explain what is so different this time around .
Last week , after the United Nations ordered a new inspection regime for Iraq , he declared , “ If Iraq fails to fully comply , the United States and other nations will disarm Saddam Hussein ” by force .
Bush defends his new first - strike policy as a response to the threat that some terrorists aim to attack us with weapons of mass destruction .
In this regard , however , Bush ’s policy is neither controversial nor novel .
When confronting terrorists who cannot be deterred or appeased , and who seek to inflict death and destruction , there is no alternative to pre-emption .
Bill Clinton acknowledged this when he pre-emptively tried to assassinate Osama bin Laden and his inner circle in August 1998 .
What is new and reckless in the Bush policy is applying this doctrine not only to global terrorists but to a state that has no record of materially supporting them , on the sole ground that the state seeks weapons of mass destruction .
While preventing proliferation is laudable , a first - strike strategy is likely to backfire by : * Causing the wars it ostensibly seeks to prevent .
* Undermining efforts to prevent state - sponsored terrorists .
* Encouraging other states to launch similar first strikes , with potentially disastrous results .
* Undermining global alliances necessary to ensure U.S. interests , including non-proliferation .
A first - strike posture runs the risk of triggering the very wars it intends to avert .
In the 1960s , Harvard ’s Thomas Schelling warned that if both sides adopt pre-emption policies , “ the reciprocal fear of surprise attack ” could cause war even if neither side actually has aggressive intention .
History also teaches that “ rogue ” leaders can be reined in without risky invasions .
In the 1980s , Libya ’s Moammar Gadhafi earned a reputation much like that of Saddam today .
An international strategy of sanctions , deterrence and interdiction eventually persuaded the Libyan leader to cut loose the terrorists and offer restitution .
Other states also might copy the dangerous American example .
The Indian government long has considered attacking Pakistan ’s small nuclear force pre-emptively , but has been dissuaded at least in part by U.S. exhortations and fear of international condemnation .
Bush ’s new policy would undercut both of these incentives .
History ’s most fundamental lesson is that military force usually spawns opposition , not compliance .
Bush imagines that by smashing Iraq the USA will coerce other aspirants to regional power to abandon their ambitions .
Rome had similar visions , as has every momentary hegemony .
Nearly all undermined their power by abusing it in that manner .
Even if an attack on Iraq proves a short - term success , it likely would compel other states to band together diplomatically against us .
Indeed , it even could encourage some to acquire weapons of mass destruction as their best guarantee against a U.S. attack .
Unfortunately , the only thing Bush ’s new pre-emption policy is likely to pre-empt is peace .

New Scientist has an interesting article discussing research on how we attribute personality traits to robots .
This is not just the human - like android from research labs , it ’s the robots that are already in widespread use in the workplace and home like the floor - cleaning Roomba .
This is a fantastic snippet about a study on the commercially available Aethon TUG robot , used to deliver supplies on hospital wards , and what staff made of the machine :
TUG , which is made by Aethon , can navigate a building ’s corridors and elevators on its own and tell humans it has arrived with a delivery …
The lack of any social awareness led interviewees to complain that they felt “ disrespected ” by the robot .
“ It does n’t have the manners we teach our children , ” said one , “ I find it insulting that I stand out of the way for patients … but it just barrels right on . ”
Luckily for TUG , its unvarying , one - size - fits - all social skills happened to be a natural fit in the relaxed atmosphere of the post-natal ward , says Mutlu .
But the same default settings were interpreted as demanding and attention - seeking on the oncology ward , which is a more stressful and busy place to work .
“ If you are going to design robots with human - like capabilities you have to design the appropriate social behaviour that goes along with it , ” Mutlu says .
This reminds me of perhaps the only study that has evaluated what personality traits people attribute to the synthetic speech on a voice mail system , rating it as practical , intelligent , courteous , efficient , straight - forward , sophisticated , methodical , progressive and alert .

McDonald 's announced that it is going to provide free Wi-Fi access starting in January 2010 at 11,000 McDonald 's locations across the nation .
It 's about time .
Two summers ago I did a cross-country road trip with my family .
It was a " working vacation " so I sat in the passenger seat pecking away on my laptop as we traversed this great nation .
Every once in a while , I would need to find a Wi -Fi hotspot to check in with the real world .
I am sure there were a plethora of smaller , local establishments providing free Wi-Fi , but when you 're driving 70 mph down the highway those businesses are hard to locate .
I needed a familiar and accessible chain .
I knew that I could get a Wi -Fi connection at any of the ubiquitous Starbucks or McDonald 's locations , but for a fee .
I used my handy dandy GPS to seek out Panera Bread locations .
Panera Bread was one of the first to provide free Wi-Fi .
They were not nearly as plentiful as the Starbucks and McDonald 's establishments , but they were out there .
It is those Panera Bread locations that got my money for coffee , snacks , and the occasional meal .
It was a fair quid pro quo exchange .
I certainly was n't going to stop in to Panera to check my e-mail , and then drive across the street to frequent Starbucks .
Why It 's Dumb to Charge for Wi-Fi
Since AT&T bought Wayport -- the provider of Wi-Fi for Starbucks and McDonald's , the Wi-Fi service at those franchises has been free for AT&T wired and wireless subscribers .
But , for the rest of the people , the Wi-Fi service at McDonald 's costs a minimum of $ 2.95 for two hours of access .
The problem with that is that nobody plans to spend two hours at McDonald's .
Intrepid road warriors trotting across the country just want to check email while grabbing some lunch .
They do n't plan on hanging out more than 15 minutes or so .
Paying $ 3 for that 15 minutes of time is the equivalent of paying $ 24 for two hours .
If used on a moderately consistent basis , it would be much cheaper to simply subscribe to a mobile broadband plan and be able to connect from anywhere you can get a wireless signal .
Why Free Wi-Fi Makes Good Sense
McDonald 's is everywhere .
Had McDonald 's offered free Wi-Fi when I was on my cross-country travels , it would have been much more convenient for me , and would have resulted in McDonald 's getting to keep more of my money .
Trust me , my kids would have greatly preferred that we stop at McDonald 's instead of Panera Bread .
David Coursey , one of my PC World peers , describes how his use of the free McDonald 's Wi-Fi for AT&T subscribers worked in McDonald 's favor .
" On more than one occasion , I 've landed in a McDonald 's parking lot just to use their Wi-Fi .
Often with an icy Coke and a hot order of the world 's best fries from the drive - thru , which I 'm willing to bet is just what Mickey D's hoped I 'd do . "
Travelers who are hungry and looking for a quick meal will choose McDonald 's because they can also jump online to check traffic conditions , news headlines , or sports scores at the same time .
Travelers who need a quick Internet connection to get an urgent e-mail or download a critical PowerPoint presentation will choose McDonald 's because yes , they would " like some fries and a Coke with that " .
Wi-Fi access has already transitioned from being a luxury that people are willing to pay for , to being a free service that sets some establishments apart and draws customers .
Eventually it will simply be expected - like electricity and restrooms , but for the time being McDonald 's free Wi-Fi service differentiates it from many competitors and gives people one more reason to frequent the fast food chain .
Starbucks should get onboard quick .
McDonald 's is already treading on Starbucks ground with the McCafé .
Now I can get a gourmet , whipped - cream topped caffeinated beverage from McDonald 's for half the cost of a similar drink at Starbucks , and get free Wi-Fi at the same time .
Your move , Starbucks .

One of New Zealand 's first safe houses for men affected by domestic abuse is about to open in Gisborne .
Women 's Refuge signed tenancy agreement papers for the men's respite centre - expected to be operating before Christmas - last week , the Gisborne Herald reported .
The community housing home will offer temporary accommodation for men who needed to stay away from their partner or children while the family addressed violence in their home .
Gisborne refuge branch manager Vi Pirini said the centre would make the healing period for families " less traumatic for all parties " .
Up to four men at a time would be able to stay at the centre for a temporary period .
Further support would be available through a close link with a recently developed men's resource centre .
Ms Pirini said men would be hired to run the centre , based at a residential address , under an Oranga Tane , Oranga Whanau arm of the refuge .
Words from the ( investment ) wise for the week that was ( September 21 – 27 , 2009 )
After hitting its best levels of the year on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee ’s ( FOMC ) communiqué , the S&P 500 Index ran into heavy weather on the realization that the Fed could start scaling back on emergency support of the economy .
US equities dropped further later in the week on renewed concerns about the state of the troubled housing market and weaker - than - expected durable goods orders .
In addition to global stock markets declining , risky assets such as commodities , oil , gold and other precious metals all sold off as pundits worried about the winding down of quantitative easing puncturing the “ liquidity rally ” .
Government and corporate bonds , as well as the Japanese yen , emerged as winners .
Hat tip : The Big Picture , September 23 , 2009 .
The FOMC maintained its loose monetary policy following its meeting on Wednesday .
The statement said the committee expected to keep the Fed funds rate target in the 0 % to 0.25 % range “ for an extended period ” .
“ The committee extended the time period over which it plans to purchase Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt and mortgage - backed securities .
The remarks on current economic conditions were more optimistic than in August , and the FOMC now believes the recession is over .
The Fed will keep monetary policy loose in the near term to support the recovery but is laying the groundwork for an eventual tightening , ” said Moody ’s Economy.com .
Although the US Dollar Index ( +0.4 % ) closed a little higher on the week , the greenback hit a one - year low against the euro on Wednesday , with the Fed ’s indication of keeping US interest rates at current levels for a while longer underscoring the dollar ’s status as a carry - trade funding currency .

The past week ’s performance of the major asset classes is summarized by the chart below – a set of numbers that shows risk aversion creeping back into financial markets .

A summary of the movements of major global stock markets for the past week , as well as various other measurement periods , is given in the table below .
The MSCI World Index ( - 1.4 % ) and MSCI Emerging Markets Index ( - 1.2 % ) both closed the week in the red , with the Shanghai Composite Index ( - 4.2 % ) one of the biggest losers among the major stock markets .
After bucking the global weakness that prevailed during the week , Chile is now only 5.1 % down from its July 2007 highs and could be one of the first markets to wipe out all the financial crisis losses .
The major US indices declined for three consecutive days ( from Wednesday to Friday ) and registered their first weekly drop since the last week of August .
The year - to - date gains remain in positive territory and are as follows : Dow Jones Industrial Index + 10.1 % , S&P 500 Index + 15.6 % , Nasdaq Composite Index +32.6 % and Russell 2000 Index + 19.9 % .

Top performers in the stock markets this week were Latvia ( +8.0 % ) , Cyprus ( +6.8 % ) , Israel ( +5.0 % ) , Ukraine ( +4.9 % ) and Saudi Arabia ( +4.1 % ) .
At the bottom end of the performance rankings , countries included Luxembourg ( ‑8.7 % ) , Ireland ( - 4.2 % ) , China ( - 4.2 % ) , Mexico ( - 4.0 % ) and South Africa ( ‑ 3.3 % ) .
Of the 98 stock markets I keep on my radar screen , 44 % recorded gains ( last week 81 % ) , 51 % ( 15 % ) showed losses and 5 % ( 4 % ) remained unchanged .

John Nyaradi ( Wall Street Sector Selector ) reports that , as far as exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) are concerned , the winners for the week included Global X / InterBolsa FTSE Colombia 20 ( GXG ) ( +6.0 % ) , Market Vectors High - Yield Municipal ( HYD ) ( +2.9 % ) , iPath S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures ( VXZ ) ( + 2.9 % ) and United States Natural Gas ( UNG ) ( +2.8 % ) .
At the bottom end of the performance rankings , ETFs included United States Gasoline ( UGA ) ( - 10.8 % ) , United States Oil ( USO ) ( - 8.4 % ) , United States 12 Month Oil ( USL ) ( - 8.3 % ) and iShares Dow Jones Home Construction ( ITB ) ( ‑ 8.3 % ) .
Against the background of the International Monetary Fund ’s approval of the sale of 403.3 metric tons of its gold and beggar - thy - neighbor currency devaluations , Richard Russell reminded us of the following quote from the Republican National Platform in 1932 : “ The Republican Party established and will continue to uphold the gold standard and will oppose any measure which will undermine the government ’s credit or impair the integrity of our national currency .
Relief by currency inflation is unsound in principle and dishonest in results . ”
Russell added : “ My , how times have changed , and not always for the better . ”
Other news is that the summit of G20 countries have agreed , inter alia , to plot a roadmap for the banking industry , align economic policy , ensure that tax havens comply with global standards and phase out subsidies for fossil fuels in the “ medium term ” .
Also , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) closed another bank on Friday , bringing the tally of US bank failures in 2009 to 95 ( 120 since the beginning of the recession ) .
Meanwhile , according to The New York Times , regulators are considering a plan to have the nation ’s healthy banks lend billions of dollars to rescue the FDIC .
This would enable the fund , which is running low on resources as a result of the myriad of bank failures , to continue to rescue the sickest banks …
“ You ca n’t make up stuff like this ! , ” commented Bill King ( The King Report ) .
Next , a quick textual analysis of my week ’s reading .
Although “ banks ” still features prominently , the key words have started taking on a more normal pattern compared with the crisis - related words that have dominated the tag cloud for many months .
The major moving - average levels for the benchmark US indices , the BRIC countries and South Africa ( where I am based ) are given in the table below .
With the exception of the Shanghai Composite Index , which is trading below its 50 - day moving average , all the indices are above their respective 50 - and 200 - day moving averages .
The 50 - day lines are also in all instances above the 200 - day lines .
The August highs and September lows are also given in the table as these levels define a support area for a number of the indices .

Kevin Lane , technical analyst of Fusion IQ said : “ Yesterday ’s [ Wednesday ] intraday sell - the - Fed - news price reversal of the S&P 500 stalled at the area ( 1,079 to 1,106 ) where the index really accelerated its 2008 sell - off .
While we believe liquidity and buying power remain strong and thus pullbacks should be relatively shallow in nature , it does n’t mean we ca n’t get a corrective wave of some magnitude before this sideline liquidity is redeployed .
Additionally , quarter - end window dressing may keep stocks elevated or from slipping too much .
“ However , we do believe putting new money to work in front of this more significant resistance level poses risks .
Initial support below the current S&P levels comes into play near the 1,040 level ( current 1,044 ) .
Secondary supports if 1,040 were to give way would come into play near 980/975 then 950 . ”
David Fuller ( Fullermoney ) , making a successful recovery from heart surgery , said : “… it does look as if Wall Street and other stock markets under its influence have temporarily run out of upside momentum following a good run recently .
Supply in the form of secondary offerings has increased .
This coincides with understandable October jitters as investors recall last year ’s meltdown .
“ At this stage of the bull market cycle , a consolidation would have the benefit of preventing overheating .
When a larger reaction eventually unfolds it is likely to be a providential buying opportunity rather that a repeat of last year ’s harrowing decline – provided monetary conditions remain favorable . ”
The S&P is at a level that should be reached in the third year of recovery from a recession , David Rosenberg , chief economist of Gluskin Sheff & Associates , told Bloomberg ( via MoneyNews ) .
“ The fair multiple for earnings should be 12 or 13 , ” he said .
“ We ’ve blown right through that . ”
( The S&P 500 is trading at a level equal to almost 20 times reported earnings from continuing operations , according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg . )
The Bullish Percent Index shows the percentage of stocks that are currently in bullish mode as a result of point - and - figure buy signals .
With the figure at 86.4 % , this indicator conveys the message that the vast majority of stocks are in uptrends , but the line looks as if it might start turning down from a high level , which could spell at least a short - term top .

As stated often before , share prices have moved too far ahead of economic reality .
This calls for a cautious approach in anticipation of the market working off its overbought condition and fundamentals reasserting themselves .
I will bide my time while the fundamentals play catch - up , especially as we could be seeing one of those occasional all - change signals in the short - term trends of a number of markets .

Economy
A tentative global economic recovery has begun , according to the results of the latest Survey of Business Confidence of the World by Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ Business expectations are strong that conditions will improve further later this year and early next .
Sentiment is strongest in Asia and South America and among business service firms .
European businesses and those that work in government are least upbeat .
Pricing power is consistent with very low rates of inflation . ”

The Business Confidence Survey ’s results were confirmed by the Duke / CFO Magazine Global Business Outlook Survey of CFOs of 650 companies in the US and nearly 900 in Europe and Asia .
According to the Survey , the economic outlook has improved since the last quarter ; it appears that the Great Recession is ending and economies around the world are stabilizing .
However , the analysis indicates that the recovery will be lethargic , with employment growth lagging behind the rest of the economy .

As far as hard data are concerned , an index compiled by the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis , a Dutch research institute , showed the volume of world trade rising by 3.5 % in July after a revised increase of 1.6 % in June – its fastest rise in more than five years , as reported by the Financial Times .
Also , according to China ’s National Bureau of Statistics ( via US Global Investors ) , as of the end of June 97 % of the 151 million migrant workers in the country have landed a job , a significant improvement from early this year when more than 20 million migrant workers were reported as being unemployed .

The Fed mentioned in its quarterly flow - of - funds report that American households were $ 2 trillion richer on June 30 than they had been three months earlier – the first time in two years that household net worth had increased .
“ Household wealth rose in the second quarter at a 17 % annual rate , or $ 2 trillion , to $ 53.1 trillion after falling at a 13 % rate in the first quarter , the Fed said .
It was the first time since the second quarter of 2007 that wealth had increased .
Net worth is down $ 12.2 trillion from the peak in 2007 , an indication of how much the collapse in stock prices and home prices has hurt , ” said MarketWatch .

On the topic of wealth destruction , the chart below , courtesy of Chart of the Day , not only illustrates that house prices are currently 30 % off their 2005 peak , but also that a home buyer who bought a median - priced single - family home at the 1979 peak has seen that home appreciate by a mere 4 % over the ensuing three decades .

The US has lent , spent or guaranteed $ 11.6 trillion to bolster banks and fight the longest recession in 70 years , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
“ There ’s not a lot of new job creation going on on Main Street , and the liquidity to the consumer and to small business is still contracting , ” bank analyst Meredith Whitney said on CNBC ( via MoneyNews ) .
“ It ’s very difficult to get the engine moving without a lot of government support within that .
So when you slowly wean government support , that ’s going to be the test that I think everyone ’s going to be watching starting in October . ”
Richard Koo , author of Balance Sheet Recession and chief economist at Nomura Research Institute , said in an interview with Kate Welling at Welling@Weeden ( via Dow Theory Letters ) :
“ In this type of recession , the economy will not enter self - sustaining growth until private sector balance sheets are repaired .
Until the private sector is finished repairing its balance sheets , if the government tries to cut its spending , we ’re going to fall into the same trap that Franklin Roosevelt fell into in 1937 ( a crushing bear market ) and Prime Minister Hashimoto fell into in 1997 , exactly 70 years later .
“ The economy will collapse again and the second collapse is usually far worse than the first collapse .
And the reason is that , after the first collapse , people tend to blame themselves .
They say , ‘ I should n’t have played the bubble .
I should n’t have borrowed money to invest – to speculate on these things . ’
But a second collapse affects everyone , not just the bubble speculators , and it also suggests to the public that all the efforts to fight the downturn up to that point – all the monetary easing , the low interest rates , quantitative easing – they all failed and even fiscal policy failed .
Once that kind of mindset sets in , it becomes ten times more difficult to get the economy going again .
“ So the fact that Larry Summers was talking about ‘ temporary ’ fiscal stimulus had me very , very worried .
That whole Larry Summers idea that one big injection of fiscal stimulus will get the US out of the recession , and everything will be fine thereafter , probably led to President Obama ’s saying he ’s going to cut his budget deficit in half in four years . ”

Bloomberg : G - 20 unites again to curb bank pay , align economic policy
“ Group of 20 leaders built on the common front they forged in fighting the financial crisis to chart a shared - path toward a more stable banking system and a stronger global economy .
“ President Barack Obama and his counterparts ended their Pittsburgh meeting yesterday promising to ‘ raise standards together ’ to ensure banks restrain pay and build up capital buffers .
They also established a peer - review process to monitor individual efforts to rebalance their economies and to hand emerging economies a greater say in managing world growth .
“ ‘ There is much more work to be done , but we leave here today more confident and more united in the common effort of advancing security and prosperity for all of our people , ’ Obama told reporters yesterday after hosting his first summit .
“ A lot is at stake .
While the international economy is showing signs of recovering from its worst recession since World War II , pockets of weakness remain , especially in the US and other industrial countries .
Demand for US durable goods unexpectedly fell in August and loans to households and companies in Europe grew at the slowest pace on record , data showed yesterday .
“ ‘ It ’s going to be slow going , ’ said former US Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill , who once ran Alcoa Inc. , the largest US producer of aluminum , from Pittsburgh and still lives in the city .
‘ We ’re getting a recovery but it wo n’t be fast . ’
“ The third summit of G - 20 leaders in the past year plotted a roadmap for revamping the banking industry after the two previous meetings , in Washington and London , focused on fighting market turmoil and reverse the spiral into recession .
“ ‘ Given this is the third meeting of these people in 10 months , the fact that they ’ve gotten as much substantively done as they have is quite impressive , ’ said Edwin Truman , a former adviser to Obama ’s Treasury and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington .
“ After recording $ 1.6 trillion in losses and writedowns , banks were told to avoid ‘ multi - year guaranteed bonuses ’ and a ‘ significant portion of variable compensation ’ must be deferred , paid in stock , tied to performance and subjected to clawbacks if earnings flop .
The G - 20 stopped short of endorsing a French proposal to introduce specific caps on pay .
“ Awards must also be curbed if they are “ inconsistent with the maintenance of a sound capital base . ”
Regulators should be allowed to modify the compensation practices of key firms .
Banks will also have to increase the quality and quantity of capital they hold by the end of 2012 .
“ The growing influence of emerging economies such as China and Brazil was marked by the agreement that the G - 20 would supplant the G - 8 as the guardian of the world economy . ”
“ The leaders agreed to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels in the ‘ medium term , ’ without setting a deadline .
They also plan to intensify their monitoring of tax havens from next month to ensure economies follow through on promises to comply with global standards . ”

MoneyNews : Putin – US should scrap trade barriers
“ Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Friday praised President Barack Obama ’s decision to scrap plans for a missile defense system in Europe and urged the US to also cancel Cold War-era restrictions on trade with Russia .
“ NATO Secretary - General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the Western alliance and Russia should consider linking their defensive missile systems .
“ He said NATO and Russia have a shared interest in combatting the proliferation of intercontinental ballistic missile technology in East Asia and the Middle East .
“ ‘ If North Korea stays nuclear and if Iran becomes nuclear , some of their neighbors might feel compelled to follow their example , ’ Fogh Rasmussen said .
“ Obama ’s predecessor , George W. Bush , had pushed to base elements of a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic , saying it would help defend against a missile attack from Iran .
But the Kremlin strenuously objected , fearing that the system would compromise Russia strategic nuclear capabilities or be used to eavesdrop on Russian military forces .
“ Russian leaders in the past threatened to deploy short - range missiles to the Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad near Poland if the US moved ahead with the missile defense plan .
“ On Friday , the Interfax news quoted an unnamed Russian military - diplomatic source as saying that such retaliatory measures would now be frozen and , possibly , fully canceled in response to Obama ’s decision to scrap the missile defense shield .
“ Russian president Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday praised the US decision to dump the missile defense plan as a ‘ responsible move ’ .

Nigel Rendell ( RBC Capital Markets ) : Softly ahead on CEE
“ Central and eastern European markets have rallied strongly in the past six months but investors should still proceed with caution , says Nigel Rendell , senior emerging markets strategist at RBC Capital Markets .
“ ‘ As capital has gradually returned to the region – through a combination of IMF rescue packages and portfolio flows – economies have started to show signs of bottoming out , ’ he says .
“ ‘ With the backstop of IMF funds for countries in severe financial difficulties , and the promise of precautionary credit lines to others , investors have returned to CEE . ’
“ But are the markets being too bullish and ignoring potential pitfalls ?
Mr Rendell outlines three main risks for the region .
“ First , sustained recovery is highly dependent on a pick - up in western Europe .
‘ Most CEE countries are small , open economies that rely on external demand to create economic growth . ’
“ Second , fiscal accounts in many CEE countries are in poor shape , with spiralling deficits that will require politically difficult tax rises and spending cuts to meet Maastricht budget criteria .
“ Third , the Baltic states and Ukraine are still wild cards , where economic uncertainty and market volatility could feed through to the rest of CEE .
“ ‘ Rather than break long established currency pegs , all three Baltic states have decided to go down the ‘ internal devaluation ’ route .
“ ‘ We remain very doubtful whether this adjustment can work over the medium term . ' ”

The Wall Street Journal : FOMC – home buyers get a reprieve
“ The Federal Reserve , in a move aimed at keeping interest rates low for home buyers through early next year , decided to extend and gradually phase out its purchase of mortgage - backed securities .
“ The Fed ’s action signals its belief that the economy , while in recovery , remains fragile and that housing , which has seen some improvement in recent months , has only started to pull out of its slump .
“ ‘ We definitely need help from the government , ’ says Lee Barrett , president of Century 21 Barrett , a real - estate brokerage firm in Las Vegas .
‘ I do n’t think the market can make it on its own . ’
He also hopes Congress will extend tax credits for home buyers due to expire at the end of November .
“ The central bank left its interest - rate target unchanged at zero to 0.25 % and maintained its expectation that the federal - funds rate , or the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans , would remain low ‘ for an extended period . ’
“ ‘ Economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn , ’ the Federal Open Market Committee said Wednesday in a statement after a two - day meeting .
Though conditions in financial markets and the housing sector have improved , household spending ‘ remains constrained by ongoing job losses , sluggish income growth , lower housing wealth and tight credit ’ , the Fed said .
“ The Fed is about two - thirds of the way through its mortgage - purchase program , which was launched late last year to support mortgage lending , housing activity and broader credit markets .
The central bank ’s decision to complete the full $ 1.25 trillion in purchases of mortgage - backed securities – rather than ‘ up to ’ that amount , as it said in August – ended speculation that it might stop short , as a handful of policymakers have suggested .
The Fed still plans to buy up to $ 200 billion in debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . ”

Bloomberg : Fed ’s strategy reduces US bailout to $ 11.6 trillion
“ The Federal Reserve decided to keep pumping $ 1.25 trillion of new money into the mortgage market to focus on rescuing the US economy as the financial system revives and banks ask for less help .
“ The Fed is allowing some of the 10 support programs it created or expanded after the credit crisis began in August 2007 to expire or shrink .
That caused the first decline in the amount of money the US has committed on behalf of taxpayers to end the recession , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
“ The central bank has purchased $ 694 billion of mortgage - backed securities since January and plans to spend $ 556 billion more by April 2010 to keep interest rates down .
The debt - buying is the biggest program in the Fed ’s arsenal .
“ ‘ The first thing the Fed had to do was stop the bleeding in the banking system , ’ said Richard Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research Corp. in New York .
‘ Now that that seems to have been accomplished , they ’re focusing on the economy by buying mortgage - backed securities . ’
“ The purchases were scheduled to stop at the end of December .
The Federal Open Market Committee decided on September 23 to continue the program through the first quarter of next year and slow the pace of buying to ‘ promote a smooth transition in markets ’ , the committee said in a statement .
It also said the economy has ‘ picked up ’ .
“ The US has lent , spent or guaranteed $ 11.6 trillion to bolster banks and fight the longest recession in 70 years , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
That ’s a 9.4 % decline since March 31 , when Bloomberg last calculated the total at $ 12.8 trillion . ”

MoneyNews : Richard Rahn – the growing debt bomb
“ Assume you had put much of your savings into US government bonds and then you learned the following .
In just the last eight months , the Congressional Budget Office estimates of the amount of additional federal debt to be held by the public grew by an astounding $ 4 trillion for the 2010 - 19 period ; and that the amount of federal debt held by the public grew from $ 5.9 trillion to $ 7.5 trillion in just the last 12 months .
“ In addition , you learned that the federal government ( i.e. taxpayers ) now owns ( primarily through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ) or insures ( through the Federal Housing Administration and other government programs ) about 80 % of the $ 14.6 trillion of home mortgages outstanding in the United States .
Last week , Congress passed a bill requiring all student loans be made by the federal government rather than banks , which means the taxpayers will be 100 % liable for any student loan defaults .
“ You also learned that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is considering tapping its Treasury credit line for up to $ 500 billion .
It needs to do this because of the high number of bank failures and because each bank account is insured by the government ( i.e. taxpayers ) up to $ 250,000 .
The president and many in Congress are calling for a roughly $ 1 trillion health care bill – paid for by additional debt and / or more taxes , which will further slow economic growth , eventually leading to even more debt .
“ Finally , you also became aware of the following facts : Federal government expenditures are growing far faster than the economy , and thus the government is becoming a larger and larger share of gross domestic product .
Obviously , this cannot continue forever because eventually the government would totally drive out the private sector .
“ The entitlement programs ( i.e. Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , etc. ) all continue to grow faster than the economy , and they will take more than 100 % of all federal tax revenue this year , requiring that virtually all of the other government spending programs , including defense and interest payments on the debt , be funded by more borrowing .
“ You are also aware that the government cannot tax its way out of the deficit situation , because increasing income tax rates on the upper income people will both slow the economy and cause them to find legal or illegal ways to avoid the tax increase , and the politicians have pledged to not increase taxes on those making less than $ 250,000 , which includes all but a very few Americans . ”

Bloomberg : Fed said to start talks with dealers on using reverse repos
“ The Federal Reserve has started talks with bond dealers about withdrawing the unprecedented amount of cash injected into the financial system the last two years , according to people with knowledge of the discussions .
“ Central bank officials are discussing plans to use so - called reverse repurchase agreements to drain some of the $ 1 trillion they pumped into the economy , said the people , who declined to be identified because the talks are private .
That ’s where the Fed sells securities to its 18 primary dealers for a specific period , temporarily decreasing the amount of money available in the banking system .
“ There ’s no sense that policy makers intend to withdraw funds anytime soon , said the people .
The central bank ’s challenge is to decrease the cash without stunting the economy ’s recovery and before it sparks inflation .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a July Wall Street Journal opinion article that reverse repos are one tool to accomplish that goal without raising interest rates .
“ ‘ One thing the Fed has to figure out is if they can launch pilot programs without spooking the market and creating the perception that they are about to tighten , ’ said Louis Crandall , chief economist at Wrightson ICAP , a Jersey City , New Jersey - based research firm that specializes in government finance .
‘ They are discussing things like accounting issues , and updating the governing documents to the volume of reverse repos the dealer community could absorb . ’
“ Deborah Kilroe , a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , declined to comment about meetings with dealers .
Total assets on the Fed ’s balance sheet stand at $ 2.14 trillion , up more than a $ 1 trillion since the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in August 2007 triggered the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression . ”

“ Bank analyst Meredith Whitney remains bearish on the economy , particularly when it comes to jobs .

“ ‘ It ’s very difficult to get the engine moving without a lot of government support within that .
So when you slowly wean government support , that ’s going to be the test that I think everyone ’s going to be watching starting in October . ’
“ She questioned where new jobs will come from .
“ ‘ Once companies become more productive do they go back and say I want to become less productive ? …
You have to have a revolutionary application to hire people , ’ Whitney says .
“ ‘ Surely if this country becomes massively protectionist we ’ll build up manufacturing capabilities .
Is that necessarily a good thing ?
No . ’
“ Half of the work force toils in small businesses , she notes .
But , ‘ there ’s not a lot of free capital for small business innovation , small business period ’ .
“ As for the banks , ‘ they ’re now doing everything they can to keep loans on the books and not write them down , ’ she notes .
‘ They ’re extending and pretending with loans . ' ”

MoneyNews : Taylor – rates may rise early in 2010
“ The Federal Reserve may hike up interest rates to combat inflation as early as the beginning of next year , says Stanford University Professor John Taylor .
“ Interest rates have hovered at a very low target range of zero to 0.25 % since December , as monetary policymakers have worked to get the country out of the recession .
“ Lower lending rates can eventually lead to rising consumer prices .
“ The government , meanwhile , has earmarked $ 787 billion in stimulus spending programs that should inflate the country ’s budget deficit , which can also fuel inflation , Taylor told Bloomberg News .
“ The Congressional Budget Office predicts the budget deficit will widen to $ 1.6 trillion this year .
“ On top of low interest rates , the Federal Reserve balance sheet has ballooned by $ 1.2 trillion since the monetary authority bailed out organizations such as insurance giant AIG and took on other assets .
“ ‘ The Fed ’s balance sheet has just exploded .
They ’ve got to find a way to bring it down , ’ Taylor said .
“ Now , Obama administration officials say , the financial system is on the mend and it ’s time for the government to start stepping aside .
“ ‘ The financial system is showing very important signs of repair , ’ Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said .
“ Markets on the mend do not mean that the overall economy is very close to fully healing , he also cautioned .
“ ‘ I would not want anyone to be left with the impression that we ’re not still facing really substantial enormous challenges throughout the US financial system . ’
“ Geithner told Congress this week the government will soon roll back support for Wall Street rescue programs , a move that Taylor applauds . ”

Asha Bangalore ( Northern Trust ) : Index of Leading Economic Indicators – confirms economic recovery is underway
“ Chairman Bernanke noted last week that a recovery is most likely underway .
Our forecast is for a 2.5 % increase in real GDP during the third quarter , which is slightly lower than the market consensus .
The advance estimate of real GDP for the third quarter will be published on October 29 .
“ The Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.6 % in August , the fifth consecutive monthly increase of the index .
On a year - to - year basis , the index moved up 1.89 % , the largest gain since May 2006 .
The July - August average translates to a 1.32 % from the third quarter of 2008 , the first increase since the first quarter of 2007 .
Historically , the year - to - year change in the LEI advanced one quarter has a strong positive correlation with the year - to - year change in real GDP .
“ This evidence and other economic reports – ISM manufacturing survey , industrial productions index – support expectations that an economic recovery commenced in the third quarter of 2009 .
“ In August , the workweek held steady , jobless claims , orders of non-defense capital goods and real money supply declined .
The remaining seven components – orders of durable consumer goods , supplier deliveries , building permits , interest rate spreads , index of consumer expectations and stock prices moved up .
Effectively , there is a widespread improvement in economic conditions , which had been brought about by policy changes .
The impact from monetary policy accommodation is evident .
The possible impact from the $ 787 billion fiscal stimulus package will be available in 2010 .
By the end of fiscal year 2009 , roughly 24 % of the fiscal package will have been spent . ”

“ Sales of all existing homes fell 2.7 % to an annual rate of 5.1 million units during August , following a string of four monthly gains .
Sales of new single - family homes fell 2.8 % to an annual rate of 4.48 million units .
The sales level of single - family existing homes is now up 10 % from the record low of 4.050 million units in January .
In the course of the economic recovery , all economic indicators inclusive of housing measures are likely to show small setbacks than post a straight upward trend .
“ It is noteworthy that on a year - to - year basis , sales of all existing homes and single - family homes have risen for three straight months .
The Fed ’s policy statement on September 23 also pointed to improving conditions in the housing sector .
The $ 8,000 first - time home buyer credit appears to have played a role in bringing about stability in the housing market .

Eoin Treacy ( Fullermoney ) : US Homebuilding Index leads Case / Shiller
“ The overlay of the S&P500 Homebuilding Index with the Case / Shiller Composite - 10 Index shows the sector topping out almost a year ahead of house prices .
The sector lost downward momentum from January 2008 and has arguably been in a period of base formation since .
It hit an important low in November , posted a consistent succession of higher reaction lows since and pushed above the 200 - day moving average which has now also turned upwards .
“ Given the sector ’s lead over the Case / Shiller Index , it is plausible to assume that house prices have begun to bottom out .
However , this is also likely to a lengthy process . ”

Bloomberg : Housing crash to resume on 7 million foreclosures
“ The crash in US home prices will probably resume because about 7 million properties that are likely to be seized by lenders have yet to hit the market , Amherst Securities Group analysts said .
“ The ‘ huge shadow inventory ’ , reflecting mortgages already being foreclosed upon or now delinquent and likely to be , compares with 1.27 million in 2005 , the analysts led by Laurie Goodman wrote today in a report .
Assuming no other homes are on the market , it would take 1.35 years to sell the properties based on the current pace of existing - home sales , they said .
“ Helping to stoke speculation the housing slump has ended , an S&P / Case - Shiller Index for 20 US metropolitan areas showed the first month - over - month increases in values since 2006 in May and June , reducing the drop from the peak to 31 % .
Echoing other mortgage - bond analysts including those at Barclays Capital , Amherst cautioned that a change in the mix of foreclosure and traditional sales over different parts of the year lifted prices in the period , as the distressed share shrank .
“ ‘ The favorable seasonals will disappear over the coming months , and the reality of a 7 million - unit housing overhang is likely to set in , ’ they said .
“ The amount of pending foreclosed - home supply has been boosted by more borrowers going into default , fewer being able to catch up once they do , and longer time periods to seize properties because of issues such as loan - modification efforts and changes to state laws , the New York - based analysts wrote . ”

Chart of the Day ( Clusterstock ) : The Option ARM Armageddon
“ The Option Arm Armageddon was supposed to strike in the spring of 2009 .
Across the country , option adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) were set to detonate and start a new wave of foreclosures .
“ But it never happened .
We made it well past when this chart from Credit Suisse showed the option ARMs were supposed to begin to hit .
And the crisis did n’t come .
“ Why not ?
Well , when interest rates dropped to historically low levels as the Fed fought the financial crisis , the wave of resets was held off .
Unfortunately , low interest rates wo n’t last forever – they ’ll now likely strike next year and continue well into 2011 .
Many borrowers who now have the option of making payments so low that they do n’t even cover the interest are seeing their original loan balance grow , even as their home values continue to fall or remain flat .
“ The chart below shows that the option ARM reset problem is comparable to the subprime problem , and will likely last for quite some time .
Armageddon may have been forestalled but it has n’t been overcome . ”

The Huffington Post : Landmark decision promises massive relief for homeowners and trouble for banks
“ A landmark ruling in a recent Kansas Supreme Court case may have given millions of distressed homeowners the legal wedge they need to avoid foreclosure .
In Landmark National Bank v. Kesler , 2009 Kan. LEXIS 834 , the Kansas Supreme Court held that a nominee company called MERS has no right or standing to bring an action for foreclosure .
MERS is an acronym for Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems , a private company that registers mortgages electronically and tracks changes in ownership .
“ The significance of the holding is that if MERS has no standing to foreclose , then nobody has standing to foreclose – on 60 million mortgages .
That is the number of American mortgages currently reported to be held by MERS .
Over half of all new US residential mortgage loans are registered with MERS and recorded in its name .
Holdings of the Kansas Supreme Court are not binding on the rest of the country , but they are dicta of which other courts take note ; and the reasoning behind the decision is sound .
“ The development of ‘ electronic ’ mortgages managed by MERS went hand in hand with the ‘ securitization ’ of mortgage loans – chopping them into pieces and selling them off to investors .
In the heyday of mortgage securitizations , before investors got wise to their risks , lenders would slice up loans , bundle them into ‘ financial products ’ called ‘ collateralized debt obligations ’ ( CDOs ) , ostensibly insure them against default by wrapping them in derivatives called ‘ credit default swaps ’ , and sell them to pension funds , municipal funds , foreign investment funds , and so forth .
“ There were many secured parties , and the pieces kept changing hands ; but MERS supposedly kept track of all these changes electronically .
MERS would register and record mortgage loans in its name , and it would bring foreclosure actions in its name .
MERS not only facilitated the rapid turnover of mortgages and mortgage - backed securities , but it has served as a sort of ‘ corporate shield ’ that protects investors from claims by borrowers concerning predatory lending practices . ”

Bloomberg : Card defaults surge in August
“ US credit - card defaults rose to a record in August and more losses may lie ahead as delinquencies climbed for the first time since March , according to Moody ’s Investors Service .
“ Write - offs rose to 11.49 % from 10.52 % in July , Moody ’s said today in a report .
Loans at least 30 days delinquent rose to 5.8 % from 5.73 % .
‘ Early - stage ’ delinquencies , or loans overdue 30 to 59 days , surged to 1.65 % , from 1.41 % , signaling higher losses in coming months .
Banks typically write off loans after 180 days .
“ Card issuers have struggled with rising defaults as the recession drove up unemployment to 9.7 % and the impact of income tax refunds waned .
Credit - card defaults typically track the US jobless rate since consumers tend to fall behind on payments when their income dries up .
“ ‘ We continue to call for a recovery of the credit - card sector to begin once industry average charge - offs peak in mid-2010 between 12 % and 13 % , ” said the Moody ’s report , which predicted unemployment may reach 10.5 % . ”

Wave of commercial property defaults ahead
“ Once flourishing commercial property sales are expected to hit their lowest point in almost two decades this year , and analysts say the growing loan default rate may significantly lower gains in real estate investment shares .
“ ‘ There ’s no real way to sugarcoat it , ’ Real Capital Analytics managing director Dan Fasulo told Bloomberg .
“ ‘A slowdown of this magnitude certainly has n’t occurred since I ’ve been in the business . ’
“ ‘ Some of the older folks in the industry I talk to said it has a similar feel to the early ’90s , when transaction activity went to basically zero . ’
“ The volume of office sales in the second quarter was 97 % less than the market ’s peak in the first three months of 2007 , according to Real Capital , whose data indicates that only about $ 16 billion of sales for office buildings will complete by year ’s end .
“ Moreover , fewer transactions make it more difficult for buyers and sellers to agree on prices , which in turn makes lenders less able to find the comparable transactions they need in order to evaluate loan worthiness .
“ Returns on office investments this year have been running almost 1 % higher than for moderate - risk long - term corporate bonds .
“ Most commercial property mortgages made within the last few years are headed for default , says real estate financier Ethan Penner .
“ ‘ For anything originated after 2005 , the chances of those loans going into default are very high , ’ Penner told The Dallas Morning News .
“ ‘A large majority of the loans originated in this period will ultimately go into default . ' ”

Financial Times : European property groups face debt time - bomb
“ European commercial property owners face a wave of complex debt refinancings and restructurings that pose a threat to the sector , according to bankers and industry groups .
“ Senior bankers and industry representatives in the UK used a meeting with the Bank of England in the summer to highlight the problems caused by billions of pounds worth of debt that needs to be refinanced or has breached banking agreements .
“ They are particularly concerned about the amount of European debt packaged in complex bonds , known as commercial mortgage - backed securities ( CMBS ) , where restructuring has proved especially difficult and highlighted this issue to the Bank for the first time .
“ The group , which includes senior bankers and representatives from the British Property Federation , the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Investment Property Forum , believes the CMBS market remains important to the property sector .
“ It discussed with the Bank whether a central bank guarantee could be used to underpin the debt issued , or whether the real estate investment trust market could be used by banks to offload their loans .
“ There is mounting concern among industry professionals about how to restructure or refinance the $ 2,100 billion of European commercial property loans , in particular the $ 200 billion in CMBS .
“ A report from the UK industry group that met with the Bank highlighted that the UK commercial property sector could be in negative equity until 2017 and undercapitalised by up to £ 120 billion ( $ 195 billion ) based on current conservative banking refinancing terms .
“ Close to £ 43 billion of loans to the commercial property sector are due for repayment this year alone , according to De Montfort University research .
“ Half of the outstanding European CMBS market needs to be repaid in 2011 and 2012 , and CMBS in default have already proved difficult to restructure .
“ ‘ The amount of outstanding CMBS that need to be refinanced poses an absolutely huge problem , which is waiting to hit the market , ’ said Edmund O’Kelly , head of real estate restructuring at KPMG .
‘ A lot of the technology for creating the structures was imported from the US , but they have never been tested in Europe .
Restructuring CMBS is unchartered territory . ' ”

Financial Times : Financial groups hit by surge in loan losses
“ The US financial sector ’s losses on large loans exploded over the past year , exceeding the combined losses since 2001 , with hedge funds and other members of the ‘ shadow banking system ’ hit the hardest , official figures revealed on Thursday .
“ Regulators ’ annual review of ‘ shared national credits ’ – loans larger than $ 20 million shared by three or more federally regulated institutions – highlighted the toll taken by the crisis on financial groups outside the traditional banking sector .
“ More than one in three dollars lent by non -bank institutions such as hedge funds , securitisation vehicles and pension funds , went sour , according to the figures , compared with 11.5 % for US banks .
“ The results will increase fears that , in spite of a recovery in the shares and balance sheets of many banks , the epicentre of the crisis has moved to the hedge funds and investors that gorged on cheap credit in the run-up to the turmoil .
“ The importance of these non -bank institutions was underlined by the review ’s finding that they held 47 % of problem loans , in spite of accounting for only 21.2 % of the total loan pool .
“ Overall , the US financial sector ’s losses on loans in early 2009 reached a record of $ 53 billion , almost triple the previous high in 2002 .
“ The number of loans edging into the danger zone has also surged .
“ Some 15 % of the $ 2,900 billion SNC portfolio was classified as ‘ substandard ’ – the second of the four categories used by regulators – and worse , up from 5.8 % in 2008 .
“ The pace at which loans got into serious trouble accelerated significantly .
The dollar volume classed as ‘ doubtful ’ or loss - making increased 14 - fold over the past year to $ 110 billion .
‘ Doubtful ’ loans are so weak that collection or liquidation is highly improbable . ”

In recent weeks , more investors have been buying the underlying assets at deep discounts , leading to increased trade and boosting prices for some existing CDOs .
“ ‘ There has been a significant increase in the amount of CDO liquidations , ’ said Vishwanath Tirupattur , analyst at Morgan Stanley .
‘ The rally across asset classes has given investors an incentive to liquidate . ’
“ CDOs were one of the main vehicles through which risky US mortgages were repackaged and sold to investors around the world .
Much of their value was wiped out amid a wave of defaults on subprime mortgages .
The inability to sell or unwind complex securities such as CDOs was one of the prime problems of the financial crisis .
Now , the option to sell these so - called toxic assets is re-emerging .
‘ For a long time it may have made sense for investors to liquidate CDOs , but this was not possible when there was no market for the underlying collateral , ’ said Ed O’Connell , partner at Jones Day .
“ The recent rally has been particularly marked for CDOs backed by corporate bonds and loans .
Of the more than $ 500 billion of CDOs backed by asset - backed securities sold in the boom years , $ 350 billion have already experienced an ‘ event of default ’ .
“ Once that happens , the holders of the top tranches , those once rated triple A , can opt to liquidate the CDO .
This involves selling off the collateral .
CDOs backed by corporate loans are now trading at levels last seen nearly a year ago , shortly after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers .
Morgan Stanley estimates about $ 123 billion of these defaulted CDOs have been liquidated . ”

Financial Times : BofA to pay $ 425 million over toxic assets
“ Bank of America agreed late on Monday to pay $ 425 million to federal regulators to extricate itself from an agreement struck last December to protect the bank against $ 118 billion worth of toxic assets , most of which came from Merrill Lynch .
“ The decision to pay the money to the US Treasury , the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation brings an end to one of BofA ’s financial entanglements with its overseers at a time when the bank is also trying to pay back $ 45 billion in funds to the troubled asset relief programme .
“ The loss - protection agreement was part of a deal struck in December after Ken Lewis , BofA chief executive , told Hank Paulson , the then Treasury secretary , that he wanted to invoke a ‘ material adverse change ’ clause to abort his planned acquisition of Merrill Lynch .
“ Mr Paulson , along with Ben Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , encouraged Mr Lewis to proceed with the deal , and provided $ 20 billion in funds , on top of the $ 25 billion already earmarked for BofA and Merrill , to make sure the transaction was consummated .
On top of the money , the regulators gave BofA a guarantee on $ 118 billion worth of troubled assets .
“ BofA did not formally sign a contract for the ringfence protection and in May decided against entering into the insurance programme .
For the past three months , the bank has been in negotiations with federal officials to determine the fair value of the perceived insurance provided by the guarantee .
“ Meanwhile , the US Securities and Exchange Commission said it would consider adding charges to its lawsuit against BofA for allegedly failing to give investors details on executive bonuses . ”

MoneyNews : Foreigners snapping up Treasuries , still
“ While foreign investors such as China have threatened for months to dump Treasuries they are instead grabbing every last one they can get their hands on .
“ Foreigners have purchased 43.1 % of the $ 1.41 trillion of Treasury notes and bonds issued so far this year , compared with 27.1 % of the $ 527 billion issued at this point in 2008 , government figures show , Bloomberg reports .
“ The Merrill Lynch Treasury Master Index of US securities returned 1.18 % in the third quarter after the worst first half on record .
Demand at Treasury auctions from the investor group , which includes central banks , surged to record heights .
“ China is the biggest foreign owner of Treasuries , making net purchases of $ 24.1 billion in July and raising the country ’s Treasury holdings 3.1 % to $ 800.5 billion , the latest official data show .
“ China ’s Treasuries kitty has gained 10 % this year , after a 52 % jump last year .
“ ‘ The interest rate on long - term Treasury bonds is at a very low level by historical standards , ’ David Dollar , the Treasury Department ’s economic and financial emissary to China said at a recent conference .
‘ That says that the market has confidence the U.S. will get the fiscal problem under control . ' ”

David Fuller ( Fullermoney ) : Riding the stock market bull
“ I maintain that we are still in the comparatively early stages of the second psychological perception stage of a bull market , characterized by the ‘ wall of worry ’ .
This stage is often longer than its predecessor – disbelief during the base building phase , or the final euphoria during an accelerated peak .
Today , many investors are still nervous , not least as we have yet to pass the anniversary of last October ’s low , when most of today ’s leaders bottomed .
“ Today , I am not more bullish than earlier in the year when China and other favorites were so clearly leading the base formation development and completion stage .
After all , the low hanging fruit in terms of valuation bargains has already been harvested .
Nevertheless , momentum bull phases should not be underestimated , especially when interest rates remain low and monetary policy is still accommodative .
Also , the earnings growth phase of this bull cycle lies ahead of us and this will be more robust in Asia than most other regions of the globe .
“ As investors we need to remember that due to the human element , markets are much more volatile than changes in underlying fundamentals .
Over the last year we have seen astonishing fundamental changes and even more dramatic price moves .
We are moving into a period when fundamental surprises should be mainly to the upside , not least due to year - on - year comparisons for 4Q 2009 and 1Q 2010 .
Once again , this should favour Asia , export and some consumer stocks excepted .
“ Meanwhile , investors will recall that even bullish momentum moves are sometimes punctuated by sudden reactions and consolidations .
These may be triggered by a temporary news item or they may be random .
It is difficult to time setbacks in an overall bullish environment although they are usually proceeded by overextensions relative to a mean such as the 200 - day moving average .
Mean reversions within an overall upward trend … are usually buying opportunities .
“ The next significant danger period for investors is unlikely to arrive until a few months after leading central banks have clearly signaled their intent to tighten monetary policy .
Today , we hear plenty of discussion as to when this might occur but policies remain accommodative . ”

Eoin Treacy ( Fullermoney ) : Monetary conditions remain accommodative
“ Interest rates have fallen about as low as they can go in the US and Japan and are only slightly higher in the UK and Europe .
Most countries are now signalling that their next move will be upwards .
However , this is not an immediate threat and central banks are only beginning to examine how stimulus can responsibly be removed .
The process by which central banks are bailing out their respective financial sectors via the yield curve has been a tailwind for most stock and commodity markets .
“ If we examine spreads between 10yr and 2yr yields across a range of countries a very similar pattern emerges .
Spreads in the US , Eurozone , Canada and Switzerland are all close to historic highs .
The corresponding spread for the UK is at new 17 - year highs and continues to advance .
“ These spreads clearly illustrate the loose monetary conditions permeating the global economy .
These extraordinarily loose conditions will not last interminably and the current strong tailwind provided to risk assets will decrease over time .
However , it will not turn into a significant headwind until the next time these spreads invert , with moves below 0 % .
When this occurs , it will be a warning that we are in the latter stages of what remains likely to be a multi - year stock market advance .
“ No significant uptrend unfolds in a straight line .
We can expect occasional corrections along the way .
However , as long as monetary conditions remain accommodative , these are likely to be good medium - term buying opportunities . ”

“ Economist David Rosenberg says the stock market has way overdone it on the upside .
“ The Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index has soared 60 % from its March low .
“ The S&P is at a level that should be reached in the third year of recovery from a recession , Rosenberg , chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc. in Toronto , told Bloomberg .
“ ‘ The market is being really fueled here by technicals and momentum , ’ the former chief North American economist for Merrill Lynch said .
“ ‘ It has overshot the fundamentals .
I ’m a little nervous , at least over the near - term . ’
“ Earnings for companies in the S&P 500 Index have fallen for a record eight straight quarters and will probably plunge 22 % in the current period before growing 62 % in the final three months of 2009 , according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg .
“ Stock prices have surged to levels equal to almost 20 times reported earnings from continuing operations , the highest level in five years , according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg .
“ ‘ The fair multiple for earnings should be 12 or 13 , ’ Rosenberg said .
‘ We ’ve blown right through that . ’

“ ‘ Where there is inflation in the system as defined by money supply growth and credit growth , you have currency weakness .

If you print the money , they can go anywhere . ’

Chart of the Day ( Clusterstock ) : Investor sentiment rebound could be a bearish sign
“ 42 % of individual investors are bullish right now , according to most recent sentiment data from the American Association of Individual Investors ( AAII ) .
While investor sentiment has changed dramatically since March , we ’re still only moderately above the long - term average of 39 % .
“ The problem is that professional investors are likely to be more optimistic than AAII ’s investor sentiment , since they became optimistic earlier in the game this year .
Overall bullish sentiment could thus be higher once you combine individual investors with these pros .
“ The market could be approaching a tricky stage whereby one has to gauge the potential for new bulls to be disappointed versus that for further bears or fence - sitters to capitulate .
Given the uncertain times , even moderately above - average bullishness , shown below , could signal a short - term sentiment peak . ”

“ The S&P 500 closed at another high for 2009 today , but it still remains well below its 52 - week high of 1,255 ( September 22 , 2008 ) .
As the market has rallied , we have been watching the number of stocks in the index making new 52 - week highs for confirmation of the rally .
Even though the number has been relatively low , with each new high in the S&P 500 , the number of stocks making new highs has increased .
Today [ Tuesday ] , however , was an exception .
Even though the S&P 500 closed at a new high for the year , only 5 % of the stocks in the index hit a 52 - week high .
This is down from last week ’s peak of 7.6 % when the S&P 500 was at similar levels .
Given that it has only been one day , we would n’t read too much into this indicator yet , but it certainly warrants watching . ”

In other words , a rising red line indicates dollar weakness while a falling red line indicates dollar strength .

John Normand ( JPMorgan ) :
This is not a currency crisis
“ The latest sell - off in the dollar has prompted renewed talk of reserve diversification – but this is not the stuff a currency crisis is made of , says John Normand , global head of FX strategy at JPMorgan .
“ ‘ Quantifying reserve diversification is financial alchemy – often attempted and never successful , ’ he says .
‘ But there is decent circumstantial evidence that this process has accelerated since June . ’
“ Mr Normand notes that global foreign exchange reserves are growing at $ 100 billion a month , while official purchases of US assets are running near $ 50 billion .
‘ This sort of divergence is unusual in an environment where rate spreads between the US and the rest of the world are stable , ’ he says .
“ Mr Normand points out that official investors are still sizeable net buyers of US assets , even if the dollar share of total reserve recycling appears to be declining .
“ ‘ We could pander to the dollar - crisis camp and claim that this divergence marks the beginning of the end for the dollar and US asset markets where foreign ownership dominates , but that course would be too easy , ’ he says .
‘ It would also be wrong .
“ ‘ The dollar crisis scenario still looks low - probability for the next three to six months since the US manages to attract a high absolute level of official financing , even though the US ’s relative share of global reserves may be declining . ' ”

Ambrose Evans - Pritchard ( Telegraph ) : HSBC bids farewell to dollar supremacy
“ ‘ The dollar looks awfully like sterling after the First World War , ’ said David Bloom , the bank ’s currency chief .
“ ‘ The whole picture of risk - reward for emerging market currencies has changed .
It is not so much that they have risen to our standards , it is that we have fallen to theirs .
It used to be that sovereign risk was mainly an emerging market issue but the events of the last year have shown that this is no longer the case .
Look at the UK – debt is racing up to 100 % of GDP , ’ he said
“ Crucially , China and rising Asia have reached the point where they can no longer keep holding down their currencies to boost exports because this is causing mayhem to their own economies , stoking asset bubbles .
Asia ’s ‘ mercantilist mindset ’ of recent decades is about to be broken by the spectre of an inflation spiral .
“ The policy headache was already becoming clear in the final phase of the global credit boom but the financial crisis temporarily masked the effect .
The pressures will return with a vengeance as these countries roar back to life , leaving the US and other laggards of the old world far behind .
“ A monetary policy of near zero rates – further juiced by quantitative easing – is completely incompatible with circumstances in most of Asia , the Middle East , Latin America , and Africa .
Divorce is inevitable .
The US is expected to hold rates near zero through 2010 to tackle its own crisis .
“ What is occurring is an epochal loss in the relative wealth and economic power of the old G10 bloc of rich countries compared to rising regions of the world .
The euro , yen , sterling , Swiss franc and other mature currencies will be relegated along with the dollar in this great process of rebalancing , but the Greenback will bear the brunt .
“ The Fed ’s super - loose policy is turning the dollar into the key funding currency for the next phase of the global ‘ carry trade ’ , taking over the role of Japan during its period of emergency stimulus .
“ Mr Bloom said regional currencies would emerge as the anchor for their smaller trading partners , with China , Brazil , or South Africa substituting the role of the US .
Australia is already linking its fortunes to China through commodity ties . ”

Yahoo Finance : IMF approves sale of some of its gold
“ The International Monetary Fund approved on Friday the sale of a limited amount of its gold to help provide loans to poor countries and shore up its finances .
“ The fund ’s executive board said it decided to sell ‘ a volume strictly limited to 403.3 metric tons ’ – one - eighth of its holdings – in a way that does not disrupt the sale of gold in commodity markets , which already were expecting the sale and discounted the IMF decision .
“ The IMF , a 186 - nation Washington - based lending organization , is the third - largest official holder of gold in the world , with 3,217 metric tons , after the United States and Germany .
“ The board said the IMF could sell its gold directly to its members ’ central banks if any were interested or it could put the gold on the open market in phases .
“ China , India and Russia have indicated interest in such purchases as a way of reducing their position in dollar - denominated securities and increasing their role in IMF operations .
These countries and other developing nations have complained the IMF is dominated by the United States , its largest shareholder , and European nations .
“ If the gold is sold on the open market , the IMF said it would inform these markets before any sale begins and report regularly to the public on the progress of gold sales .
“ The IMF said it also would coordinate its sales with major central banks , who agreed last month on ceilings of gold sales amounting to 400 tons annually and 2,000 tons in total over five years .
“ ‘ Hence , on - market sales by the fund will not add to the announced volume of official sales , ’ the IMF said .
“ The head of the IMF , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , expressed satisfaction with the board ’s decision .
“ ‘I am delighted the executive board has given its overwhelming backing to a strictly limited sale of fund gold to put the finances of the IMF on sound , long - term footing and enable us to step up much - needed concessional lending to the poorest countries , ’ he said . ”

James Lord ( Capital Economics ) : Baltic fall reflects China demand
“ The recent sharp fall in the Baltic Dry Index is in part due to an increase in shipping capacity , but primarily reflects waning demand for commodities – especially in China , says James Lord at Capital Economics .
“ ‘ The BDI , which has almost halved since the start of June , reflects the cost of hiring a bulk cargo ship and as such is often seen as an indicator of the health of the global economy .
“ ‘ But we think the BDI ’s drop is due to conditions specific to the shipping industry and to China ’s reduced commodity stockpiling , ’ Mr Lord says .
“ He notes that orders for new ships rose sharply during the boom years for the global economy – and as it takes up to two years to build these craft , many have only recently become available for lease .
“ ‘ However , the supply of new ships began to rise in January – well before the recent correction in shipping costs , ’ he says .
‘ We therefore believe the main driver of the recent BDI decline has been falling Chinese stockpiling of commodities . ’
“ Mr Lord says the global upswing may continue to underpin commodity prices for a while even though Chinese demand has tapered off .
‘ However , commodity markets have already priced in a strong recovery .
We expect global growth to slow in the second half of 2010 – and as such we see commodity prices falling next year .
“ ‘ Indeed , the recent fall in the BDI may be an early warning sign . ' ”

Financial Times : New Zealand climbs out of recession
“ The New Zealand economy grew in the second quarter for the first time since the end of 2007 marking the end of a prolonged recession .
“ Gross domestic product rose by 0.1 % in the June quarter – after five consecutive quarters of contraction .
“ The quarterly rise surprised the market which was expecting a 0.1 % contraction .
News that the nation was emerging from a recession pushed the New Zealand currency to a 2009 high of 72.85 US cents .
“ According to Helen Kevans , economist with JPMorgan , second quarter GDP growth would have been much stronger had inventories not dropped so sharply .
The NZ$ 1.1 billion ( US $ 792 million ) plunge in inventories in June was the largest on record and took 2.3 percentage points away from GDP growth .
“ Demand for exports was met with existing stock , according to Statistics New Zealand , but lower imports and a fall in manufacturing were also responsible for the dramatic fall .
But Ms Kevans says the run down of inventories is positive for GDP growth in coming quarters as businesses will need to replenish stock as global demand picks up
“ Export volumes rose 4.7 % thanks to a surge in shipments of dairy products , forestry and logging .
Import volumes dropped 3.8 % .
“ Although inventories were a drag on economic growth in the June quarter there were some encouraging signs .
Household spending was up 0.4 % on the back of record low interest rates , heavy discounting among the nations retailers , strong migration flows , and signs of recovery in the domestic housing market .
“ Gross fixed capital formation rose 0.1 % buoyed by investment in ‘ other ’ fixed assets , while investment in residential building remained weak as expected .
Business investment was surprisingly firm , rising 1.3 % despite credit constraints and tighter lending standards . ”

Dede Scozzafava is the moderate Republican assemblywoman who withdrew from the congressional race in New York 's District 23 and threw her support to Democrat Bill Owens .
You could call her the forgotten player in the race .
In a district that had been in Republican hands since the 19th century , Scozzafava 's support helped Owens beat back a conservative maverick , Doug Hoffman , whose surging candidacy was fueled by Tea Party activists angry about her moderate views on abortion , gay marriage and President Obama 's $ 787 - billion stimulus package .
Now , Republicans in the New York Assembly are threatening to retaliate by stripping Scozzafava of her party roles .
Minority Leader Brian Kolb is openly talking about removing her as the GOP floor leader .
The two have held several meetings , with Kolb expressing his disappointment in her action .
For her part , Scozzafava is talking about whether she even wants to stay in politics , or seek a seventh term in the Assembly next year .
She told Kolb that she was sorry if she put him in an awkward position , but she does n't sound sorry to have robbed conservatives of a voice in Congress .
" If this is my end , so be it , " she told the Watertown Daily Times .
" At least I know we have a congressional representative who is going to put the interests of the district above the interests of the Club for Growth and Rush Limbaughs of the world . "
The move to punish Scozzafava is reminiscent of what Democrats wanted to do after Connecticut independent Joe Lieberman , who had been the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2000 , went out and campaigned all through the 2008 presidential campaign for Republican John McCain .
As Ticket reported earlier , the Democrats were also pretty ticked off last month when Lieberman threatened to filibuster a healthcare bill if it contained a public option .
Lieberman gets to chair the Government Reform Committee because he caucuses with the Dems , and many of them wanted to strip him of his chairmanship after the presidential defection .
The man who persuaded them not to : Barack Obama .

In Oslo last week , President Barack Obama ironically used his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize to deliver a lengthy defense of the " just war " theory and dismiss the idea that nonviolence is capable of addressing the world ’s most pressing problems .
After quoting Martin Luther King Jr. and giving his respects to Gandhi — two figures that Obama has repeatedly called personal heroes — the new peace laureate argued that he " cannot be guided by their examples alone " in his role as a head of state .
" I face the world as it is , and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people , " he continued .
" For make no mistake : Evil does exist in the world .
A nonviolent movement could not have halted Hitler ’s armies .
Negotiations cannot convince al - Qaeda ’s leaders to lay down their arms .
To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a call to cynicism — it is a recognition of history ; the imperfections of man and the limits of reason . "
Unfortunately , this key part of Obama ’s speech , which the media widely quoted in its coverage of the award ceremony , contains several logical inconsistencies and historical inaccuracies that tragically reveal Obama ’s profound ignorance of nonviolent alternatives to the use of military force .
The Power of Nonviolence
Almost immediately after acknowledging that there is " nothing weak — nothing passive — nothing naïve — in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King , " Obama equated nonviolence with doing nothing .
To live and act nonviolently , however , never involves standing " idle in the face of threats . "
Dorothy Day , Cesar Chavez , Dave Dellinger , Daniel and Philip Berrigan , and countless other genuine peacemakers have put their lives on the line in the struggle for a more just world .
Advocates of nonviolence , like Gandhi , simply believe that means and ends are inseparable – that responding in kind to an aggressor will only continue the cycle of violence .
" Destructive means cannot bring constructive ends , because the means represent the ideal - in - the - making and the end - in - progress , " Martin Luther King explains in his book Strength to Love .
" Immoral means cannot bring moral ends , for the ends are pre-existent in the means . "
Therefore , to put it bluntly , it ’s impossible to create a world that truly respects life with fists , guns , and bombs .
As A.J. Muste , a longtime leader of the labor , civil rights , and antiwar movements , famously said : " There is no way to peace — peace is the way . "
Using a broad array of tactics — including strikes , boycotts , sit-ins , and protests — nonviolent movements have not only gained important rights for millions of oppressed people around the world , they have confronted , and successfully brought down , some of the most ruthless regimes of the last 100 years .
The courageous , everyday citizens who spoke out and took to the streets to stop the murderous reigns of General Augusto Pinochet in Chile , Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines , and Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia , to name only a few examples from recent decades , were anything but passive in the face of evil .
Moreover , these incredible victories for nonviolence were not flukes .
After analyzing 323 resistance campaigns over the last century , one important study published last year in the journal International Security , found that " major nonviolent campaigns have achieved success 53 percent of the time , compared with 26 percent for violent resistance campaigns . "
Victories Against Hitler
Contrary to Obama ’s speech and the dominant narrative about World War II , nonviolent movements in several different European countries were also remarkably successful in thwarting the Nazis .
In 1943 , for instance , when the order finally came to round up the nearly 8,000 Jews in Denmark , Danes spontaneously hid them in their homes , hospitals , and other public institutions over the span of one night .
Then , at great personal risk to those involved , a secret network of fishing vessels successfully ferried almost their entire Jewish population to neutral Sweden .
The Nazis captured only 481 Jews , and thanks to continued Danish pressure , nearly 90 % of those deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp survived the war .
In Bulgaria , important leaders of the Orthodox Church , along with farmers in the northern stretches of the country , threatened to lie across railroad tracks to prevent Jews from being deported .
This popular pressure emboldened the Bulgarian parliament to resist the Nazis , who eventually rescinded the deportation order , saving almost all of the country ’s 48,000 Jews .
Even in Norway , where Obama accepted the peace prize , there was significant nonviolent resistance during the Second World War .
When the Nazi- appointed Prime Minister Vidkun Quisling ordered teachers to teach fascism , an estimated 10,000 of the country ’s 12,000 teachers refused .
A campaign of intimidation — which included sending over 1,000 male teachers to jails , concentration camps , and forced labor camps north of the Arctic Circle — failed to break the will of the teachers and sparked growing resentment throughout the country .
After eight months , Quisling backed down and the teachers came home victorious .
Alternatives to the War on Terror
Obama ’s rejection of negotiations as a possible solution to terrorism also does n’t square with the evidence .
After analyzing hundreds of terrorist groups that have operated over the last 40 years , a RAND corporation study published last year concluded that military force is almost never successful at stopping terrorism .
The vast majority of terrorist groups that ended during that period " were penetrated and eliminated by local police and intelligence agencies ( 40 % ) , or they reached a peaceful political accommodation with their government ( 43 % ) . "
In other words , negotiation is clearly possible .
For his book , Dying to Win : The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism , University of Chicago professor Robert Pape created a database on every suicide bombing from 1980 to 2004 .
Pape found that , rather than being driven by religion , the vast majority of suicide bombers — responsible for over 95 % of all incidents on record — were primarily motivated by a desire to compel a democratic government to withdraw its military forces from land they saw as their homeland .
" Since suicide terrorism is mainly a response to foreign occupation and not Islamic fundamentalism , " Pape said in an interview with The American Conservative , " the use of heavy military force to transform Muslim societies over there , if you would , is only likely to increase the number of suicide terrorists coming at us . "
Apart from pulling U.S. troops out of the Middle East , calling off the deadly campaign of drone attacks , and ending military , economic , and diplomatic support for repressive regimes in the region , how can the threat of terrorism be best minimized ?
A recent article in the Independent by Johann Hari may provide an answer .
Through interviews with 17 radical Islamic ex-jihadis over the course of a year , Hari discovered that they all told strikingly similar stories about what drew them to extremism , and what eventually got them out .
They all felt alienated growing up in Britain , and connected their personal experiences to the persecution of Muslims around the world .
In most cases , however , coming into contact with Westerners who took the values of democracy and human rights seriously , opposed the wars against Muslim countries , and engaged in ordinary acts of kindness first made them question whether they were on the right path .
As I silently carried a cardboard coffin from the UN headquarters in New York to the military recruiting center in Times Square during a protest on the day of Obama ’s speech , I could n’t help but cringe to think of the president justifying the deployment of 30,000 more troops to the " graveyard of empires . "
Every nonviolent alternative has not been exhausted .
In reality , they have yet to be tried .
By Corie Lok
Several gene - synthesis companies yesterday finalized a code of conduct that outlines how to screen orders for synthetic DNA that could be used for terrorist activities .
The code , which has been in the works from the International Association of Synthetic Biology ( IASB ) in Heidelberg , Germany , for a year and a half , reflects for the most part what has become common practice in gene - synthesis companies .
Before filling orders , the firms compare the gene sequences with those from organisms on lists of pathogens , such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's select - agents list .
Most companies then follow up ' hits ' with human investigation of whether the match is valid and the purchaser is legitimate .
But how many companies will commit to this standard and whether this will end the conflict over how best to standardize these practices remains unclear .
Earlier this year , for example , two companies , DNA2.0 of Menlo Park , California , and Geneart of Regensburg , Germany , put forward their own code of conduct that includes only the automated screen ( see ' Keeping genes out of terrorists ' hands ' ) .
Reaching out
In Cambridge , Massachusetts , yesterday , representatives from a handful of US and European companies -- including Geneart but not DNA2.0 -- met to finalize the wording of the IASB code .
The code states that hits from automated screens should be " assessed by a molecular biologist or similar subject matter expert " .
If the hit is deemed to be real and not a false positive , the order should be filled only when people have verified the legitimacy of the customer .
Some of the debate at the meeting centred on whether companies should try to determine the function of the requested genes , helping to clarify the level of risk .
The standard leaves it open to companies to decide whether they would do this .
" Everyone 's struggling with this issue , " says Edward You of the FBI 's Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate .
" It 's not something you can solve in a meeting in a hotel conference room .
If they ever come to a conclusion , that 'd be great , because that makes my job easier and it makes it easier for the [ gene - synthesis ] companies to make the right judgement call . "
" The next thing we will do is to reach out to everyone in the industry with this standard and invite them to join it , " says Stephen Maurer , a lawyer and expert in public policy at the University of California , Berkeley , who helped to formulate the code .
" And in the nature of standards wars , if enough people do that , the war will be over . "
Markus Fischer of Entelechon in Regensburg , Germany , who was the chief architect of the IASB code , says that his company will sign up to the code .
The other four companies that make up the IASB have pledged to adopt it as well .
But it 's uncertain whether the rest of the industry will join them .
The Synthetic Biology Industry Association in Irvine , California , is supportive of the new standard , but it is up to the individual companies whether they adopt it , says Joseph Kittle , chairman of the association .
Competing codes
Representatives from other companies were reticent at the meeting about their plans for selecting a standard .
" We are evaluating this to see how this will fit with our processes , " says Frank Notka , research and development manager at Geneart .
DNA2.0 declined to comment directly on the new standard , although the company did say that it valued " the efforts of organizations such as the IASB " to help forge biosecurity policy .
John Mulligan , chief scientific officer of Blue Heron Biotechnology in Bothell , Washington , says that his company is also assessing the code .
Both Geneart and Blue Heron say that their current screening practices do n't differ much from what 's outlined in the IASB code .
" The issue of getting agreement between competing companies is n't a purely technical issue , " says Mulligan .
" It is hard to get competing companies to agree on anything .
It does n't surprise me that we are n't going to solve this today in this room , but we are moving towards a consistent solution .
We might not all sign the same document , but it 's going to come to the same thing . "
US government officials at the meeting said they were pleased that the industry had taken the initiative to come up with its own standards .
" Having a single code of conduct will help persuade other governments and companies to follow the same approach , " says Robert Mikulak , director of chemical and biological weapons threat reduction at the US Department of State .
The US government will be releasing draft guidelines for voluntary synthetic DNA screening by the end of the year , says Mikulak .
Although there are some differences in the details , the IASB code of conduct is similar to the forthcoming government guidelines , he adds .
At ground level , electric cars like GM's Chevrolet Volt -- due to be launched in November 2010 -- are pretty much everything the U.S. economy is banking on .
The cars promise innovative engineering and a resurgence of the American auto industry .
They mean an America that is manufacturing things rather than just bundling financial instruments .
Cosmically , electric cars mean green technologies that will migrate to China , India , and Brazil , where they will allow for Western styles of personal freedom yet not threaten to overheat the earth .
And you do n't have to be George Clooney to want one .
Electric cars may be vaguely cool , but GM executives are counting on drivers with nothing more than a householder 's logic , something like the good sense to refinance a mortgage when the 30 - year - fixed drops more than 2 percent .
Jon Lauckner , GM 's vice president of global product planning , tells me that his team set out to trump gas - powered cars as a matter of straightforward economics , especially as economic recovery pushes the price of gas back over $ 3 a gallon .
" At that level , " Lauckner says , " the cost of running a Volt in full electric mode will be about one - sixth that of a gas - driven car of the same size , 2 or 3 cents a mile rather than 12 to 15 cents a mile .
We figured that , for most people , this means a savings of about $ 1,500 a year . "
Sticker prices will be high ; the suggested price of the Volt will be about $ 40,000 .
But federal tax rebates are anticipated to be as much as $ 7,500 , not to mention various state incentives .
So the actual price will probably be closer to $ 30,000 -- not a bad deal , given that borrowing costs will be low for some time .
When he speaks of " full electric mode , " Lauckner is acknowledging another barrier he expects the Volt to take down , namely range anxiety , the fear of getting stuck with rundown batteries while driving in a snowstorm , bumper to bumper , on a 150 - mile trip to the in - laws ' .
The Volt will come equipped with a small gas engine , unlike its forthcoming competitors : the smaller Nissan Leaf , BMW 's plug - in Mini Cooper E , and Ford 's electric Focus .
This engine will not drive the wheels , as with the hybrids now on the market ( actually , GM likes to call the Volt an " extended range electric car , " not a hybrid ) , but will act as a dynamo to supply the electricity for the car after 40 miles of running on stored power .
The Volt 's designers assumed , per Department of Transportation data , that nearly 80 percent of Americans drive 20 miles or less to work .
This is why GM was able to make the technically true but sly announcement that the Volt earned a 230 - mpg rating for city driving from the EPA .
" Most drivers will hardly ever use this engine , " says Tony Posawatz , the Volt 's line director .
" We may have to educate people to change their oil because it has n't been used for a year !
Anyway , when the range - extending engine kicks in , drivers can go up to 300 miles , like a conventional car .
In a pinch , they can make use of the existing gas- station infrastructure . "
And so , assuming these cars prove safe and reliable , American consumers will almost certainly consume them .
U.S. auto companies will make them , and that 's good for the planet , right ?
Yes , but .
NO ONE SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE EASY
The first obvious question to ask -- and because we all now own a piece of GM , we may be forgiven for asking it -- is whether the American car industry will really be able to compete in the manufacture of electric cars .
Or any steel bending , for that matter .
After all , the industry became uncompetitive at making conventional cars .
GM lost $ 82 billion during the past four years .
Emergent Chinese auto companies intend to be producing 500,000 hybrid or all - electric cars and buses by the end of 2011 , by which time Japan and South Korea together will be producing about 1.1 million .
America will be making a quarter of that number .
In the past 30 years , GM 's domestic market share has dropped from around 50 percent to less than 20 percent .
What has changed to make us optimistic about American car companies ?
Another thing :
Are these cars really green ?
Let 's assume that , 10 years from now , 250,000 electric cars will glide home every evening in , say , the Raleigh - Durham Triangle , and plug in .
If Duke Energy did nothing from now till then to prepare , brownouts would be unavoidable , especially in the summer , when the air conditioners would be working hard .
If Duke met the challenge in purely conventional ways , by burning more coal and gas , it would just be shifting the carbon footprint of drivers from vehicles to other , more concentrated generators .
One recent analysis , by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , assumed a scenario in which 25 percent of householders drove electric cars and plugged in at 5 p.m .
Up to 160 large power plants would be needed nationwide to supply the added electricity .
Ed Kjaer , director of the electric transportation advancement program at Southern California Edison , warns that electric vehicles , each equal in demand to about a third of a house , would particularly tax distribution transformers at the local level .
( Each transformer handles the load for about 10 average - size homes . )
" The worst imaginable situation you could have is your neighbor yelling at you because you blacked out the neighborhood , " Kjaer told Scientific American .
Big power companies like Duke Energy and Southern California Edison are hardly complacent in the face of this danger .
But Mike Rowand , Duke Energy 's director of advanced customer technology , admits his company 's answer is a work in progress .
If every American home had a Volt , he says , total power usage in the country would increase only about 10 percent .
But what 's crucial is load distribution : where and in what order the cars ' battery packs are recharged -- and from just where the power is taken .
The maximum environmental benefits of these cars are realized only when they are charged with power taken during off - peak hours and from renewable sources -- for example , in the wee hours of the morning from hydroelectric plants in Quebec or the Tennessee Valley .
Cars can be made smart enough for this .
Even first - generation electric vehicles will have the capacity to tell the grid to fill their batteries immediately or , say , after midnight ; eventually , they will be able to sync to your schedule -- stay at home tonight , PTA meeting tomorrow .
The question is , Can the power grid become smart enough in turn to syndicate demand from millions of electric cars and then transmit power back down to individual vehicles from available renewable sources ?
America has more than 3,200 electric utilities , relatively few of them with the resources of Duke .
Actually , here is where the dots connect and the news turns good .
For the technical challenge of greening electric cars means entering a commercial landscape that mirrors the transformative industries of the 1980s and '90s : computers and software , switching and networking , consumer electronics converging with cellular technology .
This landscape is full of start - ups and medium - size supplier businesses that play to American strengths : entrepreneurship , originality , comfort with the virtual .
We ought to stop thinking about the auto industry as a handful of great manufacturing companies superintending large , dependent suppliers -- or , for that matter , cars as standalone objects .
Rather , the electric car will be a kind of ultimate mobile device , produced in expanding networks for expanding networks ; a piece of hardware manufactured by a burgeoning supplier grid and nested in an information grid interlacing the electrical grid .
Building out these three networks will be more profitable , and a greater engine of economic growth , than building the cars themselves .
There 's a lesson here for government , whose pedestrian duty , as Adam Smith wrote , is to " facilitate commerce in general . "
To facilitate the auto industry in particular , the federal government will need to anticipate a new division of labor among car companies , electric utilities , and , crucially , the layer of new companies that will tie the former two together .
Smartening the grid will mean , collaterally , transforming energy infrastructure in virtually every neighborhood ; as President Obama never tires of reminding us , green energy means businesses creating jobs here , not sending them overseas .
So governments at all levels must get over what once seemed a clear distinction between manufacturing and information services , or automotive jobs and construction jobs .
They must seek to expand employment less by helping original - equipment manufacturers , or OEMs , to grow and more by encouraging small software and components suppliers to launch .
Posawatz , who himself runs a kind of start - up within GM , puts the matter eagerly , if a little cryptically : " Our urgent challenge is to become the leading integrator of the sustainable transportation - energy ecosystem -- to control the intellectual property governing the integration of the battery to the car and the car to the grid . "
Translation : if GM plays its cards right , it could well incubate , and own , the new industry 's crucial operating and telecommunications standards , the anchors for thousands of smaller technology companies supporting the electric car 's components , information , and entertainment and charging needs .
For his part , Duke 's Rowand is sure that 10 years from now the dominant players in this new automotive ecosystem will be companies we have not yet heard of .
POWER ON
Let 's start with the battery and work our way up to the grid .
Battery development has often , and incorrectly , been lamented as an area ceded to Asian firms , a misconception that was strengthened when GM announced that it is initially leaving manufacture of the Volt 's lithium - ion battery cells to LG Chem .
It is true that LG Chem will be producing cells at its huge home facility in South Korea .
But labor is such a trivial cost in making them that LG Chem 's American subsidiary , Compact Power , is investing $ 300 million ( including $ 151 million from the Department of Energy 's stimulus funds ) to set up a supplementary plant in Michigan .
The Department of Energy has meanwhile granted $ 249 million to an MIT spinoff , Massachusetts - based A123 , that will build a lithium - ion battery manufacturing facility to compete directly with Compact Power 's facility .
At any rate , cells are to the battery pack what protoplasm is to an organ or transistors to a computer .
To focus on cells is to miss the point .
I am standing over the Volt 's pack at GM's new $ 30 million testing facility in Warren , Michigan .
It looks like a fat , vinyl - clad cross , meant to fill a slot cut out of the car 's undercarriage .
The pack contains roughly 300 cells .
" The voltage of each cell has to be evenly calibrated to every other , " the lab 's recently departed director , Bob Kruse , tells me .
" Like a chain , performance depends on the weakest link . "
Kruse notes that his pack is in only its first generation .
On the horizon -- " Gen - 3 , " he thinks -- will be a solid - state battery pack that should achieve a 50 percent saving in size and cost , mainly by reducing the volume of liquid electrolytes .
His team is working with the University of Michigan 's Ann Marie Sastry and her start - up , Sakti3 .
Sastry has already raised $ 5 million from a private venture fund and the state of Michigan ; all are counting on the Volt to bring scale to a burgeoning industry .
" Gen - 1 technologies have sufficiently high rates of discharge , very suitable for getting us over the tipping point , you know , where a reasonable part of the vehicle portfolio goes electric , " Sastry tells me .
" But liquid electrolytes present integration limits -- also limits on energy density .
We think that disruptive manufacturing techniques can improve performance dramatically , as in the chip industry . "
Does this not ultimately mean very costly fabrication facilities , as with chips ?
" We aim to create a cheap , scalable process .
But government support and appropriate regulation may be needed for other elements of electrification -- and that 's justified .
Think of what we spend to secure oil .
Think of the livability of cities and the dangers of climate change .
But the changes have to be reinforced by companies making a profit . "
By the way , one of the more compelling businesses to expect from the proliferation of battery packs will come into relief only after Gen - 1 cells end their useful lives in cars .
Lab tests show that , even after 10 years , Volt packs will still be capable of carrying 75 percent of their original charge -- not enough for the vehicle , but more than enough for utilities to use as storage for bulk renewable energy .
Posawatz is excited : " It is easy to imagine warehouses full of used batteries sucking up wind energy and saving it for times the wind does not blow , or homeowners using the pack as backup , " he says .
" For recycling entrepreneurs , this means a whole new way of doing business . "
YOU HAVE TO HAVE STANDARDS
Around the battery are novel hardware components .
The pack has five connectors running from it -- one for cooling , one for heating , a third for charging , a fourth for monitoring the car 's performance , and the last one for an onboard information and entertainment system .
Each connector , cable , and component represents a race to create a cross-industry standard ; each participant in each race has the potential to turn an innovation into a marketmaker .
Consider the lowly plug , the basic connection to the grid .
A Japanese company called Yazaki developed a new design for recharging from virtually any wiring up to 240 volts .
( The Volt will recharge in eight to 10 hours at 110 volts , in three hours at 220 . )
The design is now supported by all OEMs with electric cars in the pipeline , including Chrysler , Ford , Toyota , Honda , Nissan , Mercedes - Benz , and Tesla .
It carries the name SAE J1772 .
This may seem a humdrum development , but it is hardly that :
By comparison , cell - phone makers agreed only this past June , and under pressure from the European Union , to a standard for charging handsets through a micro-USB cable .
Ultimately , SAE J1772 will stimulate development of infrastructure companies of all shapes and sizes : installation of metered outlets in home garages , say , or even robotic solutions .
Think of the way , back in 1993 , the EPA mandated that the port -- the interface connector -- to the engine 's main computer be of a standard size , so that every mechanic 's scanner could be manufactured and programmed to handle all cars .
The goal was to make it possible for local garages to check cars for a yearly roadworthiness sticker .
But the standard also reinvigorated competition in after - warranty car repair , because it gave those local garages access to any car 's digital systems .
Today , 70 percent of such repairs are handled by independent shops .
More immediately , SAE J1772 is firming up the position of start - ups focusing on recharging stations in public areas such as apartment blocks , airports , and supermarket parking lots -- companies like Coulomb Technologies and AeroVironment , both based in California .
" There are 247 million motor vehicles in the U.S. but only 54 million garages , " Richard Lowenthal , CEO of Coulomb , tells me .
" Fifty - one percent of all San Franciscans park their car on the street overnight .
There are six times as many cars as there are home garages . "
Lowenthal , a former Cisco executive , closed a first round of funding in January -- $ 3.75 million with a German venture fund -- and he has three term sheets for a $ 10 million second round .
At this early stage , Coulomb claims 57 customers worldwide for its ChargePoint system , including the municipal governments in San Jose , California ; Nashville ; and Amsterdam ; and companies like McDonald's .
Business is doubling from quarter to quarter .
" The key to our infrastructure and our venture funding is our network software applications , " Lowenthal says .
" Our chargers are smart enough to consolidate payment from subscribers to all the various power companies , or tell drivers over their phones where they can find incentive pricing , and so forth . "
Finally , Volt - like cars will require a raft of components specific to the blend of engineering decisions embodied in range extension .
Think of the onboard engine that will have to be monitored as the battery runs down or started in below - zero temperatures to warm the pack for a time .
Or think of the sound it makes as the vehicle comes to a stop .
If the engine is charging the battery , not powering the drivetrain , it could well be roaring uninterrupted , like a home generator , unless calibrated to the speed of the car .
And there are going to be new components fit for all electric cars , even those without an onboard engine .
" You want a new generation of regenerative brakes that capture energy when you apply the pedal , " says Frank Weber , GM 's global chief engineer for electric vehicles .
" You want a sound system that worries about how much energy it is drawing .
In conventional cars , air - conditioning systems were driven by belts .
So were hydraulic brakes and steering mechanisms .
Heaters borrowed from radiators .
Now they all need new ' power dynamic ' components -- electric motors for everything .
None of these components can be developed by GM alone or will be for GM alone .
We have to work closely with new , smart suppliers .
As with ABS brakes , they 'll start out with an add - on component , but they 'll eventually turn to the integrations of chips , software , and new materials .
Each generation will get cheaper and more robust . "
Yet for all these innovations , the electric car 's hardware will not really be where the action is .
The Volt 's most important new component will be a huge , evolving chunk of software , built up from federated sources , governing what Weber calls the car 's " dialogue with the driver . "
Managing the cloud of information running in the car 's digital circuits -- balancing the power for acceleration against the duration of charge , say , or locating traffic - free routes to inexpensive charging stations -- will be the Holy Grail .
Posawatz anticipates the " connected car , " beginning with an overarching operating system that monitors and communicates the car 's charging needs , component faults , position , etc. , to various service providers while simultaneously networking drivers to the Web .
" Our car -- but I 'm sure all electric cars -- will aim to create a seamless experience for the driver as he or she moves from the office or home to the road , " says Posawatz .
" We want charging , music , phone , GPS , and so forth to all appear in a kind of dynamic cockpit .
The driver should n't have to fuss with the telecommunications platforms that provide the integration . "
Seamlessness will require new communications standards .
One , provisionally called SAE J2847 , will shape communication between cars and the grid .
Another , Smart Energy Profile , or SEP 2.0 , will guide an application layer managing the efficiency , usage , and price of power .
" We are focusing on the car and building in the capacity to roll up charging data , which can be placed at the door of the power company , " Posawatz says .
But GM is not committing to any communications standard just yet -- and for good reason .
Volts are being designed to nest in GM 's proprietary , satellite - based telecommunications platform , OnStar , which may prove GM 's most underleveraged asset -- indeed , the company 's chance to create a bundled operating and telecommunications system .
OnStar already handles onboard monitoring of critical diagnostic codes and sends out 3.5 million e-mails a month to customers about the performance of their components .
It responds to 2,000 collisions a month .
" We have 5.5 million subscribers already , " OnStar 's president , Walt Dorfstatter , tells me , " and we are about to establish a lab dedicated to vehicle connectivity , anticipating the Volt 's rollout .
Working with other OEMs to put some of our technology on their vehicles is still a definite possibility for us .
OnStar is a proprietary technology , but when proprietary becomes prevalent enough , it becomes the de facto standard . "
THE KILLER APP FOR THE SMART GRID
All of which portends the biggest , most contentious business space on the horizon , and for the widest array of start - ups : load distribution on the grid .
Most important will be companies helping electric utilities digest what OnStar - like platforms place " at the door " and also help them route electricity from renewable sources back into individual cars .
Think of the switching infrastructure that enables us to download a program from an " available " server .
Something like this capability will have to be built in to the electric grid .
The most conspicuous start - up by far in this expanding space is GridPoint of Arlington , Virginia .
The company has raised more than $ 220 million , with major investments from Goldman Sachs , among others .
( GridPoint has just named Posawatz to its advisory board , which already includes networking guru Esther Dyson and energy expert Daniel Yergin . )
GridPoint is working with a number of partners to build the nation 's first smart grid , in Boulder , Colorado , a $ 100 million project .
Its near - term ambition , according to its CEO , Peter L. Corsell , is to give utilities the means to aggregate and manage a network of distributed energy resources : controlling load , storing energy , and producing power .
" There are perhaps 100 million electrical meters in this country , " Corsell says .
" We are working with companies that account for 40 million . "
At the same time , GridPoint is in discussions with virtually all automotive companies with an electric car in the pipeline .
When he dreams out loud , Corsell sees a GridPoint component loaded onto every electric car , the way every laptop contains a signal processor .
" In order to balance the load of an electric utility -- predict load , shift the load out of peak periods , shape the load by integrating renewable energy , and so forth -- it would be ideal to have our software baked into the electric cars themselves , so that what gets reported from aggregations of cars will come to utilities in a format that integrates with how the grid is managed .
The savings for consumers are not at all trivial when the software allows for real - time , dynamic balancing on the grid .
The benchmark equivalent to a gallon of gas during peak hours is somewhere between 60 cents and a dollar .
The cost from renewable in the middle of the night is more like 20 cents . "
Posawatz , for his part , sees a natural division of labor : " We see companies like GridPoint managing what utilities do with data behind the door , providing back to our drivers the charging , billing , and other services that will maximize the cost effectiveness and environment benefit of owning an electric vehicle . "
That said , neither Posawatz nor Duke Energy 's Rowand denies that partnership with GridPoint could eventually become rivalry -- that it matters greatly who determines the format and conveyance of the data placed at the door of power companies and , more important , what gets baked into the cars ' consoles .
I ask Dorfstatter if he can foresee , for example , GridPoint components preloaded onto all Volt - like vehicles in the future .
" It is too early to say , " he replies warily .
For if OnStar will indeed control these standards early on , it might eventually wish to integrate forward to the management of grids , much as Duke Energy -- or makers of power switching equipment like GE or Siemens -- may wish to integrate backward into vehicles .
Corsell embraces the challenge : " We believe there is room for a layer of technology -- and business -- between the various automotive OEMs and the electric companies , " he says .
" A great many electric companies simply do not have the IT talent to manage end - to - end smart charging solutions .
I think we represent a necessary firewall . "
But is this not something GM can do without you , I ask ?
" Do automobile companies really want to assume the liability that comes with mishandled load data ? " he asks in response .
" Just think of the implications for the warranty .
And does Toyota really want to be dependent on a software environment owned by General Motors ? "
This firewall , Corsell knows , could prove thick enough to contain the most valuable and dynamic pieces of what we will mean by an auto industry in a few years , offering enormous opportunities for new entrants .
" The horizons of companies like this will expand with each new generation of smart charging , " Corsell says .

NOT INVENTED FROM SCRATCH
It is important to understand that electric cars like the Volt will benefit from a supplier base already structured like an ecosystem .
Had the technologies of multilateral networking not already existed -- Web 2.0 and the like -- the connected car could never be entertained .
It may be hard to remember that , only a generation ago , big car groups like GM were still gargantuan pyramids of specialization , in which production facilities and critical components were controlled , if not owned , by vertically integrated companies : from metal stamping and engine manufacturing to assembly and distribution .
Information was also assembled by a kind of pyramid , with marketing data flowing up to the peak and production decisions flowing down .
Car companies competed on engineering platforms -- integrated powertrain , chassis , and suspension designs -- onto which they grafted comparatively less expensive bonnets : molded sheet metal , upholstery , and electronics .
GM was the first to perfect this approach .
When I sold auto parts as a college student in the late 1960s , a Chevy ball joint was a Pontiac ball joint .
Marketing gurus focused on skins , manufacturing honchos on guts :
You tried to tantalize with the former and reduce the cost of the latter .
Today , however , car companies look less like pyramids and more like hubs and spokes connecting product teams : teams networked across the globe to one another and to myriad suppliers , a little like open - source software designers .
By 2000 , the most advanced car companies -- Volkswagen Group , for example -- migrated to " modular " design strategies , mandating a sharing of underlying components .
Imagine cars built up from so many Lego pieces , which could be shared across the group and much more spontaneously than platforms were .
Imagine not having to settle for the prix fixe ; rather , order à la carte yet pay the same price for the meal .
What Volkswagen Group put in place , in other words , was an organizational architecture that positioned designers across its brands to network freely with component suppliers working to group standards .
It is at this level of the ecosystem -- that of first - tier suppliers and their suppliers -- where economies of scale make sense .
The keys to making so much freedom work are brand focus and clarity .
GM , alas , did not learn that lesson quickly enough to avoid bankruptcy .
Forget health care costs and SUVs .
GM simply stuck with too many platforms -- 15 by one count -- and distributed these over a dozen brands .
Inevitably , most of its cars became undistinguished while the costs of complexity grew .
The Volt portends a new approach .
Virtually every component in the Volt not specifically reinvented for an electric powertrain was snatched from existing GM product programs .
GM will probably produce about 30,000 Volts in the first two years after launch .
Nevertheless , the car is clearly energizing suppliers -- again , from battery makers to the managers of charging data .
And given how many innovations boil down to code , the Volt is reviving opportunities , particularly for American suppliers .
A ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT
This focus on suppliers , where the focus belongs , frames the role of government .
Yes , the Obama administration has engineered a rise in CAFE standards -- targets for vehicle miles per gallon -- and the House has passed a cap - and - trade energy bill that , if passed by the Senate , will almost certainly pressure energy companies to increase renewable sources of energy .
But I got the sense from talking to Posawatz that improving the mileage of internal combustion engines is like improving the storage capacity of tape cassettes .
It is much more important , he thinks , that governments at all levels help the base technologies of batteries , components , and the smart grid get off the ground , and also help enforce technical standards , like SAE J1772 , to engender a settled environment in which an array of supplier start - ups can compete .
The Obama administration would seem to agree .
The stimulus package has made critical investments in all pieces of the ecosystem .
This includes $ 500 million for producers of electric drive components , including electric motors , power electronics , and other drivetrain components ; and also $ 400 million in grants for the purchase of thousands of plug - in hybrid and all - electric vehicles for test demonstrations in several dozen locations .
The stimulus package also allocated more than $ 4 billion to the development of smart grid technology .
In August , Duke Energy applied for $ 200 million in federal infrastructure funds to accelerate its $ 1 billion electric grid modernization project in Ohio , Indiana , and Kentucky .
Note , however , that when Obama signed the stimulus package , he was introduced by Blake Jones , the CEO of Namasté Solar , a company of 60 employees .
Obama appeared eager to stress that the energy sector will be driven by thousands of fast , smart start - ups growing bigger , not by a few established engineering giants getting a makeover .
The point is , there are far too many living things in the emerging ecosystem to be anticipated by any government or major OEM .
It will take an implicit partnership of hundreds , perhaps thousands , of suppliers to fill out the technology .
The key is to bring them into alignment .
" If governments act to consolidate standards , " Posawatz says , " they can really make a difference in catalyzing competition among suppliers . "
He would not want to impose standards prematurely and cut off promising avenues for innovation .
( Presumably , OnStar 's ambitions are also on his mind . )
But when the catalyzers of the new auto industry are so entrepreneurial and distributed , technical standards hardened by government become virtual roads and bridges .
They are more vital to electric cars than actual ones .
The faster we get to standards , the better .
This principle , of catalyzing competition , is an endless subject I can not do justice to here .
To build out the grid Posawatz envisions , the government must help reduce other obvious barriers to entrepreneurial teams converging on a problem .
The administration might look at an outdated patent office , which has been swamped by software developers in recent years -- filings mainly from big companies , whose fat patent portfolios needlessly block or intimidate entrepreneurs .
It might look at facilitating the exchange , categorization , and monetizing of intellectual property , which cannot flow unless governments engender mutual trust .
Some will persist in calling such government socialist .
But you listen to Posawatz and you know that there is no contradiction between a catalytic commonwealth and an ownership society .
You also know that the old socialism is finished , not because of natural greed or the invisible hand or even because it required , as Oscar Wilde said , " too many evenings . "
Socialism is finished because the old machine - industrial capitalism against which it arose is finished , superseded by technologies so transformative that it seems a privilege to be alive just to witness their diffusion .
“ Being a former professor , I can tell you the uniqueness of what he ’s doing is something for the textbooks , ” said Eugene Sanders , the chief executive of the district , who recalled Ginn ’s pitch to start the academy as “ perhaps the most passionate vision of any person I ’ve ever had the opportunity to hear a plan from . ”
Ginn Academy uses a curriculum that includes an emphasis on science and math to help students pass the state ’s graduation exam .
Ginn knows each student ’s name and home situation , and even decided on the shade of red for the uniform blazers .
He dislikes administrative meetings because he fears becoming “ too corporate . ”
Ginn , who is paid $ 66,950 annually , said : “ The philosophy works because it ’s all based on relationships and trust .
And people do n’t understand , but it ’s so simple .
You have to be consistent . ”
Providing Direction
All students at Ginn Academy must turn right when leaving class , even if they would reach their destination more easily by turning left .
Over the years , he said , too many students have gone the wrong way in life , like one Glenville quarterback from the 1980s who failed to qualify for a college scholarship .
Ginn said there were no academic alternatives to help , and the quarterback ended up on the streets and addicted to crack cocaine .
That kind of lost potential haunts and motivates Ginn .
At the academy , students know someone is always looking out for them .
In addition to 23 teachers , seven youth support staff members serve essentially as life coaches , each in charge of 30 to 50 students .
The seven , who receive district - issued cellphones , are on call 24 hours a day , even during the summer , to help students in emergencies or even to arrange rides to school .
Ginn Academy classes are smaller than the city ’s average , and teachers are asked to be more involved .
The Cleveland Teachers Union endorses Ginn ’s efforts , said its president , David J. Quolke .
Sanders , the district ’s chief executive , said Ginn ’s model could be duplicated .
Danny Ayalon , the deputy foreign minister , claimed that Israel 's policy of refusing to give into US pressure had paid off , while his cabinet colleague Daniel Hershkowitz declared : " The US administration understands what we have always said – that the real obstacle to negotiations are the Palestinians . "
THOUSANDS of seats will be removed from Melbourne 's existing trains over the next two years by new operator Metro to squeeze in more passengers .
And the trouble - plagued air - conditioning units on the city 's 92 Comeng trains - which failed dramatically in last summer 's heat - will not need to be completely overhauled for another six years .
Contracts worth about $ 9 billion signed in August by the Government with Metro and Yarra Trams ' new operator Keolis were posted on the Department of Transport 's website yesterday .

5 Warning Signs of When the Gold Top is Forming
Bill Fleckenstein of the Contrarian Chronicles has put together a tongue - in - cheek list of the five key indicators that will predict when the gold trade has become overly crowded .
Here they are …
* Goldman Sachs will be running bus tours to visit gold mines , like they ’ve arranged for technology companies in the past .
* Instead of TV ads telling people to sell jewelry , we ’ll see ads on CNBC hawking gold to the masses .
* Banks will have found some highly complicated scheme for gold investing , “ because no modern mania has ever ended without the banks finding a way to lose money in it . ”
* There will be a flurry of mergers and acquisitions , and one or two leveraged buyouts for good measure .
* BusinessWeek will discover that gold is “ the wave of the future ” and feature it on its cover .
As Fleckenstein puts it , “ most of these events have occurred before a big mania has ended — be it energy in the late 1970s and early ’ 80s , stocks in the late 1990s or real estate in the middle of this decade .
So it seems to me that what ’s crowded is not the long - gold trade but more likely the camp of folks who think it ’s too crowded . ”
More of his thoughts on gold , including the recent Mauritius central bank purchase of gold and the Icelandic krona and Latvian lats rally against dollar , can be found in MSN coverage of how much longer gold can rise .
Havana , the capital city of the island nation of Cuba is home to nearly 4 million people - 20 % of the entire population of Cuba .
On November 16th the city will celebrate its 490th anniversary , being founded by the Spanish in 1519 .
Havana is also the seat of the state - run economy , one that has been faltering more and more in recent years .
President Raul Castro has even gone so far as to warn Cubans that their socialist system must change - and to invite ( limited ) criticism of the state .
Cuba 's economic woes are compounded by the 50 - year - old trade embargo imposed by the United States , a practice recently condemned ( again ) by the United Nations with a vote of 187 - 3 .

In his 2001 testimony , Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the House Committee on the Budget , and while offering his usual cautions and caveats , Greenspan talked of surpluses for the foreseeable future .
Greenspan spoke of " an on - budget surplus of almost $ 500 billion ... in fiscal year 2010 " .
The National Debt would soon be retired and the Boomer 's retirements secure .
Greenspan offered a projection of " an implicit on - budget surplus under baseline assumptions well past 2030 despite the budgetary pressures from the aging of the baby - boom generation , especially on the major health programs . "
How did that work out ?
The key point is that for the Fed to remain independent , the Fed Chairman - as a rule - should avoid all discussions of fiscal policy .
Now comes Fed Chairman Bernanke today on the deficit .
From Ryan Grim at Huffington Post :
" Well , Senator , I was about to address entitlements , " Bernanke replied [ to Senator Bennett ] .
" I think you can't tackle the problem in the medium term without doing something about getting entitlements under control and reducing the costs , particularly of health care . "
Bernanke reminded Congress that it has the power to repeal Social Security and Medicare .
" It 's only mandatory until Congress says it 's not mandatory .
And we have no option but to address those costs at some point or else we will have an unsustainable situation , " said Bernanke .
...
" Willie Sutton robbed banks because that 's where the money is , as he put it , " Bernanke said .
" The money in this case is in entitlements . "
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke ...
Bernanke emphasized that the government has spent less than half of the money in the $ 787 - billion package passed earlier this year and that analysts are still determining its impact .
" Only about 30 percent of the funds have been disbursed , " Bernanke said .
" It 's a little bit early to make a strong judgment , a little bit early to decide whether or not to do additional fiscal actions . "
No matter if people agree or disagree with Bernanke , to maintain independence the Fed Chairman should not be commenting on the deficit and entitlements .
And from Silla Brush at The Hill : Bernanke : ' Little bit early ' to make case for second stimulus
Once again - it does n't matter whether you agree or disagree with Bernanke - he should not be talking about these issues .
A very poor performance today from the Fed Chairman .
I think I said it before , but I 'll say it once more : I totally love illustration series .
There are some really cool series themes out there , and I guess is a little bit of my duty to find them and share its awesomeness with you guys !
Today , is the Super Heroes and Villains Alphabet !
This guy , Ankles , had the really simple , yet awesome idea to illustrate the alphabet of cool characters , and it turn out to be an awesome series .
Here is the complete alphabet , but for more of his amazing work , you should all check his portfolio at DeviantART !
You guys will enjoy it !

Over at LAKings.com , they are breaking down the best Kings players of the decade by position during this 8 day break for the Los Angeles Kings hockey club .
But over here at The Royal Half … we are doing it a bit differently .
Yesterday , you saw Half Season Ticket Holder Buddy ’s list of his 149 favorite Los Angeles Kings from the past 10 years .
Today … I present the 10 Worst Kings of the Last 10 Years as we continue with ….
The Royal Half : A Decade of Futility in Review !!!!
Check out the top 10 … after the jump !
I ’ve been a dedicated Los Angeles Kings fan since 1988 , but I ’ve spent most of the 00’s ( we never did come up with a clever nickname for the Aught ’s , huh ? ) as a Half Season Ticket Holder , from the 02-03 season until the current season .
So since the Kings have not seen the post - season at all during those years … that makes me , ChrisKontos ( not this Chris Kontos ) an authority on all things that suck related to the Kings .
# 10 . BRIAN WILLSIE – RW
2006 -2008
134 games , 15 goals , 18 assists , 33 points
In 2006 , at the start of his first season as Kings GM , Dean Lombardi signed right winger Brian Willsie to a 2 year , 1.7 million dollar contract .
It seemed like a nice little grab as Willsie was coming off a career season with the Washington Capitals scoring 19 goals and 22 assists in 82 games .
But Dean Lombardi must have not looked at the fine print … as Willsie was Alex Ovechkin ’s linemate for most of that season .
I could have scored 19 goals on a line with Ovechkin .
Check that …
I could have scored 25 .
Hell … Teddy Purcell could score at least 5 on a line with Ovie .
Brian Willsie was the Whipping Poster Boy for Dean Lombardi ’s first 2 years of futility as Kings GM .
I ’ve never heard such a collective groan from the fans in the Staples Center every time his name was mentioned .
( Actually , I hear that groan for Teddy Purcell now . )
Not big enough to be an agitator , not talented enough to be a consistent scorer …
Brian Willsie was just really a giant pile of shit in terms of a hockey player .
I ’ve seen some bad , bad player jerseys being worn by fans at Staples Center … but I ’m yet to see a Willsie one .
If you see one , send the photo my way .
KINGS ’ BLOG THOUGHTS THEN : RudyKelly at : RudyKelly at Battle of California sums it up best here
I despise Brian Willsie .
There is no one in the world who could like Brian Willsie except for maybe his mom , and even she probably thinks he should just pass the puck instead of shooting so damn much .
WHERE IS HE NOW ? : Currently in the AHL skating with former Kings Tom Preissing for the Lake Erie Monsters . 13 points in 26 games .
# 9 . SEAN AVERY – C
2002-2007
218 games , 35 goals , 64 assists , 99 points , 667 penalty minutes
I do n’t hate Sean Avery so much for what he did on the ice as a Los Angeles King .
In fact , Avery was the type of player that you love to have on your team … but if he was on an opposing team you ’d do nothing but hate him .
He was cocky , aggressive , loud and loved to mix it up on the ice .
No , the reason Sean Avery is on this list is because when Dustin Brown was a rookie …
Avery would tease him about Brown ’s lisp .
And that ’s just bullshit .
KINGS ’ BLOG THOUGHTS THEN : From the : From the Fabulous Forum at LATimes .
Com
So , let ’s review .
The Kings trade Avery to the New York Rangers .
Dustin Brown —
Avery ’s whipping boy — blossoms into a quality NHL player and team leader , as the Kings begin moving forward .
The Rangers allow Avery to leave and immediately zoom to the top of the Eastern Conference .
And the Stars ?
Well , they wallow in last place in the Pacific Division .
WHERE IS HE NOW ? : Back in New York , opening nightclubs and apparently playing hockey for the Rangers .
# 8. JEREMY ROENICK – C
2005 -2006
58 games , 9 goals , 13 assists , 22 points
Before the start of the 2005 NHL Season , the Philadelphia Flyers had stacked up their payroll by signing free agent Peter Forsberg .
So something had to give .
And it was Jeremy Roenick and his $ 4.94 million salary .
The Flyers traded Roenick AND a 3rd round pick to the Kings for future considerations … just to get his salary off the books .
For Kings fans … it seemed like a perfect fit .
Sure , Roenick was 35 and on the tail - end of his career , but he was a consistent 20 goal scorer , a great veteran presence and would surely provide a great role model for fellow American bruiser Dustin Brown , right ?
RIGHT ?!!?
Pretty sure you can get a good deal on a Roenick Kings figurine this Christmas .
Not even close .
Roenick showed up to Kings camp way out of shape , blamed his skates and scored a measly 9 goals in 58 games .
He was the type of player that earned former GM Dave Taylor the nickname “ Dumpster Dave ” ; just another over - the - hill hockey player who had come to Los Angeles for sunshine and surf .
( I ’m looking in your direction Rob Blake . )
His time spent in Los Angeles was a complete disaster and a total embarrassment for one of the greatest American born hockey players of all time .
What was his best hit during his time in LA ?
Some show called Leverage .

KINGS ’ BLOG THOUGHTS THEN : Before he had the Inside the Kings blog and before he was a Kings employee , Before he had the Inside the Kings blog and before he was a Kings employee , Uber - Reporter Rich Hammond had this to say in the Daily News
Given that the Kings also signed Pavol Demitra they might focus on defense instead of signing another winger such as Palffy .
In either case , Roenick said he believes Taylor has put together “ a team to be reckoned with ” and Robitaille said he now considers the Kings to be championship contenders .
WHERE IS HE NOW ? : Retired and waiting for NBC to call him to be a color analyst .
7. BRIAN BOYLE – F/D/ TALL
2007 -2009
36 games , 8 goals , 2 assists , 10 points
It ’s not so much the player that Brian Boyle is that infuriates King fans … is the player he could have been .
The Los Angeles Kings had 3 # 1 draft picks in the 2003 NHL Draft .
They took current captain Dustin Brown with the # 13 pick , current Islanders cast - off Jeff Tambellini with the # 27 pick and 6 ’7′ , 250 pound beast of potential Brian Boyle at # 26 .
Drafted directly after Boyle and Tambellini at # 28 ?
Current Anaheim Duck stud Corey Perry .
Yeah , this guy totally would n’t have looked good skating with Kopitar and Williams .
Brian Boyle never had a fighting chance .
The Kings wanted him to use his size as a defenseman … and he struggled at it .
They wanted him to use his size as a power forward … and he started off his NHL career scoring four goals in his first seven games .
And then he stopped using his size again .
This is the curse of people that have big frames and do n’t have the mentality to use it … how exactly is a coach supposed to make Brian Boyle fierce ?
The Kings never found a way and shipped him off last summer to the New York Rangers for a 3rd round draft pick .
KINGS ’ BLOG THOUGHTS THEN : After Brian Boyle lost his spot in the starting line - up to Derek Armstrong , The Royal Half ( the old - school edition ) had these After Brian Boyle lost his spot in the starting line - up to Derek Armstrong , The Royal Half ( the old - school edition ) had these thoughts I had high hopes for Boyle , based on his size , his college career and the scoring he did during his brief call - up last season .
He ’ll show a flash of brilliant puck handling skills once or twice a game , but overall this season he has seemed completely lost out there .
I hope some time in the minors will do him some good .
WHERE IS HE NOW ? : Playing 4th line center for the New York Rangers and starting fights with Playing 4th line center for the New York Rangers and starting fights with teammates
6. MARC CRAWFORD – COACH / HAIR MODEL
2006 -2008
59 wins , 105 losses
( Yes , an OT and shootout loss is still a loss )
Just the wrong guy at the wrong time .
Sure , Marc Crawford was coming off 4 consecutive 40 + wins as the coach of the Vancouver Canucks and he even won a Stanley Cup with the 1996 Colorado Avalanche … ( never mind that was a team that you and I could have won the Stanley Cup with . )
Crawford was handpicked in 2006 by brand new GM Dean Lombardi to lead the young Kings to the playoffs .
And he failed miserably .
Honestly , Marc Crawford is used to being handed a team that is already moderately successful and then improving upon it or keeping it at status quo .
( Just witness his “ success ” in Dallas so far this year . )
He is not a patient , teaching type of coach … he ’s the complete opposite of current Kings coach Terry Murray .
Sure , Anze Kopitar burst onto the scene under Crawford ’s watchful eye … but look at the type of hockey player he has become under Coach Murray .
Crawford could never find a line combination he was comfortable with … constantly changing players around within a single game .
And I could n’t even imagine what Drew Doughty would have been like last year with Crawford as his coach .
But remember … without the complete inefficiency of Crawford as a coach … the Kings would n’t have finished in 2nd to last in 07-08 … enabling them to draft Doughty .
Thanks ,
Marc !
KINGS ’ BLOG THOUGHTS THEN : When Marc Crawford was hired to take over for former Kings assistant coach Dave Tippet in Dallas , When Marc Crawford was hired to take over for former Kings assistant coach Dave Tippet in Dallas , A View From My Seats had this to say Most Kings fans will tell you exactly how they feel about Marc Crawford .
Under his guidance , very few of the Kings prized prospects developed as hoped .
While they were strong offensively , there was nothing resembling a defensive system for the entire tenure in L.A .
The fact is he was using the same coaching strategy that helped him win a Cup in Colorado and multiple 40 + win seasons ( 4 ) in Vancouver .
But the stay in Los Angeles proved that his past success probably had more to do with the incredible talent on those Avs / Canuck teams and a little less to do with his Crawford ’s expertise .

5. CLIFF RONNING , ANSON CARTER AND MARK PARRISH
All 3 of these forwards were Trading Deadline Acquisitions by the Los Angeles Kings in an effort to make the playoffs .
And to say they failed … would be putting it lightly .
There is NO coincidence that the only 3 photos I could find of these 3 players in their Kings uniforms involved them falling down .
Cliff Ronning
2002
14 regular season games , 1 goal , 4 assists , 5 points
4 playoff games , 0 goals , 1 assists , 1 point
Cliff Ronning was a consistent 20 goal scoring journey - man that stood a mighty 5 ’ 8 ″ on skates .
The Kings finished 2nd in the Pacific at the end of the 01 - 02 regular season , just a mere 4 points behind the San Jose Sharks and faced with a first round playoff matchup against the Colorado Avalanche .
And Cliff Ronning promptly got a concussion and only played 4 games of the 7 game playoff series that the Kings lost .
KINGS ’ BLOG THOUGHTS THEN : Blogs were n’t invented in 2002 , so something called the Los Angeles Times had Blogs were n’t invented in 2002 , so something called the Los Angeles Times had this to say :
On Sunday , Coach Andy Murray had Ronning ’s playoff statistics posted on a bulletin board : 76 points in 101 games .
Ronning , though , has n’t participated in the playoffs since 1998 .
He ’s looking forward to making his return next month .
“ There ’s still , obviously , some work to be done , ” said the veteran forward , who will make his King debut tonight against the San Jose Sharks .
“ But this team ’s played great and if I can help out in any way , I ’m looking forward to the challenge . ”
WHERE IS HE NOW ? : According to According to Wikipedia , Ronning “ has participated in the research and development of a better hockey stick ”
Well , good for him .
Anson Carter
2004
15 games , 0 goals , 1 assist , 1 point
Anson Carter was the kind of Trading Deadline pickup where a team was kinda close to making the playoffs and felt like they had to do something … anything … to make it seem like they wanted to make the playoff to their fans .
On March 8th , 2004 when Carter was traded to the Kings from the Washington Capitals , the Kings were 26 - 19 - 16 and fighting for a playoff spot .
Once Carter joined the team , the Kings won 3 and lost 12 … including an astonishing 11 straight to finish the season … and any hope of making the playoffs .
Carter had 1 assist during those 15 games .
And then next season Carter went on to score 33 goals playing with the Sedin twins in Vancouver .
KINGS ’ BLOG THOUGHTS THEN : From the HFBoards , user
As far as Carter , he is a 5 - time 20 goal scorer .
He has struggled some in the East , but playing for the Rangers and the Caps can do that for a lot of players .
With his skating ability , Carter will fit in well in Andy ’s system , since he can get in quick on the forecheck , and while Carter does not lay out big hits or take a lot of abuse in front of the net , he is pretty good in the corners and drives well to the net .
Most of all , the Kings are hoping that bringing Carter to LA will give him a sense of comfort , so that he can be productive again .
Anson has been very streaky in the past , hopefully he can get into a hot streak and give the Kings the push they need as they head into the playoffs .

From the HFBoards , user “ skolgoar ” had this to say in regards to Carter coming to LA : ( You should really read this forum , some fans were thinking Mike Cammalleri or Alexander Frolov should have been traded for Carter instead of Jared Aulin !! )

Mark Parrish
2006
19 games , 5 goals , 3 assists , 8 points
By now , it ’s a classic Hollywood tale .
Talented potential 30 goal scoring forward is acquired at the trade deadline for some young talent in an effort for that team to make the playoffs .
And that goal scoring forward does nothing … the team falls flat … and fails to make the playoffs … yet again .
When Parrish was traded to the Kings , they were 35 - 24 - 5 and in solid competition for a 7th or 8th seed in the playoffs .
The record with Parrish ?
7 -12 .
Andy Murray was fired , John Torchetti was hired … and once again the Kings did n’t make the playoffs .
KINGS ’ BLOG THOUGHTS THEN : From HockeyFights.com … oh just read the stupid line where everyone is SO happy Parrish has been traded to the Kings : :
“ We feel the addition of Mark and Brent will strengthen our team down the stretch as we battle for a playoff spot , ” said [ GM Dave ] Taylor .
“ Mark is a proven NHL scorer and will be a boost to our power play . ”
WHERE IS HE NOW ? : Living it up in Norfolk , playing for the AHL Admirals .
4. VALERI BURE – RW
2005 -2006
0 games , 0 goals , 0 assists , 0 points
1 marriage to Candace Cameron
One of former GM Dave Taylor ’s last signings before he was fired , Valeri Bure was inked to a 1 year , 1.5 - million dollar contract and then never skated 1 game with the Kings due to a back and hip injury .
The picture you see above is the only proof he ever wore a Kings jersey .

Of course he is .
3. ROMAN CECHMANEK – G
Let ’s say you are an NHL GM .
And your franchise has a horrible time finding an elite goaltender to take it to the playoffs .
A rival GM offers you a goaltender with a career record of 92 wins , 43 loses and 22 ties with 20 (! ) shutouts and a 1.96 goals against average over his 3 years in the NHL .
( Oh and that 1.96 GAA is the lowest among goaltenders with at least 150 regular - season games since 1943 - 44 . )
And let ’s say that rival GM says “ you know what … all I want is a 2nd round pick in the 2004 draft for this goalie . ”
Well , if you are that GM being offered that deal … do you make that trade ?
Well , do ya ?
2003-2004
18 wins , 21 loses , 6 ties , 2.51 gaa , .906 save %
I forgot to mention … the reason why that rival GM was willing to give up that goalie for so cheap ?
It ’s because that goalie was run out of town for being incredibly inconsistent during the prior season , especially during the 2nd round of the playoffs .
As we all know , the mind of a goalie is an incredibly fragile one and Cechmanek was no exception .
He had dominated at every level of hockey he played … but he was no match for the boo’s from those tough Philly fans .
I once saw Roman Cechmanek bend over at his waist to cover a puck with his glove .
That was all I needed to see .

1. DAN CLOUTIER – G
2006 -2008
33 games , 8 wins , 18 losses , 3 ot losses , 3.71 gaa , .873 save %
So many bizarre moves .
Forget the fact that Cloutier was traded to Los Angeles for a 2nd round draft pick in 2006 .
For new GM Dean Lombardi why would n’t you trade for the goalie that had so much success under new Kings coach Marc Crawford in Vancouver .
But then there was the 2 year , $ 6.2 million contract extension for Cloutier before the season even started … with Cloutier still having 1 year left on his Canucks contract at $ 2.55 million .
Then there was the switch from his old - school birdcage helmet to a modern goalie helmet .
Then there was the hip injury .
And then next season being outplayed by Erik Ersberg .
And then there was the contract buyout .
And then the accusations of being mistreated by the Kings .
But most of all … there were the goals .
Man , were there a lot of goals .

Dan Cloutier was not good last year .
In fact , some of the more hot - headed among us might describe him as a “ miserable sac that deserves to die . ” ( Easy … )
He had terrible positioning , he could n’t get down into a butterfly in less than 3 seconds ( he looked like a 70 year - old trying to do pilates ) , and he basically ruined my life because he sucks and is probably a pedophile .
( Count to ten … 1 , 2 , 3 … )

Dawn Before Nova
Illustration Credit & Copyright : Mark A. Garlick ( Space-art.co.uk )
Explanation :
Will this dawn bring another nova ?
Such dilemmas might be pondered one day by future humans living on a planet orbiting a cataclysmic variable binary star system .
Cataclysmic variables involve gas falling from a large star onto an accretion disk surrounding a massive but compact white dwarf star .
Explosive cataclysmic events such as a dwarf nova can occur when a clump of gas in the interior of the accretion disk heats up past a certain temperature .
At that point , the clump will fall more quickly onto the white dwarf and land with a bright flash .
Such dwarf novas will not destroy either star , and may occur irregularly on time scales from a few days to tens of years .
Although a nova is much less energetic than a supernova , if recurrent novas are not violent enough to expel more gas than is falling in , mass will accumulate onto the white dwarf star until it passes its Chandrasekhar limit .
At that point , a foreground cave may provide little protection , as the entire white dwarf star will explode in a tremendous supernova .
Magpie , as an imperative language , has the usual flow control structures you expect to see : while , if , and for ( although they ’re a little different from their C counterparts ) .
However , Magpie has one other flow control construct you probably have n’t seen before : let then , the conditional binder .
A Motivating Example or Two
Before I explain it , let ’s go over a couple of examples in other languages where it would be useful .
First up : converting strings to other types .
In C# , you ’d do something like :
int value = Int32 .
Parse ( " 1234 " ) ; // do something with value
That ’s fine and dandy except that the parse can fail and throw an exception .
If you do n’t want to deal with the exception , the easier solution is to use the conveniently provided TryParse function :
int value ; if ( Int32 .
Try Parse ( " 1234 " , out value ) ) { // do something with value }
That ’s the idiomatic way to convert strings to ints in C# .
Aside from the cumbersome out parameter , what ’s lame about it is that value is scoped outside of the if block where we actually want to use it .
If the conversion fails , we have this weird unassigned value variable floating around .
Here ’s another example : downcasting .
Let ’s say we have a variable of type Base and we want to downcast it to a Derived subclass .
The normal way to do this is :
Derived derived = someBase as Derived ; if ( derived != null ) { // do something with derived }
A third and final example : looking up a value in a dictionary .
If you are n’t sure the key exists , the typical solution is :
Dictionary < string , int > dict = // get dictionary ... int value ; if ( dict .
TryGetValue ( " key " , out value ) ) { // do something with value }
You ’re seeing the pattern by now .
All of these have the exact same structure .
We have some operation that may return a value or may fail for some reason .
If it succeeds , we want to do something with the returned value .
Let
The let keyword in Magpie lets you implement that pattern directly , without the gross scoping issues or output parameters .
The above examples in Magpie would look like :
// parse let value <- " 1234 " .
AsInt then // do something with value end // downcast let derived <- someBase .
As ' Derived then // do something with derived end // look up in dictionary let value <- Find ( dict , " key " ) then // do something with value end
The way this works is pretty simple .
Magpie has an Option type , which is the same as F# ‘s option or Haskell ’s Maybe .
A let expression looks like :
let < variable > <- < expression > then < body >
The < expression > is expected to return an Option value .
If it evaluates to Some , then the value is extracted and assigned to < variable > and the < body > is evaluated .
If None is returned instead , the variable is n’t bound and the body is skipped .
Pretty straightforward .
What ’s nice about it is that the bound variable is scoped to the body of the let expression and disappears afterwards .
This means that if the expression fails and returns None , the variable disappears entirely .
It ’s syntactically impossible to access that variable incorrectly when the expression fails .
What Else ?
Because let is essentially another kind of if , it also supports an else clause :
// parse let value <- " 1234 " .
AsInt then // do something with value else Print " Could n't parse string . "
end
A Bit on Naming
I probably spend more time than I should thinking about the minutia of language syntax .
I chose let because to me that implies permission : it may “ let ” you do something or it may not , which lines up with the conditional nature of the construct .
Using then to separate the expression from the body both reinforces that this is an “ if - like ” conditional block and lets me reuse an existing keyword .
NANTES ( Reuters Life ! ) -
It ’s a unique concept according to its creators , a hotel in the French town of Nantes is offering the chance for people to become a hamster .
For 99 euros ( $ 148.10 ) a night , you can eat hamster grain , run in a giant wheel and sleep in hay stacks in what is called the “ Hamster Villa . ”
Maud and Sebastien are the first ones to experience how hamsters live , not afraid at the thought of sleeping in hay or feeding on a hamster fountain and special grain .
It ’s a unique experience and , the guests say , just something different .
“ To become a hamster , eat seeds , change our way of life ... come out of our daily routine ” Maud and Sebastien told Reuters TV ..
The owners , Frederic Tabary and Yann Falquerho , run a company which rents out unusual and bizarre places .
“ The Hamster in the world of children is that little cuddly animal .
Often , the adults who come here have wanted or did have hamsters when they were small , ” Falquerho said , dressed as a hamster .
However , the price is soon to go up as today ’s hamsters need , according to the owners , Wifi and a giant TV screen .
Facebook gives users more control of privacy
Facebook is one of the world 's most popular social networking sites Facebook is launching new privacy settings , designed to simplify the process for its 350 million users .
It is the latest in a string of changes that have been made to its privacy policy this year .
The site claims that only 15 - 20 % of users have ever adjusted their settings .
One new feature - the ability to control who sees every post made - was made following a stream of requests from users .
Facebook will make recommendations about how widely available different postings should be .
It suggests that status updates should be visible to everybody .
" We believe users will feel comfortable sharing more , " said a spokesperson .
It will mean information can be shared with a wider internet audience as search engines increasingly integrate content from social media sites into search results .
Google announced plans to integrate certain Facebook data into its real - time search although the data will be limited to public profile Facebook pages created by celebrities and companies .
Rival social media site Twitter makes all information viewable to the public .
Facebook will require users to update their general privacy settings , in a first for an internet firm .
It acknowledged that the process had become " complicated " as new features have been added to the site .
The new publisher privacy control means users can select a privacy setting for each piece of content , from updates to photos , meaning they can tailor their posts for specific audiences .
Privacy choice Users will be asked to choose one of three categories ; friends , friends of friends , or everyone .
From 9 December , Facebook will offer all its users a so - called transition tool , explaining the changes and asking users if they want to update their settings .
" We 've always designed Facebook to enable people to control what information they share with whom ... we will continue to innovate to serve users ' changing needs , " said Elliot Schrage , vice president of communication .
Earlier in the summer , the social network was forced to make worldwide changes to its privacy policy when it was found to be in breach of Canadian law by holding on to users ' personal data indefinitely .
It agreed to make changes to the way it handles this information and be more transparent about what data it collects and why .
It also agreed to make it clear that users can deactivate or delete their account .
In February Facebook responded to criticism over the way it handled users ' data by opening up the site 's policies to users .

A common objection given by capitalists to Anarchist theories is that Anarchism is utopian because people will always form hierarchies , as much as we ’d like them not to do so .
In short , hierarchies are part of human nature .
There are two major problems with this assumption .
First , if hierarchies were natural , then they would have been adopted by all societies .
And yet we know this is not true , as there have been many societies which actively eschewed hierarchical decision - making ( see for instance examples in People without Government : An Anthology of Anarchy , by Harold Barclay ) .
Second , if hierarchies were part of human nature , then everyone should desire them .
And yet few people desire to obey others ( who likes to have to work , pay taxes , and so on ? ) .
We obey for many reasons , but not out of a desire for the hierarchy itself .
No other human instinct works in this way .
We seek to have sex because we want to have sex , not because we ’re forced to .
We eat because we ’re hungry .
People follow some religion or spirituality , and do n’t wish ardently that they were skeptics .
In short , if hierarchies are natural , then why do n’t we actually like them ?
I said that we obey others for many reasons .
This obviously needs to be explained before the argument takes its full force .
There are three main reasons why we obey :
1 . Because we have no other viable options ( this is not true in some cases , but certainly true in others ) .
2 . Because we ca n’t imagine things being any other way .
This is especially true of hierarchies which have existed for more than a generation .
This would apply to people who did n’t have access to education , despite the fact that we are now more educated , we are not taught about the different kinds of societies that existed before ours ( as in the book I already referenced ) , or the alternatives which exist today ( see for instance the examples from Anarchy in Action , by Colin Ward ) .
Our education system is geared towards turning children into good citizens and good workers , not into informed decision - makers or people with any knowledge of society beyond the tyrannical concepts of our capital - democracies .
Decision - making is , of course , to be left to the “ experts ” and “ authorities , ” leaving the people as a whole with token choices between pre-approved options .
And because we are taught that “ it ’s always been that way , ” we ca n’t imagine it being any other way .
3 . We hope to , one day , be the ones who give the orders , either as an individual or as part of a faction .
This is the goal of most hierarchical games conditions , including those of capitalism and democracy , and those that do n’t have that goal still give an inbuilt sense of superiority ( in Christianity , for instance , one cannot become God , but one can feel superior to others by worshipping God the right way and having the correct beliefs ) .
In fact , it ’s interesting to note how little even true believers in this or that faction support the hierarchy that makes their factions possible , in democracy for example .
The staunch Democrat or Republican does not believe in democracy , at least most of the time ; he or she praises the democratic process only when their chosen faction wins .
They want to impose their values on everyone else , not obey the results of the process as such .
The best argument against the “ hierarchies are natural ” position is the massive amount of indoctrination , threats and cajoling necessary to make people obey , starting from a young age all through one ’s life .
And yet , the moment their control weakens , widespread public resistance springs up almost by magic .
In his famous work The True Believer , Eric Hoffer pointed out that dictatorships need not fear opposition as long as they maintain their iron grip , but that any relaxing of that grip is inevitably followed by public rebellion .
If hierarchies were natural , this is the exact opposite of what we would expect .
To recapitulate , the proposition that hierarchies are part of human nature should entail the following :
* All societies in history should have hierarchies .
( they do n’t )
* We should all desire to obey .
( we do n’t )
* It should not be necessary to indoctrinate people to obey .
( it is )
* People left to their own devices should naturally form hierarchies .
( they do n’t : see examples from Anarchy in Action chapter 2 , notably the Peckham Experiment )
If hierarchies are not natural , then what is natural ?
As Kropotkin famously argued , mutual aid permeates the animal kingdom , including humans , and is probably a more important evolutionary factor than warfare between species or competition within a species .
The faculties which led the human species to unlock the secrets of nature were social adaptations , not tools of war .
This is , of course , not a total vindication of the mutualist stance , but it ’s something to consider .
Tennyson ’s conception of nature as being “ red in tooth and claw ” has been dominant in our psyches , Kropotkin notwithstanding , and the delusional Hobbesian conception of primitive anarchies as “ nasty , brutish and short ” has dominated theoretical politics .
The position that mutual aid is the most important factor in nature and natural societies provides a strong counter - point to these assumptions .
‘ No God ? No problem ! ”
That ’s one sign of the season .
The American Humanist Assn. is pasting it all over Southern California buses to make the point that you do n’t have to be godly to be good .
Atheists United , headed by Bobbie Kirkhart , had a different holiday sign for last Christmas .
It read , “ Reason ’s Greetings , ” and it was accompanied by one of those stylized Darwin fish , this one wearing a jaunty Santa Claus cap .
It went on display , legally , in a Westside park , outnumbered by creches -- and someone stole it .
Kirkhart ’s not surprised .
She remembers that when a sign went up on the Glendale Freeway , maybe 10 years ago , announcing that the atheist organization was cleaning up roadside trash , it got defaced all the time .
Not so much now .
And she thinks that ’s a good sign , too , that atheism is n’t getting quite the bad rap it used to .
This year , the Atheists United holiday display destined for that same Westside park is a gnome with Charles Darwin ’s face on it .
Kirkhart is an optimist but not a fool .
How long it ’ll stay there , she ca n’t hazard a guess .
As for me , I think I ’ll look in vain for a long time yet to find a “ Happy Solstice ” card in the Hallmark store .
Is this a great time of year or a terrible time of year to be an atheist ?
It ’s always a great time of year to be an atheist .
The traditions of Christmas are almost entirely pre-Christian , so that ’s not really a problem for us that some people are celebrating the birth of their god .
We are doing what people have always done when the days are cold and dark -- we look to each other for light and warmth .
The downside is this so - called war on Christmas .
This year , the Gap had an ad that celebrated Christmas , Hanukkah , Kwanzaa and the solstice .
Some Christians are saying it puts the solstice on the same level as Christmas .
Then it arguably does the same for Kwanzaa and Hanukkah too .
They would n’t dare boycott based on Kwanzaa and Hanukkah , but they can boycott based on [ the solstice ] .
It ’s kind of amazing , such latent bigotry .
People who are very insecure in their own beliefs are frightened by other beliefs and want to stifle them .
I think their own insecurity makes them afraid to have us in the same society and have any access to the same media .
Where in American history do you find the same protection for non-religion that believers claim for religion ?
The 1st Amendment says “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . ”
Certainly most of our Founding Fathers who wrote our Constitution and declared independence were very much concerned about protection of freedom of thought .
Yet many people say this nation was founded as a Judeo - Christian nation .
They get that from the Pilgrims -- and of course today ’s most conservative fundamentalists would be quite liberal compared to the Pilgrims .
So when people [ say they ] want the government the Pilgrims established and envisioned , I do n’t think they know what they ’re asking for .
A 1999 Gallup Poll found that 38 % of Americans would n’t vote for a Muslim presidential candidate and 48 % would n’t vote for an atheist .
Federal courts have said religious tests for public office are illegal , but North Carolina ’s constitution says that atheists cannot hold elected office .
That law is being used to challenge the November election of an atheist to the Asheville City Council .
So has the public standing of atheists evolved ?
I think it ’s improved somewhat because of the people we call the Four Horsemen : [ authors ] Richard Dawkins , Daniel Dennett , Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens .
It ’s been exciting to see atheists ’ books in airport bookstores , [ like ]
“ God is Not Great , ” Hitchens ’ book .
And you did n’t say “ Thank God ” when you saw it ?
My son - in - law is training us all to say “ Thank Godzilla . ”
So if atheism is indeed beginning to register , why is that ?
There ’s much more access to information .
Even in Los Angeles , we ’ve had people come to Atheists United and say , “ I thought I was the only atheist in the world . ”
Being able to Google the word “ atheist ” to access information has helped .
I think the biggest single factor is eight years of something pretty close to an open theocracy .
People got frightened when George Bush talked about crusades .
There are certainly atheists who agreed with that war , but they did n’t think it was a crusade .
That woke people up .
And I think that many of [ them ] decided to stand up and be heard -- probably mostly just told their friends and family .
You mean they came out ?
They came out .
Richard Dawkins has an “ out ” campaign , and you can get a scarlet A from the Richard Dawkins website to show that you are an “ out ” atheist .
How big is your membership ?
Membership is still low compared to the number of atheists .
We are by definition people who go our own way .
On any fourth Sunday , when we have our meetings , you ’ll find more atheists sitting in the pews of churches and synagogues than in our meetings .
Society has sold the idea that religion is by definition good , that religion ’s doing good things , and so people go for the socialization and the charitable events .
People believe the church is doing good , and some are , of course .
Are these atheists using churchgoing for protective cover ?
I have a nephew in Little Rock , Ark. , who , if he lived in Los Angeles , would be a serious atheist .
But in Little Rock , with exactly the same beliefs , he ’s a serious Methodist .
Are atheists persecuted ?
Oh , sure .
Persecuted is a very strong word for what happens in this country , but I lost a job once .
I had been teaching in a private school , but not a religious one .
We had a new director , a really vocal Christian .
He started prayer meetings , voluntary , before work on Wednesday mornings .
The school was failing and it was time for layoffs , and I was among the first .
I learned from my Christian friend that [ the director ] asked why I was n’t going to prayer meetings .
They told him I was an atheist , and he said , “ Oh , we ’ll take care of that . ”
How did you become an atheist ?
I grew up in a very religious home .
My mother was a Salvation Army officer before she married .
That was in Enid , Okla .
I call it the whipping strop of the Bible Belt .
I loved the church ; I taught a Sunday school class .
My first job out of college was as a social worker in South - Central L.A. I met people of other religions .
I had always been told that those people were just superstitious .
[ I found ] they were as smart as I was -- and they believed [ in ] Hinduism or Islam .
That was a little disconcerting .
I had always had what Christians call the problem of evil .
I had never doubted the existence of a god , but I thought God was terribly cruel , and then I felt very guilty because I was judging God .
My clients were black and Latino women who were God ’s most fervent servants , and my God was at best leaving them to very cruel elements .
And I realized that the God that I had grown up believing [ in ] could not exist .
I looked at other [ religious ] concepts , and most of them did n’t hold water .
[ When ] my father was very ill , I found myself wanting to pray for his health .
And I did n’t believe there was a god up there who was going to hear my prayers .
On vacation , I went to a lonely beach in Mazatlan , and I said , “ I ’m not going to leave this beach until I know what I think . ”
And I spent about six hours there and came off the beach an atheist .
I have to use the metaphor -- was it a Saul - on - the - road - to - Damascus moment for you ?
“ Pascal ’s wager ” [ is ] the idea that if you believe and there is no God , you ’ve lost nothing .
And if you do n’t believe and there is a God , you ’ve lost eternal life .
What I came to was more practical :
If that ’s the case , how would I know I ’ve chosen the right god ?
And what would make me think that a god who was that cruel , and would punish me eternally for my honest beliefs , would reward me for trying to make myself believe ?
And that was the final moment .
What do n’t people know about atheists ?
Most atheists have happy , full lives ; have great families .
I found my late husband at Atheists United , and my daughter met her husband at Atheists United .
We care about the larger community .
We are a free - thought community .
I do n’t think there ’s any higher moral force than the thoughtful , informed , individual human conscience .
Why do n’t you just hedge your bets and be an agnostic ?
I am an agnostic .
People do n’t understand what an agnostic is .
There ’s about a 95 % overlap between atheists and agnostic .
I do n’t know with absolute certainty that there is nothing that could be considered a god .
But I know with functional certainty that there ’s no god I have to be concerned about in my life or my observable world .
An agnostic says “ I do n’t know . ”
Theism is about belief , and an atheist says I do n’t believe .
So I do n’t know , and I do n’t believe .
How do atheists celebrate the solstice ?
We do most of the holiday observances that other people do .
You will find [ Christians ] who do n’t do any of the traditional holiday observances because they believe the real meaning of Christmas is worship ; you ’ll find atheists who do n’t like solstice parties .
But most of us will get together and there ’ll be evergreen decorations and maybe candles and we ’ll sing and have a party .
What do you sing ?
We ’ll probably sing “ Imagine . ”
It ’s a great song .

In my childhood , Poland was a part of the " Eastern Bloc , " roped into the Soviet Union 's repressive orbit .
For decades , Soviet troops were stationed in Poland , and the Kremlin directed important political decisions over and above the Polish domestic leadership .
The official Polish ideology and governing philosophy was communism .
Today Poland , like the rest of Europe and the West , has a mixed economy .
The government plays a very big role in economic life .
Most Poles , I was told during a recent visit to the country , are in fact socialists .
The communist past is largely looked down upon , but the goal of most Poles is not a laissez - faire society , but a society modeled after the mixed economies of Western Europe — that is , social democracies .
However , there were a few encouraging signs for supporters of laissez - faire and limited government more generally .
Most importantly , Poland is home to some very committed and energetic free - market organizations and individuals .
My recent trip to Warsaw , for example , was hosted and sponsored by the Polish Ludwig von Mises Institute .
The Polish LvMI , which is based in Warsaw , conducted an excellent four - day seminar on the current financial crisis .
Many young Polish scholars presented erudite papers analyzing the recent financial meltdown .
More than 60 people attended the seminar , mostly college students or graduate students but some business people as well .
While I was at the Mises conference I also met the director of the Polish - American Foundation for Economic Research and Education .
The Foundation would be hosting a visit later the same month by Sheldon Richman , editor of the Freeman .
Clearly , there remain pockets of support for economic liberty in Poland , despite many decades of collectivist oppression .
Shortly after my arrival in Warsaw , I asked my Polish host , the president of the Polish Mises Institute , what life was like in the country prior to the end of communism .
" It was exactly like George Orwell 's book , 1984 , " he answered .
" Freedom was called slavery and slavery was called freedom . "
Life was very depressing every single day , he said .
At another time , I asked a younger Polish woman if she had any recollections of the communist times .
She said she remembered how quickly her family would rush to the grocery store if word got out that the store had a new shipment of bread .
Another young Pole I met during the conference volunteers to teach Polish high school students some very basic economics .
His commitment to freedom was perhaps the most impressive I saw .
" I am the first person in my family for generations not to be repressed by the communists , " he told me .
His grandfather had fought against the Nazis in Poland during World War II , but under Russian rule he was imprisoned on the charge of conspiring with the Germans .
Fighting for individual liberty and economic freedom was clearly a deeply personal matter to this young man .
At another point during the conference , a " New Left " economist debated a free - market economist .
At the end of this spirited and enlightening debate , the leftist professor stated quite clearly that " free market prices are indeed necessary for a rational economy . "
My jaw literally dropped .
How many American university professors understand that and would be willing to say it today ?
In the heart of Warsaw is a very tall building .
The eye immediately finds it when scanning the disjointed skyline .
This towering hulk was a " gift " from Joseph Stalin to the Polish people at the end of World War II .
Every Pole
I spoke with described it as " the gift we could not refuse . "
It is massive , dirty and surrounded by statues .
One statue is of a person holding a book with the name of Marx clearly visible on the cover .
The trend in politics in America and Western Europe is presently toward greater government control over healthcare , education , banking , finance , industry , housing , agriculture , energy , and transportation .
In short , the trend is toward more coercion and less freedom .
Respect for economic freedom , free trade , and private property all seem to be in rapid retreat .
A young Polish lady asked me , " Where are the Americans I 've always heard of ?
Where are the Americans that believe in individualism and economic freedom ? "
" I think they are still there , " I answered .
" Some may now just be waking up . "
The human desire for freedom has always run up against those who believe " too much " freedom is a bad thing and that the " common good " — as defined by some elite — outweighs the rights of the individual .
This was Hitler 's mantra .
It was the mantra of the communists .
It is the underlying belief of those working to expand government control in America today .
At a time like this , it is good to know that in a far away place , a place with a still - recent history of collectivist oppression , the human desire for liberty still burns bright .
NASA News : Keck Telescopes Gaze into Young Star ’s “ Life Zone ”
December 26 , 2009
The inner regions of young planet - forming disks offer information about how worlds like Earth form , but not a single telescope in the world can see them .
Yet , for the first time , astronomers using the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii have measured the properties of a young solar system at distances closer to the star than Venus is from our sun .
“ When it comes to building rocky planets like our own , the innermost part of the disk is where the action is , ” said team member William Danchi at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. Planets forming in a star ’s inner disk may orbit within its “ habitable zone , ” where conditions could potentially support the development of life .
To achieve the feat , the team used the Keck Interferometer to combine infrared light gathered by both of the observatory ’s twin 10 - meter telescopes , which are separated by 85 meters .
The double - barreled approach gives astronomers the effective resolution of a single 85 - meter telescope — several times larger than any now planned .
“ Nothing else in the world provides us with the types of measurements the Keck Interferometer does , ” said Wesley Traub at Caltech ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
“ In effect , it ’s a zoom lens for the Keck telescopes . ”
In August 2008 , the team — led by Sam Ragland of Keck Observatory and including astronomers from the California Institute of Technology and the National Optical Astronomical Observatory — observed a Young Stellar Object ( YSO ) known as MWC 419 .
The blue , B - type star has several times the sun ’s mass and lies about 2,100 light - years away in the constellation Cassiopeia .
With an age less than ten million years , MWC 419 ranks as a stellar kindergartener .
The team also employed a new near - infrared camera designed to image wavelengths in the so - called L band from 3.5 to 4.1 micrometers .
“ This unique infrared capability adds a new dimension to the Keck Interferometer in probing the density and temperature of planet - forming regions around YSO disks .
This wavelength region is relatively unexplored , ” Ragland explained .
“ Basically , anything we see through this camera is brand new information . ”
The increased ability to observe fine detail , coupled with the new camera , let the team measure temperatures in the planet - forming disk to within about 50 million miles of the star .
“ That ’s about half of Earth ’s distance from the sun , and well within the orbit of Venus , ” Danchi said .
For comparison , the planets directly detected around the stars HR 8799 , Fomalhaut and GJ 758 orbit between 40 and 100 times farther away .
The team reported temperature measurements of dust at various regions throughout MWC 419 ’s inner disk in the Sept. 20 issue of The Astrophysical Journal .
Temperature differences help shed light on the inner disk ’s detailed structure and may indicate that its dust has different chemical compositions and physical properties , factors that may play a role in the types of planets that form .
For example , conditions in our solar system favored the formation of rocky worlds from Mars sunward , whereas gas giants and icy moons assembled farther out .
In turn , the astronomers note , the size of the young star might affect the composition and physical characteristics of its dust disk .
The team is continuing to use the Keck Interferometer in a larger program to observe planet - forming disks around sun-like stars .

My friend and colleague David Bedein did some of the interviews of the Hamas convicts .
While it is a difficult decision to free these murders for our soldier Gilad Shalit there is a need to make this public .
I only hope that Gilad will be freed soon .
Last year , the Center for Near East Policy Research commissioned two reporters to interview Hamas members who are serving life sentences for multiple murders .
These interviews are now newsworthy , since these are the Hamas convicts who may be freed in the near future by the government of Israel .

We 've got Paul Hayward on Carlo Ancelotti's Italian job at Chelsea ; Richard Williams on today 's red and blue rivalry ; Tim Rich on why Darren Fletcher is the new Roy Keane ; and Daniel Taylor 's analysis of United 's diminished defence .
" The emphasis on Rio Ferdinand 's troubled form faded last Tuesday when United looked even more vulnerable without him during the 3 - 3 draw with CSKA Moscow .
It seems that he will be missing again with back trouble just when solidity at the heart of the defence will be critical .
" The visitors must find others to check Didier Drogba , who has verged on the uncontainable for Chelsea this season , scoring nine goals in his last nine appearances in all competitions . "

Match pointers
• Manchester United average 1.29 points per game in the Premier League against Chelsea , fewer than against any other side
• Chelsea have not been beaten at home by United in the Premier League since losing 3 - 0 in April 2002
• Five of Dimitar Berbatov 's last six league goals have come between the 51st and 62nd minute
• Chelsea are one defeat away from 150 in the Premier League era
• Sir Alex Ferguson has lost three of his four meetings with Carlo Ancelotti as a manager
The Department of Entertaining Irrelevance
OK , so almost two million people have seen this already , so I 'm not exactly shattering a world exclusive here , and it does n't have a whole lot to do with this afternoon 's Premier League six - pointer , but if we see any defending that holds a candle to this today we 'll be in for a tasty afternoon .
Incidentally , I interviewed " ESPN soccer analyst " Julie Foudy once .
She was very nice .
Less nice is Elizabeth Lambert , star of this here video , who since it took America by storm ( perhaps a better , and certainly better - quality , highlights package of her fouling rampage ) has been suspended indefinitely by her team .
" This is in no way indicative of my character or the soccer player that I am , " she said in a grovelling apology .
" There is no way to defend her actions , " says her university vice - president for athletics .

Here are today 's teams !
Chelsea : Cech , Ivanovic , Carvalho , Terry , Ashley Cole , Essien ,
Lampard , Ballack , Deco , Drogba , Anelka .
Subs : Hilario , Joe Cole , Mikel , Malouda , Paulo Ferreira , Kalou , Alex .

Fletcher , Carrick , Anderson , Valencia , Rooney , Giggs .
Subs : Kuszczak , Owen , Vidic , Scholes , Fabio Da Silva , Obertan , Gibson .
Referee : Martin Atkinson ( W Yorkshire )
3.40 pm update Somehow , one gets the impression that this has n't been a very good day for John Terry , whose father provided this morning 's News of the World with their front page scoop .
The England skipper and committed family man , in case you 've foolishly forgotten , was named Dad of the Year back in June by no less a body than some PR people representing " great value brown sauce " brand Daddies Sauce .
Presumably he picked up his responsible parenting skills from Frank Lampard .
3.50 pm update The Elizabeth Lambert horror - show ( see below ) has got the email inbox ticking over nicely .
" That youtube clip of the female Vinnie Jones has all the hallmarks of a set - up in the hope of getting Hollywood interested and building a second career .
Just like ... er ... Vinnie Jones , " writes Gary Naylor .
3.53 update Someone called Martin , who either has " a source " on the inside or an active imagination , writes : " One of my nephews who hopefully will start today 's game for Man U ( he shall remain nameless ) was asked by me a few weeks ago what was their secret to beating Chelski today ... to which he replied ' If Johnny gets a start and can remember to remind Didier again what he caught while celebrating during the African Nations cup in 2007 ... that always unsettles him ... then we have a chance ... lol .. true story ... needless to say I am a man U fan "
3.55 pm The United team are limbering up in the tunnel ... on their own .
No sign of the boys in blue .
3.59 pm Chelsea having turned up to the party , they 're on the pitch ( but going to form a guard of honour for various current and former members of Britain 's armed services , with it being Remembrance Sunday , before they do any ball - kicking ) .
1min : Peeeep !
A minute 's silence having been dutifully respected , they 're off .
2mins : Some smart - arse is refusing to return the ball so John O'Shea can take a throw - in .
4mins : Smart turn and run from midfield by Deco , but his through - ball to Anelka is cut out .
" Just read that News of the World article , " writes Brian Johnston .
" Solves the mystery about where Adrian Mutu was getting his goods from . "
5 mins : Ivanovic gets into the penalty area down the right and , after his low cross bounces back to him , he shoots low and hard from an acute angle , and Van der Sar saves easily .
Some kind of pull - back might have been a better option .
8 mins : Wayne Rooney is played in and the flag goes up , with the striker entirely on his own and clean through , 30 yards from the nearest outfield player and 20 yards from goal .
But Ashley Cole , on the near side , is clearly playing him onside .
Bad – and crucial – decision .
11mins : Rooney - related refereeing error latest : Rooney turns sharply and shoots wide , but the referee unaccountably gives a corner , seeing a deflection off Carvelho that no number of slow - mo replays can convince me of .
14mins : Valencia seems to be going past
Terry when both go down , in United 's penalty area .
Nothing 's given .
" At best it 's clumsy , " says Andy Gray ( though I think I 'm with the referee on this one )
16 mins : United have definitely had the better of the first quarter - hour .
Valencia v
Cole on the right flank seems the key battle .
At the moment it 's looking easier for Valencia to escape from Cole than the other way round ( the Ecuadorian is doing a pretty good marking job when Chelsea attack ) .
18 mins : Ballack sends in a cross and Drogba heads it back across goal , but wide .
Decent chance , Should Have Done Better ( SHDB , for short ) .
20 mins : Valencia could have played O'Shea clean though on goal , but instead he bashes a 30 - yarder over the bar .
22mins : " Are Man U the new Chelsea , " asks Bill Chilton .
" Keeping it tight , dull functional football , probably going to win 1 - 0 ... "
( I take your point , but Chelsea 's last Premier League 1 - 0 : April )
26 mins : Brown clears into touch as he heads back towards goal and Droba breathes down his neck .
It 's a corner ... but the referee gives United a free - kick instead .
To this moment , I have no idea why .
27 mins : Brown challenges Drogba for the ball 27 yards out ( roughly ) .
Nothing in it , but Drogba goes down and wins the free - kick .
It appears I 'm destined to disagree with every single refereeing decision today .
29 mins : So I guess this is the first proper , clear chance .
Fletcher loops a long ball towards the edge of Chelsea 's penalty area , Cech half - comes , Giggs gets there first and tries to volley it over the keeper .
Tough , with the ball really travelling , but on target and it's in .
It goes over .
32mins : Anelka cross -shot from the corner of the penalty area pushed away by Van der Sar.
Drogba , running to the near post , was n't far away from a killer touch .
Chelsea 's first decent attacking moment .
34mins : " You do n't seem very convinced by the ref 's decisions , " writes Robin Hazlehurst , " but maybe he knows he 'll be berated by Ferguson even if he is perfect , so in for a penny in for a pound he might as well have some fun along the way with some wacky whistle - blowing . "
If that 's what 's going through the referee 's mind he is a ) mad , and b ) my kinda guy .
35 mins : United were pretty great for half an hour but it's got a bit sloppy at both ends these last few minutes ... as I write that Rooney gives the ball to Giggs , who pass rolls out of play rather than into the path of the onrushing Anderson .
36mins : Poor Anderson .
Rooney gets the ball on the left , Anderson 's on his own in the middle .
Rooney does n't cross to him , or pass to Velencia , well placed 20 yards out , opting instead to burst into the penalty area and bosh the ball into John Terry 's legs .
39mins : Nicolas Anelka bursts from midfield into space , the ball 's slid through ... and Wayne Rooney 's the player who tracked the Frenchman 's run .
Sometimes the kid is just awesome .
Terry 's rolling around in pain at the moment , having jumped into Ashley Cole and hit his head on the pitch .
42mins : For the first time , Chelsea attack with genuine menace , getting five men forward in a speedy attack , but in the end the cross is n't very good for anyone , Ballack attempting some kind of backheel volley that does n't come off .
43 mins : " 0 - 0 all over it , " says Michael Hatcher .
" I turned over from The Wizard of Oz for this ?
Well yes , but also because you 've seen in 25 times and if you snub the potential magnificence of live top - level sport to see it again and miss anything good you 'd never forgive yourself ( and nor should you ) .
45 mins : Ludicrous what on earth are you thinking shot of the day : Drogba , on the right edge of the penalty area and with the angle against him but with a couple of team - mates in support , lashes a shot crazy wide and stupid high .
Half - time : The whistle goes .
United have had the best of it , but the last quarter - hour was anybody's .
Or nobody 's , to be more precise .
Post - slow - mo update :
That early ( 14mins )
United penalty shout which was the only major refereeing decision I agreed with : I was wrong ( and so was the ref ) .
Some serious shirt - tugging proved by the side - on camera angle .
46mins : Peeeeep !
They 're off !
Again !
47mins : " So is Wes Bron going to stand in for Rio in South Africa next summer too ? " writes Ian Fielding .
Well , Don Fabio's watching and there have been no major slip - ups yet .
Rooney tees up Fletcher , 20 - odd yards out , perfect pass , he does n't have to break stride , but the shot is ballooned over the bar .
48mins : Ryan Giggs gets the ball on the edge of the area , but he almost has too much time to decide what to do and he chips a hopeless cross - type thing into uselessness .
50 mins : " To Martin Atkinson 's credit we 've hardly mentioned his name , " says the commentator glowingly of the referee who , other than denying Manchester United two clear goalscoring opportunities and making countless other useless decisions , had a pretty good first half I reckon .
53 mins : Carrick and Fletcher are basically owning the midfield here .
Chelsea can attack down the flanks if they like , but they 're getting no change in the middle ( he writes , as Ivanovic cuts inside and wins a dangerous free - kick , though he was tackled by Ryan Giggs ) .
55 mins : Drogba thumps the free - kick into the wall and rolls the rebound out of play .
58 mins : The first booking , for Ivanovic ( who got the ball before he got Giggs , and did n't really get Giggs so badly – another one for the referee 's debit column ) .
59 mins : Good little move for United ends with Fletcher working a good shooting chance on the edge of the penalty area .
Carvalho brilliantly blocks the Scotsman 's shot before it can sail harmlessly over the bar .
60 mins : Joe Cole – it's his 28th birthday today , by the way – is about to come on .
63mins : ... no really , he really is ... ( Giggs just headed O'Shea 's cross over the bar from 15 yards ) .
63mins : ...
And now he has , for Deco .
Talking of whom : " In lieu of any magnificent top - level sport to report , " writes Michael Hatcher , " a question : when did Deco jump his shark ? "
Anyone got any idea a ) what the question means , or b ) what the answer is ?
66 mins :
There seems to be a bit of niggle working its way into this one .
They 're one tiny incident away from a full - on brawl ( he said , optimistically ) .
Rooney just pulled a shot just wide when well - placed , 18 yards out .
68mins : Ooooh !
Rooney tries a curler , 25 yards out , which Cech pushes theatrically round the post .
69 mins : Another great block from Carvalho , to stop Rooney 's shot at source .
United have been excellent today , they really have .
It would be ironic though if these two big clubs , having failed to keep clean sheets against all the rubbish little sides they so annoyingly still have to play every week , finally succeed against each other .
72mins : Drogba is writhing comically after Evans ( accidentally , while jumping ) kicked him in the chest really hard .
Now , jumping the shark .
" The reference is to the TV show Happy Days . " writes Matthew Carpenter - Arevalo .
" In one episode Fons jumps a shark on water skis , representing the fact that the television show had run out of ideas and was reaching new lows .
I 'd say that Deco jumped his shark some time before leaving Barcelona , which was why Pep Guardiola happily sent him off to Chelsea while trying to disguise his grin . "
74mins : Drogba has been booked .
Do n't ask me why .
Ray Wilkins currently having a go at the fourth official .
76mins : GOAL !
Chelsea 1 Man Utd 0 ( Terry ) Frank Lampard 's left - wing free - kick , Terry 's header ( maybe his shoulder ) , and Chelsea take the lead a ) against the run of play ; b ) from a free - kick given against Fletcher for winning the ball pretty cleanly .
Controversyometer shoots to 10 .
Rooney gets booked for protesting .
79mins : Seriously , punch - ups any minute now .
There are some very angry United players out there .
80 mins : The referee has totally jumped the shark today .
81mins : Here we go !
Well , no punching , just a bit of posturing .
Carvalho gave away a free - kick but just kept on running with the ball until Evans brought him down with a terrible tackle from behind .
Carvalho rolls around , everyone runs to the spot and when they get there they ... just stand around a bit ... and then go back to wherever they were .
Evans and Carvalho both booked .
83 mins : Kalou comes on for Drogba .
Sky reckon Drobga was offside and trying to influence play for the goal , and had possibly fouled his marker as well .
85 mins : Giggs and Anderson come off for Obertan and Owen as United chase a goal .
85 mins :
This referee , incidentally , is the one who gave United unlimited stoppage time in which to beat Manchester City earlier this season .
88mins : Apparently not only has someone jumped the shark , but someone else has brushed his teeth .
Jonny Mac writes : " Anyone else see the guy in the crowd cleaning his teeth ?
Who takes a tooth - brush to the ground ?
Could catch on . "
Anyone else spot this guy , apparently behind the Chelsea dug - out ?
89mins : Valencia , who 's been excellent as well , booked for a foul on Lampard .
90 mins : We 'll be having five minutes ' stoppage time !
90+1 mins : Someone else spotted the tooth - brusher – Nigel Mitchell !
So it 's official ( kind of ) !
90+2 mins : Kind of like the Chelsea goal , a set - piece ( Valencia 's corner ) , a centre - back 's header ( Evans ) – but it goes wide .
90+3 mins : O'Shea 's cross hits Lampard 's arm , exactly the same as Lescott yesterday , who gave away a penalty .
This time the ref waves play on ( it would only have been a free - kick though ) .
Alex comes on for Anelka .
90+5 mins : It 's all over !
Chelsea 1 Manchester United 0 !
Total injustice !
But Sir Alex has slagged referees off so often and so stupidly , no one will take it seriously if he does it again here .
He 's the boy who cried wolf .
Final thoughts :
Firstly , loads of people saw this toothbrushing bloke .
" The game was so dull , it made his mouth dirty , " was Tom Mitchell 's take .
" Five minutes ' stoppage time should be enough for him to shave as well , " adds Alan Sekers .
Secondly – and I should make it clear that I do n't support United , or any Premier League team for that matter – a truly unjust result .
Nothing much was made of the early offside decision that denied Rooney an easy chance , but that and the penalty were two game - changing decisions that the referee ( and his team ) got wrong .
He got most other decisions wrong too .
I 'm not sure about the free - kick that led to the goal – I was typing when it happened – but Fletcher did get the ball , and Martin Atkinson got everything else wrong , so I guess that 's the way I 'm leaning .
United played really well , did 70 % of the attacking , had the game 's outstanding players in Fletcher , Carrick and Valencia and simply should n't have been beaten .
( And Anelka won the man of the match award – another unjust decision ! )
( Incidentally , Drogba was n't offside for the goal , which Anelka reckons was actually his – one for the dubious goals committee , though Jamie Redknapp would give it to the Frenchman and so would I , if only for fantasy league reasons )
So there you go .
Bad luck United , but swings and roundabouts and all that , eh ?
Did he really say that department : " Manchester United will be delighted , " says Jamie Redknapp , " apart from losing the game . "
Wrong .
United will be absolutely incandescent .
Guess which manager this is department : " The referee ... totally ridiculous position ... he could n't see it ... you lose faith in referees sometimes ... you do need a break and we never got the break . "
Genuinely final thoughts :
Sorry for those who think I 'm making too much of the injustice here .
I just think that , once United are denied both a one - on - one featuring their best striker and a penalty within the first 15 minutes , any subsequent result but a United win must be tainted .
Other than those clear goalscoring opportunities , United did n't make any clear goalscoring opportunities .
But for those moments , this would have been a common - or - garden against - the - run - of - play 1 - 0 .
But as it was , it was n't .
Is that clear ?
In retrospect , it might be recognized as a troubling harbinger that , ten years ago , no consensus could be reached in this country on what to call the decade upon which we were about to embark .
The ohs ?
The double - ohs ?
The zeros ?
The zips ?
The nadas ?
The naughties ?
As the reassuringly comprehensible nineties were drawing to a close , all these were suggested as possible designations for the coming era .
When Madison Avenue and the collective editorial boards of the nation ’s newspapers failed to come up with a killer appellation in advance , there was at least confidence that , by decade ’s end , a majority - pleasing solution to the problem of decennial nomenclature would have presented itself .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
As we near the end , however , we still do n’t have a good collective name for the first decade of the twenty - first century — at least , not one beyond “ the first decade of the twenty - first century , ” which is gratifyingly lacking in cuteness but may be too wordy for practicality , particularly given contemporary constraints .
( Call it that on Twitter , and you ’ve used up a third of your character allotment . )
Arguably , a grudging agreement has been reached on calling the decade “ the aughts , ” but that unfortunate term is rooted in a linguistic error .
The use of “ aught ” to mean “ nothing , ” “ zero , ” or “ cipher ” is a nineteenth - century corruption of the word “ naught , ” which actually does mean nothing , and which , as in the phrase “ all for naught , ” is still in current usage .
Meanwhile , the adoption of “ the aughts ” as the decade ’s name only accelerates the almost complete obsolescence of the actual English word “ aught , ” a concise and poetic near - synonym for “ anything ” that has for centuries well served writers , including Shakespeare ( “ I never gave you aught , ” Hamlet says to Ophelia , in an especially ungenerous moment , before she goes off and drowns ) and Milton ( “ To do aught good never will be our task / But ever to do ill our sole delight , ” Satan declares near the beginning of “ Paradise Lost , ” before slinking up to tempt Eve ) .
To call the decade “ the aughts ” is a compromise that pleases no one , and that has more than a whiff of resigned settling about it .

But perhaps that ’s appropriate , since this turned out to be the decade in which there were no good answers .
It began in overwrought hysteria : recall that , this time ten years ago , the fear was abroad that civilization would come to a standstill , if not an end , when the world ’s computers failed to recognize a date that did n’t begin with the digits 1 and 9 .
Having readied ourselves for that disaster , the one that actually did materialize , a year and a half later — the terrorist attacks of September , 2001 — came as a surprise , even , apparently , to those who had been privy to intelligence memos warning of impending harm from militant - Islamist quarters .
It has been suggested that the appropriate designation for this decade might be “ the post - 9/11 era ” — an unswingy if otherwise apposite sobriquet .
Others argue that to name the decade thus would be letting the terrorists win— as if the cumulative casualties of war and the infringements of civil liberties that took place under President Bush were not already evidence of at least partial victory on that score .
The events of and reaction to September 11th seem to be the decade ’s defining catastrophe , although it could be argued that it was in the voting booths of Florida , with their flawed and faulty machines , that the crucial historical turn took place .
( In the alternate decade of fantasy , President Gore , forever slim and with hairline intact , not only reads those intelligence memos in the summer of 2001 but acts upon them ; he also ratifies the Kyoto Protocol and invents something even better than the Internet . )
And if September 11th marked the beginning of this unnameable decade , its end was signalled by President Obama ’s Nobel acceptance speech , in which he spoke of what he called the “ difficult questions about the relationship between war and peace , and our effort to replace one with the other , ” and painstakingly outlined the absence of any good answers to the questions in question .
In between those two poles , the decade saw the unimaginable unfolding : the depravities of Abu Ghraib , and , even more shocking , their apparent lack of impact on voters in the 2004 Presidential election ; the horrors of Hurricane Katrina and the flight of twenty - five thousand of the country ’s poorest people to the only slightly less hostile environs of the Superdome ; the grotesque inflation and catastrophic popping of a housing bubble , exposing an economy built not even on sand but on fairy dust ; the astonishing near - collapse of the world financial system , and the discovery that the assumed ironclad laws of the marketplace were only about as reliable as superstition .
And , after all this , the still more remarkable : the election of a certified intellectual as President , not to mention an African - American one .
There was the ascent of the digital realm — with the happy surrender , on the part of hundreds of millions , to the congenial omniscience and possibly less congenial omnipotence of Google , and the perplexingly popular appeal of making available online all manner of information of the sort formerly considered private .
Who would have dreamed , at the decade ’s outset , not only that something like Facebook would exist but that , thanks to it , anyone would be able to view photographs of the company ’s C.E.O. , Mark Zuckerberg , in pajama bottoms and with red - eye uncorrected , lounging in an armchair and clutching a Teddy bear to his chest ?
Or that anyone would want to ?
And what of those other unlikely innovations and unforeseen blights of the era— small plates , Bump for the iPhone , Sarah Palin , Chinese drywall , jeggings ?
Given all that has emerged in the past ten years , the failure to invent a satisfactory name for the period seems overdetermined — a reflection of our sense that the so - called aughts were not all they ought to have been , and were so much less than they promised to be .
With its intractable conflicts and its irresolvable crises , its astonishing accomplishments and its devastating failures , the decade just gone by remains unnamed and unclaimed , an orphaned era that no one quite wants to own , or own up to — or , truth be told , to have aught else to do with at all . ♦
Gordon Brown was accused yesterday of failing to protect the British national interest by handing the French a powerful European post which could allow them to shackle the City of London .
The Tories claimed the Prime Minister made a secret deal with Nicolas Sarkozy in which the French President backed the Labour peer Baroness ( Cathy ) Ashton as Europe 's " foreign minister " on Thursday , in return for being able to put his man in as the commissioner in charge of financial services and the internal market .
That important post is expected to go to Michel Barnier , a former French foreign minister , when the new Commission team is named in the next few weeks .
He would be the first Frenchman to take charge of the single market , and would also become a Commission vice - president , the same rank as Lady Ashton .

The Tories say the French government has the City in its sights and that Mr Barnier 's appointment would help Paris 's cause .
William Hague , the shadow Foreign Secretary , said : " If Gordon Brown has done a deal that would mean a French commissioner being in charge of the economic issues that affect Britain the most then that could be a serious concern .
Our French partners have a different view on market issues that touch on Britain 's vital economic interests .
I look forward to the Government taking this opportunity to be completely open about what has been agreed . "
In a letter to the Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , Mr Hague said : " The financial services sector is an area of extreme sensitivity for the British national interest .
It is of crucial importance to the future of a pro-growth EU that there is no retreat from the principle of a free market within the EU . "
Downing Street dismissed the Tory claim as " absurd " .
A spokesman for Mr Brown said : " Under the Tories , the UK would n't have had the High Representative [ foreign minister 's ] job .
We would be totally sidelined . "
Many in the City have long entertained the theory that the French government secretly covets London 's position as the world 's second - largest centre for hedge fund activity , after New York .
The proposed European directive on " alternative investment funds " already threatens closer oversight of the sector across Europe , and is thought by some to be an attempt to erode London 's competitive edge .
Many hedge funds are based in Mayfair , and some are already said to be considering moves abroad to escape higher taxation and tougher regulation .
Longer term , the new French Commissioner will also have a powerful influence on the choice of chief for the new European Systemic Risk Council , a body that will oversee financial stability across the Union , and who must be the head of a European central bank .
Given that the UK remains outside the eurozone and the mixed record of the British regulators in preventing the financial crisis , some believe that the chairmanship of that body will go to another Frenchman – Jean - Claude Trichet , currently head of the ECB .

The Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , would be a strong contender for the deputy role , given London 's existing pre-eminence in financial services .
But the preponderance of Frenchmen in key economic positions might tip the balance back in Mr King 's favour .
A number of other European financial regulatory bodies are also planned , roughly along the lines of the UK's Financial Services Authority .
How much power they will be given vis-a - vis national bodies is being hotly debated in Brussels , and again Mr Barnier will have powerful a say in that .
The Treasury has made no secret of its hostility to the European " supervisory authorities " being granted the authority to override national regulators .

This past year felt like a rebuilding year for Firefox add - ons , with two new frameworks implemented to help guide the future of extensions .
Personas gave Firefox on - the - fly theme - switching , and users can expect it to be part of the stable version of Firefox 3.6 when that gets released .
Jetpack takes a similarly - minded approach to feature add - ons , allowing programmers to create feature - rich add - ons from little more than HTML , CSS , and JavaScript .
Expect JetPack to eventually be part of Firefox by default .
In no particular order , here are eight other of our favorites :

Weave Sync is another project from Mozilla Labs , although it 's not as clear whether it will eventually end up in Firefox as a default feature .
This homegrown tool for synchronizing Firefox across computers and devices introduces incremental syncing and a more - streamlined , less - obtrusive experience , fitting in smoothly in your Options pane .
Although it still conflicts with some extensions , including the massively popular and arguably more essential AdBlock Plus , in general it works well and brings a long - missing feature to Firefox .
Multi Links is simple in purpose , but so effective that it's one of the best add - ons of the year .
Right - click in a browser tab and drag it , highlighting multiple links in the box .
By default , selected links open up in new browser tabs , although you can go into the options to choose whether you want them to open up in new windows , or be bookmarked instead .
You 're also able to change the color scheme of the box , and the outlines of the selected links , just in case you 're into that sort of thing .
Originally known as SmarterFox , FastestFox is a multitasking fiend that helps make searching , pasting , surfing , and downloading faster .
Highlight a word or phrase on the Web page and FastestFox will display a bubble filled with search engine icons .
After a few seconds of inactivity , the search bubble fades away .
The add - on automatically merges linked pages into one , which some users prefer for reading long articles , and it also allows you to check other search engines from any single engine 's results page .

Whether you 're looking for an unobtrusive panic button , or your just need to clear your screen of those 153 tabs for moment , HideTab can help you out .
You can hide all of them at once , or merely one -- just do n't forget that the hidden tabs are still running in the background .
WebReview makes your start page smarter and more suggestive based on past browsing habits .
It 's a bit like the Speed Dial feature in Opera , Chrome 's new tab page , or Top Sites in Safari , but Firefoxified .
It tells you the last batch of tabs you had open , along with most visited pages .
But it also shows you a group of sites you visit daily , along with a suggestion of sites you may be interested in going to .
It sorts these out by what day it is , along with the time .
WebReview also offers a replacement history tracker , allowing you to search by domain or number of visits .
Sites in the WebReview history come with thumbnail previews .
Lastly , there 's a Graph View , showing the breadcrumb trail of how you went from site to site for that entire session .
You can also go back to specific days and see a large graph for the entire day .
It 's visually appealing and exploratory at the same time .
FastestFox can be a bit of overkill , and one of our favorite features from it is available separately .
PageZipper takes stories split over multiple pages and " zips " them into one .
It 's a bit wonky , and does n't play nicely with Flash - or JavaScript - based photos , but in general works well .
It 's also designed to be inoffensive to publishers , who often have legitimate reasons for splitting content into multiple pages .
The " zipping " loads the next page in full below , including ads , so their potential revenue goes unharmed .
The reader , on the other hand , benefits from significantly less stop - and - go clicking .

Wikipedia
Diver hooks deep into your Wikipedia browsing to provide a fascinating look at what you 've been researching .
It organizes your Wiki searches down to the day , order , and session in which you visited the sites , making it easy to revisit old entries .
Fortunately , all this data is kept on your local computer and not in the cloud , so there are no privacy issues .
The reasonable offshoot of that is that it does n't track external links you click on from within a Wikipedia article , but that 's a small price to pay .
I use URL Tooltip in conjunction with several other , not - new - in - '09 add - ons to maximize my screen real estate when browsing .
URL Tooltip is new this year , and is quite savvy for those with larger monitors .
It reveals a link 's full URL as a mouse - over tool tip , thus allowing you to hide your status bar at the bottom of Firefox if you 've got nothing else in it .
Along with Personal Menu and the Stop - or - Reload Button , and removing the search bar , I 've been able to see more of what I want to be looking at on my screen when browsing .
Have a suggestion for the best new Firefox add - on of 2009 ?
Or think I just got it all wrong ?
Tell me about it in the comments below .
Cuentan que en el año 2000 , cuando el actual alcalde de Los Ángeles , Antonio Villarraigosa era un político en ascenso y Presidente de la Asamblea de California , fue invitado a cenar a casa del empresario mexicano Carlos Slim , se le pidió , como mexicano - estadounidense , que explicara en pocas palabras , la diferencia que había entre México y Estados Unidos .
Esto fue lo que contestó Villarraigosa : " Mire usted , es muy simple , si mi familia se hubiera quedado a vivir en México , el día de hoy yo estaría sirviendo esta cena . "
Quizá hubiera sido el caso del astronauta José Hernández Moreno , quien nació el 7 de agosto de 1962 en French Camp , California .
Es estadounidense .
Sus padres originarios de un ranchito llamado Ticuitaco , cerca de La Piedad , Michoacán , México , migraron a Estados Unidos , como ilegales , para emplearse en la recolección del tomate y el pepino .
El propio José Hernández trabajaba todos los veranos en el campo .
Él mismo recuerda como estaba limpiando con azadón una fila de remolacha azucarera , cuando escuchó en un radio de transistores la noticia de que Franklin Chang Díaz había sido seleccionado como astronauta y cómo esa noticia lo motivó y ese día dijo : " Yo quiero viajar al espacio . "
José Hernández lo logró .
Estudió ingeniería , alcanzó el grado de doctor , ingresó a la NASA , se preparó y por fin el 29 de agosto de 2009 despegó como parte de la tripulación del transbordador espacial Discovery , en una misión en la Estación Espacial Internacional .
Pero , ¿qué hubiera sido de José Hernández si su familia se hubiera quedado en México ?
Es claro que no habría alcanzado su sueño de volar al espacio .
Tardaremos muchos lustros , antes de que México logre concretar su primera misión espacial .
Apenas hoy se discute en el Congreso mexicano la posibilidad de crear una Agencia Espacial Mexicana .
Pero más que eso , los futuros posibles de José Hernández si se hubiera quedado en México están en la experiencia y en la estadística .
Como tantos mexicanos pobres , campesinos , de Michoacán y de otros estados del país , le hubieran quedado pocas opciones y futuros muy limitados .
Difícilmente hubiera pasado de la primaria .
Estadísticamente hubiera abandonado los estudios con la secundaria inconclusa y por supuesto su educación hubiera sido de muy mala calidad .
Quizá se hubiera quedado a sembrar su tierra , lo que le hubiera garantizado un futuro de miseria , con ingresos inferiores a los dos dólares al día .
Lo más probable es que , inquieto , hubiera emigrado a la ciudad .
En ese escenario estadísticamente las mayores oportunidades a las que aspiraba José Hernández con la secundaria inconclusa , si es que conseguía trabajo , eran las de terminar con algún trabajo precario , como jardinero , mesero , quizá como obrero en una maquiladora , como trabajador de la construcción o quizá conduciendo un autobus .
Pero la familia de José Hernández no se quedó , emigró como tantas otras y le dio a su hijo la posibilidad de alcanzar un futuro totalmente distinto .
El contraste de ingresos y de oportunidades entre México y Estados Unidos es tan grande , que por eso México sigue y seguirá siendo por muchos años un país expulsor .
Un país del que se han ido ya millones de personas .
Para darnos una idea , según cifras oficiales , consideradas muy conservadoras por algunos expertos , hoy radican en Estados Unidos cerca de 12 millones de personas nacidas en México .
Esto es , algo así como el 10 % de la población total de México .
En 2007 migraron a Estados Unidos 478.000 personal .
En 2008 migraron 450.000 y aunque las autoridades mexicanas esperan que la cifra sea un poco menor en 2009 como consecuencia de la crisis económica en Estados Unidos , la migración es un proceso constante .
El esplendido documental de Juan Carlos Rulfo y Carlos Hagerman
Los que se quedan , nos regala un gran fresco de esta realidad .
El drama de los mexicanos que se quedan en las comunidades expulsoras de migrantes .
Los contrastes de ingresos , las diferencias , la soledad , la incertidumbre , la miseria , pero sobre todo la falta de oportunidades .
Es con esta realidad de fondo y en esta condición , en la que entra el absurdo , la contradicción y la vergüenza .
Es aquí donde aparece la incongruencia que enoja , que debe enojar , cuando el gobierno y los políticos mexicanos tratan de convertir a la historia de José Hernández en un cuento de orgullo nacional .
Es aquí donde aparece el cuento del astronauta mexicano .
Donde nos inventan la historia de superación personal de un mexicano , como si fuera de verdad un logro nacional .
En cuanto apareció en el radar la historia del astronauta José Hernández , de inmediato se activaron todas las maquinarias de la propaganda y el marketing gubernamentales .
En el cuartel de todos los partidos políticos , del Congreso de la Unión y del Ejecutivo Federal se movilizaron de inmediato las agendas y los medios para tratar de capitalizar al máximo al supuesto astronauta mexicano .
El objetivo : convertir a José Hernández en orgullo nacional .
Es obvio , ante la falta de triunfos reales , cualquier gol de la selección nacional , cualquier medalla , cualquier premio de literatura es bueno para tratar de levantar un poco el ánimo y la moral nacional caídas en un país en crisis , complicado y muy emproblemado .
El presidente personalmente paseó a José Hernández por el país .
Inmediatamente todos los medios se ocuparon del tema .
José Hernández se convirtió en súper estrella .
Entrevistas en los medios .
Toda una gira de Estado .
Visita al Congreso .
Homenajes .
Los políticos querían retratarse con él .
Regalos , las llaves de la ciudad , plaza con su nombre y sobre todo discursos , muchos discursos .
Discursos que hablaban una y otra vez del orgullo nacional , de la superación personal y de la capacidad de los mexicanos .
Pero la realidad es otra muy distinta .
Aunque nos duela , José Hernández no es un orgullo nacional .
Su historia de éxito no es nuestra historia de éxito y menos una historia de la que pueda sentirse orgulloso nuestro gobierno o nuestra clase política .
No es un problema de nacionalidades .
José Hernández es estadounidenses y tiene raíces mexicanas , tiene acceso a la nacionalidad mexicana , por derecho de sangre , y él mismo se identifica mucho con nuestra cultura .
Pero ese no es el debate .
José Hernández puede ser mexicano , pero la historia del astronauta José Hernández es totalmente estadounidense .
El logro de llevar a un jornalero agrícola pobre al espacio , es una historia de movilidad social en los Estados Unidos .
El mérito es de otro sistema .
José Hernández se hizo en otro país , con otras políticas públicas , con otro gobierno y con otras leyes .
La verdadera imagen de José Hernández es la fotografía de un hombre con una bandera con estrellas y barras en el hombro .
Su bandera como astronauta .
La bandera de su logro .
En todas las imágenes vimos a un miembro de la fuerza aérea estadounidense , enfundado en su uniforme azul , portando con orgullo la bandera del país que le dio la oportunidad de tener la educación de calidad , la salud , las condiciones y el ambiente de libertad necesarios , para alcanzar sus metas .
Inventar el cuento del astronauta mexicano por parte del gobierno , es como robar un pedacito de gloria .
Mendigar triunfos ajenos .
Usurpar éxitos imposibles , en un país que no atina el rumbo para convertirse en serio en un México ganador .
El Presidente de México Felipe Calderón dijo en uno de los homenajes : " la brillante historia de vida de José Hernández es y debe ser un ejemplo para los mexicanos . "
¿ Lo dice en serio ?
¿ Cuál es el ejemplo Señor Presidente ?
¿ Irse ?
¿ Nacer en Estados Unidos ?
¿ Migrar ?
¿ Qué las familias mexicanas migren a tiempo ?
¿ Hacerse norteamericano ?
¿ Buscar allá las oportunidades que no se tienen aquí ?
La historia de éxito de personal de José Hernández , es al mismo tiempo la historia del fracaso de la política económica , de la política social y de la política exterior del gobierno mexicano .
Es la historia del fracaso de éste y de varios gobiernos mexicanos .
Su historia debería darle vergüenza a una clase política incapaz de ponerse de acuerdo y de generar un proyecto de nación para los millones de José Hernández que están repartidos por todo el país , y que no quieren ser astronautas , millones de mexicanos a quienes sólo les bastaría con poder comer , con tener un mínimo de salud , un piso que no sea de tierra o saber leer y escribir .
José Hernández es la historia moderna de Benito Juárez .
Uno llega a la presidencia , el otro llega al espacio .
Ambas son historias de éxito .
Historias de superación personal .
Iconos .
Ejemplos .
Pedagogía pura .
Historia de bronce .
Los dos comparten esa historia de movilidad social , que tanto nos gusta a los seres humanos .
Es el cuento de la cenicienta .
Es la pobreza superada , es la miseria transitada .
Es el éxito a pesar de la adversidad .
Pero la de Juárez es una historia mexicana del siglo XIX .
La de José Hernández es una historia norteamericana del siglo XXI .
José Hernández dijo en una entrevista : " Lo que me sorprendió mucho es cuando vi al mundo como uno : no había fronteras , no se podía distinguir entre Estados Unidos y México " , pero lo cierto es que sí existen las fronteras .
Su familia cruzó una de ellas de manera ilegal .
Lo cierto es que sí existen las banderas y las diferencias .
Sí existe una frontera que hace a dos países muy distintos .
La lección es muy clara : si José Hernández se hubiera quedado en México , quizá hoy estaría sirviendo la cena .
A Gallup poll of Americans ’ attitudes towards religion released on Christmas Eve found significant recent increases in those responding either that they have no religious preference , that religion is not very important in their lives , or that they believe religion “ is largely old - fashioned or out of date . ”
Only 78 % of Americans now identify as Christian , while 22 % describe their religious preference as either “ other ” or “ none . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Most of these changes have occurred since 2000 and represent the first significant shift since a sharp decline in religious adherence during the 1970s .
Over the last nine years , the number with no religious preference has grown from a level of around 8 % to 13 % .
The number for whom religion is not very important has climbed from just over 10 % to 19 % .
And the number who believe religion is out of date and has no answers for today ’s problems has jumped from slightly more than 20 % to 29 % .
These changes do not appear to have affected the majority of Americans who still consider religion “ very important ” in their own lives .
That figure remains at 56 % — roughly the same as for the last 35 years — while 57 % still say religion has answers to most of the world ’s problems .
The biggest difference is that in the late 1990s , up to 68 % of Americans thought religion had answers to the world ’s problems — even though only about 60 % said religion was personally very important to them .
It seems as though over the last ten years a significant number may have gone from believing that religion is a positive factor in the world , even if they ’re not particularly religious themselves , to seeing religion in a far more skeptical or even negative light .
Mérida , December 18th 2009 ( Venezuelanalysis.com ) – During a meeting with trade unions , political organizations , and social movement leaders in Copenhagen , Denmark on Thursday , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez accused the Netherlands of allowing the United States military to plan a future attack against Venezuela from its island territories in the Caribbean , known as the Dutch Antilles .
“ I am accusing the Kingdom of the Netherlands together with the Yankee empire of preparing a military aggression against Venezuela , ” said Chavez , who came to Copenhagen to participate in the XV United Nations International Conference on Climate Change this week .
“ The islands of Aruba and Curacao , both of which belong to the Kingdom of the Netherlands , have permitted the installation of United States military equipment on their soil , placing Venezuela under the watch of the United States , ” Chavez explained .
“ It would be good for Europe to know that the North American empire is arming these islands Aruba and Curacao to the teeth , filling them with war planes , war ships , and CIA spies . ”
“ Since the Kingdom of the Netherlands is a member of the European Union , I would like to see what the European Union has to say about this , ” Chavez declared .
In response , a spokesperson for the Netherlands Foreign Ministry , Bart Reis , called the accusations “ groundless . ”
“ As Venezuela knows , ” said Reis , “ the United States only uses civilian airports ” and “ unarmed planes for the fight against drug trafficking ” in the Dutch Antilles .
Reis said the Netherlands Foreign Ministry would seek a meeting with Venezuelan government officials to discuss the issue .
President Chavez emphasized that the U.S. military presence in the Dutch Antilles , which are located approximately one hundred kilometers off the Venezuelan coast , is only part of broader U.S. strategy to expand its military power in Latin America in order to crush the socialist movements and progressive governments that have been democratically elected in countries across the region over the past ten years .
Last year , the U.S. military re-activated the Fourth Naval Fleet of its Southern Command .
In October of this year it signed a military pact to use seven Colombian military bases as a launching pad for “ full spectrum operations ” across the South American continent , according to U.S. Air Force budgetary documents .
“ This new Yankee military deployment that is now in full scale development threatens not only Venezuela , ” but also other countries whose governments openly support socialism and are members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas ( ALBA ) , Chavez said on Thursday .
Several of the nine ALBA member countries , including Ecuador , Cuba , Nicaragua , and Bolivia , sent representatives to Thursday ’s meeting with social movements in Copenhagen as well .
Shortly after Chavez made his announcements in Copenhagen , U.S. - Venezuelan lawyer Eva Golinger testified to the truth of Chavez ’s accusations on a nightly Venezuelan talk show .
The U.S. has had a “ contract ” with the Dutch government since 1999 to use air and seaports in the Dutch Antilles for what the U.S. military calls “ advanced operations , ” said Golinger , who has used the U.S. Freedom of Information Act many times to find information on U.S. intervention in Latin America .
Since the creation of the ALBA in 2004 , the re-election of Chavez to a second presidential term in 2006 , and Chavez ’s increasing advocacy of “ 21st Century Socialism ” , the U.S. has placed more than a hundred warships in Aruba and Curacao , an increase of 1000 % , said Golinger , holding up newspapers from 2005 and 2006 in Curacao as evidence of her assertion .
The fact that we ’re seeing the first really serious attempt to control health care costs as part of a bill that tries to cover the uninsured seems to confirm what would - be reformers have been saying for years :
The path to cost control runs through universality .
We can only tackle out - of - control costs as part of a deal that also provides Americans with the security of guaranteed health care .
That observation in itself should make anyone concerned with fiscal responsibility support this reform .
Over the next decade , the Congressional Budget Office has concluded , the proposed legislation would reduce , not increase , the budget deficit .
And by giving us a chance , finally , to rein in the ever - growing spending of Medicare , it would greatly improve our long - run fiscal prospects .
But there ’s another reason failure to pass reform would be devastating  namely , the nature of the opposition .
The Republican campaign against health care reform has rested in part on the traditional arguments , arguments that go back to the days when Ronald Reagan was trying to scare Americans into opposing Medicare  denunciations of “ socialized medicine , ” claims that universal health coverage is the road to tyranny , etc .
But in the closing rounds of the health care fight , the G.O.P. has focused more and more on an effort to demonize cost - control efforts .
The Senate bill would impose “ draconian cuts ” on Medicare , says Senator John McCain , who proposed much deeper cuts just last year as part of his presidential campaign .
“ If you ’re a senior and you ’re on Medicare , you better be afraid of this bill , ” says Senator Tom Coburn .
If these tactics work , and health reform fails , think of the message this would convey :
It would signal that any effort to deal with the biggest budget problem we face will be successfully played by political opponents as an attack on older Americans .
It would be a long time before anyone was willing to take on the challenge again ; remember that after the failure of the Clinton effort , it was 16 years before the next try at health reform .
That ’s why anyone who is truly concerned about fiscal policy should be anxious to see health reform succeed .
If it fails , the demagogues will have won , and we probably wo n’t deal with our biggest fiscal problem until we ’re forced into action by a nasty debt crisis .
So to the centrists still sitting on the fence over health reform :
If you care about fiscal responsibility , you better be afraid of what will happen if reform fails .
A research study at the University of Arkansas has indicated that excessive gaming interferes with sleep .
Thank goodness that mystery has finally been solved .

Research studies sound like a great deal of fun .
You get to arbitrarily assign values and definitions and then cull data based on those arbitrary assignments in order to get obvious answers !
Take this University of Arkansas study , which was presented at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies on Monday , surveyed 137 students - 87 females and 50 non-females , you know , to preserve balance ... somehow .
They then separated the results for excessive gamers from the casual or non-gamers , defining excessive as those who spend more than 7 hours a week playing computer games or using the internet .
My mother spends over seven hours a week using the internet .
By this study 's standards , my mom is hardcore .

Principal investigator Amanda Woolems indicated that previous research has determined that excessive gamers spend less time in bed .
True , though I 'd say that depends on the frequency of save points in whatever game I might be playing at the time and whether or not I 've fallen asleep in my recliner .
This study 's findings ?
" Our statistics revealed that those who admitted addiction scored higher on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( sleepiness ) , " said Woolems .
" It surprised us , however , that of the people who admitted being addicted to gaming , only about a third of them recognized an interference with their sleep . "
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is based on a test in which you rate your likeliness to fall asleep in several different situations , such as reading a book , watching television , or stopped at a particularly long intersection .
It 's the sort of scale I 'm surprised does n't come into play more often , like when you 're calling in sick for work .
" Sorry , I 'm about a 22 on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale boss . "
As for the results , one has to look at the numbers to have them make more sense .
The study found that only 12.6 people admitted to being addicted to gaming , while 10.81 reported that gaming interfered with their sleep .
That 's 17 and 15 people , rounded up .
One also has to keep in mind that they are polling university students on their sleep habits , and basing their findings against the American Academy of Sleep Medicine 's recommendation that adults get 8 hours of sleep per night and adolescents get 9 .
I 'd say that to the vast majority of us , those numbers are a bit unrealistic .
Eight hours of sleep is what I get if I pulled an all - nighter the previous evening .
From what I remember of my college days ... well let 's just say I do n't remember much , probably due in part to lack of sleep .
Advertisement
In case you were interested , those 15 people who reported that gaming interfered with their sleep spend 1.6 hours less than other gamers , while those 17 who claimed to be " addicted " slept one hour less on weekdays .
To put that into perspective , between work gaming and recreational gaming , I probably average about 5 to 6 hours per night , though I generally average less during the weekdays , making up for lost sleep by falling asleep at particularly busy intersections .
Anyway , the study still stands .
Excessive gaming , especially gaming that interferes with sleep , can make you tired ... as can excessive listening to music , excessive watching of entire seasons of Weeds at 2 am , and excessively writing up the results of research studies .

TWITS , TWEETERS , HOOTERS following Mat Mladin may have noticed the multiple AMA Superbike champion hinting at a possible return to racing .
Following several public outbursts at AMA race organisers , as well as fellow competitors early this year , the Australian announced his retirement from AMA Pro Racing .
But this week the superbike hardnut said this on his Twitter page :
' A couple of world superbike offers have come my way in the past month .
1 of them very good in regards to machinery .

Advertisement President Barack Obama has said the US must uphold moral standards when waging wars that are necessary and justified , as he accepted his Nobel Peace Prize .
In his speech in Oslo , he defended the US role in Afghanistan , arguing the use of force could bring lasting peace .
He also said his accomplishments were slight compared with other laureates .
Mr Obama was given the prize in October for his " extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples " .
Thursday 's ceremony in the Norwegian capital came days after Mr Obama announced he was sending 30,000 extra US soldiers to the war in Afghanistan .
ANALYSIS Paul Reynolds , BBC world affairs correspondent
He is careful to say that America respects the cultures and traditions of others - again , trying to project the US as a defender not an aggressor .
But he also wants to stand up for " universal values " .
It is a difficult balancing act .
His statement that " America has never fought a war against a democracy " might raise the issue as to whether it has fought on the side of non-democracies .
Point - by - point analysis of speech
There was a mixed reaction when he was named as the winner of this year 's prize , becoming the fourth US president to be given the honour .
Mr Obama 's elevation to the rank of fellow laureates such as Nelson Mandela , Mother Teresa and Martin Luther King , before he has even spent a year in office , has sparked fierce debate .
Critics also said it was inappropriate for the honour to go to the commander - in - chief of a country involved in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Acknowledging the controversy , Mr Obama said he accepted the award with humility , adding : " Compared to some of the giants of history who have received this prize ... my accomplishments are slight . "
He could not argue with those who said many previous laureates were " far more deserving " of the honour than him , he said .
US media reaction
In pictures : Obama 's Nobel Prize Send us your comments Defending his Afghan troop deployment , Mr Obama said there were times when " the use of force [ was ] not only necessary but morally justified , " as long as force was proportionate and civilian casualties minimised .
" Instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace " , he said .
" A non-violent movement could not have halted Hitler 's armies , " he added .
" Negotiations cannot convince al - Qaeda 's leaders to lay down their arms . "
He said the US " must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war " to differentiate it from " a vicious adversary that abides by no rules " .
The president of war and peace appears to have pulled off a difficult balancing act , by refusing to bask in the glow of merely being the ' anti- Bush '
Mark Mardell , BBC North America editor
Read Mark 's thoughts in full Mr Obama also emphasised alternatives to violence , stressing the importance of diplomacy and sanctions to confront nations like Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programmes .
While Russia and America were working to reduce their nuclear stockpiles , he said the international community must ensure Tehran and Pyongyang did not " game the system " .
" Let us reach for the world that ought to be , " Mr Obama said .
" We can understand that there will be war , and still strive for peace . "
He paid tribute to anti-government demonstrators in Iran , Burma and Zimbabwe , and said the US would always stand on the side of those who sought freedom .
Protests
Some anti-war demonstrators gathered outside city hall , where the ceremony was held .
" We are protesting against him because ... we do n't think he is a man of peace , " one of them told AFP news agency .
Amid high security , the US president earlier signed the Nobel Prize book of previous laureates after arriving in Oslo with his wife , Michelle .
Indonesia unveils statue of Obama Obama tight schedule irks Norway
There has been some disappointment in Norway at Mr Obama 's decision to stay only one day , even though Nobel ceremonies are usually held over three , and decline a traditional lunch with the king .
At a news conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg , Mr Obama said he and his wife wished they could stay longer .
In the evening , Mr Obama appeared alongside Michelle on their hotel balcony and waved to a torchlight procession below .
The couple were then due to go to the traditional winners ' banquet .
The Nobel Prizes for chemistry , literature , medicine , physics and economics are also being presented , in the Swedish capital Stockholm .
Each laureate , including Mr Obama , receives a diploma , a medal and 10 m kroner ( $ 1.4 m ; £ 865,000 ) .
Coinciding with the Nobel ceremony , a statue of Mr Obama as a young boy was unveiled in the Indonesian capital , Jakarta , at a park , near where the president lived between 1967 and 1971 .

Experts warn that universities ' e-mail systems are vulnerable to attacks Sir Muir Russell will head an independent review into the e-mails leaked from the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) in Norwich , UK .
Sir Muir , a former civil servant , will look into allegations that have arisen from the security breach .
The review will examine whether there is evidence of manipulation or suppression of data " at odds with acceptable scientific practice " .
The CRU is based at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) .
The e-mails issue arose two weeks ago when hundreds of messages between scientists at the CRU and their peers around the world were posted on the world wide web , along with other documents .
It appears that the material was hacked or leaked ; a police investigation has yet to reveal which .
CRU maintains one of the world 's most important datasets on how global temperatures have changed .
Professor Phil Jones , director of the unit , has stepped down pending the review , and has said he stands by his data .
At the time that the theft of the data was revealed , some climate sceptic websites picked up on the word " trick " in one e-mail from 1999 and talk of " hiding the decline " .
Professor Jones said the e-mail was genuine but taken " completely out of context " .
He added : " The first thing to point out is that this refers to one diagram - not a scientific paper .
" The word ' trick ' was used here colloquially as in a clever thing to do .
It is ludicrous to suggest that it refers to anything untoward . "
UEA has said the review will : Examine e-mail exchanges to determine whether there is evidence of suppression or manipulation of data at odds with acceptable scientific practice which " may therefore call into question any of the research outcomes " .
Review CRU 's policies and practices for acquiring , assembling , subjecting to peer review and disseminating data and research findings , and " their compliance or otherwise with best scientific practice " .
Review CRU 's compliance or otherwise with the UEA 's policies and practices regarding requests under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) and the Environmental Information Regulations ( EIR ) for the release of data .
Review and make recommendations about the management , governance and security structures for CRU and the security , integrity and release of the data it holds .
Sir Muir commented : " Given the nature of the allegations it is right that someone who has no links to either the university or the climate science community looks at the evidence and makes recommendations based on what they find .
" My first task is to scope the project , gather the information I need and source the additional expertise that will be required in order to investigate fully the allegations that have been made . "
In another development , Saudi Arabia 's chief climate negotiator , Mohammad Al - Sabban said that the CRU e-mail issue will have a " huge impact " on next week 's UN climate summit .
Mr Al - Sabban made clear that he expects it to derail the single biggest objective of the summit - to agree limitations on greenhouse gas emissions .
" It appears from the details of the scandal that there is no relationship whatsoever between human activities and climate change , " he told BBC News .
" Climate is changing for thousands of years , but for natural and not human - induced reasons . "
Bob Ward , policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment , welcomed the appointment .
But he said : " One concern is that the results may not be published until the Spring .
" This is probably necessary to allow a thorough investigation , but it does mean that those who are using ' climategate ' as a propaganda tool for their own political ends might be able to enjoy many more weeks of mischief - making .
" The big question is whether so - called ' sceptics ' will complain because the investigation will not be headed by one of their own , and whether they will suspend their campaigns of disinformation about this affair until the investigation is completed . "
UEA has asked for the review to be completed by the Spring of 2010 and this will be made public along with the university 's response .

The winner of the 2009 Turner Prize is soon to be announced - and one of the four finalists is the artist Roger Hiorns .
The Birmingham - born 34 - year - old made his name with sculptures created with unexpected materials .
He is nominated for ' Seizure ' , in which he took an abandoned London flat and covered it with blue crystals .
Hiorns did this by making the apartment water - tight and flooding it with 70,000 litres of hot copper sulphate solution , which was then allowed to cool and crystallise .
David Sillito took a tour of a very unusual flat .
It is thought around 1.5 m people play bingo in the UK every week A bingo caller has been advised to stop using phrases such as " two fat ladies " for fear of offending his audience .
John Sayers , who runs charity games in Sudbury , Suffolk , says he was told by a council clerk the traditional bingo call could upset some players .
Mr Sayers said no - one had complained before , but now players moaned his new numbers - only style was boring .
A town council spokeswoman said it was " sad " they had to give the advice but they had to be " politically correct " .
The 75 - year - old , a member of Sudbury Town Council and former town mayor , said the clerk advised him to cut the traditional comic calls in case the authority found itself facing legal action .
' Tradition of game '
" The concern was that if there might be two large ladies in the audience when I said ' two fat ladies 88 ' or someone might think I was looking at their legs when I said ' legs 11 ' , " he said .
" I was advised that someone might take offence and we could end up being taken to court . "
He added : " No - one had ever complained about being offended .
But they moan now they say it 's boring .
And I think just saying the numbers is boring too .
" I 'm obviously not being offensive - just having a bit of fun .
It 's the tradition of the game and part of our language . "
Mr Sayers ' use of traditional calls was backed by Rob Hutchinson , who runs onlinebingoclub.co.uk .
" I 'm sure any ladies of larger size who go to bingo do n't find it insulting but take it in the affectionate spirit in which it 's meant , " he said .
" What 's the alternative , ' two generously proportioned people of either gender ? '
It 's not very snappy . "
A council spokeswoman told the East Anglian Daily Times : " In particular with John being a councillor we have to be politically correct . "
She added : " It is very sad because it is part of the fun of bingo but unfortunately in today 's society people take it literally . "

The talk I gave at the New York Future Salon is now available !
The entire video runs about 98 minutes ; my talk starts after a couple of minutes of intro , and I finish up right at the one - hour mark .
The remainder of the video is the Q&A period , which has some good stuff , too .
When I get a chance , I hope to pull out some short clips as stand - alone videos .
The sound quality is surprisingly good , considering that I was n't mic'd .
The lighting is such that some of the slide images are a bit hard to see ; if you 're curious , the entire deck ( sans nifty Keynote transition effects ) is available at SlideShare .
You can get a high - quality MPEG ( .m4v ) version at the Internet Archive page for the video , if you 're eager to download just under a gigabyte ...
My thanks to Kevin Keck and Ella Grapp for inviting me to give the talk , and to Robert Wald for dealing with the video stuff .
As always , please let me know what you think of the talk .
For some reason free market libertarians , Ayn Rand included , tend to fall for the public goods unlogic and therefore dismiss anarchism as a viable social order .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Public goods are not a problem in a free market — they are only a problem in a regulated such .
In fact , the logic emanating from identifying the existence of public goods is based on false assumptions .
Public goods are defined as goods or services that are both non-rivalrous and non-excludable , i.e. the u201 Cexact oppositeu201D of private goods , which are both rivalrous and excludable , in the common two - by - two setup .
Whatever is rivalrous is limited in terms of consumption , which means your use of the good reduces availability of it for others ; whatever is excludable can be u201 Cprotected u201D from others through exclusion , i.e. if I have it and want to use it I can easily make sure you ca n’t have it .
In other words , the rivalrous and excludable private goods are cakes that you cannot both eat and have .
It follows that public goods , as the very opposite of private goods , are cakes we all can eat and have at the same time .
The setup has obvious political connotations in that private goods are like private property in the free market whereas public goods are of a rather communist character and require government regulation .
Consequently , public goods are used as an argument against the free market and for a government .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
However , the distinction between public and private goods and , especially , the conclusion drawn from it ( that only the latter work well as private property ) is fallacious .
There are two reasons for this .
In the first case , the structure of present government provision of the public good is taken as a given and the market , it is concluded , cannot provide this type of structure .
In the second case , the current market structure is shown not to provide a good or service that is presumed to be wanted by consumers .
Here the market is u201 Cobviously u201D suboptimal since there exists demand but the market , through its very structure of bottom - up solutions based on private property , provides disincentives to satisfy the demand and therefore u201 Cfails.u201D
Both arguments are wrong and for the same reason .
I would like to say that they are obviously wrong , but since so many , even free - marketeers , seem to fall for them I guess they are not that obvious after all .
The Myth of National D... Hans - Hermann Hoppe Best Price : $ 2.50 Buy New $ 17.90 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
Taking Government Structure for Granted
The problem is that status quo is implicitly assumed .
Where government is currently providing a service , such as national defense , it is concluded that the market could not provide that service holding the production structure , provision , and level of service constant .
This is a common trick that many seem to fall for , but the conclusion does not make much sense : the free market cannot provide government defense .
And even if the market could , why in the world would we assume market organization would be identical to government organization ?
Market organization is bottom - up subject to consumer wants through the profit - loss system ; government organization is top - down political command with no incentive whatsoever to satisfy consumer wants ( except , perhaps , to the degree that it keeps voters voting ) .
In the case of national defense , an issue that often seems to confuse advocates of the free market , the public goods argument bluntly states that the free market cannot supply national defense .
Well , to be honest : I see no reason for private enterprise to provide national defense .
u201CThe nationu201D is not a consumer and has no wants and also cannot pay for the service — it is but a collectivist illusion .
The market would provide defense services for individuals and families and their property — to the degree they are willing and able to pay for the service .
In what sense is protection of my life and property non-rivalrous and non-excludable ?
A counter - argument claims that even if private life and property is protected , it is still the case that foreign nations constitute a threat and that we need to defend our nation .
But this counter - argument is even worse than the original argument : not only is u201 Cour nationu201D assumed as the starting point — but now we also seem to assume other u201Cnationsu201D have the ability to act and even have feelings ( they ’re u201 Chostileu201D and therefore u201Ca threatu201D ) .
Also , the argument seems to assume that u201 Cweu201D — our u201Cnationu201D — must have pissed u201 Cthemu201D off somehow to such a degree that u201 Cthey u201D not only want to but will attack u201 Cus.u201D
I doubt it is possible to get more collectivism than that into a single sentence .
So how would the free market provide u201Cnational defenseu201D ?
The question has been answered over and over to different levels of detail , but a good starting point is government .
If one would want to u201 Cdefeatu201D ( occupy , take over , destroy , whatever … ) the United States all that is necessary is to get the people on capitol hill on their knees and then they ’ll wave the white flag of surrender and all Americans will instantaneously be subjected to another master .
If someone would want to take over the area formerly known as the United States that someone would have to occupy and defeat every single individual and every single piece of private property .
Furthermore , a free market society would not supply the aggressor with a fixed and ready structure of government , so the aggressor would need to both subject 300 million people to his will and build the controlling hierarchy of government to keep them all in check .
As an aggressor , which structure would you choose ?
Which suffers from a u201 Cpublic goods problemu201D ?
The Left , The Right an ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr Best Price : $ 7.33 Buy New $ 40.00 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
The Market ’s Failure to Provide
The alternative version of the public goods anti-market rhetoric states that the market is unable to provide certain goods or services that are desired by [ most or all ] consumers .
The obvious question to ask anyone claiming this is u201 Chow do you know ?
u201D — how do you establish that there is sufficient market demand but not supply to satisfy those consumer wants ?
To me , this seems like a contradiction in terms : if there is sufficient demand there will be supply , and if there is n’t there wo n’t be .
Oftentimes market demand is assumed to be great because the good or service is u201 Cimportantu201D or necessary in very general terms , such as a clean or protected environment and the supply of radio or television ( and , lately , Internet ) .
In the case of the environment , government u201 Cneedsu201D to step in since the market does n’t regulate e.g. emissions and therefore the market suffers from extensive externalities .
The description of the u201 Cproblemu201D obviously assumes a distribution of property rights and a system for property protection — and regulation of the extent of property rights — that is identical to that provided by government , i.e. a political system based on force .
The fallacy is here the assumption of a society with a free market based on private property existing side by side with ( or , more likely , under ) government .
The truth is that any force - based system necessarily compromises private property rights : a system of power cannot guarantee property but can only guarantee property for as long as that power finds it beneficial .
In other words , property exists subject to the whim of government leaders , which increases uncertainty and therefore creates disincentives to invest in risky projects .
Also , such a system provides the illusion of a universal u201 Csafe pathu201D for business .
As long as entrepreneurs follow the government - provided guidelines they are u201Csafeu201D ( i.e. , approved ) and therefore they need not bother as much with market demand , since a market subjected to government is necessarily restricted in supply and has limited competition and artificial barriers to entry .
This means that if consumers prefer reduced emissions they cannot rely fully on market instruments such as boycotts , since new market actors are hindered from entering , but find it more effective to organize in order to influence politicians who can then regulate business .
War is a Racket : The A ... Butler , Smedley D. Best Price : $ 2.55 Buy New $ 7.01 ( as of 05:45 EST - Details )
The problem of public goods is further increased by the fact that government does not enforce property rights to the degree necessary ( i.e. , to the degree they would be in the free market ) and also that it prohibits property of certain assets ( air , water , frequencies for radio , TV , cell phones ) .
Where there are no allocated and enforced property rights there will be chaos .
Chaos , in fact , is a perfectly understandable outcome of a lack of private property , but only where private property rights are n’t applicable or are prohibited .
In fact , where there are no property rights but property rights can be established there will be no chaos — there will be property rights .
Such rights spontaneously arise through market interaction everywhere possible .
In other words , there is no need for government ownership of air waves for television and radio since frequencies can indeed be owned and traded in a market .
But what about exclusion of the use of air waves since they are freely available for anyone capable of picking them up ?
This seems to have been an issue in the public goods debate , but should not be .
It is true that the broadcast of television can be received by anyone within reach — but it is equally true that the broadcaster can encrypt or encode the broadcast so that only those who buy the service get access , thereby creating excludability of non-excludable goods .
The extent of the market is dependent on the overall level of division of labor which is in turn partly dependent on developments in communication and technology .
Conclusion
The conclusions should be fairly obvious : there is no public goods problem .
In fact , we can say that there is either private property or chaos , and there is chaos to the degree that there is no private property .
Our regulated market contains the level of chaos corresponding to the level of government meddling with the incentives and orders of the free market .
That government would be the solution to the so - called public goods problem is nothing but preposterous .
The public goods problem exists in the mind of theoreticians for two reasons .
One is due to their inability to imagine a way to satisfy consumer wants different from the one - size - fits - all service provided by government .
The fact that the market works in very different ways than governments has not crossed their minds .
The other is that they underestimate the destruction caused by government regulation in the existing market and that they fail to understand that markets successfully manage to provide all services that are worth providing .
Making government provide a solution that the market u201 Ccannotu201D simply means making a good or service available prematurely while forcing the costs on everybody through taxation .
In either case , it is obvious that government is the problem and cause of the u201 Cfailureu201D of markets .
The solution is more market , but that ’s not the way public good theorists want to go .
They want to go the other way ; they want their own and nobody else ’s values to shape the world .
For that to happen more government is obviously the key ; without it they cannot force any solution upon the rest of us .

IT takes just nine minutes for John Safran and the ABC to plunge to new " comedic " depths this week .
Under the notion of exploring his attraction to Eurasians , Safran is filmed stealing the underwear of prominent Australian women - actress Dichen Lachman and singer Mahalia Barnes , among others - before sniffing them in a science laboratory .
The distasteful sketch features in the debut episode of John Safran 's Race Relations , due to be screened on Wednesday .
Lachman , based in Los Angeles , has privately questioned the intention of the sketch , but she declined to discuss it with The Sunday Telegraph .
She and Barnes , the daughter of iconic Australian rocker Jimmy Barnes , were approached by Safran to discuss their mixed ethnicity .
During the interviews , Safran excused himself before being filmed allegedly stealing the women 's supposedly unwashed underpants .
Later , he is filmed sniffing undergarments - also taken from Jewish friends - as part of a " scientific " test to discover if he is biologically predisposed in an attraction to Eurasians or Jews .
Safran said he expected some backlash over the series debut , in which he is also shown masturbating to an image of US President Barack Obama .
" I thought episode one was my mainstream episode ... maybe I got it wrong ?
There 's seven and three - quarter episodes where I 'm not masturbating .
I can't be any more accommodating than that , " he said .
Noting the underpants sketch was " set up " , Barnes agreed the piece could prove publicly odious .
" People will be offended , but they should n't be watching the show .
I was n't personally offended , " she said .
Australian Family Association spokesman John Morrissey described the show as " filth " .
" It 's the lowest point in Australian television history , " he said .
Safran 's new series prompts further questioning of the ABC 's comedy approval processes .
In June , Amanda Duthie was removed as department head after allowing the screening of a Chaser skit , in which the troupe made light of the Make A Wish Foundation .
The skit drew widespread public condemnation , from the Prime Minister down .
Political battles this fall in six different parts of the country could have a profound impact on whether the United States will extend the promise of equal rights to those who are not allowed to marry simply because they are the same sex as their partner .
Three jurisdictions 
New York , New Jersey and the District of Columbia  seem tantalizingly close to securing legislative approval for measures ending the hurtful and unjustifiable exclusion of same - sex couples from civil marriage .
But in Maine , Washington State and Kalamazoo , Mich. , voters are being asked on Tuesday to strip away vital rights and protections .
The dominant Election Day battleground is Maine .
Last fall , forces of the religious right backed a successful ballot measure that overruled California ’s top court by banning same - sex marriage .
Now those forces are trying for another mean - spirited victory with Maine ’s Question 1 , which , if approved , would block the legalization of same - sex marriage passed by the State Legislature and signed by Gov. John Baldacci in May .
With the outcome likely to be close , a heavy turnout by voters committed to tolerance and justice is crucial .
Washington State has yet to approve same - sex marriage .
But it took a positive step last May when Gov. Chris Gregoire signed a bill that granted gay and lesbian couples the state - provided benefits that married heterosexual couples have , like the right to use sick leave to care for a partner .
Voters should affirm this progress by voting yes on Referendum 71 .
In the years leading up to the start of the Revolutionary War in 1775 , the rebel - rousing Sons of Liberty “ The Boston Massacre ” to encourage anti-British sentiments .
used an engraving of what they calledto encourage anti-British sentiments .
Paul Revere , shows a line of British soldiers coldly firing their bayoneted muskets into a crowd of Americans , several of which lay bleeding on the ground .
The engraving , done by , shows a line of British soldiers coldly firing their bayoneted muskets into a crowd of Americans , several of which lay bleeding on the ground .
A poem underneath that scene describes how the King ’s men “ With murderous Rancour stretch their bloody hands , Like fierce Barbarians grinning o'er their Prey . ”
It was good propaganda .
But it did distort what happened at the “ Boston Massacre ” on the night of March 5 , 1770 .
That night , a local resident got into an argument over a debt with a British soldier .
Eight other British soldiers came out on the street to help their comrade .
A group of Americans surrounded the soldiers .
The Brits were soon being yelled at and pelted with snowballs , ice chunks and debris by the much larger , hostile crowd .
The bloodletting appears to have started when a mulatto seaman named Crispus Attucks hit one of the soldiers with a piece of wood .
The soldiers panicked .
Somebody yelled “ Fire ! ” and they shot into the crowd , killing Attucks and four other Americans .
When the British soldiers were arrested and put on trial for murder , a Boston merchant asked local lawyer ( and future president ) John Adams to defend them .
He agreed , knowing it would make him unpopular and could ruin his career .
Adams believed the soldiers deserved legal representation as a matter of principle .
After looking into the incident , he also believed they were provoked and should not be executed for murder , as many Bostonians wanted .
On December 4 , 1770 , the second day of the brief trial , Adams gave his summation to the jury .
He argued that anyone might have reacted the same way the soldiers did in such a confusing and potentially life - threatening situation .
He suggested Crispus Attucks was more to blame for “ the dreadful carnage of that night ” than the soldiers , because of his “ mad behavior . ”
“ Facts are stubborn things , ” Adams said , uttering what became a famous quotation .
“ And whatever may be our wishes , our inclinations , or the dictates of our passions , they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence : nor is the law less stable than the fact ; if an assault was made to endanger their lives , the law is clear , they had a right to kill in their own defence ; if it was not so severe as to endanger their lives , yet if they were assaulted at all , struck and abused by blows of any sort , by snow - balls , oyster - shells , cinders , clubs , or sticks of any kind ; this was a provocation , for which the law reduces the offence of killing , down to manslaughter . ”
The jury was persuaded .
Six of the soldiers were acquitted .
Two were found guilty of manslaughter and punished by having their thumbs branded .
Several years later , John Adams wrote in his diary that his defense of those British soldiers was “ one of the best Pieces of Service I ever rendered my Country . ”
“ Facts are stubborn things ” became one of Adams ' best known and oft - cited quotes .
However , contrary to what I once thought , he did n't coin that line .

Stone Temple Pilots STILL kick - ass .
( Now with 51 % less heroin !
I think . )
Well .
I ’m beginning to get a little bit concerned that I ’m becoming one of “ those ” music fans .
The kind I used to make fun of for being to old , to stubborn and to locked into their own era of music , uninterested in expanding their listening experiences to anything beyond the music they know – the music they grew up with .
People who still listen to “ the Eagles ” or “ the Doobie Brothers ” even though so much music has come out since then , and neither band was very good to begin with anyways .
I was always confidant that this then would never be me .
I ’m young !
I ’m hip !
I ’m in the “ know ! ” I keep up with whatever ’s young and hip and in the “ know ! ” Right ?
RIGHT ?
Not quite .
And Tuesday night proved that when I shelled out actual money to see Stone Temple Pilots at the Kool Haus in Toronto .
That ’s right .
Stone Temple Pilots .
A band that has n’t had a hit single , or even an album , in god knows how long .
A band who ’s lead singer I ’m sure we all assumed was either dead or arrested .
A band that hit it big over fifteen years ago , and who would recieve a collective “ who ? ” from anybody under the age of sixteen today .
THAT band .
And they absolutely rocked .
Seriously .
Vindication !
And , while some people would see the complete lack of any new material as a depressing reminder of just how irrelevant a band might be , all it meant for us was an hour and a half of SINGING ALONG TO EVERY DAMN WORD .
Which is always a good time .
The band kicked it into high gear right off the bat , opening with “ Silvergun Superman ” and then tore threw fan favorites like “ Wicked Garden , ” “ Vasoline ” and “ Big Empty . ”
In fact ,
during the show they played songs mostly off of their first two records , “ Core ” ( 1992 ) and “ Purple ” ( 1994 ) – which of course , is exactly what the majority of the audience ( mostly males under thirty ) wanted to hear ( myself included ) .
The band was tight and professional , which was a little surprising to be honest .
It was also the band ’s only real weakness .
At times they were a little “ too tight ” and “ too professional . ”
I know that sounds horribly nitpicky ( had they been sloppy and falling apart , I ’m sure I would have bitched about that too ) but the fact is that they were clearly just going through the motions at times – and looked it .
Still , when they launched into such crowd favorites as “ Crackerman , ” “ Interstate Love Song ” and their signature tune “ Plush , ” it was hard not to get caught up in the vibe , and be momentarily transported back to 1994 .
Which is , apparently , exactly where I want to be .
And I ’m totally cool with that .

EFA has received many queries from overseas in the last few days asking :
What on earth is going on down there ?
Well , we hoped that sense would prevail ; that more important policies would get in the way , or that the Minister would get seated on a plane next to somebody who actually understood how the Internet works .
Instead , at a sudden press conference it was announced that Australia will next year join the ranks of countries who censor the net .
It 's hard for any government to resist pursuing a policy when children are involved , or are seen to be involved .
The censorship push started its life as a cyber - safety policy , where ISPs would be required to provide a filtered solution to families , but has since morphed into something at once less useful and more sinister .
An announcement on Tuesday confirms it : next year , all Australian ISPs will be required to filter access to a government - supplied blacklist containing " refused classification " ( RC ) web content .
That would include nasty stuff like child pornography , but also a broader range of content : fetishy sex , instruction in crime ( such as euthanasia ) , any computer game not suitable for under 18s .
The list will be partly generated by complaints from the public , and may include lists imported from overseas police departments .
While this is sold as a kid- friendly measure , to " improve safety of the internet for families " , it 's clearly nothing of the sort .
A few thousand URLs hardly constitutes a national net nanny .
The list would almost be laughable if only it was not mandatory and secret - unlike censorship decisions made in other media , blocked URLs will remain secret and expressly excluded from freedom of information requests .
Just as worrying is the fact that once this list is in , a conga - line of special interests will be approaching the government to have their pet peeves added to the list .
It 's not much of a stretch to imagine AFACT ( Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ) clamouring to have bittorrent trackers added , and several parliamentarians are on record calling for a ban on pro-anorexia sites and pornography in general .
It looks like the Australian blogosphere and twitterverse are in an uproar , and the media have not been very kind .
What remains to be seen is how much this issue can crossover into the mainstream public consciousness .
If the policy is seen as a vote - loser rather than a crowd pleaser , the Government might be a little readier to see reason .
So is Australia the new Iran ?
Should you encrypt your hard drive or install a VPN before visiting Australia next year ?
Well , it 's not the law of the land yet , but unless the political winds change , Australia is set to join a club with some rather unsavoury members .
Where can you find Sarah Palin and Rep. Michele Bachmann rubbing elbows with the likes of Roy Moore and Rick Scarborough ?
At the National Tea Party Convention next February in Tennessee :

BEIRUT , Lebanon —
The bombing of Beirut ’s southern suburbs by Israel in 2006 destroyed and damaged hundreds of buildings .
Now , despite three years of political instability , the global financial crisis and United States sanctions , the Hezbollah - run organization tasked with reconstruction has nearly completed rebuilding , and the affected neighborhoods are once again buzzing with activity .
Hassan Jeshi , the head of Hezbollah ’s reconstruction program , called , Waad , or “ The Promise , ” says the $ 400 - million effort has so far rebuilt 70 of the 260 buildings destroyed in the war , and repaired nearly all of the more than 1,000 buildings damaged .
He says the project will finish by the end of 2010 .
“ We passed the half way mark in repairing all the buildings , ” Jeshi said .
“ We are delighted because … people are coming back to their homes , and they are happy . ”
Amidst tall yellow cranes and freshly painted new apartment buildings , the sound of hammers , saws and dump trucks has given rise to renewed life in the areas devastated by Israel ’s month - long bombing campaign that left thousands of Lebanese homeless .
In two separate walks through Beirut ’s southern suburbs , GlobalPost had the chance to interview some of the estimated 800,000 people who live here , all mostly Shiite Muslims .

in southern Beirut .
( Ben Gilbert / GlobalPost )
As an indication of both the extent of Hezbollah ’s tight control in the southern suburbs and the group ’s paranoia about Israeli spies , this reporter had to obtain permission from Hezbollah to tour the area , and was accompanied on both occasions by a Hezbollah security agent , who stood within earshot of all interviews .
People who live in the southern suburbs ( called simply “ Daheeyah , ” or “ suburb , ” in Arabic ) see Hezbollah as the protector against , rather than instigator of , conflict with Israel .
The group ’s kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers in a cross - border raid on July 12 , 2006 , sparked the war .
Still , residents blame Israel , and the U.S. , for the destruction here .
“ Hezbollah is trying to give us better , ” said Abbas Dhani , 50 , a school principal , as he walked into his newly rebuilt apartment building in the Hart Harayk neighborhood .
“ They are defending us .
We are near to Israel , so we have to suffer . ”
Dhani , like other residents of the southern suburbs whose homes were destroyed , received $ 12,000 to pay rent for a year after his home was destroyed and to buy new furniture until Hezbollah could rebuild .
He says times have been tough since the war and he lost a good paying job at a school that was also destroyed .
Still , the pain of the last three years is offset by the value of his new rooftop apartment , which has risen from $ 35,000 to $ 90,000 , he says .
The southern suburbs were originally constructed on the orchards and fields south of Beirut as Shiites from southern Lebanon escaped violence caused by Israeli onslaughts , Christian militias and Palestine Liberation Organization guerillas during Lebanon ’s 1975 to 1990 civil war .
As the refugees arrived , the southern suburbs ’ concrete apartment towers , most of them about 10 stories high , were hastily constructed , often not meeting the minimum standards for building safety .
Many were built illegally .
Electricity , sewage and water problems still plague the old buildings .
Now , few who are moving back in miss much about their old apartments .
As a subtle message to Israel , the buildings are essentially all being built on the same grid , and the apartment layouts are basically the same .
But there are new , modern additions .
“ The building is now built to withstand an earthquake , ” said Ilhama Nahlay , a housewife who recently moved into her new apartment .
She spoke on the steps to her building as two men behind her worked on installing the elevator in the tower ’s shiny new entranceway .
Waad falls under the responsibility of Hezbollah ’s reconstruction wing , called Jihad al Binaa .
Jeshi , the general manager , wo n’t say from where his organization receives its money , only to say that Arab countries have donated money and materials through NGOs and the Lebanese government .
But Hezbollah is widely believed to receive millions of dollars in funding from Iran every year .
Despite the Islamic Republic ’s funding other projects overtly in Lebanon , Jeshi says he does n’t know anything about it .
“ I did n’t take money from Iran , and no one from Iran came here to give us money , ” he said .
“ I have relations with Hezbollah , and if Hezbollah has their relations with Iran , OK , but I have no business with Iran . ”
Hezbollah is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. , and last year Waad was added to the U.S. Treasury terrorist list .
The designation froze all funds related to the group in the U.S. , and made it illegal for Americans to donate money to the project .
" The Waad Project is another example of Hezbollah ’s use of deceptive tactics to support its military and terrorist apparatus , " said a treasury department press release quoting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey .
The Treasury Department accuses Waad of reconstructing not just buildings , but Hezbollah ’s command bunkers and underground weapons storage facilities .
But Jeshi says the terrorist designation had no effect on the reconstruction funding or progress .
The global recession , he says , has also had little impact .
“ The NGOs are still giving money , ” he said .
“ They are still giving me reconstruction materials , marble , iron , concrete and ceramics .
And still money is coming from the government . ”
That last part is a particular sore point between Waad and the Lebanese government , of which Hezbollah is a part .
Oil -rich Arabian Gulf countries like Qatar and Kuwait pledged more than a billion dollars to the Lebanese government for reconstruction after the war in 2006 .
The aid is still being distributed , but residents who lost homes in the southern suburbs are slated to each receive around $ 50,000 from the government .
The government refused to give the money directly to Hezbollah , so the group set up Waad to pool the money by having residents sign over their government issued checks to the group .
But residents often do n’t acknowledge that the government had anything to do with the reconstruction .
And Waad says only 37 percent of the overall cost , or around $ 87 million , has come from the government — far less than it says was pledged .
The government says it has distributed more than $ 150 million to residents in the southern suburbs , and that money is still being disbursed .
Ironically , Jeshi says the biggest challenge to reconstruction has been the steady ebb and flow of laborers from Syria , who have left and come back over the last three years as political tension , and the security situation , fluctuated .
Hezbollah ministers resigned from the government in the wake of the 2006 war , and a power struggle ensued for 18 months , paralyzing the March 14 government and nearly returning the country to civil war .
Between 2006 and 2008 , clashes between Hezbollah supporters and rival young men from March 14 often degenerated into riots or armed clashes .
Eventually , Hezbollah flexed its military muscles , and briefly took over parts of largely March 14 areas in Beirut by force in May 2008 .
More than 70 people died in the fighting .
But now Jeshi says that since a political agreement was reached , the country has been stable , and work has progressed quickly .
Still , there are some things that ca n’t be replaced .
Ilham Nahlay , the housewife whose home was destroyed in 2006 , says all her family ’s photographs , souvenirs and mementos were lost in the bombing .
And , pointing to her two teenage daughters standing shyly nearby , she says the whole family still fears another onslaught .
“ Still now , when they hear about war , they pack their things and want to leave , ” she said .
“ We ’re still afraid . ”

BBC News , Bhopal
Many locals believe their birth defects were caused by the gas leak
Indian officials have dismissed claims that the former Union Carbide pesticide plant at Bhopal is still leaking dangerous toxins into drinking water .
The chief minister of Madhya Pradesh state was speaking 25 years after the world 's worst industrial disaster .
Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan told the BBC the plant was safe , contradicting claims in a new report .
Thousands died after 40 tons of deadly methyl isocyanate gas leaked from the US - owned plant on 3 December 1984 .
Half a million people were exposed to the gas .
Many have suffered life - long chronic illness as a result .
' 100 % clean '
Mr Chouhan said that neighbouring communities near the site had been supplied with clean drinking water .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" It took some time , " he said in a BBC interview ahead of the 25th anniversary of the disaster on 3 December .
" But we managed this quickly , and we can say that we are providing 100 % clean water . "
However , a report published by the British - based charity the Bhopal Medical Appeal ( BMA ) and the Sambhavna Clinic in Bhopal says there is evidence that " there are still high levels of toxic chemicals in the drinking water supply in 15 communities near the old Union Carbide pesticide plant " .
The report says the water " in and around the Union Carbide factory site in Bhopal still contains extremely unsafe levels of carbon tetrachloride and other persistent organic pollutants , solvents , nickel and other heavy metals " .
We have ample evidence that there are many toxins still in the ground
Sathyu Sarangi ,
Sambhavna Clinic
" Not surprisingly , " the report claims , " the populations in the areas surveyed have high rates of birth defects , rapidly rising cancer rates , neurological damage , chaotic menstrual cycles and mental illness . "
Mr Chouhan insisted that clean water was supplied by tanker to those communities without piped water .
But many residents said that supplies were infrequent and insufficient , forcing them to continue relying on contaminated ground water .
Toxins ' never cleaned up '
Sathyu Sarangi , of the Sambhavna Clinic , told the BBC much of the problem arises from areas known as solar evaporation ponds , which he claimed Union Carbide used before the disaster as dumping grounds for toxic effluent .
BHOPAL'S DEATH TOLL Initial deaths ( 3 - 6 December ) : more than 3,000 - official toll Unofficial initial toll : 7,000 - 8,000 Total deaths to date : over 15,000 Number affected : Nearly 600,000 Compensation : Union Carbide pays $ 470 m in 1989

" We have ample evidence , " he said , " that there are many toxins still in the ground that have never been cleaned up .
" Each time it rains , the rain washes those toxins into the ground water , which many people still draw to drink . "
Chief Minister Chouhan said the Union Carbide plant had been made safe , and that the government was planning to turn it into a memorial site , to be opened to the public .
" The plant is not functional , " he said .
" It 's closed down there was a question as to what to do with the pesticide waste .
We took the instructions of the Supreme Court as to how to dispose of that waste .
" There is nothing hazardous to human life people should not be worried .
We have secured the site . "
Union Carbide is now a subsidiary of US firm Dow Chemical .
The government of Madhya Pradesh state took over running the site in 1998 .
A Union Carbide statement said : " The groundwater issue at the Bhopal site is best addressed by the state government of Madhya Pradesh , which owns the site and is responsible for clean - up activities .
" Our understanding is that the central and state governments have plans for site clean - up and we 're hopeful they will follow through with their remediation plans , including addressing concerns about groundwater . "

It is often thought that mathematics can only develop after a civilisation has developed some form of writing .
Although not easy for us to understand today , many civilisations reached highly advanced states without ever developing written records .
Now of course it is difficult for us to know much about such civilisations since there is no written record to be studied today .
This article looks at the mathematical achievements of one such civilisation .
The civilisation we discuss , which does not appear to have found a need to develop writing , is that of the Incas .
The Inca empire which existed in , before the Spanish conquest , was vast .
It spread over an area which stretched from what is now the northern border of Ecuador to Mendoza in west - central Argentina and to the Maule River in central Chile .
The Inca people numbered aroundmillion but they were from many different ethnic groups and spoke aboutdifferent languages .
The civilisation had reached a high level of sophistication with a remarkable system of roads , agriculture , textile design , and administration .
Of course even if writing is not required to achieve this level , counting and recording of numerical information is necessary .
The Incas had developed a method of recording numerical information which did not require writing .
It involved knots in strings called quipu .
The quipu was not a calculator , rather it was a storage device .
Remember that the Incas had no written records and so the quipu played a major role in the administration of the Inca empire since it allowed numerical information to be kept .
Let us first describe the basic quipu , with its positional number system , and then look at the ways that it was used in Inca society .
The quipu consists of strings which were knotted to represent numbers .
A number was represented by knots in the string , using a positional baserepresentation .
If the numberwas to be recorded on the string then six touching knots were placed near the free end of the string , a space was left , then eight touching knots for thes , another space , and finallytouching knots for thes .
586 on a quipu .

According to their position , the knots signified units , tens , hundreds , thousands , ten thousands and , exceptionally , hundred thousands , and they are all well aligned on their different cords as the figures that an accountant sets down , column by column , in his ledger .
For larger numbers more knot groups were used , one for each power of , in the same way as the digits of the number system we use here are occur in different positions to indicate the number of the corresponding power ofin that position .
Now it is not quite true that the same knots were used irrespective of the position as would be the case in a true positional system .
There seems only one exception , namely the unit position , where different styles of knots were used from those in the other positions .
In fact two different styles were used in the units position , one style if the unit were aand a second style if the unit were greater than one .
Both these styles differed from the standard knot used for all other positions .
The system had a zero position , for this would be represented as no knots in that position .
This meant that the spacing had to be highly regular so that zero positions would be clear .
There are many drawings and descriptions of quipus made by the Spanish invaders .
Garcilaso de la Vega , whose mother was an Inca and whose father was Spanish , wrotesee for example : - Now of course recording a number on a string would , in itself , not be that useful .
A quipu had many strings and there had to be some way that the string carrying the record of a particular number could be identified .
The primary way this was done was by the use of colour .
Numbers were recorded on strings of a particular colour to identify what that number was recording .
For example numbers of cattle might be recorded on green strings while numbers of sheep might be recorded on white strings .
The colours each had several meanings , some of which were abstract ideas , some concrete as in the cattle and sheep example .
White strings had the abstract meaning of " peace " while red strings had the abstract meaning of " war " .
As well as the colour coding , another way of distinguishing the strings was to make some strings subsidiary ones , tied to the middle of a main string rather than being tied to the main horizontal cord .
Quipu with subsidiary cords .
The ordinary judges gave a monthly account of the sentences they imposed to their superiors , and they in turn reported to their immediate superiors , and so on finally to the Inca or those of his Supreme Council .
The method of making these reports was by means of knots , made of various colours , where knots of such and such colours denote that such and such crimes had been punished .
Smaller threads attached to thicker cords were of different colours to signify the precise nature of the punishment that had been inflicted .
1179
We quote Garcilaso de la Vega again :- It was not only judges who sent quipus to be kept in a central record .
The Inca king appointed quipucamayocs , or keepers of the knots , to each town .
Larger towns might have had up to thirty quipucamayocs who were essentially government statisticians , keeping official census records of the population , records of the produce of the town , its animals and weapons .
This and other information was sent annually to the capital Cuzco .
There was even an official delivery service to take to quipus to Cuzco which consisted of relay runners who passed the quipus on to the next runner at specially constructed staging posts .
The terrain was extremely difficult yet the Incas had constructed roads to make the passing of information by quipus surprisingly rapid .
Much information on the quipus comes from a letter of the Peruvian Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala to the King of Spain , written about eighty years after the Spanish conquest of the Incas .
This remarkable letter containspages and there are several drawings which show quipus .
A fascinating aspect of one of these drawing is a picture of a counting board in the bottom left hand corner of one of them .
This is called the yupana and is presumed to be the counting board of the Incas .
This is what the yupana looked like .
It is unclear from Poma 's commentary whether it is his version of a device associated with Spanish activities analogous to those of the person depicted or whether he is implying its association with the Incas .
In either case , his commentary makes interpretation of the configuration and the meaning of the unfilled and filled holes highly speculative .

... the two together that make a pair ...
... the one together with its mate ...
... two - in reference to one thing that is divided into two parts ...
... a pair of two separate things bound intimately together , such as two bulls yoked together for ploughing ...
etc .

To see them use another kind of calculator , with maize kernels , is a perfect joy .
In order to carry out a very difficult computation for which an able computer would require pen and paper , these Indians make use of their kernels .
They place one here , three somewhere else and eight , I know not where .
They move one kernel here and there and the fact is that they are able to complete their computation without making the smallest mistake .
as a matter of fact , they are better at practical arithmetic than we are with pen and ink .
Whether this is not ingenious and whether these people are wild animals let those judge who will !
What I consider as certain is that in what they undertake to do they are superior to us .
Interpretations of how this counting board , or Peruvian abacus , might have been used have been given by several authors , see for exampleand .
However some historians are less certain that this really is a Peruvian abacus .
For examplein which the authors write :- It is a difficult task to gain further insights into the mathematical understanding of the Incas .
The bookby Urton is interesting for it examines the concept of number as understood by the Inca people .
As one might expect , their concept of number was a very concrete one , unlike our concept of number which is a highly abstract onealthough this is not really understood by many people .
The concrete way of conceiving numbers is illustrated by different words used when describing properties of numbers .
One example given inis that of even and odd numbers .
Now the ideas of an even number , say , relies on having an abstract concept of number which is independent of the objects being counted .
However , the Peruvian languages had different words which applied to different types of objects .
For example separate words occur for the idea of : - This is a fascinating topic and one which deserves much further research .
One wonders whether the Incas applied their number system to solve mathematical problems .
Was it merely for recording ?
If the yupana really was an abacus then it must have been used to solve problems and this prompts the intriguing question of what these problems were .
A tantalising glimpse may be contained in the writings of the Spanish priest José de Acosta who lived among the Incas fromto .
He writes in his bookwhich was published in Madrid in : - What a pity that de Acosta did not have the mathematical skills to give a precise description which would have allowed us to understand this method of calculation by the Incas .
Onan would be proud
Today , my little twelve year - old cousin who is staying with us for a while so his parents can " work out issues " ran into my room , his face ghostly white .
He begged me to take him to the hospital because he " tugged " on his penis too much in the shower , and was " bleeding milky stuff . "
Sigh .

Portrait of a world economy :
The outlook brightens for business leaders The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) says growth and recovery are expected in 2010 in just about all world regions .
For its 30 member countries , rich nations including the US and UK , it has more than doubled its growth forecast to 1.9 % for next year , from 0.7 % .
But the OECD warns developed nations not to expect a smooth ride .
It said growth was being " held back by still substantial headwinds " and would be " modest " for some time .
The very measures that are helping richer nations to recover pose risks to that recovery , the OECD says .
The UK , for example , needed to come up with a concrete plan to ease concerns about the stability of the public finances , it added .
The OECD said the effectiveness of the UK 's asset purchase programme - the so - called quantitative easing programme - was uncertain .
Jobless recovery ?
The main danger for rich countries is unemployment , according to the OECD 's economic outlook .
In the US , people are expected to continue to lose their jobs at a faster rate than new ones are created until sometime in the first part of next year .
For the European Union , the picture is even worse .
Unemployment may continue to rise in that region until 2011 .
A very different economic outlook is forecast for key emerging nations .
China can expect to grow by 10 % , India by more than 7 % .
The other two stand - out nations are Brazil and Russia .
The OECD expects Brazil 's economy to rebound and expand by almost 5 % after stagnating this year .
Russia is also predicted to see that kind of economic improvement next year .
But its turnaround will be even more dramatic .
This year , it has experienced one of the worst economic slumps in the world - contracting by almost 9 % .
But those four so - called Bric countries are not part of the 30 - strong OECD club .
The one member nation whose economy should perform vigorously in 2010 is also an eastern one : South Korea should rebound to grow by 4.5 % in both 2010 and 2011 , after ending this year with almost no growth .

On the other side of the equation , you believe you know the Divine will .
You claim a position of moral authority , confident that the God of love guides your judgment .
I do n’t trust that this is true .
Time and again your predecessors made decisions in the name of God that in retrospect are shameful .
A council of Christian Bishops included texts in the Bible sanctioning sexual slavery , scorched earth policies , and human sacrifice .
Catholic Bishops said that God gave kings a divine right to wealth and power .
Bishops oversaw the design of exquisite implements to torture infidels and prolong their dying .
The Church authorities sanctioned a convert - or- kill approach to Native Americans .
They endorsed the Vietnam War .
They looked the other way while thousands of children were molested by priests , confident that protecting the priesthood mattered more to God than the children ’s suffering .
They told uneducated Africans that God does n’t want them using condoms .
Church history should be a lesson in humility to us all .
Even so , you insist that this time you are right .
You are so sure God prizes every embryo that you are willing to trade on a world with more unwanted children , more women bleeding to death , more families in poverty , more extinctions , more starvation , and more desperation all around .
Not only would you make this trade , you would force it on the rest of us by making contraception and abortions illegal or financially impossible .
Please understand if I ’m not ready to cede my moral judgment to yours .
While I ’m confessing , I might as well say that my judgment differs from yours on a whole host of other issues :
-- I believe that slavery has always been evil , no matter which sacred text endorses it .
-- I believe it is immoral to bring more children into this world than we can care for .
-- Whatever God may be , I believe that putting God ’s name on human words , books and institutions is idolatry .
-- I do n’t think that burnt offerings , substitutionary atonement and incense ever fixed anything .
-- I do n’t believe that sex is dirty or virginity sacred .
-- I suspect that if I can forgive those who sin against me without making someone bleed first , any perfect god can too .
-- I think that torturing people is wrong , even if you do it for eternity .
I can speak only for myself , but I want you to know that my abortion was a profoundly moral decision .
I chose abortion because of an infection during first trimester that causes serious fetal anomalies .
My husband and I weighed the decision together .
We did n’t make it lightly .
In your framework , my decision was immoral .
But in my ethical framework , it would have been immoral for me to go through with the pregnancy I aborted .
I am ever grateful for my life - loving daughter , my abortion baby who could not be alive today had I carried that other unhealthy pregnancy to term .
How many other chosen children will not be here if you get to decide for all of us ?
There are few decisions that have greater moral impact than deciding whether to have children , when , and how many , and so I understand your attempts to intervene in our personal lives and political processes .
By forcing your priorities on the rest of us you think you are holding us to a higher standard of holiness .
I disagree .
When I was a child , I thought as a child , and I bowed to authority such as yours .
But now I am a woman .
It is my job , in community with those I love , to decide what it means for me to be a good parent , a wise steward , a loving partner , and true to my life calling .
My decisions about child bearing play a role in each of these , and so I claim them as my own .
This is a privilege and responsibility I do not relinquish to you or to anyone .

The accident happened in front of thousands of children
The accident occurred during a " test of strength " challenge to raise money for a hospital in Young , 380 km ( 235 miles ) west of the capital , Montevideo .
Contestants were pushing and pulling a train and two carriages when the vehicle gained speed and ran them over .
Local authorities have declared three days of mourning .
' State of shock '
Participants in the programme , called A Challenge to the Heart , raise funds for local charities by completing difficult tasks set by the network - in this case manoeuvring a train a certain distance down railway tracks .
The Associated Press news agency quoted Ana Portela as telling local radio station El Espectador that the train was moving when " somebody slipped and fell under the locomotive , and others were falling alongside it .
" There were shouts and somebody said ' my arm ! ' "
Ms Portela said .
" Everybody was in a state of shock . "
Graciela Baccino , a spokeswoman for Channel 10 television , said the tragedy was " deeply saddening " .
She said the TV network offered its " solidarity and support " to the families involved .
About 3,000 schoolchildren were at the recording and witnessed the accident .
