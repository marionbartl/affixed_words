28 - Aug-2009 ( Fri ) Wherein Twestival screw us over with their egregious unprofessionalism .
Wherein Twestival screw us over with their egregious unprofessionalism .
As you might imagine , we do business with a lot of promoters who are amazingly flaky , inconsiderate , and otherwise unprofessional .
It appears to be par for course in this line of work .
Normally I would n't bother calling one of them out , because it 's just so common , but this latest one is so egregiously unprofessional , and cost us so much time and money , that it deserves special mention and ridicule .
There 's this group called " Twestival " whose gimmick seems to be throwing simultaneous events announced on Twitter , and raising some money for charities .
I 'm told they 've done this before in SF , and got a decent turnout .
They approached us in July and I gave them a quote for a date in September .
They could n't decide which date they wanted , and we ended up changing the date we had on hold for them three different times -- including rescheduling another promoter 's event so that we could give Twestival the date they preferred .
They wanted to meet in person and do a walk - through of the club , as first - time promoters usually do .
Our first warning sign : they could n't manage to actually show up when they said they would .
They asked to stop by on a Wednesday at noon , then at 9 AM on that day emailed us to say " we ca n't make it until Friday " .
We rescheduled for Friday .
Then on Friday , they just did n't show up .
No explanation .
No phone call .
And ( eventually ) barely an apology , by email , a week later .
Still , it sounded like it could be a profitable event , so we did n't give up on them yet .
We sent a contract , and asked for a deposit .
Months went by .
A few times they asked when they could stop by to drop off the deposit , but never actually did so .
We emailed and called them at least a couple times a week and got no response at all .
I even asked a friend who works at Twitter to try to contact them , since they seem to have some vague affiliation .
Nothing .
Then today , I got this !

Subject : TwestivalSF Venue Change
Dear Jamie !
We are excited about a few new announcements that you may have not gotten sooner ... please take note of the last most important announcement :-) [... two paragraphs of random hype elided ...]
Last but not least , we have a venue location change ....
The new location will be at [ some other venue ] .com full details will be announced on the blog over the weekend .
As part of behind the scenes of Twestival , we wanted you to be the first to know and PLEASE tweet it out !
We want to make sure that everyone is aware of this change !
Best regards ,
Your TwestivalSF Team

Note that that 's not even a message to DNA Lounge telling us that they no longer want the date we have on hold for them .
That 's a message to their announcements mailing list , to which they seem to have added us , encouraging us to tell everyone about the great new venue they 've found .
Does that sound like an apology for wasting our time to you ?
No , it does n't to me either .
So as a result of them having jerked us around for so long , now we have an empty night to fill on Fri Sep 11 , just two weeks from now .
This is way too short notice to arrange anything , especially with most of the city 's reliable promoters heading to Burning Man next week , so chances are we 'll be closed on that Friday .
So thanks to Twestival 's rudeness and unprofessionalism , we 're going to be closed on a Friday night .
It 's fair to say that they just cost us at least $ 5,000 .
Do n't do business with these people .
Tell your friends .
And hey , for extra irony , use Twitter to do it .
Eat a balanced diet , containing foods from all the good groups , especially fruits and vegetables .
There – for the vast majority of people that is all the diet advice that you need for overall health .
Get regular exercise , do n’t smoke , maintain a healthy weight , and have good sleep habits – now we have covered most lifestyle risk factors .
If people followed this basic advice they would significantly reduce their risk of the most common diseases and disorders .
Often , however , I meet or hear people who add unneeded complexity to what it means to have a healthy lifestyle , even while simultaneously ignoring more basic advice .
I ca n’t tell you how many patients I have who spend hundreds of dollars a month on useless supplements while they still smoke .
The media , weight - loss , and supplement industries are no help .
They offer a constant barrage of complex , often conflicting , misleading , or downright false health information .
Meanwhile , many people have lost sight of the basics .
Dieting for weight loss is the same .
Everyone wants to know the secret to maintaining a thinner waistline .
Low - carb diets have been all the rage for at least a decade , despite the fact that they do n’t work .
What does work is calorie control and exercise – eat a balanced diet in moderation and get regular exercise .
Not always easy , but at least it is simple .
( Again – this is for most people .
Certain health conditions do require special diets . )
The major problem with most diet plans is that they are restrictive .
They generally focus on good foods vs bad foods and counsel elimination of the “ bad ” foods from the diet .
This makes it more difficult to get a well - balanced diet , and also reduces compliance .
Most such plans will produce short - term weight loss from calorie reduction , but long - term failure .
Ninety - five percent of people who go on a diet to lose weight will regain all of their short term losses within a year or two .
A recent study also suggests that low - carb diets may increase vascular risk .
Researchers fed mice their regular diet , a western diet high in fat , and a low - carb / high protein diet .
They found that the high fat diet had a 9 % increase in atherosclerosis ( clogging of the arteries ) while the low carb diet had a 15 % increase .
Of course , this is an animal study so translation to humans is not clear .
And it was a single study and needs replication .
Prior studies have shown that low carb diets do not increase cholesterol levels , probably because short - term weight loss offsets any adverse effect from having higher fat content , but this is still not clear .
What we need are long term studies in humans .
This animal data is preliminary , but suggests that there is a potential problem and further research is warranted , especially given the popularity of low - carb diets .
This study highlights the fact that restrictive diets may have unintended consequences .
Humans are omnivores and we are dependent upon a varied diet .
There is a principle in medical research known as the “ intention to treat ” model .
What this means is that two or more treatment strategies are compared based upon as close to real - life experience as possible and the intention to treat with one or the other .
Treatment A may be superior to treatment B in a carefully controlled clinical trial , but if in the real world compliance with treatment A is low because it is complex and unpleasant , while treatment B is cheap and simple , B may yield the best statistical outcomes .
With regard to specific patients I often tell my students that you have to make sure you do n’t overwhelm them with details and with a complex regimen .
Often the more important basics are lost in the complexity of fine - tuning .
This is also part of the individualization of medicine – some patients can tolerate more complexity than others .
A hectic executive , for example , may not be able to take a middle - of - the - day dose of medication .
What all this means , in my opinion , is that we need more public health education focusing on the basics – those things that are easy for most people to do that will have the biggest health benefit .
In terms of diet – eating a balanced diet in moderation with plenty of fruits and vegetables is what most people need to focus on .
前回 に引き続 き 、Windows税（またの名 をMicrosoft税）ネタです。
Danish FreeBSD Dev. Sues Lenovo Over " Microsoft Tax " によると、デンマーク のFreeBSD開発者がLenovoが返還に応じないので、訴えることにしたそうです。 実はこの開発者というのは、 phkのことで、 FreeBSDはもちろんのこと、数多くのフリーソフトウェア・プロジェクトに貢献してきた方です。
最近だと、よく知られているのは Varnish あたりでしょうか 。
ちなみに、彼の主張によると、
私には、EUにおける判例が個々の国の裁判にどれだけの影響力があるのかわかりません。
しかしそれ以外の主張は大変真っ当であるように感じます。
特に、競合相手に無意味にお金を払うことを強制されるのがおかしい、というのは全くその通りでしょう。
はっきり言って、自殺行為ですからね。
さて、/.のコメントで興味深いものがあったので簡単に紹介しておきます。
この種の議論になると、Windows税擁護派は、頻繁に他の業界でバンドルされている例を持ち出して、部分的な返還は不可だと主張しますが、
それは違うよって話です。
長いので、要約してしまいますが、最初のコメントは自動車の座席だけ払い戻しさせられるかという、よくあるタイプのものです。
全部で一つのプロダクトなんだから、そんなことできるわけがない、と。
それに対して、自動車の座席には独立した契約（「この座席を利用するには、以下の条項に同意しなければなりません。同意しない場合は...」）なんかないという反論がありました。 ご存知の通り、Windowsにはそういう契約、所謂EULAがあります。
もしも払い戻しが受けられないならば、独立した製品が同定できず、EULAの対象を特定できないと言っているわけですから、EULAは無効になるそうです。
つまり、EULAが有効であるためには、払い戻しをするしかなく、EULAが無効であるならば、払い戻しはない代わりに、EULAで定められた条件が全く適用されなくなります（例えば、私的利用のために何台にコピーをインストールしても構わない）。
Pared - down summit will force heads of rich states to listen to those of third world in hope of kickstarting radical action
The United Nations is planning a form of diplomatic shock therapy for world leaders this week in the hope of injecting badly needed urgency into negotiations for a climate change treaty that , it is now widely acknowledged , are dangerously adrift .
UN chief Ban Ki-Moon and negotiators say that unless they can convert world leaders into committed advocates of radical action , it will be very hard to reach a credible and enforceable agreement to avoid the most devastating consequences of climate change .
As the digital counter ticking off the hours to the Copenhagen summit – which had been supposed to seal the deal on climate change – hit 77 days today , progress at the UN summit in New York is seen as vital .
Nearly 100 heads of state and government are to attend the summit , for which a pared - down format has been devised .
" We need these leaders to go outside their usual comfort zones , " said one diplomat .
" Our sense is that leaders have got a little too cosy and comfortable .
They really have to hear from countries that are vulnerable and suffering . "
Rajendra Pachauri , head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which won the Nobel peace prize with Al Gore , agreed .
Commenting on the leaders attending the G20 summit in Pittsburgh next week , he said : " We need to remind these people about impacts of climate change – the fact that they are inequitable and fall very heavily on some of the poorest people in the world .
We are likely to see a large number of failed states if we do n't act in time . "
The heads of state attending the UN summit are to be stripped of their entourages .
Each will be allowed just one aide , generally their country 's environment minister , in the sessions .
Instead of set - piece speeches , leaders will be paired off to chair discussion groups .
Britain will be with Guyana , Tuvalu with the Netherlands , and Mongolia with the European commission .
The leaders will also lunch with environmental activists and chief executives of corporations who have been pressing their governments for action .
At dinner , the leaders of the biggest polluting countries will dine with the leaders of Bangladesh , Kiribati and Costa Rica – which are among the primary victims of climate change .
By the end of the day , the rationale goes , the leaders will be imbued with a new sense of purpose .
Leaders of rich countries will have been galvanised to take on the big emissions cuts – 25 - 40 % over the next decade , 80 % by 2050 – needed to keep temperatures from rising more than two degrees above pre-industrial levels , the temperature set by science to avoid the most calamitous effects of climate change .
The leaders will also , it is hoped , have some understanding of the threat to poorer countries .
And , at the very least , they will have more of a common purpose in tackling the problem .
" We need to gather together .
We do n't want to blame or point fingers at each other , " said Yaqoub al - Sanada , counsellor at the Kuwaiti mission to the UN .
Kuwait – one of the biggest producers of oil – will co-chair a discussion session with Finland .
The UN is hoping for help from Barack Obama .
The US president will speak at the session , and there is anticipation he will deliver a strong signal that America is committed to action .
There is growing anxiety for those kinds of reassurances , especially as opposition to Obama 's green agenda grows in Congress .
" The first question I get any time I meet with anybody is , ' Where 's the legislation ?
How 's it going ? ' , " Todd Stern , the State Department 's climate change envoy , said .
There are also reports that China 's president , Hu Jintao , in his first appearance at the UN , will announce new commitments to curb pollution – the kind of signal that will be crucial to boost negotiations in the days leading up to Copenhagen .
" We can get a successful outcome from Copenhagen .
It is achievable , but at the moment it's in the balance , " said John Ashton , Britain 's climate change envoy .
" We need to close the gaps . "
Those gaps grew over the summer .
There is what Ashton called the " ambition gap " – the failure of leaders of the big polluting countries to sign on to the deep emissions cuts needed .
Then there is the " finance gap " – the failure of industrialised states to come up with a package on how to compensate poor countries that will suffer the most devastating consequences .
Britain came forward last June with an estimate of £ 61bn a year by 2020 .
Negotiators are frustrated that major industrialised states have not set clear figures on how much they are willing to commit , or how they will provide the funding .
Some climate change experts and negotiators have already begun planning a fallback position should the December Copenhagen summit fail to produce a strong enough agreement .
In Washington , Obama administration officials now talk openly about negotiating beyond Copenhagen .
" Let 's not make that one particular time the be-all and end - all , and say that if it does n't happen we are doomed , " Steven Chu , the energy secretary , told reporters .
Thinktanks are already starting to work on what is being called " Plan B " – scenarios for how the world could come up with an action plan before it is too late .
But some are not holding their breath .
" It seems to me that Copenhagen is not the end of this , " said Tim Wirth , the president of the UN Foundation , and the man who , in the 1980s , helped to write the first cap - and - trade plan for acid rain .
He added : " We are going to have Copenhagens for the rest of our lives . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Beginning Saturday , many air travelers will be asked their birth dates and genders when making airline reservations .
The new travel rules are the latest " visible " expansion of the Secure Flight program .
It 's the latest " publicly visible " expansion of Secure Flight , a program that transfers responsibility for checking air passengers ' identities from the airlines to the federal government , the Transportation Security Administration said .
The change keeps the agency on track to assume responsibility for ID checks on all domestic flights by early next year , according to the TSA .
Currently , the airlines check passenger identifications against lists of suspected terrorists .
But the 9/11 Commission said the job was better suited for the federal government , which compiles the " terror watch lists . "
Government control increases security , according to the TSA , while reducing the number of instances in which innocent people are mistakenly confused with possible terrorists having similar or identical names .
In May , the federal government began the first public phase of " Secure Flight " when four small airlines began asking passengers to provide their names , as the names appeared on the government - issued IDs they would be traveling with , when making reservations .
Since then , additional airlines have begun asking for full names , TSA spokeswoman Sterling Payne said , though she declined to say how many airlines are participating for security reasons .
The new change requires travelers to provide three pieces of information when making reservations : the passenger 's full name as it appears on the government - issued ID they will be using , their birth date and their gender .
The airline will transmit that information to the TSA , which will compare it to a " no - fly " list of people prohibited from flying or a list of " selectees " who can fly after they pass additional physical screening .
If passengers are not asked for this addition information , they should not be concerned , as it will not affect their travel , the agency said .
Early efforts to create the Secure Flight program were beset by problems , including program delays and complaints of privacy breaches .
Finally , in 2006 , after the TSA spent more than $ 130 million and four years on the system , then - TSA Director Kip Hawley ordered a complete overhaul of the program and dropped plans to check passengers ' names against commercial databases , one of the most contentious features of the program .
" Secure Flight is a key tool in confirming that someone identified as a ' No Fly ' does not receive a boarding pass , " TSA acting Administrator Gale Rossides said in a statement Wednesday .
" Secure Flight will make travel safer and easier for passengers . "
The TSA says it plans to vet 100 percent of passengers on all domestic commercial flights by early next year and 100 percent of passengers on all international commercial flights by the end of 2010 .

WASHINGTON 
On the agenda is the revamping of the American health care system , possibly the most complex legislation in modern history .
But on the table , in a conference room where the bill is being hashed out by six senators , the snacks are anything but healthy .
Last week , there were chippers  chocolate - covered potato chips  described on a sign as “ North Dakota Diet Food . ”
More often , there are Doritos , pretzels , Oreo cookies and beef jerky : fuel to get through hours of talks on topics like the actuarial values of private insurance plans or the cost - sharing provisions of Medicare .
The fate of the health care overhaul largely rests on the shoulders of six senators who since June 17 have gathered  often twice a day , and for many hours at a stretch  in a conference room with burnt sienna walls , in the office of the Senate Finance Committee chairman , Max Baucus , Democrat of Montana .
President Obama and Congressional leaders agree that if a bipartisan deal can be forged on health care , it will emerge from this conference room , with a huge map of Montana on one wall and photos of Mike Mansfield , the Montanan who was the longest - serving Senate majority leader , on the other .
Facebook is cooperating with the secret service investigation
The US Secret Service is investigating a poll posted on social networking site Facebook , asking people if they thought President Obama " should be killed " .
The poll , posted on Saturday , was taken off the site as soon as the company was made aware of it .
It was put up on the site using a third - party application that was unconnected with the social networking site itself .
US officials said they would take " the appropriate investigative steps " .
The poll , described by Facebook as " offensive " , asked respondents " Should Obama be killed ? " and offered four possible responses : " No " , " Maybe " , " Yes " , and " Yes if he cuts my health care " .
Like any threat to the US president 's life , the poll is being studied by the US Secret Service , which is charged with protecting the president .
" We take ... these things seriously , " said Darrin Blackford , a Secret Service spokesman .
The social networking site said it would co-operate with the investigation .
" We 're working with the US Secret Service , but they 'll need to provide any details of their investigation , " said Barry Schnitt , Facebook 's spokesman for policy .
Many , like Ruiz Hot -Dogs on Sixth Avenue , work step - side carts with two - item menus of Sonoran hot dogs and soft drinks .
Set in dirt and gravel parking lots , beneath makeshift shelters , under mesquite tree arbors , these peripatetic vendors serve fast food for day laborers , craftsmen and policemen , the typical patrons of traditional hot dog stands in any town .
Other champions of the Sonoran style , like El Güero Canelo , with two Tucson outlets , have evolved from carts into full - scale restaurants .
( At the Twelfth Avenue location , two of the three spaces where burritos , tacos and hot dogs are cooked and assembled remain on wheels , but the prospect of mobility is now far - fetched . )
Image THE SONORAN WAY Ruiz Hot -Dogs in Tucson is fine by Luis Galindo .
Credit ... Chris Hinkle for The New York Times
One Sunday afternoon , as a mariachi band played , an after - church crowd , half Anglo and half Hispanic , thronged El Güero ’s outdoor dining pavilion .
Babies cried .
Teenagers table - hopped .
And parents argued that , rather than order a second hot dog , children should fill up at the salsa bar at the back of the pavilion , stocked with peeled cucumbers , sliced radishes and chunky guacamole .
Front and center on every third table was a Sonoran hot dog .
For at least the last 40 years , likely longer , borderland vendors , in Tucson and elsewhere , have been refashioning the hot dog with a cloak of bacon , a clump of beans and a chop of tomatoes and onions , followed by squirts of mayonnaise , mustard and salsa verde .
( Ketchup and other condiments show up , too .
More recently , some vendors have begun offering a topping of crumbled potato chips . )

Advertisement Thousands of angry protesters have clashed with police after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner of Iran 's presidential poll .
Secret police have been attacked , while riot police used batons and tear gas against backers of Mir Hossein Mousavi , who called the results a " charade " .
Correspondents say the violence is the worst seen in Tehran in a decade .
In a televised address to the nation , Mr Ahmadinejad thanked voters for giving him a " great victory " .
He said the election had been " completely free " .
Meanwhile , Mr Mousavi urged his supporters to avoid violence , reports the AFP news agency .
John Simpson
Reporting from Tehran
A crowd of about 3,000 attacked the police , some of whom were on motorbikes , which they set on fire .
The sky was thick with black smoke .
Police attacked the crowd with sticks and maybe teargas .
I did n't expect to see people turning on the secret police .
We were filming when we were surrounded by angry secret policemen .
The crowd turned on them and chased them off .
I suspect we are not looking at a revolution but there is serious anger .
It all depends on how the government responds - if they use violence , that could inflame the situation .
In quotes : Reaction to result " The violations in the election are very serious and you are right to be deeply hurt , " he said in a statement on his website .
" But I firmly call on you not to subject any individual or groups to hurt . "
The official results gave Mr Ahmadinejad 63 % of the vote against 34 % for Mr Mousavi .
Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised the high turnout of 85 % , described the count as a " real celebration " and called for calm .
" Enemies may want to spoil the sweetness of this event ... with some kind of ill - intentioned provocations , " the ayatollah said .
Mr Mousavi 's supporters said the election had been stolen and vowed to seek a re-run .
But observers say this will have little chance of success .
Some of the protesters in Tehran wore Mr Mousavi 's campaign colour of green and chanted " Down with the dictator " , news agencies report .
Four police motorbikes were set on fire near the interior ministry , where votes had been counted , the BBC's John Simpson in Tehran says .
Interior Minister Sadeq Mahsouli warned that any demonstrations needed official permission , and none had been given .
One opposition newspaper has been closed down and BBC websites also appear to have been blocked by the Iranian authorities .
The AP news agency reports that mobile phone services have been blocked in Tehran .
Mr Mousavi was hoping to prevent Mr Ahmadinejad winning more than 50 % of the vote , in order to force a run-off election .
Danger of ' tyranny '
Mr Ahmadinejad said the world , especially the Western media , had waged a campaign of " psychological warfare " against the people of Iran during the election .

" It was clear what the majority of people wanted , " he said .
He said the people of Iran wanted justice , development , an end to corruption and for their country 's name to be respected .
But Mr Mousavi , a former prime minister , said : " I personally strongly protest the many obvious violations and I 'm warning I will not surrender to this dangerous charade .
" The result of such performance by some officials will jeopardise the pillars of the Islamic Republic and will establish tyranny . "
IRANIAN ELECTION Mahmoud Ahmadinejad : 62.6 % Mir Hossein Mousavi : 33.8 % Mohsen Rezai : 1.7 % Mehdi Karroubi 0.9 % Turnout : 85 % Source : Interior ministry
In pictures : Election clashes Tension looms after Iran result Iran poll result : Your comments Send us your comments Mr Mousavi had said there was a shortage of ballot papers and alleged that millions of people had been denied the right to vote .
His election monitors were not allowed enough access to polling stations , he added .
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says the result has been greeted with surprise and with deep scepticism by many Iranians .
The figures , if they are to be believed , show Mr Ahmadinejad winning strongly even in the heartland of Mr Mousavi .
The scale of Mr Ahmadinejad 's win means that many people who voted for a reformist candidate in the previous presidential election four years ago have apparently switched their votes to Mr Ahmadinejad , he adds .
However , the president does enjoy the support of many of the urban poor and rural dwellers .
" I am happy that my candidate has won - he helps the poor and he catches the thieves , " sandwich seller Kamra Mohammadi , 22 , told AFP .
Mr Mousavi gains much of his support from the middle classes and the educated urban population .
Surge of interest BBC Iranian affairs analyst Sadeq Saba says the result means that hope for peaceful reform in Iran may die for a long time .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's supporters have been celebrating the result
There had been a surge of interest in Iran 's presidential election , with unprecedented live television debates between the candidates and rallies attended by thousands .
There were long queues at polling stations on Friday , with turnout reaching 85 % .
Four candidates contested the election , with Mohsen Razai and Mehdi Karroubi only registering about 1 % of the vote each .
Iran is ruled under a system known as Velayat-e Faqih , or " Rule by the Supreme Jurist " , who is currently Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
It was adopted by an overwhelming majority in 1979 following the Islamic revolution which overthrew the autocratic Western - backed Shah .
But the constitution also stipulates that the people are the source of power and the country holds phased presidential and parliamentary elections every four years .
All candidates are vetted by the powerful conservative - controlled Guardian Council , which also has the power to veto legislation it deems inconsistent with revolutionary principles .

Wall Street gossips tell us that Apple ( AAPL ) executives have dropped hints suggesting the company is considering creating a service that would allow iTunes Store account holders to use those accounts to make purchases on participating third - party sites across the Internet .
Remember , this is Wall Street gossip and not confirmed news .
But you want to be in the loop , right ?
Anyway , such a service would make Apple a direct competitor to eBay 's PayPal ( EBAY ) and Facebook 's still - in - testing , rumored - to - be - huge " Pay With Facebook " platform .
i Phone users can already use their iTunes accounts to buy some virtual and subscription goods in third - party iPhone applications .
That service charges developers 30 % per transaction though .
For a PayPal rival from Apple to take off on the rest of the Internet -- from Amazon.com to www.PipersKiltOfInwood.com, that cut would have to come way down .
Another reason we 're skeptical that these plans will come to fruition , is that generally , Apple only comes out with products that help it drive hardware sales .
We came up with two theories as to how to address this problem :
Our gossiper specifically said it was not discussed , but maybe this is Apple 's first step toward becoming a way for people to pay for goods offline .
As consumers , we 'd love this .
No more waiting for the bartender to ring you up !
Maybe Apple sees PayPal for what is : an unwieldy clunker of a service that missed its chance .
Maybe Apple sees the online payments business as low - hanging fruit -- an easy way to diversify its business .
Apple computer sales growth has slowed a bit , and executives may worry the company depends too much on its iPhone / iPod biz .
Or both ideas could be wrong , along with our gossiper -- who is , after all , a gossiper .
We 're hoping he 's not , if only because we 'd relish a new , meaningful competition over something besides search .
A battle between eBay , Apple , and Facebook over payments could prime innovation and help develop non-ad - supported businesses on the Internet .
Increasingly , it 's looking like President Obama 's biggest headaches may be coming from the left as much as they are from the right .
That 's clearly seen in the revolt among progressives in the House over the White House 's apparent dumping of the public option in health care .
It 's now somewhat obvious in the revelation of who was behind the now - famous Obama - as - Heath Ledger / Joker poster caricature that has swept the Internet in recent weeks .
The charge has been put forward -- most strongly in a lengthy Washington Post article -- that the image is essentially racist .
Of course , it 's not just the design that has gotten many people upset .
It 's the marriage of the design with the stark " SOCIALISM " word below the picture .
But the designer , Firas Alktaheeb , is actually a Chicagoan -- yep , the president 's own homeboy -- whose criticisms of Obama are hardly hard - core right - wing :
" After Obama was elected , you had all of these people who basically saw him as the second coming of Christ , " Alkhateeb said .
" From my perspective , there was n't much substance to him . "
" I abstained from voting in November , " he wrote in an e-mail .
" Living in Illinois , my vote means close to nothing as there was no chance Obama would not win the state . "
If he had to choose a politician to support , Alkhateeb said , it would be Ohio Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich .
That would be the same Kucinich who was a founding member of the House Out of Iraq Caucus and who ran an ill - fated presidential campaign as the farthest left candidate in the race .
Actually , the only area where Alkhateeb gives Obama high marks is in his handling of foreign policy .
It 's not exactly fair to stereotype , but perhaps the overly creative nature of the design -- initially a rather ornate Photoshop melding of a Time magazine cover of Obama with a made - up Heath Ledger -- should have been a strong clue to its ideological origins .
It 's not to say that conservatives do n't indulge in electronic graffiti of this nature .
Some do .
But this type of strike against the dominant cultural theme usually comes from the left -- regardless of who is in power .
After all , " Hey , hey , LBJ , how many kids did you kill today ? " was not a chant crafted by conservative middle - class kids in the heartland .
Once again , for another Democratic president , if he does n't take care to keep an eye on his left , the joke will be on him .

( CNN ) -- With Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's resignation this weekend , she will leave behind many of the problems and frustrations she has had running the state .
A dismissed claim called Sarah Palin 's wearing of an Arctic Cat logo at a snowmobile race a conflict of interest .
But she will have to continue to deal with one of her biggest complaints : the series of ethics accusations lodged against her that will follow her after she leaves office .
Since her bombshell resignation announcement , several new ethics complaints have been filed with state authorities , including one saying that she should not be able to claim per diem funds when she stays at her Wasilla , Alaska , home instead of Anchorage or Juneau , where she has offices .
The governor 's mansion is in Juneau .
At issue is a contention that she was charging the state when she stayed in Wasilla and commuted to her offices .
Just this week , a complaint was filed alleging Palin failed to submit completed and signed gift disclosure forms .
Palin says she is the target of the " politics of personal destruction , " as she and some staff members face about 20 filings regarding allegations of ethics violations .
" It does n't cost the critics anything to file frivolous lawsuits or ethics violation charges .
It costs our state such a great deal -- thousands of staff hours , millions of dollars in public resources that are n't going to things that it should be going to , " Palin told CNN earlier this month .
" We have n't violated the ethics code . "
A preliminary report by an independent investigator said a legal defense fund set up by Palin supporters may have violated state ethics laws because it was billed as the official fund .
The report , a copy of which CNN obtained this week , recommended the outgoing governor refuse money from the fund and ask the state to pay legal fees for ethics complaints that were dismissed .
" I find the notion that I have taken any action pertaining to the legal defense fund misguided and factually in error , " Palin said in a statement this week .
" I have not ' acted ' relative to the defense fund and it is misleading to say I have . "
The pressure and financial cost of such ethics investigations are a major reason cited by the governor in her decision not to finish her term .
She said her family is facing more than $ 500,000 in legal fees and has set up a legal defense fund to help defray the costs .
Many of the complaints filed against Palin or her staff have been dismissed .
On Friday , the Alaska Personnel Board dismissed a complaint accusing Palin of violating the Ethics Act by receiving her salary while campaigning for vice president .
Palin last month reimbursed the state more than $ 8,000 for travel expenses for nine trips , accompanied by her children , after the state paid for them .
Another inquiry led to some new ethics training for a staff member .
In all , state officials say they have spent $ 1,963,840 to answer records requests from the ethics filings and to respond in other ways to them .
Records show that since January 1 , 2008 , the state has spent $ 296,043 on such investigations .
The inquiry that cost the most and drew the most attention was centered on whether Palin inappropriately fired the state 's director of public safety .
This complaint had been filed weeks before Palin 's run for vice president .
The public safety director said he was let go because of his refusal to fire a state trooper who was Palin 's former brother - in - law and was locked in a bitter divorce and custody battle with the governor 's sister .
Palin and her supporters said he was let go because the director was insubordinate .
An independent investigator found that she had a right to fire him , but in doing so had violated a state ethics law .
The investigation also found that she had abused the powers of her office by pressuring employees to get the trooper fired .
Although the governor and her supporters have criticized the investigations , Andree McLeod , who has filed six complaints against Palin , thinks they are appropriate .
" I do n't really care what other people think .
I am holding the governor accountable .
Other people 's ignorance is not going to stymie me , " McLeod told CNN , surrounded by stacks of state documents she has collected from filing information requests and ethics complaints .
" I am exercising my right to get these public records to discover what Sarah Palin is up to , " she said .
McLeod , a registered Republican , has filed several complaints since Palin announced her decision to step down , including the one regarding gift disclosures .
She has also filed two lawsuits , including one regarding whether it was appropriate for state business to be discussed using private e-mail addresses .
When ethics complaints are filed against the governor or her staff , the state has to hire an independent counsel to investigate the claims to avoid a conflict of interest .
Among other claims against Palin cite her wearing an Arctic Cat logo on a piece of clothing during a snowmobile race as a conflict of interest and another saying that an interview she did after the presidential election in her state office was inappropriate .
Those were dismissed .
James Muller , a political science professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage , told CNN that , " Some of [ the complaints against Palin ] are clearly fanciful , farcical .
" I think most of these ethical complaints are trivial .
Almost all have been dismissed by the various levels of review that have taken them on , " Muller said .
Any filings already in process before she leaves office will be concluded , and state law allows complaints to be filed even after her resignation .
Palin had signed a law making it easier to file such complaints .
" She 'd been pushing for that even before she was governor .
To have it used in this way , to have it abused in the manner that it was , is shameful .
It 's much like the boy who cried ' wolf , ' " Thomas Van Flein , Palin 's attorney , told CNN .

This is a bit of a long but very interesting subject so if you 've never read about ( re ) constructed languages you might want to grab a coffee or something before you read this post .
First a bit of background before the main subject :
The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century was a very interesting time for what are known as International Auxiliary Languages ( IALs ) .
This was a time before the advent of World War II , when French was still in a very dominant political and diplomatic position , but at the same time other languages were also quite powerful in their own right , namely English , German , and Russian , and Latin was still known by a number of people .
Without a clear victor at the time there was a kind of linguistic deadlock , and a large number of people were motivated by the linguistic situation to create languages that were based on the major languages of the time but with a grammar easy enough for anyone to learn in a short period of time , in order to provide a universal second language that would ensure linguistic neutrality .
Volapük was one of the first , later on came Esperanto ( still the most widely used constructed language today ) , then the language Ido as a reform of Esperanto , and Latino sine Flexione ( a simplified version of Latin ) was also fairly popular at the time as well .
Other languages were created later but this time before WWI and just after seems to have been the time when these languages had the most success , not just in establishing a linguistic community but politically as well .
In 1908 for example there was a fairly large push to make the tiny territory of Neutral Moresnet between Belgium and Germany into the first Esperanto - speaking nation called Amikejo , and there was even a proposal in 1920 to make Esperanto the working language of the League of Nations :
In the early 1920s , there was a proposal for the League of Nations to accept Esperanto as their working language .
Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against , the French delegate , Gabriel Hanotaux .
Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language and saw Esperanto as a threat .

Who were the original Indo - Europeans , and when and where did they live ?
Since they left no written documents or artifacts of any kind , our only recourse is to attempt to reconstruct their language .
If we assume that a word that is similar in most of the Indo - European languages designates a concept that existed in the original Indo - European society , and that , conversely , a word that varies in most Indo - European languages designates a concept not discovered until later , we may draw certain tentative conclusions .

Proto - Indo - European has been reconstructed in the past two centuries ( more or less successfully ) by hundreds of linguists , having obtained a rough phonological , morphological , and syntactical system , equivalent to what Jews had of Old Hebrew before reconstructing a system for its modern use in Israel .
Instead of some inscriptions and oral transmitted tales for the language to be revived , we have a complete reconstructed grammatical system , as well as hundreds of living languages to be used as examples to revive a common Modern Indo-European .

" What happened was that I found in the glossary to C. L. Wrenn 's edition of the poem the Old English word meaning " to suffer , " the word þolian ; and although at first it looked completely strange with its thorn symbol instead of the familiar th , I gradually realized that it was not strange at all ; for it was the word that older and less educated people would have used in the country where I grew up .
" They 'll just have to learn to thole , " my aunt would say about some family who had suffered an unforeseen bereavement .
And now suddenly here was " thole " in the official textual world , mediated through the apparatus of a scholarly edition , a little bleeper to remind me that my aunt 's language was not just a self - enclosed family possession but an historical heritage , one that involved the journey þolian had made north into Scotland and then across into Ulster with the planters and then across from the planters to the locals who had originally spoken Irish and then farther across again when the Schots Irish emigrated to the American South in the eghteenth century .
When I read in John Crowe Ransom the line " Sweet ladies , long may ye bloom , and toughly I hope ye may thole , " my heart lifted again , the world widened , something was furthered .
The far - flungness of the word , the phenomenological pleasure of finding it variously fransformed by Ransom 's modernity and Beowulf 's venerability made me feel vaguely something for which again I only found the words years later .
What I was experiencing as I kept meeting up with thole on its multicultural odyssey was the feeling which Osip Mandelstam once defined as " nostalgie for world culture . "
And this was a nostalgia I did n't even know I suffered until I experienced its fulfilment in this little epiphany .

At the same time the language Ido as well had some fairly large conferences of a size it has yet to achieve again , such as this one in 1922 in Dessau , Germany : For comparison , Ido 's yearly conferences now attract about 15 to 25 people .
After this , everything went downhill for IALs .
The 1930s came about , Hitler and Stalin murdered a large number of Esperantists ( Esperanto 's creator was Jewish and Hitler saw the language as a threat to unite the Jewish diaspora ) , World War II started , millions died , after WWII ended the Cold War began and communication between parts of Europe became impossible , and at the same time English was becoming stronger and stronger thanks to the United States , and thus there was little perceived need for a universal language .
IALs continue to be created and promoted to this day ( interesting recent arrivals over the past few years include Lingua Franca Nova and Sambahsa ) , but the fate of the IAL movement remains unclear .
One interesting thing happened during this time , however , as one previously morbund language did achieve a startling success in making itself into a common tongue for people of different linguistic backgrounds : Hebrew .
Hebrew had for a very long time simply been a liturgical language , and Jews used other languages like Yiddish , Ladino , Russian and Polish as a mother tongue .
But thanks in large part to Eliezer Ben - Yehuda the Hebrew language was modernized and revived , his son became the first native Hebrew speaker in some fifteen centuries , and the Hebrew revival movement continued to gain momentum .
Finally , in 1948 the state of Israel was established , the language became an official language of the state , and now it 's a thriving language with over 7 million speakers .
There is debate over whether this purposeful modernization and revival of Hebrew makes it a constructed language or not ( so depending on the definition of a constructed language it could be called one ) , but the philosophy upon which it was brought back to life differs from the major IALs in that it was a cultural and religious revival as well , and that there was no attempt to make the language as easy as possible to learn ; authenticity was given precedence over ease .
Thus it is more of aandlanguage than simply a constructed one .
Also note that Esperanto and other IALs had been around for quite some time during the revival of Hebrew and the establishment of the state of Israel , but in spite of their simplicity they were not chosen .
Perhaps the idea of a language without any grammatical irregularities or one lacking an established culture seemed too unnatural .
J.R.R.
Tolkien was also of the opinion that languages like Esperanto were doomed because they had no history or mythology behind them , nothing beyond the language itself and the people that used it .
So perhaps the only reason IALs have yet to succeed is that people simply have a visceral negative reaction to them , and this reaction comes from the idea of a language without its own history and mythology .
Some say that these languages have n't succeeded because the population that uses it is so small that they 're nearly useless in practical terms , but if this were the only factor in choosing to learn a language then Hebrew never would have gotten off the ground in the first place with a Jewish diaspora already speaking much more influential languages like Russian , German , English and Spanish , and with Israel being surrounded by Arabic on all sides ... and yet it has managed to succeed .
The use of Latin as a modern language is similar to the philosophy behind Hebrew in a way , as it involves a reconstruction of an early form ( classical Latin with Roman pronunciation , like the hardfor example ) of the language , accompanied by new modern terminology ( for byte , for bug , for login ) in order to make it as functional and useful as possible .
But then again , in spite of Latin 's history as a lingua franca it 's still the ancestor of the Romance languages alone , a single branch of the Indo - European language family .
Why not think big and reconstruct the common ancestor to every Indo - European language instead ?
Instead of reviving a language that is the ancestor of languages spoken in these countries :
We 're talking about the language that is the ancestor of languages used in these countries :
That 's the concept behind the reconstruction of the Proto - Indo - European language , a language that is believed to have been spoken around 3000 BC to 2500 BC , at least two millenia before Latin began to achieve any sort of prominence .
The theory goes that a few centuries later this language eventually evolved into different languages , which eventually became the ancestors of various language families , and these eventually diverged again into other individual languages that we have today , languages that differ from each other but still retain large similarities to each other .
This original PIE language has never been written down , but luckily the huge number of Indo - European languages ( 400 + languages ) and the commonalities between them have allowed us to reconstruct the original language with a fair amount of accuracy .
The book The Languages of the World describes in simple terms how this is done :
The book also gives a few examples of how these similarities are shown in Indo - European languages throughout the world , especially in basic words that are less likely to be changed over time .
Here are two examples ( I 've added the reconstructed PIE form as well ) : Welsh - misGaelic - míFrench - moisSpanish - mesPortuguese - mêsItalian - meseLatin - mensisGerman - MonatDutch - maandIcelandic - mánaðurSwedish - månadPolish - miesiącCzech - měsicRomanian - lunăAlbanian - muajGreek - menRussian - mesyatsLithuanian - ménuoArmenian - amisPersian - māh ( ماه ) Sanskrit - māsWelsh - nosGaelic - oícheFrench - nuitSpanish - nochePortuguese - noiteItalian - notteLatin - noxGerman - NachtDutch - nachtIcelandic - nóttSwedish - nattPolish - nocCzech - nocRomanian - noapteAlbanian - nat ëGreek - nuxRussian - noch ' Lithuanian - naktisArmenian - kisherPersian - shabSanskrit - nakt
In short , though there is no attested form of the original PIE language it's safe to assume that if Indo - European languages a , b , c , d , and so on have similar forms , and if we can follow the changes these words have gone through back through earlier versions of these languages , it should be possible to arrive at a single original form that is common to all of them before the original PIE language split up into other languages .
There is naturally still quite a bit of disagreement over the actual form of the original PIE language and since there are no written records fine details on the original spoken form of PIE may never be resolved ( just say the word laryngeal in a room of linguists interested in the subject and watch the sparks fly ) , but the language has been reconstructed with enough accuracy that a modern version of the language could be revived .
As A Grammar of Modern Indo-European states : This is one very large advantage the PIE revival movement has : there is already a huge body of scholarly work on the original form of the language that has existed before the idea even came about to revive the language .
The most prominent group at the moment advocating the serious revival and use of a modern common Indo - European language is the Indo - European Language Association , located at Dnghu.org , and one of their goals is to eventually see it become a working language of the European Union .
The name dnghu itself is a good choice .
Dnghu is PIE for tongue or language , and it 's interesting how it has changed over time .
Here 's a simple diagram showing how this worked :
So the d in dnghu eventually became an l on the Romance language side , and on the Germanic side it became a t in Englishand Z in German .
But not only that , but words that were derived from the Latin( language , linguistic ) were then unknowinglyinto English and German and the rest as new words even though it was originally cognate with the word tongue in the first place .
Very interesting , and the reconstructed PIE language is full of thousands of these words that show just how much history lies behind the words we use every day .
One other example of a word with great etymological richness is the wordfor man , which is where the English wordwolf originally comes from , as well as the adjectiveSeamus Heaney wrote the following in the preface to his translation of Beowulf that explains a bit behind the fascination or nostalgia finding out about these words brings :
This etymological richness of the original Indo - European language and the idea of a common linguistic ancestor from 5000 years ago that could be brought back to life is possibly what could bring success to a revived PIE in spite of the fact that it is a reconstructed language , and thus not constructed in order to be as easy to learn as possible , but rather as accurate as possible .
That means it has grammatical gender , cases , irregular verbs and all the rest of the intricacies that a natural language carries with it , so it takes as long to learn as any other non-constructed language .
One note it does have in its favour compared to other natural languages though is that there are no native speakers that must be emulated , and so bringing PIE back to life would be a very collaborative process as opposed to simply having one class of speakers that know the language from childhood , and another class of speakers that must learn the way this first group uses their language .
You can see this in Latin classes as well - the language is remarkably easy for students to understand and follow along simply because nobody is capable of using it at any great speed , and slang and non-standard usage has become virtually nonexistent .
The Indo - European Language Association not only has a grammar and dictionary of the language but also a large number of sample phrases .
Here are a few :
So could this language really be revived as a modern and international tongue for something like the European Union ?
It 's definitely possible , but what the world first needs is another linguistic deadlock like that which existed in the early 20th century in order to give the idea itself a certain impetus ( i.e. to shake off the idea that " that 's a nice idea but English is already the world language , game over " ) .
Though English is currently in a very strong position it's not quite at the level where it has become the world 's second language , and it is even losing ground or simply not being studied in a number of areas : Among other areas .
English will certainly continue to be the strongest and most studied language in the world for quite some time and no other language has stepped forth to take its place , but the idea that English will become the world 's second language while other languages quietly fade into the background is simply untrue .
But do n't take my word for it - that 's the conclusion the British Council has arrived at in their most recent study of the current state and future projections of the English language .
It remains to be seen whether a linguistic deadlock will lead to a resurgence in the popularity of constructed IALs like in the early 20th century , a reconstructed language like Modern Indo - European or simply an unresolved deadlock , but at the moment the score is Reconstructed languages 1 , Constructed languages 0 , and there is no clear winner in sight anywhere .
Since this is an unresolved issue , let 's end with a question : purely from an emotional standpoint , how does the idea of a reconstructed Indo - European language sit with you ?
Is there something attractive about the idea of reviving a language spoken 5000 years ago in spite of the difficulty ?
Or would you prefer a language with an easy grammar ( Esperanto , Ido , Interlingua , Occidental , Novial , Lingua Franca Nova , Latino sine Flexione ) in spite of their lack of historical use and culture behind them ?--- One final addendum : if you 've found this subject interesting you 'll probably also like the movie The Man From Earth .
Not only is it a great movie that is somewhat related to this subject but the producer also directly thanked people for downloading and sharing the movie online ( it was made with a small budget so he was pleasantly surprised by the attention it received ) , so it 's easy to find online .
In den 90 ern war ich Euer Traumkunde .
Es verging kaum eine Woche , in der ich nicht mindestens zweimal im Kino war ; oft war es dreimal oder viermal .
Ihr habt bestimmt Tausende an mir verdient .
Aus irgendwelchen Gründen hat das dann etwas abgenommen .
Dann kam die Sache mit den Nachtsichtgeräten .
Da gucken Eure Spanner Mitarbeiter während des Films dem Publikum beim Knutschen zu , weil ja jemand die Vorstellung von der Leinwand abfilmen könnte .
Das haben sich manche Eurer Kunden gefallen lassen , andere sind einfach seltener ins Kino gegangen .
Und jetzt habt
Ihr es auch bei mir geschafft , dass ich keine Lust mehr habe , Euch mein Geld zu geben .
Ich wollte heute mit meiner Frau ins Kinopolis .
Da ich spät arbeiten musste , hat sie mich direkt vom Bürohaus des Kunden abgeholt .
Wir haben unsere vorbestellten Karten bezahlt und sind ins gegenüberliegende Schnellrestaurant gegangen .
Und als wir dann ins Kino wollten , sollte ich meinen Rucksack abgeben .
Da könnte ja schließlich ein Aufnahmegerät drin sein .
Ok .
Da war wirklich ein Aufnahmegerät drin , nämlich mein Notebook .
Dasjenige Notebook , dessen Ersatz im Diebstahlsfall mich für die Wiederbeschaffungs - und Wiederinstallationszeit locker einen vierstelligen Betrag an Umsatzausfall kosten würde und das deswegen " Am Mann " bleiben muss .
Geht nicht .
Auch der Manager sagt , Geht nicht .
Gut , dann geht 's halt nicht .
Und Ihr habt wieder einen Kunden weniger .
Und ich fühle mich dort , wo ich als Gefahr und nicht als Gast gesehen werde nicht wohl .
Und wo ich mich nicht wohl fühle , bleibe ich nicht länger als unvermeidbar .
Immerhin habt Ihr uns die Karten anstandslos zurückerstattet , und da die Vorstellung zu diesem Zeitpunkt schon begonnen hatte , ist auch relativ sicher , dass Ihr diese beiden Karten für diese Vorstellung nicht mehr an andere Menschen verkaufen konntet .
_ Das_ ist wirklich Euer Schaden .
Und natürlich der Schaden , den Ihr durch mein zukünftiges Wegbleiben haben werdet .
Denn ich werde in Zukunft , wenn ich meinen ganzen
Tag so planen muss , dass ich möglichst ohne Rucksack zum Kino komme , sicherlich seltener Lust dazu haben , einen Film im Kino zu sehen .
Denn irgendwann wird auch er auf DVD veröffentlicht .
Und ich glaube Euch auch , dass der Versuch , uns bei der Rückerstattung des Eintrittspreises noch um einen Euro zu betupfen , wirklich ein Versehen war .
Es wäre aber nett gewesen , wenn man Euer " Du kommst hier net rein " schon beim Kartenkauf hätte bemerken können .
Dann hätten wir uns nämlich das ungesunde Junk - Food - Essen und obendrein eine Stunde Zeit sparen können .
Vielleicht lasst Ihr Euch solche Geschichten in euren schönen repräsentativen Büros im 28ten Stockwerk mal durch den Kopf gehen und begreift auch mal , dass Eure Umsatzrückgänge nicht unbedingt komplett auf die bösen Raubkopierer zurückzuführen sind , sondern auch daran , dass Ihr Eure zahlenden Kunden aktiv wegekelt .
Denn wir haben Alternativen .
Allergies were far from Christie Littauer ’s mind when she fed creamed spinach to her son Jack for the first time .
The 6 - month - old had already eaten peas and green beans .
Why not try something more exciting ?
“ A few bites into it , he started wheezing , ” says Littauer , of Henderson , Nev . “ He got bright red .
Something was obviously wrong . ”
After a scary ambulance ride , Littauer later discovered that her little boy was allergic to dairy in the spinach , making him one of a growing number of people with known food allergies .
Follow - up tests pointed to a bunch of other allergies too , putting Jack in another large category : those who think ( or whose parents think ) they ’re allergic or intolerant to foods they can handle just fine .

For 2 1/2 years , Jack was shielded from a wide array of foods , until more accurate testing proved he could eat quite a few of them , including wheat and fish .
That opened a menu of possibilities for Jack -- bread , pasta , even chicken nuggets .
With a glut of nonspecialist doctors now offering allergy testing to patients , results that can be difficult to interpret , symptoms that can be wide - ranging and people ’s insatiable need to find explanations for whatever ails them , foods are frequently blamed for crimes they did not commit .
Though allergies or intolerances ( and recognition of them ) do appear to be on the rise , there are far more people who erroneously think they have problems with specific foods .
“ Every study has shown that the perception of having a food allergy is more often wrong than right , ” says Robert Wood , a pediatric allergist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore .
“ Only about 25 % of people who think they have a food allergy will actually have one . ”

Many reactions
Between 6 % and 8 % of children under 3 are known to be allergic to at least one food .
By adulthood , the number drops to about 3 % or 4 % , or about 12 million people in the U.S. Milk , eggs , peanuts , wheat , soy , fish , shellfish and tree nuts account for 90 % of food allergies .
Whether it ’s to pollen , penicillin , bees or strawberries , an allergic reaction involves an antibody called IgE ( Immunoglobulin E ) that is part of the body ’s normal attack against substances it senses as foreign .
In people with allergies , IgE triggers the release of histamines and other chemicals that can lead , within minutes to two hours , to a variety of symptoms , including itchy mouth , swollen tongue , hives , wheezing , skin rashes , nausea , vomiting and diarrhea .
At its worst , the reaction is anaphylaxis -- a potentially life - threatening reaction that can occur within seconds and may lead to shock , airway closure and a blood - pressure drop .

In the case of food , these reactions appear to be happening more often than they used to .
Exact comparisons are hard to come by , but some studies show a doubling of peanut allergies in the last five to 10 years in kids in the U.S. , United Kingdom and Australia .
A Mayo Clinic study published in June reported that celiac disease is now four times more common than it was in the 1950s .
For all food allergies , diagnoses in U.S. kids have increased by 18 % in the last decade , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Inaccurate tests
As food allergies become more common , doctors struggle to figure out who actually has them .
Testing is part of the problem : Common food allergy tests are n’t very accurate .

The only sure - fire way to test for food allergies is with food challenges , in which patients consume controlled and increasing doses of a suspected food under careful supervision .
Yet doctors , especially primary care doctors who are n’t allergy specialists , are far more likely to do blood tests , which are much less accurate and more difficult to interpret .
Experts have seen a proliferation of blood testing by primary doctors , a trend that leads to misdiagnoses of food allergies .
“ We get patients coming in who are avoiding 20 or 30 foods based on blood tests , ” says David Fleischer , a pediatric allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver .

In a recent study , Fleischer and colleagues spent two weeks working with 125 children who had been diagnosed with a collective total of 60 food allergies .
The kids , whose average age was 4 , took a series of food challenges .
At the end of the study , presented in March at an allergy conference , the researchers were able to reintroduce at least four and as many as 20 foods into each child ’s diet .
About 90 % of the suspected allergies had turned up negative .
“ People are so happy and appreciative when they can get more foods in , ” Fleischer says .
“ Even just one food allergy changes your life . ”
Celiac disease

There is no doubt that food allergies are real , serious and dangerous .
At the same time , there is a long history of paranoia about food that lies more in the mind than the stomach .
In a 1987 study that followed nearly 500 children from birth to age 3 , 28 % of parents and caregivers thought their babies had adverse food reactions , though only 8 % ended up having confirmed allergies .
Not much has changed .
Today , between one - quarter and one - third of people suspect an allergy in their children or themselves , even though rates are up to five times lower than that .
For some people , the problem is not an allergy but a more subtle sensitivity or intolerance .
Lactose intolerance , for example , occurs when there ’s a shortage of the enzyme that breaks down milk proteins .
About 50 million Americans have it , with symptoms after consuming milk products that include bloating , gas and diarrhea .
The solution is simple : Avoid dairy , or supplement the diet with the enzyme lactase .

Gluten sensitivity , which is becoming more common -- in reality and also in people ’s perceptions -- is more complicated .
It occurs when the body fights against gluten , a protein in wheat , barley and rye .
At its worst , this sets off a cycle in which the body ’s immune system gets confused and attacks the small intestine .
The result is celiac disease .
About one out of 133 people in the U.S. has celiac disease , though an estimated 90 % of cases are currently undiagnosed .
And rates are increasing .
As many as 2.5 % of the population will have celiac disease in a decade , predicts Daniel Leffler , a gastroenterologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston .
The good news is that celiac disease can be diagnosed with a blood test and intestinal biopsy .
The bad news is that a large number of people do n’t have celiac disease and yet still feel lousy after eating gluten .
Symptoms can be as vague as fatigue and stomach upset , possibly because gluten is a protein that is hard for everyone to digest .
But there is no definitive intolerance test .
In that way , sensitivities to gluten resemble sensitivities to MSG , food dyes and nitrites .
Some people insist they feel better without these chemicals in their diets .
But scientists can’t say for sure if they ’re right -- or whether what they ’re reporting is some kind of self - administered placebo effect .
There are no data to help clear up the muddle .

“ With most intolerances , there ’s nothing medically you can measure , ” Leffler says .
“ There ’s nothing you can see . ”
It ’s a natural human tendency to link ill feelings with whatever you ate last , says Marion Nestle , professor of nutrition , food studies and public health at New York University .

It ca n’t hurt to try a diet free of gluten , food dyes or MSG , experts say .
The danger is when people eliminate one food after another in an attempt to get rid of symptoms that ( perhaps coincidentally ) wax and wane with those dietary changes .
Highly restrictive diets can be tough on people and their families .
( There is food coloring even in some cheeses , and gluten in soy sauce . )
They can also be unhealthy .
To avoid malnutrition , fatigue or low bone density , doctors recommends people who start removing ingredients from their diets consult a nutritionist for advice .
“ There ’s nothing magical about a gluten - free diet , ” Leffler says .
“ It ’s actually rigorous and difficult to follow .
It ’s in processed meats , medications , dustings on frozen vegetables .
It ’s everywhere .
For people who have to follow a gluten - free diet , it ’s a huge , huge headache . ”
As scientists work to unravel the mysteries of the immune system , doctors recommend that people with suspected allergies or intolerances get to a specialist right away .
It takes an average of 11 years to get diagnosed for celiac disease .
No one should have to wait that long to feel better .

Find an allergist
If you suspect a food allergy or food intolerance , your best bet is to have it checked out by an expert .
Dr. Hugh Sampson , professor of pediatrics and immunobiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York , recommends seeking a board - certified allergist with an interest in food allergy .
These individuals can be identified on the website of the American Academy of Allergy , Asthma & Immunology ( www.aaaai.org).
Tips for finding a good food allergy doctor and navigating the testing quagmire are also to be found in the book “ Food Allergies for Dummies , ” by Robert Wood , a pediatric allergist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore .

Frank Kucinich met President Obama at a White House luau on June 25 .
" Thank you for serving , " Obama told Kucinich at the luau .
" I 'm proud of you . "
" Frank told me that was one of the proudest moments of his life , " said his older brother , Dennis , the Cleveland congressman .
" He had a great love of country . "
Frank Kucinich , 60 , died suddenly on Tuesday at his long - time home , the Ohio Veterans Home in Sandusky .
He was the third Kucinich sibling to die since December 2007 .
Kucinich was born in Cleveland and graduated from South High School .
He toured Vietnam with the Marines and struggled the rest of his life with post - traumatic stress disorder .
The lance corporal was a charter member of the Vietnam Veterans Association chapter in Cleveland and commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Independence .
At the Veterans Home , he was color guard commander , leading military ceremonies , and a floor sergeant , helping to govern and serve residents of his wing .
His Mass will take place at 9:30 a.m. Monday at St. Stanislaus Catholic Church , 3649 East 65th St. Golubski Funeral Home at the corner of East 65th Street and Fullerton Avenue is handling arrangements .
Visiting hours at the funeral home will be from 4 to 9 p.m. Sunday .
It ’s been a nasty week for iPhone users .
Apple has buckled to pressure from AT&T and denied Google ’s Voice application from the App Store : a nifty service that helps you consolidate phones and manage your voicemail online .
The app lives on at the BlackBerry App World and Android Market , making some of the technorati so angry they ’ve vowed to ditch AT&T in protest–and their beloved iPhone with it .
Here are seven reasons why you should make AT&T and Apple suffer for their sins .
They ’re anticompetitive .
Sure , every business wants to edge out its foes , but AT&T and Apple are now under FCC investigation for their black - box app approval process .
Regulators want to know who killed the app , and why Voice is different than VOIP apps like Skype .
Check out the inquiries here .
They ’re targets .
Heavy lies the crown ; just ask Microsoft .
When your software platform is the world leader , it earns a lot of antipathy from hackers , who spend their time engineering ways to make your device crash and burn .
Already , the iPhone has been the subject of several frightening security breaches like the text message vulnerability , which Apple has fixed .
But the platform has only been around a couple of years – the more success it finds , the more trouble will find you .
They ’re dicks .
When Apple rejected Google Voice from the App Store , it also pulled all other GV - related apps , some of which customers paid for .
Now they ’re pissed because they want refunds , and Apple is telling developers that those refunds are supposed to come out of the developers ’ pockets .
Not. Cool .
Apps are mayhem .
When the iPhone had a couple of hundred apps available , you responded by downloading a handful .
Now there are 50,000 of them , and you ’ve responded by downloading approximately 30,000 of them .
The problem : you do n’t delete your superfluous apps–they ’re what make the iPhone the iPhone–but you do n’t want to trip over them getting to , say , important stuff like the camera .
Apple ’s organizational system for apps on the phone is terrible ; move one , and the rest tumble into disarray , and there are n’t any ways to organize them by name , size or kind .
What happens when you have more than 11 screens of apps ?
You ca n’t find anything .
The disarray plaguing the iPhone ’s interface does n’t get any better in iTunes , where it ’s almost impossible to discover cool new apps easily without having to sift through garbage first .
Third - party sites like AppBeacon help , but the more apps flood the store , the more bloated and unwieldy iTunes gets .
Right now , the main conduit for discovery is the “ What ’s New ” list , which is killing developers : it encourages them to do updates as often as possible , so they can stay on that list .
That , in turn , inundates the App Store with approval requests they can’t handle .
Stupid .
Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) brought the August town hall boorishness to Washington when he shouted ' you lie ' at President Obama .
Wilson gives Obama a taste of town hall
On his Twitter feed Tuesday , Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) wrote that at a parade he attended in Chapin , “ many people called out to oppose Obamacare , which I assured them would be relayed tomorrow to D.C. ”
It was n’t quite the next day , but Wilson did indeed bring the August town hall boorishness to Washington when he shouted “ you lie ” at President Barack Obama during Wednesday night ’s health care speech before Congress .

Within 15 minutes after Obama wrapped up his remarks , Wilson ’s website server had crashed and his Wikipedia page had been locked on account of “ vandalism . ”
In an interview with CNN immediately after the president ’s address , Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) called Wilson ’s behavior “ totally disrespectful ” and joined a chorus of Democrats calling on the congressman to apologize .
Wilson ’s office soon followed with a statement expressing regret for the outburst .
“ This evening I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the president ’s remarks regarding the coverage of illegal immigrants in the health care bill , ” Wilson said .
“ While I disagree with the president ’s statement , my comments were inappropriate and regrettable .
I extend sincere apologies to the president for this lack of civility . ”
A short while later , Wilson ’s office put out a notice that the congressman had called the White House to personally apologize .
A Democratic source told POLITICO that White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel accepted the congressman ’s apology .
This is not the first time that Wilson has stirred controversy with his remarks .
In 2004 , Wilson was forced to do a similar walk - back when he challenged the patriotism of Rep. Bob Filner ( D - Calif. ) , calling the Democrat “ viscerally anti-American . ”
That same year , Wilson grabbed headlines again when he called on Sen.
John Kerry to apologize for testimony the Democratic presidential candidate and Vietnam veteran gave to a Senate panel in 1971 about the Vietnam War .
“ Many veterans , including myself as a veteran , ” Wilson said at the time , “ view John Kerry ’s testimony that day as one of the worst public slanders ever against the valor and character of the American military . ”
That statement drew the rebuke of former Democratic Sen. and Vietnam veteran Max Cleland , who noted that Wilson had in fact avoided fighting in the war by receiving a student deferral .
In addition , Wilson has chosen to align himself with more outspoken members of his caucus .
He was , for example , a staunch defender of former Republican Minority Leader Tom DeLay , throughout DeLay ’s political and legal travails .
Despite all this , Wilson ’s reputation in the House has , up to this point , largely been that of a genial and mild - mannered legislator , known for handing out keychains and business cards to visitors .
According to a profile in The State , Wilson got his start in politics in 1958 , after distributing brochures and putting up yard signs for Democrat gubernatorial candidate Fritz Hollings .
In the story , Wilson described himself as " a good guy who tries to do right , who tries to be a good citizen , a good husband and good father . "
The Charleston native worked on the Hill for former Sen. Strom Thurmond and as a lawyer in Ronald Reagan ’s Department of Energy .
He practiced law in South Carolina for a quarter - century before winning his House seat during a 2001 special election .
Though he did n’t serve in Vietnam , Wilson did join the Army Reserves and spent 26 years in the Army National Guard .
His four sons have each served in the military , as well .
The congressman currently sits on the House Armed Services Committee .
Wilson ’s press - released mea culpa did little to dam the onslaught of condemnation Wednesday night .
“ I have seen every president address a joint session of Congress in the past 23 years , ” said Rep. John Lewis ( D - Ga. ) , “ in good times and bad .
I have never heard any member of Congress yell out during a speech and call the president a liar . ”
House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said that his fellow South Carolinian “ took our state ’s reputation to a new low . ”
“ I thought Mark Sanford had taken it as low as it could go , but this is beyond the pale . "
Clyburn further took the opportunity to air his grievances over Wilson holding a town hall meeting last month at the high school three blocks from Clyburn ’s house , a perceived affront that has stuck in the Democrat ’s craw for the past few weeks .
“ That 's the kind of guy Joe Wilson is , ” Clyburn said .
“ He loves confronting people .
So he was confronting the president , just as he was confronting me . "
The controversy could also confront Wilson ’s son , Alan , who recently announced his intentions to vie for the job of South Carolina attorney general .
But the more immediate and global question is what the shout meant in terms of the health care debate and how much damage Wilson did to his side ’s efforts .
As one Democrat leadership aide gleefully put it late Wednesday night : “ For a back - bencher , he found a way to garner national attention pretty quickly — but the wrong kind of attention .
He also helped reinforce the negative image of a shrinking Republican Party .
This outburst will be his legacy . ”

But to most Americans today , Federal Reserve is just a name on the dollar bill .
They have no idea of what the central bank does to the economy , or to their own economic lives ; of how and why it was founded and operates ; or of the sound money and banking that could end the statism , inflation , and business cycles that the Fed generates .

Rothbard , steeped in American history and Austrian economics , and featuring Ron Paul , Joseph Salerno , Hans Hoppe , and Lew Rockwell , this extraordinary new film is the clearest , most compelling explanation ever offered of the Fed , and why curbing it must be our first priority .

This movie could change America .
In his opening paragraph , Carroll notes warnings about global warming is usually in measured tones , dire warnings framed in the context of the uncertainty of the future .
But as governments fail to act strenuously enough against the villainous carbon emissions , and as the broad public continues in a state of environmental quietude , if not indifference , scientific voices are sharpening the alarm .
He then makes reference to the work of four men to illustrate this point , E. O. Wilson , James Lovelock , Jagadish Shukla , and Bill McKibben .
For example ,
Bill McKibben declares that the time to mitigate disaster is upon us : " 2009 may well turn out to be the decisive year in the human relationship with our home planet . ’’
Carroll then explores the notion of Apocalyptic thinking , which he describes as " anti-human " despite our deriving it from the Bible and our frequent reference to it in popular culture { " transformers " anyone ) .
He warns that the human readiness to see a looming catastrophe has itself often borne catastrophic consequences .
He warns that the biblically based apocalyptic thinking has the consequence of viewing such destruction as good , as God destroying the world in order to save it .
When I read those words I thought of a different time , in my own life , of an American field grade officer in Vietnam arguing that we had to destroy a village in order to save it .
That did not work then , and remembering that makes me resist those who might welcome destruction of the earth now as something to be welcomed .
Perhaps knowing Carroll 's background , one might be surprised with where he goes in a exploration of the two apocalyptic books in the Bible : Daniel , written in the time of Jewish uprisings against Seleucid tyranny in the 2nd century BCE and that against the Romans in the 1st Century CE ( Carroll choosing to deliberately use non-Christian terminology of Before the Common Era and Common Era , appropriate if one remembers that for Jews and many others Jesus is not the Lord , the Anointed [ Christos - Greek term ; Messiah - equivalent Hebrew term ] ) ; and Revelation , which offers an avenging Christ presiding over the chaos of destruction .
Carroll reminds us that neither book has been universally accepted as canonical .
He also argues that Jesus offered a different approach than that of John the Baptist , whom the Gospels could be fairly described as apocalyptic in his approach .
Carroll describes Jesus as insisting
on the preciousness of life here and now .
His message in no way devalued the present world in favor of a future heaven , any more than the author of Genesis denigrated the created world when God saw it as " good .
.
.very good . ’’
That is from his final paragraph , and I fully realize that there are many in this nation whose selective reading of biblical material , often well out of context and translated through a prism of a predefined theology that is contrary to that derived from reading the Bible not in isolated chunks but as a series of prooftexts will cause them to argue with Carroll 's interpretation .
Christianity has always had adherents who argued for the imminent final return of Jesus , who were looking for signs that it was upon us .
For many of these , warnings about global environmental crisis are real - world affirmations of the belief that the end - time is upon us , something also reinforced by the near constancy of war , and especially of the possibility of serious conflict involving the " holy land " of which the modern nation of Israel is only a part .
They welcome such things in the belief that they will be among the Elect , those who will be saved midst the destruction of the ' final judgment ' that will occur upon the return of Jesus .
The Republican party has a key part of its core constituency many of those who accept such apocalyptic thinking .
When that is combined with a near theological belief against government regulation of business ( although the same people are often willing to regulate the most intimate details of human behavior according to their religious beliefs ) it is understandable why so many Republicans so strongly oppose environmental regulation .
Some will argue that God has given man dominion over the lands and the seas , and thus it is ours to do with as we see fit , entirely ignoring the thrust of much biblical language on stewardship , on preserving God 's creation .
It is one reason why an increasing number of those who view themselves as evangelicals , especially in the younger generations , split with Republicans on environmental issues .
Perhaps it is because they take seriously God 's promise in Genesis at the end of the Flood that never again would he threaten his creation , for as we read in Genesis 8:20 - 22 :
rhen Noah built an altar to the Lord and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
And when the Lord smelled the pleasing aroma , the Lord said in his heart , " I will never again curse the ground because of man , for the intention of man 's heart is evil from his youth .
Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done .
While the earth remains , seedtime and harvest , cold and heat , summer and winter , day and night , shall not cease . "
Carroll concludes his piece with these words :
Uncriticized theological assumptions , in other words , are part of what inhibits the human capacity to respond appropriately to Earth ’s new vulnerability .
The overwhelming message of the Bible , read critically , is that this world is the world that counts .
Any notion of afterlife that suggests otherwise , undercutting care for the home planet , must be discarded , along with the habits that have put us at this precipice .
I chose to do a Masters in a Catholic seminary , and my concentration was on Scripture .
The monsignor who had the greatest influence upon me during that time was a graduate of the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome , as were several other priests with whom I studied .
They would be very much in accord with Carroll 's interpretation of material in this column .
But they are Catholics , and many who rely on inaccurate and selective interpretations of Biblical material as weapons ( and I use that term deliberately ) against reorienting their thinking in light of the environmental crisis reject the entire edifice of the Catholic Church , including any biblical interpretation coming from a tradition that too many view as Rome , " the whore of Babylon , " an image that comes from the Book of Revelation .
And then there are the billions for whom Christian scripture carries no weight .
That includes many who will read these words , as well as myriads whose thinking is shaped by other religious traditions in other cultures .
And it is not the the Catholic Church does not have its own culpability in the environmental crisis .
The Church 's continued opposition to birth control is one reason the earth is under threat - we cannot continue unbridled population expansion .
Certainly were the entire world to live at the " standard of living " ( which might be better phrased as the " standard of wasteful consumption " ) we Americans " enjoy " global population is already far too large to be sustainable by the resources at hand .
Why do I choose to write about Carroll 's column ?
I think it useful for us to have as much intellectual and moral " ammunition " for the continued discussion of the crisis .
I use the quoted word because this is a conflict , one which we cannot afford to lose .
It is not that I seek to slay those who refuse to consider the seriousness .
Rather , if we are not as blunt as possible , in terms people can understand , in fashions that can help shape their world view , then in fact sooner than later all will be lost .
In my recent diary on the birth of the nuclear age , one person criticized my use of the Sanskrit which ran through Oppenheimer 's mind at Trinity - I am become Death , the destroyer of world - because , as the commentator noted , the world will survive even if we eradicate all of humanity .
Perhaps true .
Perhaps true even were we to wipe out most life forms that currently exist , a process of extinction that is already ongoing and does not require the use of nuclear weapons .
We are as a species solipsistic .
If as the Bible says God created man in his own image and likeness , then we more than return the favor .
We think of God and of creation in human terms , we rarely ponder existence without humanity .
Even more basically , we rarely contemplate an existence beyond our own lives , which is why so many hold on to the notion of some kind of life after death .
Those who have biological children balance this by the hopes and dreams for their offspring - a hope seen in the Preamble in the words to secure the blessings of liberty to us and our posterity .
There is no liberty without life .
One can argue that a responsibility for preserving the biosphere as a place of human habitation have a Constitutional responsibility to act responsibly now about the oncoming ecological crisis .
Let me change that - it is not oncoming , it is already here .
There may be a danger in the use of Apocalyptic language and thinking .
But is is a part of our culture .
It is often used to justify preparing for war in the hope of preventing war , seen in expressions such as " better dead than Red " that were part of the cultural background in which I grew up in the 1950s .
Often we see politicians overuse apocalyptic language against their political rivals .
Yet the threats to existence are real .
We must remember that there are some among us who welcome such threats , perhaps because they gain political or economic advantage in the short term by fanning the flames of fear that are ignited by such threats .
For others , they welcome the threats because they look forward to a different kind of existence , one which they perceive as in opposition to the world in which most of us find ourselves rooted .
We may not be able to reach them , but there are many who are reachable , whose sacred texts can serve to remind them that in Genesis the creator imposed upon man a responsibility for a creation s/he called ' very good . "
These are my reflections , arising from reading and considering Carroll after having read and considered stranded wind .
I offer them for your consideration .
Peace .

Over 55s were less likely to opt for evolution than other groups
Furthermore , more than 40 % of those questioned believe that creationism or intelligent design ( ID ) should be taught in school science lessons .
The survey was conducted by Ipsos MORI for the BBC's Horizon series .
Its latest programme , A War on Science , looks into the attempt to introduce ID into science classes in the US .
Over 2,000 participants took part in the survey , and were asked what best described their view of the origin and development of life :
22 % chose creationism
17 % opted for intelligent design
48 % selected evolution theory
and the rest did not know .
Intelligent design is the concept that certain features of living things are so complex that their existence is better explained by an " intelligent process " than natural selection .
Education questioned
Andrew Cohen , editor of Horizon , commented : " I think that this poll represents our first introduction to the British public 's views on this issue .
" Most people would have expected the public to go for evolution theory , but it seems there are lots of people who appear to believe in an alternative theory for life 's origins . "
When given a choice of three descriptions for the development of life on Earth , people were asked which one or ones they would like to see taught in science lessons in British schools :
44 % said creationism should be included
41 % intelligent design
69 % wanted evolution as part of the science curriculum .
Participants over 55 were less likely to choose evolution over other groups .
" This really says something about the role of science education in this country and begs us to question how we are teaching evolutionary theory , " Andrew Cohen added .
The findings prompted surprise from the scientific community .
Lord Martin Rees , President of the Royal Society , said : " It is surprising that many should still be sceptical of Darwinian evolution .
Darwin proposed his theory nearly 150 years ago , and it is now supported by an immense weight of evidence .
" We are , however , fortunate compared to the US in that no major segment of UK religious or cultural life opposes the inclusion of evolution in the school science curriculum . "
In the US , a recent high profile court case ruled that the intelligent design movement is motivated by a desire to introduce God into the classroom .
This came after parents in Pennsylvania took a school board to court for demanding that biology classes should not teach evolution as fact .
Horizon : A War on Science was broadcast on BBC Two at 2100GMT on Thursday , 26 January 2006

This feature was originally published September 2010 .
It has been updated and expanded as of September 2014 .
Where were you on September 9 , 1999 ?
For as much as the NES changed the face of the industry , few can say they lined up on day one to get theirs .
Even the original PlayStation 's launch was lukewarm by today 's standards .
But 9/9/99 is a date that will live on , not just because of its mnemonic repetition , but because it started the trend of carefully orchestrated hype and anticipation culminating in an epic launch the likes of which the industry had never seen before .
It 's been 15 years since then , and to many of us it still feels like yesterday .
Maybe that 's because the Dreamcast was the first console of the sixth generation of consoles , when 3D gaming finally reached maturity , and technical limitations no longer oppressed the ambitions of game designers in the same way they once did .
It was followed by the PlayStation 2 , GameCube , and Xbox , a generation that felt a lot like an uglier version of today 's gaming landscape .
More importantly , Dreamcast was the last stand of a once mighty hardware giant ; the company that came from behind and toppled Nintendo 's near - monopoly .
After a crushing defeat in the 32 - bit marketplace , SEGA underwent one of the most dramatic reinventions the gaming world has ever seen to the delight of newcomers and their loyal fans .
It may not have been enough to turn the tides and escape the inevitable , but it was a brief moment of remarkable creativity that has n't been recaptured since .
The Dreamcast did n't even last for half of a generation , but it left a legacy most systems would be proud of .
Even a decade later , few systems can stir up emotions in their fans like SEGA 's little white wonder .
IGN remembers the Dreamcast
When Bernie Stolar took over as CEO of SEGA of America in 1996 , the company 's outlook was grim .
The PlayStation had quickly managed to devour a huge chunk of SEGA 's core ; the older , seasoned gamers that rejected Nintendo as " kiddie , " and the sports fans that once bickered about Madden versus Montana .
Meanwhile , Nintendo was arriving fashionably late to scoop up their fans with a dazzling new Mario game .
SEGA had managed to hold on to hardcore arcade fans , but this audience was rapidly shrinking as the arcade market entered a tailspin from which it has never recovered .
" I thought the Saturn was a mistake as far as hardware was concerned , " remarked an unrepentant Stolar .
" The games were obviously terrific , but the hardware just was n't there . "
It 's true that the Saturn was a needlessly complex piece of kit that lacked the ingenuity that made SEGA such a leader in arcade hardware .
During the move to CD - based media and 3D environments , development costs were already rising sharply , and the thought of programming for a system with two CPUs and two graphics processors was not an appealing prospect .
While some would have chosen to fight the uphill battle , Stolar was far more concerned with the big picture .
He truly did want to see SEGA rise again , but he knew the future would n't be Saturn .
" I was one of the individuals who fought to discontinue Saturn as a platform , " he admits .
That decision was a heartbreaking one for Saturn fans , and it effectively left the western console markets without any SEGA games for over a year .
But fans could n't see what was growing inside the cocoon .
Stolar 's decision was n't made because he resented the Saturn , it was because he knew that the next system would have to hit the ground running .
Rather than divide their development teams up between a lost cause and their last chance , he put all of the chips on Dreamcast .
Stolar claims that this was also the intent of SEGA of Japan CEO Hayao Nakayama .
" We spoke about building a new hardware platform that I would be very , very involved with , " he remembers .
" I would shape the direction of this platform and hire a new team of people and restructure Sega . "
Mr. Stolar says software was his first priority , but as an outspoken critic of the Saturn , he knew the hardware and the games needed to go hand - in - hand .
It 's no secret that SEGA of Japan let their pride interfere with their judgment in the 32 - bit era .
They passed on deals that could have landed them some version of the hardware behind both the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64 , but instead went with a Frankenstein machine of mostly stock chips that was ugly to program for .
They had ignored the urgings of SoA CEO Tom Kalinske and the American head of R&D Joe Miller , and they paid dearly for it .
This time , they established two separate teams to develop their next machine .
IBM 's Tatsuo Yamamoto led the American project , codenamed Katana , which featured the American - made 3 Dfx Voodoo chipset that had revolutionized the PC gaming market .
In Japan , a team headed by Genesis designer Hideki Sato worked diligently on Dural , with parts supplied by Japanese giants Hitachi and NEC .
NEC 's PowerVR had n't quite taken over the desktop market like 3Dfx had , but both systems proved to be worthy adversaries .
The Japanese system won out , but this time it was a righteous victory .
While some claim this was a result of a tiff with 3 Dfx over publicly announcing the collaboration before the ink was dry , that incident was just one more nail in the coffin .
Executives on both sides of the Pacific were convinced that Dural was the better system .
While the Saturn lagged behind the older Model 2 arcade hardware , this new system was truly top of the line , easily capable of outpacing the once - mighty Model 3 .
To capitalize on this , they created the NAOMI board , an arcade version of the new system that packed economy , power , and interchangeable games .
This meant , for the first time , Sega 's system would be able to deliver a true arcade - at - home experience virtually indistinguishable from their most popular arcade board .
Stolar also wanted to make the Dreamcast the first console ever to be online - ready out of the box , but this was a vision not shared by the execs in Japan .
Online gaming was rapidly rising in importance in America .
Ultima
Online took massively multiplayer gaming to a new level of commercial success , and 1999 would see the release of online breakthroughs like EverQuest Quake III : Arena , and Unreal Tournament .
The timing was perfect for SEGA to be on the cutting edge .
Stolar persuaded the powers at SEGA of Japan to not only support online gaming , but include a modem with each and every system .
It had never been done before , and it would be quite a while before the competition would catch up .
Of course , the software was just as important , and this is where Stolar 's diligence would pay off .
It was heartbreaking to see resources diverted away from the Saturn , but this is because we could n't see where they were going at the time .
Yuji Naka 's Sonic
Team reclaimed SEGA 's mascot , rescuing him from the limbo he had been trapped in at Sega 's American studio STI .
Naka had never been happy about losing the blue blur while he pursued other projects , and imagined an ambitious return to grace for the series that would finally give SEGA their long overdue answer to Mario 64 .
SEGA also diverted one of their most ambitious projects to their new hardware .
Virtua Fighter architect Yu Suzuki had been working on an epic action - adventure initially planned as a spin - off of his famous fighting game .
Shenmue quickly blossomed into something far greater , and it soon became apparent that it would n't arrive in time for the 32 - bit generation .
They started over , but the new hardware made the project that much more exciting .
It would n't arrive in time for launch , however , so SEGA also contracted Genki to port Virtua Fighter 3 to their latest system .
The Dreamcast 's Japanese launch was unspectacular .
Arriving in the final weeks of fall , 1998 , the release was plagued by shortages of NEC chipsets that limited systems to a trickle .
The launch lineup left something to be desired as well .
Virtua Fighter 3tb did n't look quite as good as its arcade counterpart , which was already a couple years old and never as popular as its predecessors .
Godzilla Generations and Pen Pen Tri-Icelon both received poor marks , and hardly showcased the new system .
Within a month , Sonic Adventure arrived to save Christmas for early adopters in Japan , but some of the damage had already been done .
Fans and third parties alike resented SEGA for abandoning the Saturn while it still held a respectable chunk of the market , and the weak launch did little to change their minds .
The following summer , while Americans were still anxiously waiting for the next generation , the Dreamcast finally landed a surprise hit in Japan .
Yoot Saito , best known for the cult classic Sim Tower , decided to capitalize on the still - recent virtual pet craze with a unique " life sim " called Seaman .
Saito went against the grain of everything the genre stood for , and that somehow made it all the more appealing .
Seaman was not cute – in fact , he was a grotesque chimera of man and fish – and he was anything but charming , but with the help of a microphone accessory and impressive speech recognition , the caustic critter could hold some pretty entertaining conversations .
Although Seaman could barely be called a " game " in the usual sense , it proved to be Japan 's first must - have title on the struggling system .
“ Go to the cashier and pay your $ 150.00 fee while I prepare your paperwork . ”
The clerk looked completely and utterly bored while he pointed us to the cashier .
He was performing a procedure he had performed hundreds , perhaps thousands of times before .
He knew his job by rote and , though he was polite , he was not excited by the process he was taking us through .
I , however , was having a spiritual experience standing in the middle of Ottawa City Hall in Canada .
On August 27 , 2009 , my partner Wanda and I walked into this government office to ask for a marriage license .
It ’s an exercise we ’ve done for several years over Valentine ’s Day week at our own government office in Columbia , South
Carolina .
Each year , we go and fill out the forms , dutifully scratching out “ husband ” and “ wife ” and replacing it with “ Spouse 1 ” and “ Spouse 2 . ”
Each year , after we ’re allowed to fill out the forms completely , the clerk behind the desk politely hands them back informing us that we cannot get legally married in our home state .
This experience was different , however , and jarringly so .
There were no television cameras following us to catch the ultimate refusal of our right to marry .
Instead , there was a bored clerk surrounded by other bored clerks processing paperwork not just for me but for a few heterosexual couples that surrounded us at the counter .
It felt eerily familiar to filling out the paperwork at home , except there was nothing to cross out .
The form simply said “ Applicant ” and “ Joint Applicant . ”
Afterward , we took the form back to the clerk and braced ourselves .
Our nervousness grew as he looked it over .
Then said the magic words : “ Go to the cashier and pay your $ 150.00 fee while I prepare your paperwork . ”
That ’s it ?
Really ?
No drama ?
No fanfare ?
No rejection ?
No judgment ?
No , just a bored city hall clerk doing his job .
What he did n’t realize , though , was the depth of the moment for us or the amazing gift he had just given us — a marriage license — a true , official , real , backed up by the federal government , marriage license .
Same - sex marriage has been legal in Canada since July 20 , 2005 after the enactment of the Civil Marriage Act .
The road to marriage equality in Canada was similar to the one currently being traveled by the States .
Some provinces ruled in favor of allowing it while others resisted .
The only true cure for Canada is the only true cure for the States — a federal law equalizing marriage rights for all across the board .
The struggle for marriage equality in Canada was also , as it is in the States , a matter of wrangling within the churches .
There were conservative Christians who opposed marriage equality and spoke stridently against enactment of the federal law .
They launched campaigns against it just as anti-marriage equality groups have done here .
Church denominations have drawn their own positions on the matter and the ongoing struggle was evident at our wedding ceremony the next evening .
A retired United Church of Canada minister performed our ceremony at the apartment of two of our friends who hosted us in Ottawa — a gay male couple who had married just a couple of years before .
The United Church has taken a very progressive stand on marriage equality and voted in 2000 “ to advocate for the civil recognition of same - sex partnerships . ”
Their ministers are free to perform same - sex marriage ceremonies .
Present at our wedding , however , were six other clergy people who would have dearly loved to do our ceremony , but were prohibited from doing so by their denominations .
So , while the law has been settled , the churches continue to struggle with their own theologies of acceptance like so many U.S. denominations .
It was truly a bittersweet day .
We were able to get legally married in Canada , but we knew that as soon as we crossed the border back to our home country , we ’d still have to check off the “ single ” box on any form that asked about our marital status in the States .
We are not alone in this conundrum .
Six states have enacted marriage equality for gays and lesbians , but the federal Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) continues to prevent even those marriages from receiving federal recognition .
Even those couples considered married in these states still must declare themselves “ single ” on any federal form or when they cross into another state that does n’t recognize their marriage .
Canadians have experienced this cognitive dissonance of a patchwork of marriage laws and have come to an equitable conclusion .
Wanda and I are dedicated to continuing the fight for similar federal recognition of same - gender marriages in the U.S .
Friends had asked why we did n’t get married in one of the half dozen states where it is legal instead of leaving the country to do it .
My answer is two - fold .
The first one is practical — I did n’t have any speaking engagements planned in any of those states in the near future .
I had been invited to speak at church in Ottawa that weekend as part of Ottawa ’s pride celebration , so Wanda and I decided to take advantage of the law while we were there .
But , my second reason is deeper .
I believe that the United States will be forced to recognize international same - gender marriages before they deign to recognize those performed within its own borders .
The reason will be economic instead of religious .
In a 2006 paper , University of Colorado law professor Laura Spitz argues that because of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) it may become impossible for the United States and Canada especially
to mix economically without ultimately mixing culturally .
It seems to me that if the legalization of same - sex marriage in Canada is politically and philosophically consistent with the American economic model , and North American economic integration is part of a larger project to make the American economic model global , then Americans have reason to believe same - sex marriage — i.e. , the further expansion of the private care - taking sphere — will become important to large economic actors in the United States .
In other words , the federal government ( which is facing the largest deficit in history ) , multinational insurance companies , and other corporations awarded government contracts for what were previously understood as public services , will all be interested in expanding the private caretaking sphere in order to save money .
One way to do this in a relatively short period of time is to broaden the definition of family .
And experience tells us , at least in the United States , that when the insurance industry and large government contractors become interested in change , they bring enormous pressure to bear on politicians and other decision - makers .
I should note that while Spitz makes a compelling case for accepting same - gender marriage on international economic grounds she clarified in an email to that she , personally , does not “ support the ‘ same - sex marriage agenda ’ for the LGB movement in the United States . ”
What Spitz makes clear in her paper is that despite religious opposition to marriage equality within the United States , if the economic livelihood of American businesses is ever threatened because of marriage inequality in the U.S. we can expect corporations to become the newest marriage equality advocates .
If that happens , marriage equality will become the law of the land no matter what anti-gay preachers or organizations have to say about it .
When the corporate piggy bank is at stake , religious arguments will always fall on deaf corporate ears .
When that happens , whether it is sooner or later , I hope many more of my gay and lesbian brothers and sisters will experience the same thrill that Wanda and I did when a bored government clerk , completely unimpressed by the two men or two women standing before him or her at the counter , directs them to pay their fee while he prepares their paperwork .
Just one more note about the bliss of marriage .
On Sunday , when we took part in the Ottawa pride parade , we were walking down the parade prep line to join up with Integrity Canada ( the Anglican LGBT support group ) when we passed by a scantily clad woman in leather marching with the fetish club .
After I walked by , Wanda said to me , “ Did you see that ? ”
“ See what ? ” I asked .
She turned me around and I beheld the mostly bare flesh of a beautiful woman , her private parts barely hidden under fine strips of leather and lace .
“ Oh , no , I missed that . ” I said , blinking at the sight .
Our host for the weekend laughed and said , “ You are married . ”
I had to laugh with him .
Yes , I am married .
In every sense of the word .
Blackwater – I mean , " Xe " – is back in the news , more than six months after the mercenary firm was kicked out of Iraq by the Iraqi government for using " excessive force . "
Baghdad gave Blackwater the boot for the company 's apparent role in the killings of 17 civilians in Baghdad 's Nisoor Square on Sept. 16 , 2007 .
In that incident , Blackwater guards reportedly opened fire on a crowd after coming under attack .
According to affidavits filed in federal court on Monday , the company 's founder Erik Prince and his staff were engaged in a fantastic litany of crimes , almost too fantastic to be believed .
At the top of the list : Prince and his proteges " murdered , or had murdered , one or more persons who have provided information , or who were planning to provide information , to the federal authorities " regarding the Nisoor Square killings .
The affidavits , part of a civil lawsuit stemming from Blackwater 's alleged abuses in Iraq , were signed by " John Doe # 1 " and " John Doe # 2 , " both of whom claim to be current or former Blackwater employees .
John Doe # 2 wrote that he " fear [s ] violence against me in retaliation for submitting this declaration . "
The affidavits also allege that Blackwater illegally smuggled weapons into Iraq , sometimes in bags of dog food – an allegation we 've heard before .
More broadly , " Prince intentionally deployed to Iraq certain men who shared his vision of Christian supremacy , knowing and wanting these men to take every available opportunity to murder Iraqis .
... Going to Iraq to shoot and kill Iraqis was viewed as a sport or game , " according to the statements .
The Nation broke the story of the new accusations , calling them " devastating . "
Blackwater had re-branded itself as " Xe " earlier this year , in a bid to shed its bad image .
Blackwater 's got loads of legal troubles .
Five employees await trial in the U.S. on charges stemming from the Nisoor shootings .
The company has also faced accusations from crew members aboard its warship McArthur , which was outfitted to fight pirates but has yet to win a contract .
Three * McArthur * crewmen reported harassment , reprisals and physical abuse at the hands of drunken superiors .
Iraqis , in particular , are adamant that Blackwater face justice .
" Iraqis might think at least a little differently of America if the killers are put in prison , " said Iraqis Farid Walid , who was wounded in the Nisoor Square incident .

[ Continuing a new column reprinting classic Game Developer magazine articles , following a Doom profile and Shadows Of The Empire postmortem , this March 1998 postmortem reveals the story behind Ensemble 's seminal PC real - time strategy game Age Of Empires . ]
I had an experience in a local computer store recently that caused me to burst out laughing .
I had stopped to self - indulgently admire the top - ten PC games display when I overheard the following exchange between two young men :
“ What do you think about this one , Age of Empires ? ” wondered the first .
His companion shot back , “ Aww , the Borg at Microsoft just combined Warcraft and Civilization to cash in on these kind of games . ”
Always eager to boost our sales , I took this opportunity to tell the young men how AoE was n’t the creative product of a giant corporation , but of a small group of talented people living right in their own backyard .
For us , Age of Empires was not only a game of epic proportions , it was an epic journey for a small band of people determined to turn an idea into a real game company .
Along the way , we laughed , we cried , we consumed pizza and caffeine , and we learned a great deal about making games .
Designing the Past Perfect
Obviously , Age of Empires did n’t start out looking like the final product .
Despite some accusations , Dawn of Man ( AoE ’s original title ) was n’t created to be a Warcraft II clone .
( In fact , Warcraft II was n’t released until after AoE ’s development was well underway . )
Instead , the final design was evolved and refined over time , with a few significant design events along the way .
One of the best things I think you can have in a game company is a staff that plays a lot of different games .
This was true of our staff at Ensemble , and was helped in no small part by programmer Tim Deen ’s habit of buying and actually playing almost every new PC game as it came out .
It was Tim who brought Warcraft II to the attention of the rest of the Ensemble staff .
At that time , many of AoE ’s game elements , such as resource management , empire building , and technology research , were taking clear shape .
However , we did n’t really know what to do about combat .
Warcraft II was a splash of cold water in the face , waking us up to how much fun real - time combat could be .
Several times a week , the staff would stay late to play multiplayer Warcraft .
These impromptu events continued until AoE reached the point in development when it became more fun to play than Warcraft .
Another major shift occurred a little over halfway through development , when the designers were looking at AoE ’s localization plans .
They realized that AoE would be sold in Asia , but did n’t include a single culture from that region .
We held a company - wide meeting and decided to add early Asian civilizations to the early European , African , and Middle - Eastern tribes that we ’d already developed .
Though the addition would create more work for the artists and designers , the enhanced appeal that the game would have in Asia would make this a profitable decision .
All of these changes occurred because the game ’s designers were n’t afraid of taking design input from the rest of the staff .
Making a game that everyone would be proud of and would want to play was something that got more than just lip service at Ensemble .
Perhaps the best example of this core value is the Wonder , the penultimate building that a player can build and use to win the game .
In early 1997 , AoE was great for slugfests , but everyone felt that the game play needed to offer something more .
Numerous ideas were tried and rejected .
Then Mark Terrano , our communications programmer , hit upon the idea of building an “ Armageddon Clock ” that would force players to drop what they ’re doing and respond to the new challenge .
AoE is chock full of little ideas and touches that were thought up by the artists and programmers .
This participation tangibly increased the sense of ownership and pride that we all took in the game .
One of things that is truly underappreciated about the designer ’s job is play balancing .
The designers spent months and months adjusting costs , strength , speed , and many other statistics in an effort to create a game that was fun to play and yet did n’t offer any loopholes or cheats .
At this point , I realized that Tim Deen was truly a gamer ’s gamer .
During development , if any of the various iterations of AoE ’s design opened up a way for one player to take advantage of another player and thus make the game one - dimensional , Tim would find it .
And when we did n’t believe his assessments , he would promptly show us by using the loophole to kick our butts at the game .
For the better part of a year , play balancing was a prominent task , and it paid off in giving AoE more staying power and better game play than many others in the recent crop of real - time strategy games .
Blazing the Multiplayer Path
Multiplayer support was an integral part of the early design , and AoE was structured in such a way that most of the game could not differentiate between human and computer players .
When DirectX first came out , it appeared that DirectPlay would be the best choice for providing communications over the widest variety of connection types .
To support a high number of moving units , we went with a modified game synchronous model , where the entire game is simultaneously run on all machines .
Only moves , changes , and commands are communicated to other machines .
This approach has the advantage of minimizing the amount of data that has to be sent .
The unanticipated danger of using this model is that it can generate a condition where the game on one machine becomes out of sync with the game on other machines .
This caused some very hard - to - reproduce bugs with AoE .
Load metering , the process of determining how much bandwidth the game updates required , was done before the computer AI was completed , and was based on the data flow model taken from human players .
As a result , we initially missed the fact that computer players would sometimes issue large numbers of commands in quick bursts .
We did , however , address this oversight with the first patch .
An area where AoE ’s communications worked out better than expected was the game ’s ability to dynamically adapt to latency .
A sliding window delays the actual game time when a command takes effect , so that all players receive the command and do not have to pause before executing it .
The problem of handling players who have dropped from a game presented Mark Terrano with difficult challenges .
Since drops are unpredictable , usually there is no way to know what happened .
The problem could be the game logic , Winsock , the physical connection , or the ISP , and could exist on either the sender ’s or receiver ’s side .
Getting the game to handle drops by anyone at anytime required a great deal of work .
One of the lessons learned from the multiplayer experience was to make full use of communications testing tools , such as automated logs and checksums .
Also , we discovered that creating a simple communications data flow simulator program could provide great benefits and isolate the communications code from the rest of the game .
DirectPlay also turned out to be problematical .
Difficult - to - reproduce bugs , quirky behavior , and poor documentation made the going more difficult .
Guaranteed packet delivery for IPX was one of the more notable examples .
At the CGDC , Microsoft promised to deliver this feature with DirectX 5 and even included in the beta .
However , when DirectX was actually released , this feature was nowhere to be found .
The cost of that one missing item was the extra time we had to spend writing our own guaranteed delivery system and a bad packet generator program with which to test it .
Painting the Scene
All of the 2D sprites in AoE began life as 3D models .
Age of Empires contains 20 MB of in - game sprite graphics .
Even though all of the displays are 2D , we decided early on that all of the graphics in the game would be taken from 3D models .
We used 3D Studio and 3D Studio MAX for art production .
Because 3D rendering is so time - consuming , each artist was issued two machines each , both usually 200MHz Pentium Pros with 128MB of RAM , which at the time was better equipment than the programmers were using .
The objects in the game were created as 3D models that had anywhere from a couple thousand to 100,000 polygons .
The models were then textured , animated , and rendered out to a .
FLC ( Autodesk Animator ) file with a fixed 256 - color palette .
So far , the process I ’ve described is identical to that of many other games .
At this point , however , the artists added another time - consuming step .
The .FLC files were handed off to a 2D specialist , who took the animation apart frame by frame and “ cleaned up ” each image with Photoshop .
The clean - up process involved sharpening detail and smoothing the edges of the irregular shapes .
Since most of the sprites in AoE had screen dimensions of only 20 to 100 pixels in each direction , the visual quality improvement that we realized was significant .
When AoE was shown at the 1997 E3 , the artists received numerous compliments on their work from their peers at other companies .
The choice to go with 3D models for the in - game objects provided benefits for other art needs , as they were readily available for use in the static background scenes that appear on the menu , status screens , and the various cinematics .
The cinematics , including the three - minute opener , were a fulltime project unto themselves .
The 256 - color palette ( actually 236 ) used in AoE was something of a problem .
The palette was chosen and set in stone at the very beginning of the project , before most of the models and textures had been created .
As a result , it turned out that some portions of the color spectrum , such as browns for wood textures , had too few available colors to get the best visual quality .
The palette was n’t revised during the development process because that would have required rerendering and touching up every image in the game ‘ far too expensive time - wise .
On the other hand , the palette did have a wide and balanced range of colors , which contributed to the overall bright and cheerful look of the game ’s graphics .
If we do another 8 - bit color game , we ’ll generate the palette at a point further along in the development process .
Going for Speed
Performance is an issue for all but the simplest of games , and it certainly was for AoE .
When I joined Ensemble , the game was still in an early form and slow .
The two biggest problems were the graphics engine ( which was just plain slow ) and various update procedures , which produced occasional pauses of up to a second in game play .
If we were going to sell to anything but the most cutting - edge systems , some serious optimization was in order .
The story gets personal here , as I did a great deal of the work on this part of AoE .
I started by trying to get a handle on what the over 100,000 lines of C++ code did ( the source would rise to over 220,000 lines before it was finished ) .
After spending a few weeks studying what we had , I proposed a major overhaul of the graphics engine structure , including writing a major portion in assembly .
AoE ’s original design team asked if the frame rate of a benchmark scenario could be raised from its current 7 - 12 fps to 20 fps .
I told them yes .
Inside I was sweating bullets , hoping that I could deliver that much improvement .
I could n’t just go ahead and rip out the old graphics engine , as it would hold up everyone else , so I spent the next five months working mostly on the new engine .
Along the way , I managed some incremental improvements that upped the frame rate to 10 - 14 fps , but the big breakthrough came during an all - nighter , when the last piece of the new design was put into place .
Much to my surprise , the benchmark scenario was now running at 55 fps .
It was exciting to come back into the offices the next day and see the formerly sluggish animation running silky smooth .
But my work was not all on the graphics engine .
I also spent a great deal of time identifying and optimizing myriad processes in the game .
Since the game was real - time , many improvements involved spreading out a process over several turns rather than of stopping the game until it completed .
In the end , the optimizations paid off handsomely and allowed us to raise the default resolution from 640x480 to 800x600 .
A practical lesson that I learned from this experience was how much additional overhead and slowdown a game can acquire as it approaches completion .
Often , early in a game project the engine will show great performance but the game ’s not finished .
When you replace the simple test levels with the complex final levels , add all the AI , UI , and bells and whistles , you can find a world of difference in actual performance .
This was true for AoE as well .
As we approached completion and all of the loose ends were tied off , many of the performance gains were traded in for new features .
Things That Worked Out ( S) well
1 . The Game was broken into separate engine and game components .
About halfway through development , there was concern that the code base had expanded far enough beyond the initial design in some areas that every new change and addition would look like an ugly hack .
Lead programmer Angelo Laudon and Tim Deen took two weeks and separated the code base into two separate sections , the general engine ( Genie ) , and the game itself ( Tribe ) .
The conversion was very successful and allowed the AoE programmers to retain a nicely object - oriented design .
The benefit here was that it made the code much easier to modify and extend , saving the programmers a great amount of development time .
2 . We made the game database driven .
Thanks to the object - oriented design , almost nothing about any object in AoE is hard - coded into the program .
Instead , huge tables of information describe every characteristic of every object that appears in the game .
The designers used a system of over forty Paradox tables to control and shape the game .
As a result , they were able to constantly update and tweak the game , and then test their changes without having to involve a programmer .
3 . We stayed in close contact and working together with the publisher .
I ca n’t say enough good things about how the close contact with our publisher , Microsoft , helped the development of AoE .
By keeping them " in the loop " on our progress , they worked with us instead of against us as things happened .
The best example of how this relationship aided development is the way we handled schedule slippage .
Each time something took longer than expected or new problems cropped up , we effectively communicated the delay to Microsoft .
With a clear understanding of what was happening and why , they reaffirmed their commitment to assist us in producing a quality game , whatever amount of time that would take .
So instead of being panic - stricken and whacked out , we remained professional and focused on our goals .
4 . We played our own game .
While this may sound simple , it ’s very important .
Throughout the development process , every person in the company not only play tested , but played AoE with the purpose of having fun .
As a result , we were very in tune with why the game was fun , and what people were likely to get out of it .
We had 20 guys who were determined not to let the game play be compromised or watered down .
5. Performance was good .
Performance truly means a lot if you want your game to have broad appeal .
Age of Empires can adequately run an eight - player game in 16MB of RAM on a P120 system .
Contrast that with Total Annihilation , which requires 32MB and at least a 200MHz CPU for an eight - player game .
Achieving this level of performance required a group effort .
The programmers expended extra energy on keeping memory consumption in check and identifying bottlenecks , while the artists culled extra animation frames and reorganized the graphics to maximize free memory .
6 . The company respected its employees .
I have to say something about the way Ensemble Studios treated its employees and their families .
It is well known that software development , especially game development , involves great sacrifices of time and can be hell on personal relationships .
Ensemble ’s thoughtful management respected that by going out of their way to include families at numerous company dinners and other events , and to make them feel welcome to come by the offices at any time .
Additionally , after crunching hard to meet a milestone , they would insist that employees take a couple of days off to catch up with their families .
People were allowed flexible schedules if they needed them , and flowers or other tokens of appreciation were sent to the families periodically .
The result of this deliberate action by company management should be obvious ; company morale and loyalty was higher than I have ever seen in fourteen years of software development .
My wife loves my job as much as I do .
7. Localization really worked .
From the beginning , we knew that Microsoft wanted to release AoE in six different languages , including Japanese .
About halfway through development , we updated our code base to provide full localization support .
This required stripping out and replacing all text references in the source code and maintaining all game text in an external resource file .
It also placed severe restrictions on how we could draw and display the text .
We had to use the Windows GDI exclusively , something most games shun like the plague .
It also meant that interface items such as buttons had to be sized to hold the largest possible translated form of their captions , limiting the clever things one could do with the design of the user interface .
But we buckled down and did it , following the guidelines exactly .
And to our pleasant surprise , the conversion was swift and painless .
We felt even better when the translators at Microsoft told us that localizing AoE was the smoothest and most pain - free project they had ever done .
The benefit to us was enormous in that we had a single executable program file that was the same for all translated versions of the game , thus avoiding the huge headache that comes with tracking bugs and releasing updates for multiple versions .
8 . We worked as a team that respected all its members .
A project of AoE ’s size required that we all work together in close quarters for extended periods of time .
One of our expressed criteria in hiring new people is that we must be able to respect each other .
This respect , complemented by the company ’s actions towards its employees , fostered an excellent sense of family and team spirit among everyone .
We avoided having different groups develop a sense of isolation from the project , and as a result , attitudes and spirits remained high even during the worst crunch time .
Had tempers flared and cliques developed , I honestly do n’t believe that AoE could have made it out the door in 1997 .
Things That Went Wrong Or We Could Have Done Better
1 . We held the beta test too late in the development cycle .
A public beta test of AoE was held in August 1997 , but we did n’t come near to exploiting the full potential of it .
We were too close to the end of the project to make any game play changes , despite the wealth of useful feedback we received .
Manuals were already set to be printed , and most of the design had been set in stone .
All we could really do was fix any bugs that were found .
For any future projects , we vowed to hold the beta testing earlier .
2 . There was inadequate communication with the QA people at Microsoft .
For most of the project , bug reporting was handled through a database and developers did n’t directly communicate with the testers .
As a result many bugs wound up taking much longer to resolve , and new features went untested .
An intermediate database was simply not enough to let testers and developers know what the other was really thinking .
In future projects , we would like to assign a specific tester to each programmer and have them communicate by phone every couple of days .
Near the end of development , this did happen for a couple people ‘ for them productivity with testing and bug resolution was drastically improved .
3 . We sometimes failed to coordinate development through the leads .
Yet another area where personnel communication could have improved the development was among our own teams .
Each team Programming , Art , Game Design , and Sound has a lead person who is responsible for keeping track of what each member of his or her team is doing .
The lead is the go - to person when someone outside has new requests for the team .
As the development of AoE progressed and the pressures rose , adherence to this system broke down as people went direct to get their needs filled quickly .
We paid a price for it .
People did n’t know about programming changes or new art that was added to the game , and the level of confusion rose , creating a time drain and distraction .
We all had to stop at times just to figure out what was going on .
4 . We failed to adequately test multi-player games with modem connections .
One problem with our development environment is that it is n’t comparable to the typical end user system .
During the course of development , the multiplayer portions of AoE were tested extensively .
When we played a game in the office , our fast machines , stuffed full of RAM , communicated with each other on our high - speed LAN .
When we tested Internet play , our communications were handled through the company ’s T1 line .
One thing that we failed to realize in our testing was the fact that most players would be using dial - up modem connections to commercial Internet service providers .
And it was n’t just us ; the same situation applied to the testing labs at Microsoft .
As a result , modem connection games were under -tested .
Bugs that were harmless when ping times were low resulted in dropped games for users on slower Internet connections .
And our high - speed network masked the fact that under certain not - so - uncommon circumstances , AoE could require 15 K of network bandwidth per second ‘ six times what even a 56 K modem can provide on the uplink side .
As a result , we were taken a bit by surprise when reports of multiplayer game problems rolled in .
Though our first patch fixed this problem , the situation was unacceptable .
Now , each developer has a modem and several different ISPs are used , as modem testing is a big part of our testing process .
5. Portions of development relied on products that were not delivered on time .
There was a second reason that modem games were under - tested ; problems with the delivery and quality of DirectPlay from Microsoft .
Features that were promised , and even included in beta releases , were n’t present when the delayed final release was delivered .
Direct X 5a was n’t available to us until a month before the game shipped .
In the meantime , our communications programmer was burning the midnight oil writing the functionality that was expected but not delivered .
Waiting on promised drivers and SDKs is one of the harder things that developers have to deal with ; even those with Microsoft as a publisher have no control over them .
6 . We did not plan for a patch .
The version 1.0a patch , even though it was a success , was problematic in that as a company we had not planned for it .
The general argument is that if you know you are going to need to release a patch , then you should n’t be shipping the game in the first place .
While one can take that stand , it ’s also a fact that no game developer ’s testing can match that of the first 50,000 people who buy and play the game .
Your customers will do and try things that you never dreamed of , while running on hardware and drivers that you never heard of .
Looking around , nearly every significant game released this year has had a patch or update released for it .
Rather than deny this reality , we would like to allocate resources and expectations in the future so that we can release any necessary updates days or weeks after our games ship , rather than months .
7 . We did n’t manage “ surprise ” events as well as we could have .
During the development period , we experienced several sudden events that caused us , as a company , to stop what we were doing .
These events included the creation of a demo version of the game and materials for press coverage of AoE .
While most of the events were beneficial to the company , we were n’t very good at handling them , and they threw off our schedules .
These disruptions mostly came late in development , when their impact was felt the most .
One of our goals for future games is to minimize the impact of unplanned events by giving advance notice when possible and restricting them by minimizing the number of people that have to respond to them .
8 . We did n’t take enough advantage of automated testing .
In the final weeks of development , we set up the game to automatically play up to eight computers against each other .
Additionally , a second computer containing the development platform and debugger could monitor each computer that took part .
These games , while randomly generated , were logged so that if anything happened , we could reproduce the exact game over and over until we isolated the problem .
The games themselves were allowed to run at an accelerated speed and were left running overnight .
This was a great success and helped us in isolating very hard to reproduce problems .
Our failure was in not doing this earlier in development ; it could have saved us a great deal of time and effort .
All of our future production plans now include automated testing from Day One .

Patching It All Up
Once AoE was shipped off to production , we threw ourselves a big party to let off some stress .
It turns out we were a bit premature in our revelry .
Shortly after AoE arrived on store shelves we began receiving feedback on problems with the path finding , unit AI behaviors , population limits , and multiplayer play .
Additionally , some bugs were found that a player could exploit to gain an unfair advantage in the game .
Management was stirred to action at both Ensemble and Microsoft , and the decision to do a patch for AoE was made .
Although time was taken away from other projects , and it took longer than desired , the patch was a success ; it vastly improved the quality of multiplayer games , fixed the bugs , and addressed the game play concerns that had been raised .
And that brings the development of AoE to where it is today , which I hope is somewhere on your hard drive …

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A new experimental treatment for multiple sclerosis ( MS ) completely reverses the devastating autoimmune disorder in mice , and might work exactly the same way in humans , say researchers at the Jewish General Hospital Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research and McGill University in Montreal .
MS is an autoimmune disease in which the body 's own immune response attacks the central nervous system , almost as if the body had become allergic to itself , leading to progressive physical and cognitive disability .
The new treatment , appropriately named GIFT15 , puts MS into remission by suppressing the immune response .
This means it might also be effective against other autoimmune disorders like Crohn 's disease , lupus and arthritis , the researchers said , and could theoretically also control immune responses in organ transplant patients .
Moreover , unlike earlier immune - supppressing therapies which rely on chemical pharamaceuticals , this approach is a personalized form of cellular therapy which utilizes the body 's own cells to suppress immunity in a much more targeted way .
GIFT15 was discovered by a team led by Dr. Jacques Galipeau of the JGH Lady Davis Institute and McGill 's Faculty of Medicine .
The results were published August 9 in the prestigious journal Nature Medicine .
GIFT15 is composed of two proteins , GSM - CSF and interleukin - 15 , fused together artificially in the lab .
Under normal circumstances , the individual proteins usually act to stimulate the immune system , but in their fused form , the equation reverses itself .
" You know those mythical animals that have the head of an eagle and the body of a lion ?
They 're called chimeras .
In a lyrical sense , that 's what we 've created , " said Galipeau , a world - renowned expert in cell regeneration affiliated with the Segal Cancer Centre at the Jewish General and McGill 's Centre for Translational Research .
" GIFT15 is a new protein hormone composed of two distinct proteins , and when they 're stuck together they lead to a completely unexpected biological effect . "
This effect , explained Galipeau , converts B - cells -- a common form of white blood cell normally involved in immune response -- into powerful immune - suppressive cells .
Unlike their better - known cousins , T - cells , naturally - occurring immune - suppressing B-cells are almost unknown in nature and the notion of using them to control immunity is very new .
" GIFT15 can take your normal , run -of - the - mill B-cells and convert them -- in a Superman or Jekyll - Hyde sort of way -- into these super - powerful B- regulatory cells , " Galipeau explained .
" We can do that in a petri dish .
We took normal B - cells from mice , and sprinkled GIFT15 on them , which led to this Jekyll and Hyde effect .
" And when we gave them back intravenously to mice ill with multiple sclerosis , the disease went away . "
MS must be caught in its earliest stages , Galipeau cautioned , and clinical studies are needed to test the treatment 's efficacy and safety in humans .
No significant side - effects showed up in the mice , he said , and the treatment was fully effective with a single dose .
" It 's easy to collect B - cells from a patient , " he added .
" It 's just like donating blood .
We purify them in the lab , treat them with GIFT15 in a petri dish , and give them back to the patient .
That 's what we did in mice , and that 's what we believe we could do in people .
It would be very easy to take the next step , it 's just a question of finding the financial resources and partnerships to make this a reality . "

Crime Around The Corner
Observant visitors to this blog may have noticed the recent appearance of a “ wiki ” button at the top of the page .
This links to the recently established Stubborn Mule wiki , which I plan to use as a repository of information relevant in some way to the blog .
Since so many of the posts here focus on data analysis , I have started with a collection of links to useful sources of data online , particularly economics and finance data .
The latest link I have added is to the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics & Research ( while I did not include it in the economics and finance section , maybe it does belong there ) .
This site includes a research data set which provides monthly crime data going back to 1995 broken down by local government ( council ) area and offence type .
Needless to say , the first thing I was interested to learn was the level of criminality in my own local area , particularly as I moved here only very recently .
The chart below shows the total number of crimes in the various offence categories for 2008 in my local government area of Marrickville .
While I was not surprised to see theft coming in at the top of the list , there were a few oddities further down .
I was initially surprised to see driving offences at the bottom of the list .
My driving is , of course , impeccable but I do not know if the same is true of all of my neighbours , not to mention visitors to the area .
Digging further , I discovered that from 2003 onwards * , the figures for driving offences have been zero for all areas and transport regulatory offences have leapt up .
So , presumably there has been a classification change .
One mystery solved .
Marrickville Crime Count ( 2008 )
More intriguing is blackmail and extortion .
Until 2008 , the highest rate this crime had reached in Marrickville was four cases per year and in three years , the figure was zero .
Yet , in 2008 , there were nine cases of blackmail and extortion .
What lies behind this wave of blackmail around the corner ?
Mystery not solved .
This led me to examine other trends through time .
Starting with theft , I was gratified to learn that 2008 was the lowest year for theft since these records began .
I am hoping 2009 will be lower still .
Occurrences of Theft in Marrickille
A look at prostitution also suggests the area has become more law - abiding after a significant spike in offences in 2001 .
Occurrences of Prostitution Offences in Marrickville
As for serious crime , Marrickville experienced three homicides in 2008 .
The total number of homicides in the area since 1995 is 66 , putting Marrickville in a somewhat disturbing 14th place out of 155 local government areas , although these two have been reducing over recent years .
For those interested in the most murderous areas in New South Wales , here is a list of the top five areas in terms of total homicides since 1995 .
Any country readers will note that all of these local government areas are in Sydney ( the area in the table labelled “ Sydney ” encompasses only the central business district and some inner-city suburbs ) .
Area Homicides Fairfield 242 Sydney 327 Blacktown 136 Liverpool 102 Parramatta 82

John Smoltz , designated for assignment by the Red Sox after his meltdown against the Yankees last week , has refused an option to the minor leagues , a source told ESPN 's Peter Gammons .
The next step is Boston's : The Red Sox can trade him , because Smoltz has cleared waivers , or they can simply release him .
According to ESPN
The Magazine 's Buster Olney , there appear to be several National League teams interested in getting Smoltz , who was designated Aug . 7 .
However , those interested , including the Texas Rangers , also likely would want the Red Sox to share the financial burden of his contract .
If the Red Sox cut Smoltz , whatever team deciding to acquire him would be on the hook for the pro-rated amount of the major league minimum .
In addition , Smoltz , 42 , would get the rest of his $ 5.5 million salary from the Red Sox .
The Red Sox had indicated they would like to keep him , but in a relief role , and that likely would necessitate a trip to the minors .
They also would like him to restructure a clause in his contract that allows him to make $ 35,000 for each day he is on the major league roster , above and beyond his base salary .
Smoltz signed with the Red Sox in January , hoping he could recover from surgery on his right shoulder .
After eight starts , Smoltz was 2 - 5 with an 8.32 ERA .
That includes a miserable outing Aug. 6 against the Yankees , when he gave up eight runs on nine hits and four walks in just 3 1/3 innings .
Peter Gammons and Buster Olney are baseball reporters for ESPN .
I have come across a couple of items recently involving market rationality and the ability of the market to reflect “ unknown ” information .
The first came in a conversation with my colleague Bryan Routledge .
Harkening back to the Challenger disaster , Bryan mentioned that “ the market ” quickly determined the company that caused the failure ( all this is my paraphrasing of my understanding of what Bryan said : it is my fault if it is wrong ! ) .
Here is the graph of the stock prices of the main companies involved in building the space shuttle on the day of the disaster :
There are four companies shown : Morton Thiokol , Lockheed , Martin Marietta , and Rockwell .
The stock price for all of the companies immediately dropped 7 - 8 % after the disaster .
Within an hour , three companies went back up to being just 2 - 3 % down , while one company further decreased : Morton Thiokol .
The company responsible for the O-ring ( of Richard Feynman and ice water fame ) : Morton Thiokol .
It is certainly provocative that the market seemed to know something immediately that took an investigation months to determine .
It would have been even more impressive if the market identified this an hour earlier ( the explosion happened at 11:39 AM ) , but the results from the day are still pretty impressive .
But , as Bryan reminds me , this was not exactly a mystery to everyone at the time : the engineers involved strongly suspected early what the issue was and later fed that information to Feynman .
So the information was out there and perhaps that information leaked out to the market in the immediate aftermath of the explosion .
So perhaps it is not so mysterious after all .
And there may well be other explanations for the larger drop off by Motton Thiokol .
Continuing the theme of markets seeming to have information that mere mortals do not , Panos Ipierotis , with tongue - in - cheek , suggested a prediction market on the P=NP question , arguing
So , if P=NP is a decidable problem , it is either true or false .
So , a fully rational agent , participating in the market , should know whether P=NP .
It is not a matter of probabilities !
All the information to make the decision is available .
So , if the market has one or more rational players , the market should converge to a price of 0 or 1 immediately , depending on the state of the problem .
Right ?
He then offers a few choices when the market , presumably , does not give such a result :
There are no rational agents .
So , all the analysis of prediction markets that assume rationality of traders is incomplete .
There are rational agents .
The market does not converge to 0 or 1 because the P=?NP problem is undecidable .
There are rational agents but the return from the risk - free rate until reaching the time to settlement exceeds the return from the market .
So , the market gives information on how long it will take for the problem to be officially solved .
If your laptop cannot find the solution , neither can the market .
These are not mutually exclusive : it could be more than one .
But I think it is pretty clear that there are no rational agents by this definition , and I think most or all economists will agree to that .
The concept of having a rational agent is no different than the assumption of linearity and divisibility and so on in linear programming .
A model cannot include everything ( a map that includes everything would be as large as the area mapped ) , so simplifications are made .
Some economic models include limits on rationality , or on information , or on timing , while others will give their agents more power / information / etc. than could occur in practice .
There is normally a tradeoff : with more detail on rationality may come limits in other areas , such as number of agents , or complexity of markets .
Given some set of assumptions , it is pretty easy to come up with a situation that exploits weaknesses in the assumptions .
If that is the case , those are the wrong assumptions to make !
So I would agree with Panos : “ all the analysis of prediction markets that assume rationality of traders is incomplete ” .
That “ incomplete ” analysis might still be useful .
To paraphrase the statistician George Box : all models are incomplete ; some are useful .
This concept was certainly seen by Feynman in the Challenger case when he questioned whether some of the mathematical models used were useful .
From Feynman ’s appendix to the Challenger Report :

( The Frisky ) -- A year ago , my average week was something like a " Sex and The City " episode .
Maybe it was n't that funny , maybe my clothes were n't that fabulous , and maybe there were n't that many hot - yet - problematic men , but there were guys , quite a few of them .
Weary of dating , writer rejects all men's profiles she sees on online dating sites .
I 'd never had a boyfriend in high school .
Then I went to an all - women 's college .
In my senior year , I was in a serious relationship .
When that did n't work out , I found a Pandora 's Box of pleasures in the City .
It was n't exactly easy to meet a guy of substance , but it was relatively simple to get a date .
All you had to do was poke around online , ask a friend to set you up , demand contact info of the guy you talked to at a party .
Dating culture became intertwined with what I imagined to be the " New York lifestyle " of twenty - something working girls .
At a certain point , I took it upon myself to look at dating as part of my job .
If I was going to work in the media and writing about relationships -- and myself in them -- I might as well play the part and score the experience .
My week 's schedule was obsessively booked .
At least one date a week .
On a good week , two dates .
On other nights , I was networking or out with my girlfriends , but my secret intention was finding my next rendezvous .
Most of the dates were bad , many epically so .
Mostly , they were completely mediocre : guys who were cocky , guys who did n't talk , guys who had boring jobs and lives , guys who talked about other girls .
No matter , I thought .
It would all be " practice dating , " so I would be completely confident in my choice when someone of quality came around .
As for those " quality " types , there were a few false alarms : the ones who , after four dates , I would tell my friends that we were on the road to girlfriend - boyfrienddom .
No .
Not even close .
The Frisky : Online behavior gets him vetoed
Some time around January , I stopped .
Not cold turkey , but I slowed things down a lot .
As if not wanting to admit to myself that I was n't made out to be a " dater , " I told myself that this slow period was about becoming more " selective . "
Then , selectivity gave way to jadedness , where I 'd laugh at most online profiles and think every guy at a party or bar was absolutely a loser .
The Frisky : 10 signs he 's a loser
After my " I need male attention " desire subsided , I realized how different things were .
I could n't tell if they were better , but I had way more time to myself .
I drank less and began to get really comfortable -- for the first time ever -- with being alone .
Not " alone " in the sense of being single , but spending less time around other people .
Once I left my office job , and became a work - at - home freelance writer , I was astounded .
It was incredible !
I could go for two days , sometimes more , without seeing anyone -- guys or friends .
The Frisky : Do you just NEED a significant other ?
Now , I 'm starting to realize how my comfort with being alone can become , well , dangerous if I let things go for too long without going out or catching up with a friend .
But , for the most part , I can't be dragged to any kind of evident singles event or bar with a hookup scene .
Every day , I receive a dozen or so emails from the dating Web sites that I 'm a member of .
" He 's waiting for you in Manhattan ! " " MrHotStuff345 Just Winked At You ! "
" Leonora , Your New Matches For New York City ! " scream the headlines .
Delete , delete , delete .
Go. Away .
I do n't even want to unsubscribe because that would mean I 'd have to log -in , and who knows how that would make me feel .
The Frisky : Some celebs embrace monogamy -- others not sure
Sometimes , though , I do start to wonder :
Does this mean I 'm depressed ?
Lack of romantic interest is a prime symptom , you know .
Whatever , I think .
Things will turn around .
For now , I 'm going to take myself to a movie and eat dinner alone , thank you very much .

Once the mud is dry , you head for the sea .
At all the resorts and beaches , there are life guards and ropes strung across the water to stop you going too far out .
The water is warm ( in winter ) and hot bath - like ( in summer ) , so there 's none of that English - seaside - holiday , " it 's lovely once you 're in ! " pleasure .
As you go into the sea , you 're likely to discover tiny cuts and grazes you did n't know you had , because they 'll sting like mad for a minute or so .
Those people unwise enough to shave any part of their bodies or faces on the day they go in the Dead Sea will regret it - it 'll make you go " ouch " !
Do n't get it in your eyes , and if a drop does go in an eye , do n't do the instinctive thing and rub your eye , it 'll sting more if you do that .
Just wait for your eye to wash itself clean .
The Dead Sea salt wo n't damage your eyes or anything , do n't worry about that .
It just hurts if you get it in your eyes !
Splashing in the Dead Sea is very anti-social , do n't do it if you want to make friends and influence people .
On the plus side , though , any cuts heal amazingly fast after a dip in the Dead Sea .
I cut my foot quite hard on my way into the waters on my first visit there , and while it hurt like mad for a minute or two , I 've never had a cut heal so fast .
You can't swim in the sea , you 'll be too buoyant .
But you can float amazingly well , and far higher out of the water than in any sea , lake or swimming pool you 've ever been in .
It 's wonderfully relaxing , and one of the most romantic experiences in my life so far is floating hand in hand with my other half while the sun set over the hills .
The water does n't feel like normal water , it 's much more oily feeling , but not at all unpleasant .
Rather , it soothes and cradles your body .
After you 've had enough , or been thrown out at closing time , there are fresh water showers on the beach near the sea ( colder than the sea , so very refreshing in summer ) and more showers and toilets in the changing blocks at the top of the beach .
Both Ein Gedi and the Mineral Beach also have hot - water sulphur pools , with the water in them coming not from the Dead Sea , but from mineral - rich springs which feed into the sea .
These are a wonderful experience after the Dead Sea itself .
> Gwen Le Berre does n't understand the ' ' electrometer ' ' machine he keeps in his Normandy bedroom .
He just knows it 's a piece of kit from the Church of Scientology , which he blames for his mother 's death .
Four days before Christmas 2006 , Gwen 's mother Gloria Lopez , a 47 - year - old secretary , tidied her kitchen , hung out her washing , left her dull , suburban apartment overlooking the railway in Colombes , west of Paris , and walked the 30 metres on to the tracks .
She stood with her arms outstretched , smiling at the driver of the oncoming commuter train .
He could n't stop in time .
After divorcing Pascal Le Berre , a French teacher , Lopez met Scientologists and signed up .
The church was to become her life .
Eventually , she moved to Paris , leaving her two children behind , to be nearer the Scientology Centre .
The Le Berres filed a legal complaint partly blaming Scientology for her death .
In 10 years as a Scientologist , they estimate , Lopez spent up to $ 400,000 on courses and books - despite her secretary 's salary of $ 3300 a month .
Her family claims she was counselled by Scientology financial advisers and decided to sell a property she had inherited in Spain .
'' They stole my mother , '' Gwen says .
'' I do n't feel I knew my mother apart from in her role as a Scientologist . ''
Several investigations and legal cases in France have prompted Scientologists to complain of a ' ' climate of hatred ' ' and a state - sponsored '' inquisition ' ' against them .
Together they have the potential to threaten Scientology 's survival in France and undermine it elsewhere .
Not only could its two flagship centres in France be closed down , but the church could be convicted of ' ' organised fraud ' ' .

The gentrifying Highland neighborhood is getting a medical - marijuana dispensary that plans to open around Aug. 3 at 2000 W. 32nd Ave. , kitty corner from the recently opened LoHi Steakbar .
The Releaf Center , owned and operated by Steven Sems rott , a medical - marijuana user himself as a result of scoliosis , will legally dispense up to 2 ounces of marijuana per person to patients who have a doctor ’s permit .
Colorado voters decided to legalize medical marijuana in 2000 .
Since then , dispensaries have been popping up all over the state .
Last month , the New Options Wellness Clinic , a medical - marijuana dispensary , was robbed in daylight by four men who pretended to be registered medical - marijuana users , according to a police report .
The men stole two 20 - gallon tubs of medical marijuana , cash and surveillance equipment but were arrested shortly after the heist .
“ I like the idea of helping people out , ” said Semsrott , an unemployed aviation worker .
“ Our clientele will definitely be a wide variety of patients from cancer to muscle spasms . ”
Semsrott said his store will likely be open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. except Sundays .
The opening of Maryjane ’s Pizza , a delivery - only spot open from 11 p.m. to 4:20 a.m. daily across the street from the Releaf Center , is purely coincidental , Semsrott said .

Speculation has been flying around in the news media and on the internet about who was behind Wednesday ’s gory bombings in Baghdad .
Let me lay out the various theories behing put forward , and then I ’ll come back and give my view .
If my conclusion is correct , it also helps answer the question of whether a return to some US patrolling in Baghdad and Mosul would be helpful .
Al - Hayat , writing in Arabic , says that the bombing attacks on Wednesday in Baghdad targeted the Ministries of Foreign Affairs , Finance and Education .
MP Ammar Tu’mah , deputy chair of the Security Committee in parliament , blamed the failure of the government to forestall these attacks on the lack of coordination among various security forces and the failure of various units to share intelligence , according to al - Hayat .
He has a point .
The Ministries of Defense and the Interior have different political colorations , and who the various domestic intelligence agencies really report to is not clear .
But the real question is who carried out these bombings and why .
I was watching Aljazeera in Arabic and they interviewed a Sunni Arab analyst from Baghdad who darkly hinted that the bombings might have been the work of a party unhappy with Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki dropping them from his coalition .
Al - Maliki ’s Islamic Mission ( Da ’wa ) Party is thought to be leaving the United Iraqi Alliance , the Shiite coalition that has in the past grouped fundamentalist parties such as the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , the Sadr Movement , the Islamic Virtue Party , and others .
( Several of these parties now have left or have an ambiguous relationship to the UIA , which is attempting to regroup ) .
So the Sunni analyst was implicitly blaming the Islamic Supreme Council or the Sadrists for the bombing .
The involvement of ISCI guards in a recent bank robbery in the capital , and of the Sadr splinter group Asa’ib Ahl al - Haqq in anti-Coalition violence in Basra , may have lent such charges some plausibility .
On the opposite side of the spectrum , al - Hayat says that the Iraqi List ( a nationalist grouping led by former appointed prime minister Ayad Allawi ) accused Iran of having a hand in the bombings .
Allawi is desperate , since his political party , which has 25 seats out of 275 , is falling apart .
Several prominent members had pulled out , and on Wednesday three more announced they were leaving .
They complained that he made all the decisions for the party in a high - handed way , ignoring the counsel of MPs and other party leaders .
And , they said , he had engaged in talks with Iran without the permission of the party or the Iraqi government .
The Iranian newspaper Tabnak reported in Persian on Allawi ’s contacts with Tehran , speculating that he was attempting to improve his chances of doing well in January ’s parliamentary elections ( Iran is influential with Iraqi Shiites ) .
Allawi ’s intemperate blaming of Iran could be seen as a hysterical attempt to shore up his nationalist credentials , or perhaps as a sign that his approach to the ayatollahs in Tehran was rudely rebuffed .
( During Allawi ’s term as appointed prime minister in 2004 , his cabinet was vociferously anti-Iranian ) .
Likewise , the Sunni Arab nationalist newspaper al - Zaman blamed the Jerusalem brigade of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards , in a shocking lapse of good journalistic practice , since it offers no evidence whatsoever for this serious allegation .
But I have a refutation .
Cabinet ministries in Iraq have thus far been vehicles for party patronage .
Thus , the Ministry of Finance is headed by long - time ISCI activist Bayan Jabr Sulagh , and its employees are disproportionately drawn from the Supreme Council .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is headed by Hoshyar Zebari , a Kurd from the Kurdistan Democratic Party , and anyone who has dealt with Iraqi diplomats cannot escape the impression that Kurds have special employment opportunities in that ministry .
The Ministry of Education is headed by Khudayr al - Khuzai , a former parliamentarian from the Islamic Mission Party ( Da ’wa ) – Iraq Organization , a branch of the same Shiite fundamentalist party to which al - Maliki belongs .
So the guerrillas who hit out at these ministries are very likely to have wanted to punish not only the central government but also the parties that control those ministries .
That ISCI bombed its own ministry of finance is not plausible .
Moreover , Iran is closely allied with the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and with the Kurds .
And we know exactly who hates ISCI , the Islamic Mission Party and the Kurdistan Democratic Party– all three .
It is the Sunni Arab guerrilla groups , whether the Baath Party or the radical fundamentalists .
So the conspiracy theory put forward by the Sunni Arab analyst just wo n’t hold water , and nor will the one trotted out by Allawi ’s group and al - Zaman .
Al - Hayat says that the Iraqi government is blaming an “ alliance of Baathists and al - Qaeda ” for the bombings .
But terrorist cells do n’t work that way .
Six coordinated bombings requires tight - knit and cohesive cells along with close command and control .
So it was likely one or the other .
Given the military discipline and precision of the operation , I suspect former Baath officers of involvement , regardless of their current ideology , whether secular or religious .
Looked at in this way , the attack on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , which was the most massive in firepower , deaths and woundings , was a continuation of the bombings last week of Shabak and Yazidi Kurdish villages outside the northern , largely Sunni Arab city of Mosul .
Mosul is a center for Arab nationalism , Baathism , and Sunni fundamentalism .
The Ilaf newspaper agrees with me that these bombings are a sign that elements in the Sunni Arab community are not reconciled to the rise of Shiite and Kurdish rule over Iraq .
The problem cannot be solved either by federalism or democracy , the newspaper argues .
Iraqi Sunni Arabs would not benefit from any kind of partition , even soft partition , since they do n’t have any developed hydrocarbon fields in their part of Iraq .
And the Iraqi parliament is so far set up with a single chamber where there is a tyranny of the Shiite majority .
So as I have hinted , I have a slight preference for the theory that ex-Baathist or neo-Baathist or generally Sunni Arab nationalists were behind the attacks .
A lot of ex-Baathist officers and leaders are hiding out in exile in Damascus .
As Al - Watan [ The Nation ] points our in Arabic , Iraqi prime minister Nuri al - Maliki visited Syria earlier this week .
While he was there , he is said to have given Syrian President Bashar al - Asad a list of Iraqis wanted by Baghdad who were thought to be hiding in Syria ( many of these would be Baathist officials or officers of the old Saddam Hussein regime ) .
In return , he offered Syria economic inducements , such as crude Iraqi petroleum at concessionary prices .
It was announced that Iraqi security officials would meet in Damascus with Syrian and American counterparts today , to discuss improving border security .
It is possible that elements of the Iraqi Sunni Arab resistance in exile in Syria , who are running terrorist cells inside Iraq , is letting al - Maliki that they will not allow themselves to be extradited and go to the gallows like Saddam Hussein without a fight , and that they can make al - Maliki ’s life miserable .
After all , al - Maliki has already more or less been running for prime minister in the upcoming January elections on the basis of his ability to get the American troops out of people ’s hair and to supply security in their stead .
It is easy for his Sunni Arab foes in Damascus and Mosul to undermine that claim with bombings like those on Wednesday .
Al - Maliki has been adamantly against negotiating with the Baathists or , indeed , any guerrilla group with blood on its hands .
A portion of the Sunni Arab community let him know Wednesday that they simply will not accept the new status quo .
Al - Maliki has surprised a lot of people by being much more assertive and much more successful in restoring security in places like Basra and Amara in the Shiite south , than many expected .
But unless he finds a way to reconcile with the Sunni Arabs , his political future is cloudy .
If , in turn , the main problem is that al - Maliki is pursuing a vendetta with elements of the Sunni Arab nationalist leadership , and they are lashing back out at him , then a return to having US troops patrol Baghdad would not in fact resolve the problem .
They might be able to make big bombings harder .
But these bombings have been going on since 2003 , and many big sanguinary explosions were set off under the nose of US troops all through those 6 years .
Especially if this is a political struggle , a short - term US military would not be the right solution .
The solution is for the Obama administration to play hard ball with al - Maliki in getting him to pursue national reconciliation .

Inspired by Eric Florenzano ’s talk , Using Django in Non-Standard Ways ( slides in PDF ) at DjangoCon and the announcement of Tornado ( tornadoweb.org ) , I decided to try building a small application using the Django Form library and Django ORM inside Tornado .
The process proved easier than I expected , especially with Russell Keith - Magee being able to provide guidance on demand .
Step 1 : Create Your Database
While Russell explained that it should be possible to get commands like syncdb running outside of a traditional Django project , it was outside the scope of this small experiment .
Instead , I created a Sqlite database manually .
For those of you that have forgotten how to do this , this will get you started :
# sqlite3 dev.db sqlite > CREATE TABLE message ( id integer primary key , subject varchar ( 30 ) , content varchar ( 250 ) ) ; sqlite > insert into message values ( 1 , ' subject ' , ' cool stuff ' ) ; sqlite > SELECT * from message ;
Step 2 : Write Your Application
With the database in place , you can create your application in a single file .
We ’ll call ours dj_tornado.py .
import sys import os import tornado .
httpserver import tornado.ioloop import tornado.web # django settings must be called before importing models from django.conf import settings settings.configure( DATABASE_ENGINE='sqlite3 ' , DATABASE_NAME=' dev.db ' ) from django import forms from django.db import models # Define your Model class Message ( models .
Model ) : " " " A Django model class .
In order to use it you will need to create the database manually .
sqlite > CREATE TABLE message ( id integer primary key , subject varchar ( 30 ) , content varchar ( 250 ) ) ; sqlite > insert into message values ( 1 , ' subject ' , ' cool stuff ' ) ; sqlite > SELECT * from message ; " " " subject = models . CharField( max_length=30 ) content = models . TextField(max_length=250 ) class Meta : app_label = ' dj ' db_table = ' message ' def __unicode__( self ) : return self .
subject + " -- " + self.content # Define your Form class DjForm ( forms . Form ) : subject = forms.CharField( max_length=100 , required =True ) content = forms .
CharField ( ) #
Define the class that will respond to the URL class ListMessagesHandler ( tornado.web.RequestHandler ) : def get ( self ) : messages = Message.objects.all( ) self.render ( " templates/index.html " , title = " My title " , messages=messages ) class FormHandler( tornado.web.RequestHandler ) : def get ( self ) : form = DjForm ( ) self.render ( " templates/form.html " , title = " My title " , form=form ) def post ( self ) : data = { ' subject':self.request.arguments [ ' subject '] [ 0 ] , ' content':self.request.arguments [' content '] [ 0 ] , } form = DjForm ( data=data ) if form.is_valid( ) : message = Message (**form.cleaned_data ) message.save( ) self.redirect ('/' ) else : self.render ( " templates/form.html " , title = " My title " , form=form ) # map the Urls to the class application = tornado.
web .
Application ( [ ( r " / " , ListMessagesHandler ) , ( r " / form / " , FormHandler ) , ] ) #
Start the server if __name__ == " __main__ " : http_server = tornado.httpserver.HTTPServer(application ) http_server.listen(8888 ) tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance ( ) . start ( )
Step 3 : Create Some Templates
As you have seen in the code above I am using 2 simple templates to render the responses .
Tornado syntax is very similar to Django / Jinja templates so Django developers should feel right at home here .
<!-- index.html --> < html > < head > < title > {{ title }}</title > </ head > < body > < ul > { % for message in messages %} < li>{{ escape( message.subject ) }} -- { { escape( message.content ) }}</li > { % end %} </ul > < a href= " / form / " >
Add</a> </ body > </html >
<!-- form.html --> < html > < body > < form action= " / form / " method= " post " > {{ form }} < input type =" submit " value= " Submit " /> </ form > </ body > </html >
Step 4 : Start Your Server
This is easy : # python dj_tornado.py
Step 5 : Profit !
Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8888 and enjoy your toy Tornado application .
While this application itself does n’t do much of anything exciting , it should give you a blueprint for how to use Django in “ non-standard ” ways and show you how to bring some of your familiar Django tools into different applications .
You can find the code example at http://bitbucket.org/yml/dj_tornado/.
I would be glad hear your opinion about this approach .
To really help " the last and the least " do you have to focus on " the lost " as well ?
Maybe not -- if you go by the statistics at Kiva , the international internet person - to - person micro-lending site where it appears that folks with no religion are spirited participants in efforts to uplift the world 's poorest .
Kiva , which kicked off in 2005 , is a global force in orchestrating small loans to individual whose business successes ripple through the lives of their families and communities .
Forbes once described it as mixing the " entrepreneurial daring of Google with the do - gooder ethos of Bono ... ”
According to the Associated Press , Kiva has raised more than $ 75 million for nearly 200,000 individuals in 44 countries and , this June , expanded the ranks of eligible entrepreneurs to struggling small businesses in the United States .
Last year Kiva added a gimmick for encouraging folks to lend ( and re-lend once their original $ 150 or so has been repaid ) through competition .
There are teams by organized dozens of ways including special interest groups , churches , businesses and more .
And who 's whomping the crowd overall ?
In first place , with $ 761,975 loaned -- Atheists , Agnostics , Skeptics , Freethinkers , Secular Humanists and the Non-Religious " committed to caring about suffering . "
Next in the listings : Kiva Christians ( $ 519,725 ) , followed by Team Obama ( $ 408,500 ) .
Sort by " Religious Congregations " to find that , topping Kiva Mormons ( $ 57,425 ) and Kiva Catholics ( $ 59,625 ) is the squadron devoted to the The Flying Spaghetti Monster ( $ 81,725 ) who sign on to give because " Thou shalt share , that none may seek without finding . "
Unfamiliar with the FSM parody " pastafarianism " ?

DO YOU THINK ... giving can be faith - free and still have " values ? "

Less cosmetically , but just as effectively , Ren , a pole dancer at a local sex joint called Scales and Tails , is in an isolation room after a bloody attack by a punter , so she too misses the bio-bug .
The women ’s past and present stories alternate and inter­twine , bringing to life the world they must survive in — a world where pigs have human brain tissue and sheep are bred with human hair in different colors , silver and purple being hot hits for whole - head implants , providing you do n’t mind smelling of lamb chops when it rains .
My favorite Atwood genetic invention is the liobam — a cross between a lion and a lamb , engineered by a lunatic fringe religious group that ’s tired of waiting for the prophecy of the lion lying down with the lamb to come true .
Their own breed has curly golden hair and long , sharp canines , and will look at you very gently while it rips your throat out — which is pretty much the metaphor for the world of lethal paternalism created by CorpSEcorps .
The sensitive CorpSEcorps elite boy Glenn , who becomes Crake , starts out as a teenage sympathizer for the Gardeners but is too seduced by his own brainpower to trust nature .
Like his friend Jimmy , Glenn does n’t know how to love , and the awkward devotion he feels for the girl he calls Oryx is not returned .
Atwood is very good at showing , without judging , what happens when human beings ( usually men ) cannot love .
In the worst of them , like Blanco the Bloat , brutality and sadism take over .
In the better of them , like Crake , a utopian desire for perfectability re­places the lost and lonely self .
Crake designs out love and romance because he wants to design out the pain and confusion of emotion .
In this strangely lonely book , where neither love nor romance changes the narrative , friendship of a real and lasting and risk - taking kind stands against the emotional emptiness of the money / sex / power / consumer world of CorpSEcorps , and as the proper antidote to the plague - ­mongering of Crake and Jimmy , for whom humankind holds so little promise .
As ever with Atwood , it is friendship between women that is noted and celebrated — friendship not without its jealousies but friendship that survives rivalry and disappointment , and has a generosity that at the end of the novel allows for hope .
Atwood believes in human beings , and she likes women .
It is Toby and Ren who take the novel forward from the last page , not the genetically engineered new humans .
Atwood is funny and clever , such a good writer and real thinker that there ’s hardly any point saying that not everything in the novel works .
Why should it ?
A high level of creativity has to let in some chaos ; just as nobody would want the world as engineered by Crake , nobody needs a factory - finished novel .
The flaws in “ The Year of the Flood ” are part of the pleasure , as they are with human beings , that species so threatened by its own impending suicide and held up here for us to look at , mourn over , laugh at and hope for .
Atwood knows how to show us ourselves , but the mirror she holds up to life does more than reflect — it ’s like one of those mirrors made with mercury that gives us both a deepening and a distorting effect , allowing both the depths of human nature and its potential mutations .
We do n’t know how we will evolve , or if we will evolve at all .
“ The Year of the Flood ” is n’t prophecy , but it is eerily ­possible .

Glad you liked it !
And Face , of course , I remember you !
I started posting this this on my birthday - July 30th - took me a while to get around to everyone .
I 've been pretty busy !
It has been literally been sent around the world !
Putting it together has taken me a couple of years !
I 'm not even going to guess at the number of hours !
But we needed it and no one else was doing it !
I would like abirthday present from each of you in return for all my work .
I would like each of you to pick one page and print it up with the URL of my post here , or at IC , or Cannabis.com .
Pick either a page at random , or one that has special significance for you .
I would like you to send it ( anonymously , if need be ) to your doctor , relative , friend , clergyperson , politician or just leave it in a public place like a laundromat , student lounge , slipped in a book on cannabis at the library , etc .
That would make my old heart happy !

For citizen journalists , the federal shield law front was looking good for a while .
Although the House of Representatives version of the bill , passed in April , only offered a shield to professional bloggers , the Senate version did n't differentiate between the pros and the amateurs .
So there was hope that amateur journalists might actually , eventually , get its protection .
No longer though .
Sadly , the Senate Judiciary Committee has followed the path of the House and opted to specify that only a " salaried employee . . . or independent contractor " will be able to invoke the shield , reports the Wall Street Journal 's Digits blog .
The amendment , offered by Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D ) of New York , limits the definition of a journalist to one who :
( iii ) obtains the information sought while working as a salaried employee of , or independent contractor for , an entity —
( I ) that disseminates information by print , broadcast , cable , satellite , mechanical , photographic , electronic , or other means ; and
( II ) that —
( aa ) publishes a newspaper , book , magazine , or other periodical ;
( bb ) operates a radio or television broadcast station , network , cable system , or satellite carrier , or a channel or programming service for any such station , network , system , or carrier ;
( cc ) operates a programming service ; or
( dd ) operates a news agency or wire service . . .
This language is in fact more restrictive than its
House counterpart , which only limits the shield to those who gather or disseminate news " for a substantial portion of [ their ] livelihood or for substantial financial gain . "
The Judiciary Committee 's " salaried employee . . . or independent contractor " language on its own would be sufficient to deprive most non-traditional journalists of protection .
But the requirement that the hosting entity both disseminate information by electronic means and operate a publishing , broadcasting , or news service of some kind ices it .
It 's hard to imagine that many amateur bloggers ( even those eking out enough money to pass the employee hurdle ) would qualify as " a news agency . "
Perhaps a blog dedicated to news and adhering to journalistic standards could be read to be " a news agency , " but I would n't want to rely on a judge making such a reading .
Clearly , this is disappointing .
Interestingly enough , it 's a bipartisan foreign policy think tank , the Partnership for a Secure America , that offers the most succinct summary I 've read explaining why the shield law should cover amateur journalists .
John Eden writes for the PSA 's blog :
In an era of instantaneous dissemination of information over the Internet by bloggers and other part - time pundits , it ’s hard to see why the privilege should be limited to journalists who are getting paid to collect news .
If what we care about is getting the most up - to - date , accurate information , why should it matter whether a blogger or a CNN reporter has delivered the news to us ?
Moreover , even if a meaningful distinction can be made between commercial and non-commercial journalists , in practice granting the privilege exclusively to commercial journalists is likely to spur costly , unnecessary disputes about who is or is n’t a bona fide journalist .
Amen .
Of course , a cynical fellow might suggest that perhaps the Senate is n't so concerned about people getting " the most up - to - date , accurate information . "
But I think it 's far more likely that citizen journalists just are n't on the radar of your average senator .
In the media whirlwind that is Washington , the only media that a Beltway insider is apt to recognize is the big , powerful corporation .
And blogs are just places that publish dirty little secrets or partisan ranting .
The idea that unpaid bloggers can actually provide legitimate journalistic services is just an alien concept .
So , it looks like the feds are n't going to come through , and citizen journalists will have to look to their own states and to the judiciary for shield law protections .
Because the states have been better about passing shield laws generally , it might not be too much to hope that they 'll be better about applying them to unpaid journalists .
Maybe they 'll even write bloggers in explicitly .
But for now , citizen journalists will have to continue their efforts with considerable uncertainty about shield law protection .

Claim :
The CDC has warned that the swine flu is wiping out villages in Asia and will kill 60 % of the U.S. population .
FALSE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , August 2009 ]
Latest on H1N1 straight from the CDC and Johns Hopkins Latest on H1N1 straight from the CDC and Johns Hopkins I ’m not a bearer of ‘ fear ’ , but think we all should pay attention to THIS one .
The CDC says H1N1 is currently wiping out entire villages in Asia .
They expect it to hit the US in Jan / Feb where it will kill 6 out of 10 people .
It HAS mutated .
( Throw out the conspiracy theory )
They will attempt a program of mandatory vaccinations but probably will not have enough time to enforce it .
I will not be vaccinated .
The last time they did mandatory vaccinations at least one person died and many others developed Guillain - Barré syndrome , which is a devastating illness .
They have not let the public know because they do n’t want people to panic , but to people who know , they are suggesting the following : Start stocking up on food now .
They expect that martial law will be put into effect .
You wo n’t be able to go to work or shop for food — you will be shot .
Buy facial masks made by 3M – # N95 .
Use Purell obsessively .
Oh , this is interesting :
This pandemic was predicted years ago by a Russian mathematician .
It ’s impetus was the Tsunami a few years ago .
I know that by spreading this information I ’m taking the risk of looking like an alarmist , but this is straight from the mouths of the CDC and Johns Hopkins .
Origins : When the A( H1N1 ) virus , commonly known as the “ swine flu , ” was
identified in April 2009 , it quickly became a hot news topic and a subject of widespread discussion that prompted many people to seek out information about its causes , effects , rate of spread , methods of prevention or avoidance , etc .
The intense public interest in the U.S. has abated somewhat since then but will likely pick up as North America approaches its “ flu season ” of fall and winter .
Meanwhile , viral ( no pun intended ) e-mails on the subject of swine flu have continued to circulate ; unfortunately , most of them are alarmist collections of unsubstantiated , exaggerated , or outright false information .
The item cited above is one example of such — nearly every statement it contains falls into one of these classes :
The CDC says H1N1 is currently wiping out entire villages in Asia
If swine flu were truly wiping out “ entire villages in Asia , ” this would be a major event reported by news media around the world .
Yet no such reports have appeared either in the news or on the web site of the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , and the latest update from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) records only 1,154 confirmed H1N1 - related deaths worldwide .
( The WHO ’s tracking chart of confirmed H1N1 deaths shows only one area with more than 10 deaths in all of Asia . )
They expect it to hit the US in Jan / Feb where it will kill 6 out of 10 people .
The CDC has not made any statement to the effect that it expects swine flu to kill 60 % of the U.S. population ( or even 60 % of the U.S. residents who contract it ) .
The A( H1N1 ) virus has been classified as “ relatively mild ” since it was first detected in April 2009 , and the CDC simply notes that swine flu activity in the U.S. is expected to increase as winter approaches , with the potential for the disease to — in addition to other viruses — cause significant illness ( including , in some cases , death ) :
Given ongoing novel H1N1 activity to date , CDC anticipates that there will be more cases , more hospitalizations and more deaths associated with this pandemic in the United States over the summer and into the fall and winter .
The novel H1N1 virus , in conjunction with regular seasonal influenza viruses , poses the potential to cause significant illness with associated hospitalizations and deaths during the U.S. influenza season .
Even in the absence of an effective vaccine , the WHO ’s current projections estimate only that one out of every three persons worldwide might contract swine flu over the next two years , resulting in “ thousands of deaths ” among a group of 2 billion people — nowhere near the 60 % mortality rate claimed above .
It HAS mutated .
To the contrary , as of late August 2009 the CDC was still reporting that the H1N1 flu strain was not mutating :
The H1N1 flu strain does n’t appear to be mutating as it makes its way through the Southern Hemisphere , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a briefing .
The H1N1 flu strain does n’t appear to be mutating as it makes its way through the Southern Hemisphere , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a briefing .
One of the biggest fears has been that the virus , which first appeared in April in the U.S. and Mexico and which people do n’t have any built - up immunity to , might mutate into an even more dangerous form .
Health officials have been keeping a close watch on the Southern Hemisphere , which is in its winter season now , to see what form of the virus is likely to travel north as fall comes to the U.S. and the rest of the Northern Hemisphere .
Flu viruses are unpredictable , so the fact that this one has n’t mutated is “ somewhat reassuring ” said Jay Butler , director of CDC’s H1N1 Vaccine Task Force .
Case numbers in the Southern Hemisphere appear to be dropping , he said .
They will attempt a program of mandatory vaccinations but probably will not have enough time to enforce it .
A swine flu vaccine is not expected to be widely available in the U.S. until mid-October 2009 .
Although Secretary of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) Kathleen Sebelius announced in July 2009 that the federal government expects to initiate a swine flu vaccination program in the fall , she also stated that the program would be voluntary , not mandatory :
Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told [ attendees of a flu summit ] that they should prepare for a mass vaccination program this fall , the start of the traditional U.S. flu season .
Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told [ attendees of a flu summit ] that they should prepare for a mass vaccination program this fall , the start of the traditional U.S. flu season .
“ While we have made no final decisions about its scope , and have ‘ off ramps ’ built into our decision - making process if the circumstances change , at this point , we expect to initiate a voluntary fall vaccination program against the 2009 H1N1 flu virus , ” Mrs. Sebelius said .
“ This will depend on the availability of a safe vaccine and the absence of changes in the virus that would render the vaccine ineffective . ”
The last time they did mandatory vaccinations at least one person died and many others developed Guillain - Barré syndrome , which is a devastating illness .
This statement is presumably a reference to the 1976 Swine flu vaccination program , known as the National Influenza Immunization Program ( NIIP ) .
Although a causal connection was never definitively established , the possibility that the vaccine might have resulted in an increased incidence of Guillain - Barré syndrome ( GBS ) , an inflammatory disorder in which the body ’s immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system , was one of the factors that led to the termination of the program :
What NIIP did not and could not survive was finding cases of Guillain - Barré syndrome ( GBS ) among persons receiving swine flu immunizations .
As of 1976 , >50 “ antecedent events ” had been identified in temporal relationship to GBS , events that were considered as possible factors in its cause .
The list included viral infections , injections , and “ being struck by lightning . ”
Whether or not any of the antecedents had a causal relationship to GBS was , and remains , unclear .
When cases of GBS were identified among recipients of the swine flu vaccines , they were , of course , well covered by the press .
Because GBS cases are always present in the population , the necessary public health questions concerning the cases among vaccine recipients were “ Is the number of cases of GBS among vaccine recipients higher than would be expected ?
And if so , are the increased cases the result of increased surveillance or a true increase ? ”
Leading epidemiologists debated these points , but the consensus , based on the intensified surveillance for GBS ( and other conditions ) in recipients of the vaccines , was that the number of cases of GBS appeared to be an excess .
It should be noted , however , that the primary reason for the termination of the NIIP was that the feared swine flu epidemic it was intended to combat never occurred .
Had there been a swine flu epidemic , the benefits of timely vaccinations would have far outweighed the relatively small risks :
Had H1N1 influenza been transmitted at that time , the small apparent risk of GBS from immunization would have been eclipsed by the obvious immediate benefit of vaccine - induced protection against swine flu .
However , in December 1976 , with > 40 million persons immunized and no evidence of H1N1 transmission , federal health officials decided that the possibility of an association of GBS with the vaccine , however small , necessitated stopping immunization , at least until the issue could be explored .
Since a current swine flu vaccine has yet to be put through clinical trials and rolled out to large numbers of people , no one could possibly know what connection ( if any ) there might be between such a vaccine and GBS .
Moreover , it ’s something of a logical disconnect to assert that a particular contagion is going to cause the death of 60 % of the population , yet suggest people should avoid being vaccinated for it because of a minuscule chance that taking the vaccine might result in the recipient ’s contracting a different illness .
They have not let the public know because they do n’t want people to panic .
They expect that martial law will be put into effect .
These types of statements are commonly found ( almost verbatim ) in all manner of unsubstantiated , alarmist e-mails , covering scenarios from
Y2K - related chaos to the United States ’ surrendering its sovereignty to the United Nations .
We have yet to encounter a single case in which such statements proved to be true .
This is straight from the mouths of the CDC and Johns Hopkins .
As noted above , neither the CDC ( nor Johns Hopkins ) has issued any such statements as the ones claimed above .
Rather than relying on and disseminating misinformation about swine flu passed along through anonymous , unsourced e-mails , we ’d advise readers to obtain their information from reputable public health agencies such as the CDC and the WHO .

Adidas provides kit to some of the world 's best - known football teams
Sportswear giant Adidas has reported a fall in profits for the April to June period of 93 % as consumer spending fell during the economic downturn .
Net profit came in at 8 m euros ( $ 11.5 m ; £ 6.8 m ) , compared with 117 m euros for the same period a year earlier .
Sales fell 2.5 % to 2.46 bn euros .
But the company was upbeat about its prospects for the rest of the year .
" I believe we have seen the bottom in our financial performance this year , " said Adidas boss Herbert Hainer .
" We did not see any fundamental deterioration in our business since publishing our first - quarter results ...
I am confident that our results will improve as we go through the remainder of the year , " he added .
Sales grew in the US and in Latin America , but fell in most major European and Asian markets .
The company also said that profit margins were squeezed due to higher operating costs and an increasingly competitive retail environment .
For the full year to date , the company reported a profit of 12 m euros , down 96 % on the same period a year ago .
Sales were down 2 % to 5.03 bn euros .
Adidas is the world 's second - biggest sporting goods maker , after Nike .
The German firm bought Reebok in 2006 to help it compete against Nike .
It also owns the Taylormade golf brand , where sales actually increased during the second quarter .
When you play Blackjack , you need to collect cards so that the sum of their values gets as close as possible to 21 , but not above .
The tricky thing is that an Ace can count both as 1 or 11 , whatever suits better for you .
So how do we find the best value of a dealt set of cards ?
Well , somhow we have to sum over all combinations .
For example if you have an ace and a three , you could represent them as 3 and [ 1 , 11 ] in your program .
What you want as a result is the array [ 4 , 14 ] .
The cross meta - operator lets us apply a + pairwise on all possible combinations of a list ( shown on Rakudo's REPL ) :
> say ( 1 , 11 X+ 3 ) .perl [ 4 , 14 ]
In principle some of the values could have been greater than 21 ( if you had two aces ) , so let 's filter out only those that are at most as large as 21 , and find the maximum :
> say [ max ] ( 1 , 11 X+ 3 ) .grep ( {$ _ <= 21} ) 14
max is an operator that gives us the larger of two values , and the reduction operator [...] applies this pair wise to all list items .
Now that works , but you can have more than two cards on your hand , so we need to generalize it a bit ..
In a perfect Perl 6 world we could simply write [ max ] ( [ X+ ] @cards ) .
grep : { $_ <= 21} ; , but that requires a quite complicated thing named slice context , which Rakudo does n't implement yet .
So we have to work around the non-working [ X + ] by doing the reduction manually :
> my @cards = [ 1 , 11 ] , 4 , [ 1 , 11 ] ; say [ max ] @cards.reduce ( { @^a X+ @^b }).grep : { $ _ <= 21 } 16
( Note : splitted on two lines for readability , but should really be on one line . )
The reduce method does ( roughly ) the same as the equally named sub in Perl 5's List : : Util module : it calls the block with two arguments , where the first one is the previous return value from the block ( or the first array item on the first call ) , and the second is the next list item .
The difference is that in Perl 5 the arguments are stored in the special variables $ a and $b ( about which strict . pm does n't complain ) , whereas in Perl 6 they are passed as ordinary arguments to the block .
The ^ twigil ( secondary sigil ) specifies that the value of that variable should be taken from the parameter list , in lexicographic order of all such variables in the block .
Since X+ operates on lists and not on array references , the arguments needs to be derefences .
In Perl 5 you 'd write that as @{...} , in Perl 6 you can simply bind to a @ - sigiled variable - with the slight difference that the derefencing on a number is not an error , but simply returns a list of that number .
( you can write the same thing a bit simpler with junctions , but that does n't demonstrate the meta operators , and is discouraged for other reasons ) .
You see that you can still write scary code with Perl 6 , and I hope you will play around with it a bit , join us on #perl6 and have the appropriate amount of fun !
Funny and Unusual Road Signs from Around the World
In any city you visit , you will see road signs .
While that is a fact , some of them can be quite unusual and unique .
These 10 hilarious road signs shows the originality in pranksters and in the people who post the signs .
The signs vary from one that says , " There may be trouble ahead " to a warning that a bicyclist may fall in the mouth of an alligator .
There is even one where you must even yield to a policeman trying to catch a drunk person .
While a recent report from the National Academies of the Sciences concluded that conservation is the short - term key to many energy issues , work continues on alternative energy production techniques like wind , solar , biomass , and fuel cells .
For mobile applications , fuel cells have quickly become the technological leader because they offer high energy density ( relative to other green technologies ) , low weight , and generally high mechanical durability .
In this month 's Biosensors and Bioelectronics , a research team from University of Massachusetts Amherst describes their work on microbial fuel cells enhanced by directed evolution .
A wide array of fuel cell technologies exist , but most fall into two catagories : solid oxide fuel cells ( SOFCs ) or polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells ( PEMFCs ) .
SOFCs conduct O2 - across ceramic membranes and produce high current densities with little degradation over time .
Unfortunately , the ionic conduction mechanism requires high operating temperatures — usually several hundred degrees centigrade .
PEMFCs conduct either protons or hydroxyls , but suffer from low current densities and significant degredation over time .
While these systems show substantial promise , there is no clear leader for most mobile applications and there is room in several niche markets for other types of fuel cells .
To produce ATP , bacteria generate charge gradients when metabolizing nutrients , and these could theoretically be harvested .
In the early 1990 's , proof - of - concept microbial fuel cells ( MFCs ) were developed using bacterial electrolytes .
These systems fed simple sugars to bacteria in anaerobic conditions and with an applied field .
Electrons produced during digestion move to the anode while protons diffuse to the cathode , where they can recombine with any electrons that have conducted across a load circuit .
In order to produce electricity , it is imperative that MFC 's bacteria conduct electrons to the cathode .
The researchers at UMass Amherst realized that there has never been any natural selective pressure that would enhance electronic conduction in bacteria , so they used directed evolution to produce highly conducting bacteria .
G. sulfurreducens bacteria were cultured on a graphite electrode under a 400 mV applied bias .
The goal was to force the bacteria to adapt to conditions inside the MFC with the hope that they would evolve greater functionality in the process .
Several colonies were isolated after five months in the MFC environment and re-cultured under normal conditions .
When placed in an MFC cell , the specially cultured bacteria grew much more rapidly — current saturated after 50 hours as opposed to 400 hours — and they provided twice the current density of normally cultured bacteria .
Analysis of the enhanced bacteria showed that there were two primary adaptions .
First , pili , fine , thread - like structures that connect neighboring cells , dramatically increased in the new bacteria .
These structures are thought to be responsible for electronic conduction in bacterial films .
Also , unlike their precursors , the enhanced bacteria all had flagella that allowed both motility and enhanced attachment to anode surfaces .
It is unclear which adaptation is primarily responsible for the enhanced performance .
MFCs must show significant improvement ( orders of magnitude ) in order to match SOFCs and PEMFCs ; simply doubling performance will not make them viable for most applications .
However , by harnessing evolution , it may be possible to rapidly accelerate development of reasonably performing systems .
As a member of the ceramic research community with vested interests in SOFC development , I am not quite ready to salute my new bacterial overlords , but this is a fascinating area of research that has real potential in many niche applications .

Jenson Button has now done enough to assure himself of the world championship after taking a decent haul of points in the Singapore Grand Prix .
That is the view of McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh , who thinks that the 15 - point advantage that Button holds as he heads into Japan is big enough to ensure he is the man who will succeed Lewis Hamilton as title winner .
" It is not the most exciting way to win the championship , but I think you have got to score the points , " said Whitmarsh about the impact on Button 's fifth placed finish in Singapore .
" Jenson is under a lot of pressure and when you have not won a world championship there is enormous pressure there , especially if it is your team - mate who is challenging you .
" I think he did a solid job here and one has to say , I do n't think it is mathematically done yet , but it looks like he has got the championship , which is a fantastic achievement . "
He added : " It is not easy to win a championship , whatever advantage you start with by way of a car .
He obviously had a decent flying start to the season , but he did a real solid job to make sure he was in a position to take that championship . "
Button has experienced great highs and lows during the season - with a dominant start to the season that saw him win six of the first seven races followed by a poor spell where he has struggled to finish on the podium .
Although that form has not been helped by his Brawn GP car struggling to get heat into its tyres , Button has also had to keep his nerve as his title rivals started cutting away at his lead .
Whitmarsh has acknowledged that things have not been totally straightforward for Button , but says that does not detract from the job he has done in 2009 .
" I think he has wavered a little bit in truth , but I think he has been around some time , he is a very smooth driver , an intelligent driver and all he had to do was keep his head and he was going to win the championship given the start he had , " explained Whitmarsh .
" I am sure he will go away from this event feeling more relaxed .
He will still have some tension , as it is very easy to crash out at the next event with Rubens winning , which will be a 10 - point swing - and we 've been there , the last two seasons have been like that for us .
He just has to stay calm , and if he does not make any mistakes he will win , but that in itself brings tension to you . "
Whitmarsh has also said that he is not surprised Button has found it hard at times to keep up the form he showed at the start of the year .
" With a championship , particularly for someone like Jenson who has been around a long time and may feel that this is his one opportunity ever in his life to fulfil his childhood ambition , that is enormous , enormous pressure , " he explained .
" I am pleased for him , it will be great for him to relax and I am sure he can cruise to the championship win . "
Would n’t you know it :
After putting down Warzone 2100 , after tearing myself away from Neverwinter Nights , after silently rejoicing that the Sierra FTP server went offline , after weaning myself off Dwarf Fortress , and after prying my bloody fingertips away from Freecell , I try out this lovely little gem .
And would n’t you know it , now I have another addiction — Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe .
Simulators and city simulations are never very big with me , but I enjoy this one for it ’s toss - up feel between Roller Coaster Tycoon , something I played a long time ago , and Railroad Tycoon II , which was an excellent exercise in thematic immersion ( and quite possibly , one of the best games ever made ) .
No guarantees this will be the one that sends you to gamers anonymous , but it ’s got the potential in all the ways I like — emphasis on detail over action , flexibility over plot and replayability over rewards and achievements .
This is another game , like Dwarf Fortress , which gives a completely different experience by changing one small fundamental variable .
The Arch rendition installs in a matter of seconds too .
Honestly speaking , the premise is very simple — make money in the transportation business — but the interface is easy to learn , the game itself is a snap to get started , and the online support is top - notch .
I recommend it , but only if you can spare the time you ’ll spend glued to the map , adjusting transport routes and counting the money you make .
You have been warned . 😈

They say that a change is as good as a rest , and many people who 've made sharp turns in their working lives report the invigorating effect of undertaking novel activities in fresh surroundings .
In the current climate , though , for those experiencing , or threatened with , redundancy a period of enforced rest might be the only option before the economy picks up .
Some will use that time to acquire new skills to enhance their employability and reduce their vulnerability to redundancy in the future .
For many in that category , a move towards working in the environmental sector , or adding some environmental credentials to their existing CV , might be the way back into employment and , more important , job security .
The fact that many people are switching roles into this broad area of work is reflected in the continued growth in membership of the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment ( IEMA ) , the leading umbrella organisation which promotes best practice in the sector , and whose members work within it .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Membership is rising all the time , " says IEMA 's acting chief executive , Martin Baxter .
" It 's gone up 5 per cent since the beginning of this year and now stands at nearly 14,700 . "
But the attractiveness of jobs in " green " roles means there 's plenty of competition for vacancies , so there 's a word of caution from IEMA 's membership director , Claire Lea .
" Environment is a popular area , it is high profile in the press and high on the Government 's agenda with regard to skills for a low - carbon economy .
So it 's important for anyone considering a career change to think about what particular job roles or areas interest them , " she says .
" The range of environment jobs is really wide , and depending on the area you choose , the training and development needed to secure a position will vary . "
An exhaustive list of roles in the green sector would take pages to complete , and be out of date almost immediately , since the sector is expanding all the time , but there are two broad categories .
The first includes the in - house environmental co-ordinators or managers working within organisations whose main function is something else , possibly banking , selling computers or making car components .
A large multinational body may have a mini hierarchy of 30 people in these roles , while a smaller organisation will have just one .
Then there is the growing number of environmental consultancies whose staff give advice to organisations on a range of environmental issues , such as energy efficiency , waste management , noise and air pollution , and sustainable use of resources .
A large proportion of these consultancies are sole operators , often people who used to work in large organisations and have now set up on their own .
Some are highly specific , with activities concentrating on a narrow area .
An example in this last category is Betts Ecology , a Worcestershire - based firm that specialises in the assessment of proposed development sites with regard to any protected species , including animals , birds , insects or plants .
Specialist ecologists from Betts visit sites , looking for bats , newts , otters , owls and countless more species , and ensure their environment is protected during and after any building work .
The contrast between a job involving night work on a bat survey and one monitoring the gas coming out of a factory chimney underlines the importance of doing research before deciding to target the environmental sector in a search for new employment .
Lea 's advice is to talk to people who have done or are doing the types of roles that interest you , to find out what they actually do when they 're at work .
Many firms will be happy to allow people in to shadow someone for a day , which is as good a way as any of judging whether or not you are likely to be comfortable in that working environment .
Many such career changers are helped by Allen and York , one of the biggest specialists in recruitment in the environment sector , with 55 consultants devoted to such work .
The firm 's business manager , Joe Heppenstall , who used to be an environmental surveyor , says some people manage to move across to the sector with little or no extra training .
" The biggest area here is people with generic project management skills , picked up in another industry , such as construction , for example , " he says .
Or sometimes experience of a specific business role proves easily transferable .
Allen and York managed a move recently for a telecommunications firm employee , whose role was buying land for new masts .
He moved to a role buying land to site wind turbines .
Other career movers will need only a small amount of retraining to operate in an environmental field .
For example , people who have generic skills at assessment and report writing .
Heppenstall knows of environmental consultancies that take such people on and give them training to become environmental assessors , visiting offices , factories and other workplaces .
" There 's evidence showing that people in this category are taking a pay cut to get into the sector , but also that they are working their way up pretty quickly , which shows that in the sector the cream will rise to the top , " he says .
Among those taking a pay cut to make this sort of a career move are those who have been forced into the position by redundancy , many of whom are given a pot of training money by the employer they 're leaving as a means of trying to help them find a new career .
Recruitment agencies are often called in by the HR departments of firms cutting jobs , asking for advice to help staff spend their training money on acquiring skills needed in the environmental sector .
Such money can help to pay for a relevant specialist Masters degree or , if the candidate is starting from scratch , towards a basic qualification covering essential starter knowledge .
Here the IEMA Associate Certificate course , which includes the core knowledge that people need to be active in any environmental role , has gained widespread recognition across the industry .
The course , which consists of 10 days of study , is run by training organisations across the country , approved by IEMA , with fees ranging from £ 1,500 to £ 2,000 .
IEMA 's website ( www.iema.net) carries adverts for many of these courses , and also has details of its own workshops providing more in - depth training in numerous specialist areas .
In that regard , Chris Kiernan , head of the environmental section of Cobalt Recruitment , endorses the importance for aspiring career changers of beefing up CVs to demonstrate specialist knowledge .
He suggests the BRE ( formerly the Building Research Establishment ) as an example of a source of information about relevant qualifications for those targeting jobs with a construction element .
But he also stresses the value of highlighting generic business and employment skills picked up in earlier , non-environmental roles .
" While you may not tick all the boxes in a purely technical sense , do think about core transferable skills which the prospective employer would benefit from : skills such as project management , current commercial and financial responsibility , team - working , presentation , communication and IT , " he explains .
" These all feature heavily in an employer 's decision - mak ing process . "
' I 've booked myself on courses to increase my knowledge '
Natalie Loben is operations director for Betts Ecology , which specialises in surveying sites for the presence of protected species .
She joined the firm in 2007 after working as an IT manager for a big car franchise .
" We provide builders and landowners with a solution to ecological requirements on their sites , relating to protected species .
To this end , we do site surveys and get involved in planning applications and sometimes litigation , which we are doing more and more of , because people are finding it difficult to navigate their way through Euro legislation .
My role is to control the ecologists who go out on site , so I 'm learning an awful lot day by day about ecology .
For example , I now know that the great crested newt season ( when they can be seen and surveyed ) is from mid-March to mid-June , and the bat season is from May to September .
I 've booked myself on courses to increase my knowledge ; I 'm going on one soon , organised by Ciria ( Construction Industry Research and Information Association ) on wildlife on building sites .
The biggest difference in this job is that the ecologists who I 'm working with here are out on site most of the time , so they have to manage themselves .
I can't control them like I could the machines and the people in my previous job , and it 's been hard letting go of that .
Also the ecologists are not at all interested in the money side – even though we are a commercial business .
They 're just interested in the animals , so it can be hard for me sometimes to control costs for our clients .
I 've been surprised at how many other organisations there are out there that do what we do .
The competition is fierce .
I enjoy the job , although it can sometimes be more frustrating than when I was working in IT ; but it can also be much more rewarding . "
' We give staff extra holiday for every day they cycle to work '
Joanna
Foy is environmental officer for Forster , the communications and PR company , which has 51 staff at its central London offices .
She moved to this role two years ago from a post as assistant to the chief executive .
" I 'm responsible for the targets on reducing emissions and improving our all - round environmental performance that we set ourselves after our annual environmental audit performed by an external consultant .
I encourage staff to take up initiatives , for example our cycling and walking - to - work scheme .
We give staff five minutes extra holiday for every day they cycle or walk to work , which means if they do that every day , they get an extra two and a half days holiday .
The company bought two Brompton ( collapsible ) pool bikes for staff to use when going to meetings in London .
The reaction has been really positive .
Cycling on business trips has gone from zero to 10 per cent in six months .
Another way we try to reduce our energy usage is by giving out sweatshirts to staff in September and October , so we can hold off turning the heating on for a month or so .
And at a company meeting last year , we gave out a winter survival kit , consisting of a woolly hat , some knitting needles and instructions on how to knit , and also some vitamin C tablets and echinacea , to keep the immune system boosted .
We 've also installed a wormery , which sits on a balcony , to turn our organic material – including apple cores and banana skins – into compost .
And I 'm responsible for our supplier screening , making sure they observe standards that come up to our policies .
That gives me lots of interaction with other organisations , and , with sustainability events I attend , helps me keep in touch with other ideas . "
The endowment , called Starr International Foundation , is run by former AIG chairman Hank Greenberg , and has given millions to the Sept. 11 Memorial and Museum , Citymeals and other local groups .
At issue is a legal conundrum that started in the 1970s , when Greenberg was building AIG into the world 's largest insurance empire , and wanted a way to reward his executives off the books .
He and several co-founders set up their own offshore piggy bank -- unaffiliated with AIG ownership -- and seeded it with their own stock shares that would pay dividends and build up nest eggs and bonuses for retiring executives .
The separate company , Starr International Co. , worked well for decades .
But in 2005 , Greenberg was pushed out of AIG in a boardroom coup , foreshadowing AIG 's collapse .
Greenberg closed his piggy bank for any future bonuses beyond 2005 , though AIG executives who had vested by that point can collect when they turn 65 .
The rest of the AIG shares held by Starr International Co. -- about 290 million -- were transferred to a charitable subsidiary , Starr International Foundation .
AIG said it 's entitled to the whole pot of stock going back to 2005 , when it was worth about $ 20 billion .
A year ago , it was worth nearly $ 11 billion , until AIG 's recent collapse .
At Friday 's close , the shares were worth $ 490 million .
AIG says it has the right to seize the stock because Greenberg set up the company specifically for company employees .
The insurer says in a legal filing that it needs the foundation 's money " for the exclusive purpose of being distributed to AIG employees in the future . "
AIG intends to go to trial in federal court June 15 .
AIG lawyers said in documents it would seek not just the shares still left in the foundation 's coffers , but the shares the foundation already cashed out in the past three years to raise $ 27 million in grant money .
That money went to groups like the Sept. 11 Museum ( $ 1 million ) , Seedco ( $ 500,000 ) and Citymeals ( $ 250,000 ) .
xslt-utf8- decode
Overview
xslt - utf8 - decode provides UTF - 8 decoding functionality to XSLT 2.0 stylesheets .
UTF - 8 strings are represented as sequences of integers , with each integer representing an octet .
My God , why ?
I wanted to decode percent - encoded strings that you might find in a URI query string .
I wanted that to support UTF - 8 - encoded non-ASCII characters .
After spending too many hours on this , I decided that this was probably a really bad idea for long - term maintainability .
Nevertheless , I did n't want to throw this work away .
Security
The decoder tries to faithfully follow RFC3987 and its security warnings .
Overly - long UTF - 8 sequences and UTF - 16 surrogate words are detected and replaced with U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER ( � ) , as are octets that do n't belong in a decodable sequence .
If you discover an error that you believe might have security implications , please contact me immediately at the below e-mail address .
You are encouraged to use OpenPGP to sign your e-mail , and encrypt it to the public key identified below .
Correctness
A trivial test was performed : the decoder correctly decodes a UTF - 8 sequence ( 4,382,557 octets in length ) of each of the 1,112,033 characters allowed in XML , once , in sequence from the lowest - numbered codepoints to the highest .
On a dual 32 - bit Xeon machine at 2.4GHz , with Saxon - B 9.0.0.4 on Sun 's Java 6 JRE , this required about 1GB of RAM , and took about a few minutes .
Query String Parameters
Included is an example library which decodes a query string and represents the ampersand - delimited parameters as XML elements .
An XSLT parameter is defined to hold a query string .
When this parameter is given , an XSLT variable holds the XML representation of the decoded string .
Alternatively , an XPath function is provided to decode any query string and represent the result in the same XML form .
Each ampersand - delimited parameter is encoded into XML with an element in the http://www.thoughtcrime.us/ns/xslt-query-params namespace .
The localname of the element is the parameter " key " — the part of the query parameter before the equal sign ( if any ) .
( If the key can't be represented as an XML element localname , the parameter is omitted . )
If there is a parameter " value " — the part after the first equal sign , if any — it appears as a text node under the element ; the element is empty otherwise .
Keys and values are " plus - decoded " ( " + " becomes " % 20 " ) , " percent - decoded " to sequences of UTF - 8 octets ( % 21 becomes " ! " ) , and UTF - 8 decoded to strings .
Elements with the same key may appear more than once .
For example , given this query string :
ebat%c3%b5en%c3%a4oline-n%c3%a4ide=dead+beef+caf%c3%A9%21&​boolean-param&​repeating-param=foo&​repeating-param=bar&​non-unicode-heart=%3C3
The included XPath function qp:decode - query - string would return a sequence of these elements ( each in the http://www.thoughtcrime.us/ns/xslt-query-params namespace ) :
< ebatõenäoline - näide > dead beef café ! </ ebatõenäoline -näide > < boolean - param /> < repeating - param > foo </ repeating - param > < repeating - param > bar </ repeating - param > < non-unicode - heart > < 3 </ non-unicode - heart >

( CNN ) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez revealed a deeply personal side in an interview Thursday night , saying he loves Jesus Christ and would have liked to play Major League baseball in Yankee Stadium .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez spoke highly of President Obama at the United Nations on Thursday .
He also expressed a fondness for American people and culture , saying he likes the movie actor Charles Bronson and the poet Walt Whitman .
He loves to sing , he said , though he does not do it well .
And Chavez had kind words for the U.S. security detail protecting him during his visit to New York , saying he chatted with them while out walking and that they " have been very gracious , very efficient and very attentive , very kind . "
In an exclusive interview with CNN's Larry King , Chavez spoke at length about a host of issues : relations between Venezuela and the United States and his hopes for improved ties with President Barack Obama ; Iran , Israel and those who deny that the Holocaust existed ; efforts to overthrow him and have him assassinated ; criticism that he is power hungry and trying to silence critics .
Chavez , a self - proclaimed socialist , spoke with King a few hours after giving a speech to the U.N. General Assembly , in which he praised Obama but criticized some U.S. policies .
Watch Chavez speak at the U.N. General Assembly »
When asked whether he is misunderstood in the United States , Chavez seemed to turn reflective .
" I'm a man with many defects , " he said .
" I love .
I sing .
I dream .
I was born in the poor countryside .
I was raised in the countryside , planting corn and selling sweets made by my grandmother .
My children , my two daughters are with me and I want a better world for my grandchildren , for your grandchildren .
" Now , they demonize me .
But that 's the start of these world campaigns to try to defend what you cannot defend -- a system that is destroying the world .
... I 'm a Christian .
I want the world of justice and equality .
This is the only way to achieve peace . "
Chavez then talked about his religious upbringing and current faith .
" I was an altar boy , " he said .
" My mother wanted me to be a priest .
I am very Christian and Catholic .
... I 'm very faithful .
I believe in God , in Jesus Christ .
I love Jesus Christ .
I am a Christian .
... I cry when I see injustice , children dying of hunger . "
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez talks to CNN's Larry King .
What does he think of President Obama and the United States ?

His comments were all the more remarkable because Chavez and the Catholic Church have been at odds since he came to power in 1999 .
The church has been one of his major critics , with Pope Benedict XVI and other church leaders expressing concern over what they see as attempts by Chavez to limit the church 's influence .
Chavez 's efforts to change anti-abortion laws have been at the top of those concerns .
Chavez , in turn , has referred to church leadership as a " tumor . "
Speaking of other matters , Chavez said he hopes for improved relations with Obama , but " we want relations based on respect , relations of peoples where we are respected . "
That has not been the case so far , he said .
" Most governments in the United States in a hundred years have not respected the peoples of Latin America , " Chavez told King .
" They have sponsored coup d'etats , assassinations .
It 's enough .
We want to be brothers and sisters .
We want respect and equality . "
Chavez particularly criticized former President George W. Bush , whom he accused of orchestrating an assassination attempt on the Venezuelan leader during a short - lived coup in 2002 .
Chavez regained power within days .
Watch Chavez discuss the alleged assassination attempt »
" The Bush government toppled me , " he said .
" They asked for my assassination .
They disrespected us .
... I saw my assassins .
... I was a prisoner in Venezuela , being a president .
They took me to the seaside .
I was debating with those who wanted murder me .
They received the order to kill me .
However , at this very moment , a group of soldiers refused .
They did not kill me , but I saw those who wanted to kill me , and the order came from the White House . "
Chavez also expressed concern that the United States , which he calls " the empire , " still would like to topple him .
As he has numerous times in recent weeks , Chavez criticized U.S. plans to begin operating out of military bases in neighboring Colombia .
The United States says it needs a presence in Colombia to fight drug traffickers .
Chavez sees a sinister intent .
When asked what country he fears would harm him , Chavez replied , " The empire .
The empire .
Seven military bases ... in Colombia , that 's a serious threat against Venezuela . "
Chavez also defended his relationship with Iran but denied having said that Iran would help Venezuela obtain nuclear technology .
Iran has embarked on a nuclear program that the United States and other nations think will lead it to develop nuclear weapons before long .
" They have fooled you , " Chavez said .
" I 've never said that Iran is going to help us to have nuclear technology .
...
That 's a strategy to attack Venezuela and say that we are building an atomic bomb .
That 's the next accusation .
And I 'm going to say this now : Please , come on .
That 's crazy .
That 's crazy . "
Chavez said he does not agree with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's contention that the Holocaust , in which 6 million European Jews were killed during World War II , never existed .
" But there also was another holocaust in South America , " Chavez said .
" I do not deny the Jewish Holocaust .
And I condemn it .
But in South America , when the Europeans arrived , there were close to 90 million Indians ; 200 years later , we only had four million remaining .
That was a holocaust .
And the Europeans denied this holocaust . "
Israel came under criticism from Chavez , who called it a " small country with atomic bombs , and very aggressive country .
...
They have massacred entire families .
It is a war - mongering country . "
Turning to the situation in his own country , Chavez denied that he is trying to shut down critical media , such as the independent Globovision TV station .
Government officials have levied several charges against the station , saying that it is disseminating false information and trying to foment dissatisfaction against Chavez .
The Chavez government has repealed licenses for other independent TV and radio stations , and has threatened to do so against Globovision .
Former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter this week joined human rights groups and others who have expressed concern over what they see as Chavez becoming too authoritarian .
Chavez dismissed the criticism .
" Never in Venezuela have we had so much freedom of speech as now , " he said .
Pressed by King about whether he is going to shut down Globovision , Chavez answered , " I do not know .
It depends on them .
If they keep on sponsoring coup d'etats , if they keep on calling for my assassination , if they keep on breaching the law even as well , it is not Chavez that 's going to close them .
I want to apply the law .
We need to respect the law .
It is the law .
It 's out of logic , and it 's pure logic . "
As to Carter , Chavez said , " Yes , I read that and I regret for him , because I think he 's totally confounded and lost .
It 's a long time since he visited us .
I respect him enormously , but I think he is wrong .
He 's a victim of so much falsehood in the world . "

Do n't get the hump , I 'm just taking a photo ...
Diver snaps 50ft humpback whale
Try as you might , you 're unlikely to get a holiday snap quite like this one .
. .
In the deep blue waters of the South Pacific , cameraman Marco Queral gets up close and personal with a humpback whale .
The experienced diver even seems to be hitching a lift on the flipper of the 50ft female .
Queral , 42 , who has spent 17 years taking such remarkable pictures , said : ' Whales are extremely intelligent .
Just like humans , they have their own mind and come with strong personalities .
Swimming together :
The humpback whale takes the diver by the fin and goes for a spin
' They decide whether I can take pictures of them or not .
They must be in a right mood to let me get into this position . '
With a playful flick of his colossal tail Queral could be dead .
But instead this curious , intelligent humpback whale takes a shine to Queral , and the two end up drifting through the seas together .
The astonishing contact between the 50ft king of the ocean and the minuscule human was captured off Hawaii in the South Pacific last week .
Queral said the jaw - dropping moment was all down to luck , and little to do with the skills he has mastered over 17 years .
He said : ' The success in getting these shots is pretty much always down to the whale . '
Reaching out to make contact :
The humpback whale and Marco Queral look like they 're about take part in an underwater dance
To get his spectacular images of marine life the world , South American Marco relies on various tricks to catch the attention of passing creatures .
' Perhaps the most effective and possibly only way to help my photography is to try to stimulate their curiosity .
' Dolphins , for example , sometimes love to hang out with me when I do some acrobats underwater like spinning and turning .
' They get as curious about me as I am about them , and that is the right time to take pictures of them as they show their individual personalities . '
Marco Queral gazes down on the humpback whale , as the two get to know each other
But mammals as large as whales are a different and much more dangerous affair .
Marco said : ' Their enormous size itself must be considered as an immediate life - threatening danger .
' I must be very cautious when they approach and investigate me .
' I believe they are gentle by nature but I am always aware their kind greeting of a tail swing may easily kill me by accident .
' Also , they are usually more shy and cautious toward humans and boats than dolphins are , perhaps because they are not so accustomed to seeing humans offshore .
' I think their bashfulness and timidity have been ingrained into their DNA as they have been chased and hunted by humans for centuries . '
The gentle beast heads to the surface , seeking a close encounter

International solidarity can boost the Honduran people 's morale .
Photo by James Rodriguez .
During an August 17 - 19 , 2009 , international seminar on the economic crisis hosted by the Party of Liberty and Socialism in Sao Paolo , Brazil , Green Left Weekly / Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal journalists Kiraz Janicke and Federico Fuentes , together with journalists from Marea Socialista ( Venezuela ) and Alternativa Socialista ( Argentina ) , were able to interview Gilberto Rios from the international relations commission of the National Popular Resistance Front against the Coup about the growing resistance movement against the US backed coup which ousted the democratically elected president of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya , on June 28 .
How is the Honduran oligarchy managing to sustain itself in the face of the growing mass movement against the coup which has developed in Honduras ?
In our opinion the oligarchy does not have the capacity to orchestrate a media campaign as well as is happening now throughout the country .
Although only three families control 98 % of the media , the harmony that exists between the media campaign , government policy , the mobilisation of the police , and the army 's presence , and are more a result of CIA planning .
It is confirmed that there is a CIA group working in Tegucigalpa directing all the actions of the coup .
Two months of resistance have put the kibosh on the economy .
All small and medium enterprises are broken .
Other sectors are also part of the resistance .
So , there is [ little ] political and popular support for the coup .
It is really the support of the US -- in terms logistics and control of the coup -- and the oligarchy in Latin America , especially Venezuela and El Salvador , which has strong interests in Honduras , that has sustained the coup .
So it 's a coup made in the USA .
But what prospects does the resistance have ?
What do you think will happen in Honduras in the next period ?
Well , the coup is politically untenable because the international community still does not recognise the de facto government .
And elections are approaching in November , important for it to legitimise the process and return to normality .
But the people do not want to participate in an electoral process that is supervised by the coup government .
It will not be a democratic process nor is the international community going to endorse it .
The continuation of the struggle is going to go beyond November , unless the President Manuel Zelaya is returned .
But the president also has proposed that for each day he misses in office he will have to be given an extra day , and that puts more pressure on the right wing .
And what ’s happening is a continuation of the struggle in which more sectors are being organised against the coup , and with ever greater political awareness of who staged the coup :
In domestic terms it is the oligarchy , and those who must be isolated from political power in the country are members of the oligarchy .
What is the situation within the armed forces ?
Honduras ’ armed forces are a very small .
There are only 15,000 soldiers but it is not just the armed forces who are operating in the framework of the coup , the police are also involved , which is another 14,000 officers .
There is also a rearguard to both these , which is the private police force which account for more than 17,000 in the country , larger than both the police and the army .
There are officials , above all in the police force , who are not in agreement with the coup but who are maintaining discipline from the higher commands , but there is also a strong resentment because the high command were subordinated to the CIA and the oligarchy in order to carry out the coup .
So it is possible that the armed forces may fracture , and also the police , in the case that tension increased in the streets and above all if the CIA reduced its support to the oligarchy .
Since the coup the social movements appear to be more visible and it gives the impression that there is a rising level of struggle .
The coup served to spark the fire ?
There was a very interesting popular movement in Honduras ; it was the most developed of the region .
In Central America there is nothing like the National Resistance Coordinator , which is the body of popular movements in which all are involved : the Indigenous movement , the labour movement , the peasant movement , feminists , the gay - lesbian and transexual movement ... this existed before the coup .
But after the coup important sections of the Liberal Party , which is the traditional party from which President Zelaya comes , also became involved .
Also honest sectors of the population and democratic and progressive political parties who are also against the coup .
So , yes there is a revival of struggle , but we must take into account that those who have supported the struggle most , with three national civil strikes , is the National Resistance Coordinator , which involves the majority of the workers and the minorities who are excluded by the capitalist system .
So there existed a previously articulated self - organisation of the social movements .
But it has consolidated in the face of the coup ?
That 's right .
There was an organisation that was present in 17 of the 18 departments [ provinces ] of the country , and when we called for people to protest in the streets they came out , not in the same numbers or with the same level of participation that is happening now .
In recent days we have had protests in the morning that remain in the streets all day , and at night there are convoys of cars in major cities .
And that shows that at a popular level the workers are participating , and the middle class is also coming out onto the streets .
There are more and more sections of the population involved in peaceful protests against the coup .
Could you explain how people are organising in the working - class and poor areas , and also which political organisations are participating in the resistance ?
In terms of political organisations , the left - wing political parties recognise that the Democratic Unification Party and other expressions of the left do not control any part of the popular movement .
It 's the opposite : we are part of the popular movement .
It is a country in which all the political tendencies [ of the left ] converged in the social movements , even before the coup .
If we talk about trade unions , 95 % of Honduras ’ unions represent the public sector and only 5 % of the organised unions represent private enterprise .
That 5 % are the most militant unions because they have the most direct class conflict with capital , such as the union in the cement industry , also the union of workers in the beverage industry .
STIBYS is the union currently most involved in politically coordinating the situation .
In fact STIBYS just launched an independent presidential candidate -- Charles H. Reyes , who is also one of the main leaders of the struggle .
He has been a popular leader for more than 30 years , with origins in the Communist Party and is recognised by broad sections of the population .
He is attracting a lot of the vote .
According to the latest polls , he has almost 40 % acceptance .
Expanding on the subject of the presidential candidacy of this workers ’ leader , is this part of a more comprehensive project of the National Resistance Front , or is participation in the coming electoral process simply an issue under discussion ?
How do you combine participation with the fact that this is a coup and Zelaya remains outside of the country ?
Are there two positions , one in favour of participation and one against ?
Currently , there is no possibility of having two strategies with respect to the coup .
Carlos H. Reyes has said publicly that if the president has not returned home then he will withdraw and will not endorse the process .
But what would happen with the candidacy of Carlos H. Reyes ?
Although he has a chance of winning , we would only have a president but we would have no parliamentarians and then we would be defeated in the other two branches of power ; the Congress and the Supreme Court .
Therefore greater alliances are proposed , something which is historic in Honduras , because it is the sector of the Liberal Party [ that supports the resistance ] that has candidates for mayors , that also defines local power and legislative candidates who are sympathetic to the president and who also have joined the National Popular Resistance Front , and this would be with the trade unions , workers , peasants -- the social base that traditionally supports Charles H. Rayes .
So what we see in the future is the transformation of this social movement into a political movement , rather broad and with more possibilities to transform and obtain changes in the country .
Does the resistance have the capacity to go further and really change the situation in Honduras ?
Well , it is important to clarify that there are many parts of the country with a high concentration of weapons in the hands of the people .
On the Atlantic coast , which is the northern , north - east of the country where there has been a presence of drug trafficking , the peasants have had to arm themselves for a long time .
Here we have more than 5000 armed men .
But they have proposed that the strategy remain peaceful .
The same in the east and the south , where due to armed conflict in Central America , there remain many weapons and many with experience in weapons use .
But nationally it has been agreed not to take armed action because that would fall into the trap of what we think may be the strategy of the United States government -- to promote a civil war to achieve direct US intervention in the country .
The US has problems now and needs to reactivate its war industry and it would also like to incorporate Central America in case the theatre of operations extends to Colombia and Venezuela .
The Nicaraguan army also is not aligned to US imperialist policy .
Therefore for us it is strategic to stay peacefully in the streets .
What is the relationship between the National Popular Resistance Front and Zelaya .
There has been little information about who Zelaya was before the coup , apart from his participation in ALBA .
Has that relationship changed after the coup ?
In Honduras , like most of Latin America , no presidential candidate could come to power without having a clear intention not to support all the policies of the oligarchies of their countries .
In that sense , Zelaya was no exception .
When he became president , he told us that he had every intention to privatise all sectors .
In fact , he wanted to be aggressive with privatisation in the first year : he wanted to privatise water , the country 's largest port Puerto Cortes -- from which the Salvadoran oligarchy also exports , as well as the Costa Ricans and Nicaragua – and also electricity .
All public services were to be privatised .
The first attempt at privatisation carried out by the Honduran oligarchy was the airports , which have been privatised for years , and are extremely inefficient and highly corrupt .
They have not paid taxes , nor have they carried out the works that were promised when the concessions were granted .
So he [ Zelaya ] checked , and found that privatisation does not answer social problems .
Well , that 's been somewhat traditional in the world , in Honduras , particularly in Latin America .
But he expressed his surprise with such indignation that it seemed real .
At first we were suspicious , then we realised that it was genuine surprise when , in a meeting with the government – meetings between the government and the popular movement were being held frequently -- he said that he had discovered that what existed in Honduras was neocolonialism .
That to extract the wealth of countries it was not necessary to bring in armies , but could be done simply through a transnationalised economy ...
He made a theoretical effort to understand what had happened in our country ...
We began to understand that he had had a conversion .
Now he has the discourse of a left - wing militant and not a traditional oligarch , although his background is totally bourgeois , above all from the landed gentry of the Honduran countryside .
But we also see in him a politically audacious person , able to take risks , for instance , to become president , Zelaya sold his 17 companies to pay for his campaign .
He risked everything to be there .
He did something that was unthinkable , that a minority candidate not supported by the oligarchy could get to that position .
Not only that , but two years after being elected , he betrayed them and changed to be more on the side of the people than of the oligarchy .
Taking this into account , what does Zelaya represent and what does the Honduras resistance represent for the possibility of political and social transformation in Honduras and Central America ?
To begin , it represents a lesson and for the left and the social movements .
Because we were distanced from president , we did n’t believe the [ political ] conversion of a human being was possible ...
It is said it is easier to conquer than convince .
And in that sense I think we can improve a little more , the strategies of the left and the social movement to appeal more to the theoretical argument of our positions than simply direct confrontation , which ultimately strengthens the position of the right wing , a right wing that is very ignorant , very unjust and very repressive in Latin America .
It is also an example that when a people are attacked they really can magnify their ability to respond and to understand what happens in social processes .
What is the resistance ’s view on the negotiations headed by Costa Rica ’s president , Oscar Arias ?
Many of the points proposed would have left Zelaya severely weakened if he had returned under those conditions .
Is a Constituent Assembly still a demand of the resistance ?
Our analysis was that it was the CIA 's strategy to weaken the resistance forces as well as the popular pressure for the president ’s return to power .
However , the president accepted ... in fact on important websites such as www.rebelion.org, it was said that Zelaya had capitulated .
But the resistance expressed publicly that it did not accept the negotiations , even though the president said yes .
But the president 's strategy was to return home , and once again take power to continue the battle for the Constituent Assembly , with a stronger argument because the constitutional framework had been broken .
We just had a coup and that is a fact that can be demonstrated .
Now , all of proposals of the resistance start with the first point , which is : nothing will happen in the country unless a Constituent Assembly is convened after the return to democracy .
And now there is also the understanding from the popular movements that a Constituent Assembly is the political way out of what 's happened .
You 've mentioned twice a ``CIA strategy ’’ .
What is the position of the National Front of Resistance on US President Obama ’s statements and performance since the coup ?
The popular movement ihas always been very anti-imperialist .
And we do not believe a change in the US government actually changes its international policies .
The same policy of aggression remains .
Most likely in the case of Obama , as Eva Golinger said in a December article , the Pentagon 's strategy will now be more to use ``dirty wars ’’ , as is occurring in Honduras , rather than direct invasions , as under George Bush , who ultimately inflamed major sections of the world against imperialism .
Now it seems that national strategies to destabilise governments are what are being implemented .
What the US is doing at a public level is to promote democracy , but on the other it is promoting war and destabilisation [ behind the scenes ] .
This is clear not only to the leadership of the resistance movement , but also to the Honduran people .
The people are making a political analysis at a level that we did not expect ... in that sense , we say , they made the coup with an old manual , but the people have changed , the world has changed .
What is the importance of international solidarity for the resistance in Honduras ?
When one leaves the country it is clear that internationally there is more opportunity to learn from the media about what is happening in the country .
Domestically , media control is very strong .
And for the resistance it is very important to know that the peoples of the world sympathise with the Honduran people .
This boosts our morale for the struggle .
Now one can see in the marches of the resistance , people marching with flags from every country in the world that have publicly opposed the coup .
Therefore international solidarity is very important for us , it helps maintain our morale .
We are thinking about the possibility of an international forum in Tegucigalpa , with the presence of popular movements from around the world .
We know that governments do not support , at least nominally , the coup , but it is also important for people and for the resistance in the streets to see popular opposition from the rest of the world in Tegucigalpa .
What we are thinking is a forum in October involving trade unions and popular movements and politicians across Latin America , from progressives , democrats and revolutionaries , all united against the coup .
For example , some US trade unions have offered to be present , and Europeans from all social movements could apply significant pressure .
What would be the response of the de facto government in Honduras to an event like that ?
I believe that every time there 's an international presence , which we strive for permanently , the level of psychological warfare against the people decreases and also the military presence on the streets decreases too .
One can see police on the street , but when there is no international presence what you see more are the military , who ultimately have neither education nor methods to suppress a march , but instead fire bullets .
A lot of people have been shot and wounded by that .
They use repressive methods as if it were a civil war against unarmed and peaceful people in the street .
So an international presence would be very positive for us .

Recently by Gary North : Bill Bonner ’s Big Idea
I got this in my email box today : spam .
This spam proposes a way to change America .
It begins with a preposterous premise : the Marxists have taken over the American media since 1999 .
The Marxist Left has spent nearly ¾ of a billion dollars on anti-American propaganda in the last decade and we need to do * something * to counter this outright war on the American people .
To that end , [ SPAMMER ] is directly asking the American people whether they would support a grass - roots media project to expand the conservative presence in broadcast media .
We put up a new website explaining the extent of this propaganda attack on the US and how we propose , with the support of the American public , to create a new radio and television broadcast network dedicated to getting greater exposure for the principles this country was founded on .
We ’re not asking for anything except comments on whether the public would support the idea .
Whether the project will go forward depends on what feedback we get from the public about it .
Marxists spent $ 750,000,000 .
Right .
These are the guys who could not raise enough money to keep The Daily Worker in print .
It died in 1991 , the year the USSR died .
I know .
I know .
The Communists were not the true Marxists .
The true Marxists are invisible and unnamed and had $ 750,000,000 to invest .
By the way , $ 750,000,000 in a decade is chump change .
Americans spend over $ 350 billion a year on higher education , and 95 % of this funds the Left .
The rest funds engineering .
Add to this K - 12 spending per year : $ 970 billion .
Then factor in what the TV networks spend .
But the spammer thinks a new radio and TV network will turn things around .
Did you ever wonder why conservatives are regarded as aluminum foil hat stylists ?
THE SECRET PLAN
For 45 years , I have been told that there is a secret plan to take over America .
It is just about completed .
America got taken over no later than 1893 — after Grover Cleveland ’s final months in office .
Some of us think it was earlier .
Much earlier .
“ Politically incorrect even for conservatives ” earlier .
See my report .
Anyway , everyone who proposes
The Latest Plan To Save America assumes that he has discovered what no other conservative has seen in the past ( say ) 130 years .
He assumes that he has a way to overturn the Secret Plan .
All he needs is money .
Or donated time .
Has anyone ever heard of these people ?
Their wives .
Or ex-wives .
Have they started an organization ?
Has it stayed solvent for 10 — 20 years ?
Is there a record of one major success ?
I do n’t mean a success like stopping the ERA .
That was the only big one the conservatives have had in 50 years .
I mean a success like winning a Federal court case or getting a piece of legislation passed in some state .
No .
Then why should we take them seriously ?
Why do they have The Secret Plan to Defeat the Secret Plan that for 50 years , or 130 years , gifted conservatives have not seen ?
Why should this plan work ?
If it ’s a centralized plan , it ’s leftist .
It ’s another top - down , twist arms , centralized power solution .
Avoid it .
If it ’s decentralized , then why not post The Latest Plan on the Web and see if anyone implements it ?
But no .
It must be secret .
It must be By Invitation Only .
It is like the other side ’s Secret Plan .
For 45 years , I have been invited to “ get in on this nation - saving deal on the ground floor . ”
Pardon me for my skepticism .

Anyone old enough with money enough to fund The Latest Plan has been hit 1,000 times with similar proposals .
They all have one thing in common .
They did not work .
I know .
I have funded several of my own .
Not one of them matches what Matt Drudge did in 1998 .
Who was Matt Drudge ?
He had no money .
He had no secret plan .
He had only this : ( 1 ) a tip that Newsweek had spiked a story about Clinton and an unnamed intern ; ( 2 ) a Web site .
That was all it took .
Ideas have consequences .
Secret plans to expose secret plans do n’t .

I ca n’t be everywhere at once .
This means I ca n’t refute every fallacious argument out there in cyberspace .
But once in a while , one person manages to collate several spurious arguments and create a video out of them .
Consider amhemsley ‘s “ Do n’t want to pay taxes ?
Then stop stealing from those who do ” .
The video is little more than a tissue of trite arguments ; tax resisters are thieves , the government provides us with services , if you do n’t love it you can leave it , and so on .
Here ’s a brief discussion of why the guy in the video is wrong .
State = Society ?
One common tool used by the anti-capitalists is the equivocation of fairly distinct and unambiguous terms .
State , society , law , order , protection and peace are all mixed together .
In amhemsley ’s mind , anyone who is against the State is against society , and subsequetly for lawlessness , poverty and chaos .
It is important to challenge this simpleminded view .
Stateless socities have existed in the past , even for centuries .
Parallel to the history of State - made legislation runs the history of private law provision .
Society is nothing more than the lose web of interaction among people who share a common heritage .
The State is a territorial monopolist of lawmaking and taxation .
Society typically uses ostracism and exclusion to punish those who engage in unlawful or distasteful activities .
But society will find it difficult to legitimately use force against you , which is precisely the point of the State .
People who produce things that other people value are actively contributing to society , and are rewarded with livelihoods in exchange .
After these people have already produced something , the State then expects to pay taxes as well .
Any libertarian who protests this payment is immediately called a thief .
But where does such an objection lead ?
There are groups in society that pay no taxes whatsoever , and are actually paid with taxes .
These people include the unemployed , the poor and single parents , and their contribution to society remains doubtful .
They benefit from the labour of others yet contribute nothing themselves .
I ’d love to see a video in which amhemsley chastises the poor and vulnerable for being tax - thieves , but I wo n’t hold my breath .
That ’s Just How It Is
Stripped of the rhetoric , amhemsley ’s assertion that tax - haters are thieves ultimately rests on an appeal to tradition : “… these things all cost money and need to be paid for , and the system that we have in place is that we pay taxes ” .
Had amhemsley lived a century ago , he could have been making a similar argument with regards to other institutions .
Try this one for size : “ Food and clothing all cost money and need to be paid for .
The system that we have in place in most countries is slavery .
Any slave who refuses to work for his master is stealing from society and hence society has a right to use force against him “ .
If that one ’s too vulgar , why do n’t we try this one : “ The mafia have a legitimate claim to a fraction of the income from all the shopkeepers in a neighbourhood .
Any shopkeeper who refuses to pay is stealing from the mafia , and hence the mob are right to use force against her .
If you do n’t like paying your mafia dues you can simply move your business somewhere else . ”
Now I hear you all crying : “ But slavery and the mafia are nothing like government .
The government provides things we need . ” I disagree .
Slaveowners do feed and clothe their slaves .
Surely this is a much better fate than being left to the unfettered free market !
But it ’s the mafia that shares a closer resemblance to the government .
The mafia have a territorial element ; they control entire neighbourhoods .
They determine the price of their services unilaterally , and they perform a very important defensive function .
Much like my country ’s army protects me from your country ’s army , my mafia syndicate protects me from other syndicates .
So what would amhemsley say to all this ?
The same arguments he uses in defence of government can be used in defence of history ’s most horrific institutions .
The solution to this is to realise that neither the slaveowner nor the mafia are legitimately entitled to the income they receive .
Libertarians take this premise to its fullest conclusion .
If the small - scale mafia are n’t entitled to their tribute than neither are the large - scale mafias — the governments .
If the mafia and the government were legitimate entities , all of amhemsley ’s conclusions follow .
Realise that they are n’t and the libertarian positions will soon fall into place .
Free Riding Revisited
Tax evaders are allegedly theives for yet another reason .
For amhemsley the concept of theft has nothing to do with property but everything to do with benefit .
In another false equivocation , anyone who benefits from something without paying for it is automatically a thief .
Now most people would see positive spillover effects as simply a good thing for all involved .
And as the saying goes “ the free rider did n’t ask for his ride … why should he be forced to pay for it ? ”
You can take this mentality to its absurd conclusion ; since everyone is benefitting from everybody else ’s existance , we all have some sort of claim to the property of others .
I ’ll provide a simple example .
My personal hygiene and friendly manner provides many benefits to those around me .
Are my friends and family stealing from me ?
Can I politely smile at them and expect to be paid ?
And then there ’s the problem of knowing how much benefit I ’ve provided .
I have little way of knowing whether someone benefits from my actions or not .
What if noone likes my cheerful demeanour but everyone is still required to subsidise it ?
More broadly , since the rich provide a great benefit to society through their entrepreneurship and far - sightedness , while the poor free - ride off others ’ production and savings , should we employ a regressive tax system to correct this imbalance ?
Conclusion
As well as leading to distasteful conclusions , we have seen that many of amhamsley ’s arguments have proved to be contradictory and absurd .
San Francisco -
A judge ordered the government Thursday to release more records about the lobbying campaign to provide immunity to the telecommunications giants that participated in the NSA 's warrantless surveillance program .
U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White ordered the records be provided to the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) by October 9 , 2009 .
The decision is part of EFF 's long - running battle to gather information about telecommunications lobbying conducted as Congress considered granting immunity to companies that participated in illegal government electronic surveillance .
Telecom immunity was eventually passed as part of the FISA Amendments Act ( FAA ) of 2008 , but a bill that would repeal the immunity -- called the JUSTICE Act -- was introduced in the Senate last week .
" Today 's ruling is a major victory for government transparency , " said EFF Staff Attorney Marcia Hofmann .
" As the court recognized , it was unlawful for the government to deny Americans access to this information in the midst of the debate over telecom immunity last year .
We 're pleased these records will now be available to the public as Congress considers the JUSTICE Act . "
EFF has been seeking information about the telecom lobbying campaign under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) since 2007 , as news reports detailed an extensive and expensive lobbying campaign seeking immunity for telecommunications companies that participated in unlawful surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans .
Officials at the Bush Administration 's Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) were vocal supporters of the immunity proposals , working closely with telecoms .
Using the FOIA , EFF asked the DOJ and the ODNI for any communications between the agencies , members of Congress , and telecom companies related to lobbying for telecom immunity .
The DOJ and ODNI argued that the records requested by EFF were protected by FOIA exemptions covering agency deliberations and other privileged communications .
But in today 's order , the judge ruled that as the communications were with Congress and lobbyists , the exemptions did not apply .
The judge also found that the identities of telecom representatives who lobbied for immunity could not be kept from the public on privacy grounds .
" Today 's ruling shows that aggressive use of the Freedom of Information Act is necessary to challenge government secrecy , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kurt Opsahl .
" We cannot allow the government to drag its feet in making relevant information available to the American public . "
EFF also represents the plaintiffs in Hepting v. AT&T , a class - action lawsuit brought by AT&T customers accusing the telecom of violating their rights by illegally assisting in widespread domestic surveillance .
In June of 2009 , a federal judge dismissed Hepting and dozens of other lawsuits against telecoms , ruling that the companies had immunity from liability under the FAA .
EFF is appealing the decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , primarily arguing that the FAA 's immunity provision is unconstitutional in granting the president broad discretion to block the courts from considering the core constitutional privacy claims of millions of Americans .

China kauft Gold Wolfgang Pomrehn
.. und kritisiert die Niedrigzins - Politik der US - Notenbank
Glaubt man der hierzulande vorherrschenden Berichterstattung , dann scheint die Krise schon fast vorüber , doch bei genauerem Hinsehen mangelt es nicht an Hinweisen , dass sich neue , noch gefährlichere Blasen aufblähen ( Wehe wenn die Hyper - Blase platzt ) .
Eines dieser neuen Risiken ist der Immobilienmarkt in China , der reichlich überhitzt erscheint .
( Einige Beobachter wenden gegen entsprechende Warnungen allerdings ein , dass China trotz des nun schon über etliche Jahre anhaltenden Baubooms in Sachen Wohnungen noch immer reichlich unterversorgt ist . )
Interessant ist in diesem Zusammenhang , dass mit Chen Siwei , dem ehemaligen stellvertretenden Vorsitzenden des Ständigen Komitees des Volkskongresses , der heute für den Ausbau " grüner " Technologien verantwortlich ist , ein hochrangiger chinesischer Politiker der US - Notenbank eine Mitschuld an der bedenklichen Entwicklung in China gibt .
Die niedrigen Zinsen in den USA würden auch China zwingen , das Zinsniveau niedrig zu halten .
Das wiederum beflügelt die Immobilienbranche .
Würde die Volksrepublik die Zinsen anheben , so würde eine Flut heißen Geldes über das Land herein brechen , wird Chen zitiert .
In den vergangenen Jahren waren trotz strenger Reglementierung derlei Kapitalflüsse in Milliardenhöhe wiederholt im Zusammenhang mit Spekulationen um eine Yuan - Aufwertung zu beobachten gewesen .
Auch sonst ist China weiter sehr besorgt über den Abwertungsdruck auf den US - Dollar , in dem der größere Teil seiner Devisenreserven im Gegenwert von über zwei Billionen Dollar geparkt ist .
Chen dazu : " Gold ist ohne Zweifel eine Alternative für uns , aber wenn wir kaufen steigt der Preis .
Wir müssen also vorsichtig vorgehen , um den Markt nicht anzuregen . "
Der Goldpreis bewegt sich derzeit in der Höhe seines historischen Höchststandes .
Bei Gold ist das in Krisen zeiten nicht weiter erstaunlich , aber auch die auch für viele industriell genutzte Rohstoffe muss derzeit ein für Krisenzeiten ganz ungewöhnlich hoher Preis bezahlt werden .
Zumindest einer der Gründe könnte sein , dass China sich umfangreiche strategische Reserven anlegt .

TCA Tour – “ The Office ” set visit
During my time at the TCA Press Tour , I was fortunate enough to visit the sets of two CBS series ( “ NCIS : Los Angeles ” and “ Three Rivers “ ) , two Fox series ( “ Bones ” and “ Dollhouse “ ) , and two ABC series ( “ Castle ” and “ Private Practice ” ) , but when you get right down to it , my excitement level about all six of those sets probably still did n’t equal out to how psyched I was to visit the set of just one NBC show : “ The Office . ”
It was an absolutely surreal experience to pull up in front of a building in Valencia , CA , and see a sign which read , “ Scranton Business Park , ” but it got even more bizarre as we stepped into the Dunder - Mifflin warehouse and immediately saw members of the cast milling about .
We were quickly divided into small groups and taken on a tour of the actual Dunder - Mifflin office by cast members , and I was fortunate enough to be part of the group led by Angela Kinsey , who plays Angela Martin on the show .
My wife and I met Angela in 2007 when we attended our first TCA Awards ceremony , as “ The Office ” had taken home the award for Best Comedy Series that year , so I was already well aware that her real - life personality is the polar opposite of her character ’s .
She ’s constantly laughing , and you could tell that , although she was no doubt drafted into the task of giving us this tour , she loves her job and does n’t mind talking about it in the slightest .
It was incredibly cool to be able to see the intricacies of the various certificates on the walls of the office , as well as the personal photos on each of the desks , but I think my favorite moment was when she told us that Brian Baumgartner , who plays Kevin , still has a post - it on his desk that was written during the very first episode of the show .
No , wait , I take that back : it might ’ve been when she recited back to us the way she used to have to answer the phone when she was an operator for 1 -800 - DENTIST .
Well , either way , it was a real treat to have her give us the tour personally .
We were also given the opportunity to take our photo at Michael Scott ’s desk , which I absolutely took advantage of , but all things considered , I think I actually might like this shot from Pam ’s desk better :
After the set visit , we returned to the warehouse , where we were each presented with our own nameplates which declared us to be Assistant to the Regional Manager of Dunder - Mifflin …and you can bet that mine sits on my desk at this very moment .
From there , we were offered coffee and pastries as we sat down for a Q&A with the cast ( minus Rainn Wilson , who was n’t feeling well ) and producers of the show .
It wo n’t surprise you to learn that there were many laughs to be had , but few were timed quite as well as the first one .
The question at hand was a simple one relating to the fact that the series was celebrating its 100th episode : “ Did you expect it to last this long ? ” Producer Greg Daniels began to answer the question , saying , “ I do n’t think any of us did .
You know … ”
Suddenly , there was much whispering from Steve Carell .
Daniels leaned over to hear what Carell was saying , nodded , then looked back at the critic who ’d asked the question and replied , “ That ’s what she said . ”
( Carell also proceeded to get the next laugh , when , after being asked how he keeps finding depth in a character who ultimately is very shallow at the surface , he replied , “ I just model it after my own shallow self . ” )
If you ’re looking for news about the upcoming season , we were able to get a little bit here and there .
At various points during the Q&A , the following information was revealed :
* As you might expect from someone who ’s preparing to become both a husband and a father , Jim ’s going to be going through some changes this year .
“ I think Jim ’s ambition has always been more of an issue than his skill , ” said B.J. Novak ( Ryan ) .
“ I think it seems to most of the writers that he would be great if he tried , and I think one of the themes this year is Jim going for it more and trying and challenging himself , especially with the wedding and the baby on the way .
I think that that will be really fun to see . ”
* As far as the Pam / Jim relationship goes , most of what we ’ll see will take place within Dunder - Mifflin .
“ I think we ’re going to try to see it in the office and how that affects people who work together , ” said Paul Lieberstein ( Toby ) .
“ But we will be going out for the wedding .
We ’ll meet the family , and it will be fun . ”
* Per Jenna Fischer , “ Pam is going to be walking down the aisle very soon because she is pregnant , but trying to hide that from certain members of her family .
So they ’re getting married pretty quickly … in , like , the fourth episode .
I actually just had a fitting for Pam ’s wedding dresses , like , just right before I walked in here , and that was a really special moment . ”
* According to Lieberstein , there will be more romance in the office beyond Pam and Jim .
“ Andy likes Erin , ” he revealed .
“ Erin is n’t quite aware of that yet , and we ’ll play that out for you . ”
* Sadly , however , Michael should prepare for a dry spell .
“ I guess it might be a rough year for Michael Scott , ” said Lieberstein .
“ There ’s no one on his horizon . ”
* After being prompted for further information about the season , Lieberstein and Daniels had a brief huddle before the former gave up an upcoming storyline which takes place at Dunder - Mifflin while Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon .
“ Michael is meeting with an Italian gentleman , and it comes to everyone ’s belief that Michael has just met with the mafia , and they ’re extorting him for insurance money , ” he said .
“ The coalition of reason is a little weak in the office . ”
* Also in the cards for an upcoming episode : a Dunder - Mifflin shareholders meeting .
There was also considerable talk during the Q&A about the changes that have gone on with the characters of “ The Office ” since the series began .
Two of the most notable : Steve Carell ’s hair and weight .
“ Part of the evolution was between that pilot and Season Two , I lost about 25 pounds , in part because of ‘ The 40 - Year - Old Virgin , ' ” explained Carell .
“ That sort of formed the look partially there .
I think that first year , the look was really scary .
I do n’t know if there was any word from the hierarchy at NBC that he needed to be at least reasonably watchable , but there was n’t any big conscious decision .
The hair just changed a little bit and got a little fluffy . ”
“ Part of the character changed , though , ” noted Daniels .
“ Michael was more an antagonist in the first season , and , you know , became much more a person that you rooted for .
So you had to root for somebody with less hair gel . ”
“ I ’ve always sort of seen him as a sympathetic character , ” Carell observed .
“ You know , even people who are obnoxious and in - your - face or unlikable to most , I believe that there are other sides and other gray areas to everybody , and I always felt that he was a kind of guy whose intentions were good and his heart was in the right place , but he just has a disconnect socially , and sort of that emotional blind spot .
So that ’s kind of how I ’ve proceeded with the character . ”
In the first season , the computers of the supporting characters did n’t even work .
“ My agent actually told me that we were required to bring paperwork to look busy , ” said Kate Flannery ( Meredith ) .
“ I thought I was going to a temp job , ” said Oscar Nunez .
“ It was a great gig .
Basically , you just want to get on with your work and not be filmed .
So as an actor , it ’s weird , because you ’re like , ‘ Oh , the camera . ’
And you just do n’t want to be filmed . ”
“ My memory of the first year or two was Oscar and Angela and I in the corner deciding that our show was better , ” said Brian Baumgartner ( Kevin ) .
“ And we were just going to make up bits and force people to film them whenever we could . ”
“ We also said that we could maybe pitch it to Telemundo , ” said Angela .
“ ‘ Los Contadores ‘ ! ”
The evolution of the Jim & Pam relationship was also a topic of conversation , which John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer were more than happy to discuss .
“ You know , when the relationship started and it was kind of an unrequited love relationship , I would get a lot of fan mail from people who were also pining away for someone else in their office , and they were enjoying watching that , ” said Fischer .
“ And then when we finally got together , we ’d get mail like thatwe ’re expecting . ”
So I feel like we ’re sort of growing up with our fans , and we ’re going through those same life stages as the people who have been watching us from the beginning .
I think maybe that ’s one of the reasons why the relationship has continued to be successful : it ’s been growing realistically . ”
“ I definitely would attribute it all to the writers , ” said Krasinski .
“ I think that we ’ve had a great time doing it , but I think there ’s very little credit that we can take for the ideas and what it is to go ahead and do .
And I think that to write such incredibly real moments has always been my favorite part of the relationship .
Probably my favorite episode is ‘ Booze Cruise , ’ and that moment on the top of the boat where they allowed silence to play at the moment that I was supposed to tell her that I loved her .
I knew from then that I ’d just sort of do whatever they told me to do with this relationship , and I think that they followed that .
I loved when they said that we would find out that we were pregnant before we got married .
And I just thought , ‘ That ’s real , and it ’s gutsy . ’
And you kind of would follow people anywhere if they choose to be that gutsy . ”
Lastly , if you ’ve been sticking with the show in hopes that the documentary that ’s been filmed in Dunder - Mifflin for all of these years will finally be released ( as was the premise of the concluding special for the British “ Office ” ) , I hate to break it to you , but you ’ve been wasting your time .
“ Well , in the beginning , we always said that , if we ran out of ideas for the way the show was being produced , we would see the documentary , ” admitted Daniels .
“ And having said that now , we might not be ever able to see the documentary , since it will be a mission of defeat in some way . ”
A “ deeply religious ” man hacked off the head of his next door neighbour and put it in a wheelie bin after he heard voices telling him to protect his toddler son , a court has heard .
Paranoid schizophrenic Eric Cruz ( 32 ) , launched the brutal assault because of his delusional belief that the neighbour was planning to kill his 17 - month - old child .
The Philippines - born biology graduate thought he was on a “ mission to protect children ” and claimed saints would talk to him , Manchester Crown Court heard .
Another neighbour claimed he heard the repeated chanting of “ voodoo , voodoo , voodoo ” from the Cruz household in the hours leading up to the attack .
Patrick McGee ( 63 ) , was stabbed 17 times with severe force as he |answered the door of his home in Crumpsall , Manchester , on the evening of December 15 last year .
Cruz then slashed at his neck and severed the head which he carried outside and placed in a bin in his neighbour 's front garden .
Just 15 minutes later , warehouseman Cruz dialled 999 and calmly told the operator he had cut off the head of his neighbour .
The court was told Cruz misunderstood his neighbour 's friendly nature as intrusiveness , which had “ fed into his delusions ” .
Sentencing him to an indefinite hospital order , Judge Michael Henshell said : “ This is a tragic case .
“ Patrick McGee had worked all his life .
Everything I have heard about him gives me the impression he was a kind , gentle man .
The perfect neighbour .
He was welcoming to Eric Cruz and his family when they moved next door .
“ Tragically , Eric Cruz suffered from a mental illness , apparently for some time .
He heard voices .
He had fixed and firm beliefs that voices were commanding him to do various things .
“ He believed he had a mission to protect children and believed it was necessary for him to take the life of Patrick McGee to protect his own child .
“ He was driven to that wicked and irrational act by the illness he suffers .
“ The nature of that killing was so brutal that the effect on his family will last for the rest of their lives .
“ For a kind and gentle man to have his life ended in this way is really unspeakable . ”
Cruz , of Parkhill Avenue , admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility .
His not guilty plea to murder was accepted by the Crown .

( CNN ) --
A tsunami watch issued for five nations after a 7.6 - magnitude earthquake in the Indian Ocean was canceled about two hours later .
A tsunami watch in effect after an earthquake in the Indian Ocean has been called off .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had issued the watch for India , Myanmar , Thailand , Indonesia and Bangladesh after the quake , which struck at 1:55 a.m. Tuesday ( 3:55 p.m. Monday ET ) .
Its epicenter was about 163 miles ( 262 km ) north of Port Blair in India 's Andaman Islands , and 225 miles south - southwest of Pathein , Myanmar , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
The earthquake 's focus was about 20 miles below the Earth 's surface .
In general , earthquakes centered closer to the Earth 's surface produce stronger shaking and can cause more damage than those further underground .
Watch where the earthquakes hit »
" Sea level readings indicate that a significant tsunami was not generated , " the warning center said in a bulletin .
" Therefore , the tsunami watch issued by this center is now canceled . "
According to the geological survey , a 6.4 - magnitude quake struck near the south coast of Honshu , Japan , 12 minutes after the Indian Ocean quake .
The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami advisory following that quake , but said that the expected wave would be under 2 feet .
CNN 's Augie Martin contributed to this report .
easyXDM is a javascript library that uses available techniques to provide a means of transporting messages and / or method calls between windows in different domains , in short , by - passing the same - origin policy and letting you call methods across the domain boundry .
This is perfect if you plan to provide a client - side API ( e.g Facebook Connect ) on your web site as you can expose a method in as little as 7 lines of code .
var remote = new easyXDM .
Interface ( {} , { local : { doMagic : { method : _privateMethod } } } ) ;
This can be consumed by a client by using
var remote = new easyXDM .
Interface ( { local : " ../hash.html " , remote : " http://apiprovidersdomain.com/api.html " } , { remote : { doMagic : {} } } ) ;
and can then be called by using
remote.doMagic(' argument1 ',2 , function ( result ) { alert ( result ) }
In this CodeProject article I present an example on how easy it is to do this , and in the extensive documentation there are links to several demos showing everything from sending simple strings to letting two applications from different domains send arbitrary objects back and forth , even using older browsers like IE6 .
The demos are repeated here
This library was earlier on called easyXSS , but due to the name being kinda ambiguous ( someone say vulnerability ) , I decided to change it to easyXDM , short for easy cross domain messaging .
If you want to sneak a peek at the sourcecode , you can see the fully documented debug version here .
The minified version weighs in at only 1.46 KB gzipped .
The library is very flexible , allowing you you choose exactly how much of the work you want to handle yourself , the base functionality is transferring string messages .
Some of the features are
transport classes for transmitting strings postMessage where supported OR hash fragment using the resize event for invisible iframes hash fragment using polling for visible frames
channel class for transmitting aribitrary data
interface class for setting up methods to be exposed / consumed
debug build with extensive logging for easy debugging
works in all browser ( run the test suite )
The library also support both visible and invisible iframes , so you can either access the aussies casino online remote domain transparently , or you can expose the remote domains document for direct interaction ( sign in etc . ) .

California 's big plans for solar power keep getting bigger .
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and a young Oakland company on Wednesday signed what may be the world 's largest solar deal , one that will create a string of seven solar power plants generating enough electricity for 530,000 homes .
BrightSource Energy of Oakland will build the plants in the Southern California desert and sell the power to PG&E for an undisclosed amount of money .
Fields of mirrors at each plant will focus sunlight on centralized towers , boiling water within the towers , creating steam and turning turbines .
The first plant could open in 2012 at the Ivanpah dry lake bed in San Bernardino County .
San Francisco's PG&E needs the juice .

California law requires the state 's electrical utilities to get 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by the end of 2010 , although they have three more years to comply if necessary .
PG&E has been frantically signing contracts with solar and wind companies , even agreeing to buy power from a startup that wants to build large solar arrays in space .
But the credit crisis may kill or delay some of those projects .
Expanding the agreement
PG&E and BrightSource already have a history .
Last year , PG&E agreed to buy as much as 900 megawatts from three solar power plants BrightSource planned to build .
The deal announced Wednesday greatly expands that agreement , with PG&E potentially buying 1,310 megawatts .
" We are continuing to contract with a variety of renewable developers - that has n't changed at all , " said PG&E spokeswoman Jennifer Zerwer .
" But we did decide to renegotiate with BrightSource because they have made strides with demonstrating their technology , moving forward with their ( government ) permits and getting financing . "
Although one megawatt can power about 750 homes , the output from solar plants varies with the seasons and the time of day .
So PG&E estimates that BrightSource 's seven plants will be able to supply 530,000 homes .
For BrightSource , Wednesday 's deal represents another coup .
Earlier this year , the 5 - year - old company signed an agreement to supply 1,300 megawatts of electricity to Southern California Edison in what was then considered the world 's largest solar deal .
The new PG&E agreement just barely tops it .
Technology studied
At a time when some solar companies are collapsing - victims of the credit crisis - BrightSource has been able to demonstrate to the utilities that its technology works .
The company built a demonstration facility in Israel that the utilities have extensively studied .
" PG&E looked hard at what we 'd done , " said John Woolard , BrightSource 's chief executive officer .
" They looked at the results from our plant in Israel , and that built a lot of confidence that we were meeting milestones and delivering .
That 's what we 're proudest of . "
Governor 's blessing
Wednesday 's deal was big enough to draw praise from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who has made renewable power a cornerstone of California 's policies to fight global warming .
" By committing to increase the amount of solar power , this announcement serves as more evidence that reliable , renewable and pollution - free technology is here to stay , and sunshine will eventually power hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses across our Golden State , " he said in a statement .

I recently saw a wonderful debate between philosopher John Searle , who is a professor at UC Berkeley , and Buddhist practitioner and scholar B. Alan Wallace , who is the founder of the Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies .
Both of this men have dedicated much of their careers towards the study of consciousness and the mind .
The debate centered around what is the proper methodology for understanding the origin and nature of consciousness .
John Searle ’s most famous argument on consciousness is the Chinese room argument ( 1980 ) which attempts to show that a symbol - processing machine like a computer can never be properly described as having a “ mind ” or “ understanding ” , regardless of how intelligently it may behave .
This argument was specifically geared towards proponent of Strong A.I. , who propose that as long as a computer is programmed with the right inputs ( sensory information ) and outputs ( behavior ) that this machine would have a mind in the same sense as a human has a mind .
John Searle argues that this view of functionalism , and specifically the computational theory of mind ( which is the current running philosophy in the cognitive sciences ) , will never explain consciousness – for it completely ignores qualia , the inner experiences as a result of one being conscious .
Searle , a self - proclaimed biological naturalist , believes that consciousness can be solely explained through an understanding of the processes of the brain , but he gives leeway towards a “ whatever works ” - attitude towards the further understanding of human consciousness .
Despite Searle making it clear that the answers to consciousness will come from the researchers of neuroscience ( specifically , he believes the answers will be found in the understanding of a higher systematic pattern of neural firing and not in the structure of the brain itself ) , he never gives an account on how the subjective will be incorporated into this field of study .
Alan Wallace is quick to point out the limitations of neuroscience , claiming that fMRI scans and other similar methods of observing the brain only reveal neural correlates of consciousness ( NCC ) and say little regarding its causes .
Wallace , instead , proposes the methodology of introspection , as it was first introduced in Western psychology by William James in the late 1800s , in understanding the nature and origins of consciousness .
Wallace , in a nutshell , claims it would be absurd to pursue a study of consciousness and ignore the potential knowledge that can come from direct observation of the subject being studied .
During Wallace ’s opening statements he reveals to the audience why introspection had been wrongfully thrown to the waste bin during the early years of psychology .
Due to the previous success of the scientific method in explaining astronomy , physics , biology , and chemistry , early researchers of psychology , such as John B. Watson and B.F.
Skinner , began to ditch introspection and move towards behaviorism in an attempt to justify psychology as a more scientific field of study .
Despite the West ’s early reluctance towards introspection , Wallace gives a primary example of where introspection has had much success – which is in Buddhist psychology .
Well - trained Buddhist monks have focused on direct study of the mind for centuries before the West ever developed an objective study of mental phenomena .
Wallace emphasizes that introspection , which he has refurbished as the more scientifically - accepted term “ metacognition , ” can be used as a legitimate methodology of studying the mind .
He goes on to suggest that the acceptance of metacognition as a useful tool of observing the mind could be as revolutionary as the telescope was towards the development of astronomy .
Searle accepts that metacognition could offer some insights into consciousness , but if so , why have Buddhists not revealed anything true about the causes of consciousness since the Buddha ’s death in roughly 400 BCE ?
Searle goes on to say that perhaps Wallace ’s insistence on meditation and metacognition as a means of studying consciousness is perhaps a “ hidden agenda ” to prove the existence of something metaphysical , such as a soul .
But , Searle , how can a suggested methodology have a “ hidden agenda ? ”
Should n’t the technique of metacognition prove its worth in whatever knowledge it reveals or fails to reveal about the mind ?
Searle also claims that Buddhism has not yielded anything useful about the origins of consciousness , and then later in the debate admits his ignorance towards Buddhism as a whole .
Even so , the methods of Buddhists actually compare quite well to the rigors of the scientific method – and perhaps science is even in a desperate need for an alternative tool of observing the mind .
The Buddha laid out a very disciplined and precise method for diving into a direct study of consciousness .
And any initial faults or misunderstandings of the Buddha ’s methods have been corrected in various traditions and interpretations – over two thousand years of improvement .
Further , the Buddha ’s methods of introspection yield results that are perfectly capable of replication ( just like any good scientific finding ) .
The only thing is it requires a lot of work and a lot of meditation .
But Wallace says : what tool of knowledge does not take some work to perfect ?
Before one can do science , one needs to spend the time to understand math and statistics – how is this any different from learning the methods and language of the Buddha ?
But the real question would be : why should we deny metacognition or neuroscience ?
This is one thing Wallace and Searle are both in agreement about : let us just do whatever works !
Wallace thinks , “ Yes !
We should study brains !
Do that !
Why should n’t we ? ”
Perhaps we need further study of both brain science and meditation , which is already beginning to become a mainstream trend in the cognitive sciences .
Despite all the disagreements , one thing is for certain : everyone is willing to come together to help workout this hard problem of consciousness .
This is evident in the Mind and Life Institute which holds annual meetings between neuroscientists , biologists , psychologists , Buddhists , physicists , linguists , anthropologists , and those in the field of artificial intelligence and technology , all regarding the study of the mind , consciousness , and mental well - being .
Since the cognitive revolution in the 1950s , the cognitive sciences have truly grown to become one of the most interdisciplinary studies ever to grace mankind , and it is undoubtedly one of the most interesting vehicles of today for the furthering of human understanding and intelligence of the reality we live in .
The Santa Fe Project is a crazy one , and over 6 months ago , David Ackley and I originally talked down at the Santa Fe Institute about what we would need as far as tools were concerned in the software and hardware domain in order to really get a “ feel ” for what we were about to try to solve .
We sketched a few ideas on the back of scrap pieces of paper ( we did n’t have any napkins lying around ) , and came up with a list of humble and meager features we ’d want in a hardware platform : infinite scalability , ad hoc interconnectivity , dynamic boot load and code flashing , physical manifestation of software code , physical computing , compatible with Open Source language work in physical computing like the Arduino platform , a very fast core processor , a more powerful chip than an 8 bit Atmel , yet an approachable basic set of functionality that would allow us to expand on it easily , and a large community of heavy duty , hardcore software and hardware hackers .
Simple !
Errrrr…
Then I jumped on a plane and headed back to New York and rode my motorcycle as quickly as I could to Connecticut , and met with Chris and Mike , and said , there ’s got to be a way to build this thing … right ?
Mike laughed at me , but Chris said bring it on .
( 6 months later )
And so , it ’s with that same kind of pride that you get when you fix a bug and a 1000 line program compiles on the very next try that I proudly introduce the Illuminato X Machina .
The Illuminato X Machina is the result of an Open Source collaboration between David Ackley from the University of New Mexico , Liquidware , and Illuminato Labs .
It ’s what you ’d expect if Complex Adaptive Systems met Open Source Hardware at a bar , drank too much and had a love child that was raised on Physical Computing child support in the suburbs of Modular Electronics .
Then one day that child spontaneously cloned itself hundreds of times , and decided to hold hands with all of its clone siblings so that it could play a crazy N^2 O*log ( O ) game of telephone .
Or something like that .
It ’s a small “ motherboard cell ” that can interchangeably link and connect up to other cells , either rightside up or upside down , to adaptively route packets and power to its neighbors , like a grid of biologic cells , passing nutrients and resources to their neighbors .
Also , each board can program its neighbors using a dynamic bucket - passing bootloader that allows any given cell in the grid to over - ride or re-program neighbors .
Each cell runs a 72 MHz ARM processor with 56 digital I/O pins , and the ability to accept power from any one of its 4 edges .
This means that the cellular grid can expand in any direction , and the reversible interconnections mean it can grow like a crystal in any orientation .
I 've uploaded more pictures to my page on Flickr too .
The Illuminato X Machina boards will be available in a limited quantity run that 's ready 2 months , so I 've put them up for pre-order here .
Basically , it is like the Borg of open source , DIY physical computing … it ’s crazy , and 7 guys and gals will be hacking it like mad over the next couple of months :-)
Despite horrible reviews , Hitman will be making its way back to the big screen .
The movie made over $ 100 million globally , so Fox has green lit a sequel to the money - making Hitman .
It ’s also reported that Fox has hired Kyle Ward , the writer of Kane & Lynch , to pen the script .
Drian Askarieh , Daniel Alter , and Chuck Gordon , three producers from the original flick , will be making their way back to the sequel as well .
It is not known whether Timothy Olyphant , who originally played Agent 47 , will return .
Not much is also known about the director , Xavier Gens .
It was also hinted that the next Hitman game will be coming sooner then we thought .
The report confirming the sequel ’s existence also announced that a new Hitman game will be coming in late 2010 .
“ We are told to expect Hitman 5 by the end of 2010 and that it will take Agent 47 in a whole new direction .
For now , we ’re filing this strictly as a rumor until we get the official word .

Washington , D.C. , August 26 , 2009 - The Central Intelligence Agency participated in every aspect of the wars in Indochina , political and military , according to newly declassified CIA histories .
The six volumes of formerly secret histories ( the Agency 's belated response to a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request by National Security Archive senior fellow John Prados ) document CIA activities in South and North Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia in unprecedented detail .
The histories contain a great deal of new material and shed light on aspects of the CIA 's work that were not well known or were poorly understood .
The new revelations include : The CIA and U.S. Embassy engaged in secret diplomatic exchanges with enemy insurgents of the National Liberation Front , at first with the approval of the South Vietnamese government , a channel which collapsed in the face of deliberate obstruction by South Vietnamese officials [ Document 2 pp. 58-63 ] .
As early as 1954 that Saigon leader Ngo Dinh Diem would ultimately fail to gain the support of the South Vietnamese people .
Meanwhile the CIA crafted a case officer - source relationship with Diem 's brother Ngo Dinh Nhu as early as 1952 , a time when the French were still fighting for Indochina [ Document 1 , pp. 21 -2 , 31 ] .
CIA raids into North Vietnam took place as late as 1970 , and the program authorizing them was not terminated until April 1972 , despite obtaining no measurable results [ Document 5 , pp. 349-372 ] .
In 1965 , a time when the South Vietnamese regime was again in conflict with the Buddhist majority , the CIA secretly funded Buddhist training programs [ Document 2 , p. 38 ] .
CIA involvement in South Vietnamese elections goes beyond what has been previously disclosed , and matches the scope of the agency 's controversial 1960s political action program in Chile [ Document 2 , pp. 51 - 58 ] .
In the later period of the war , according to the CIA 's own historian , Saigon leader Nguyen Van Thieu 's mistrust of the United States increasingly focused on the CIA [ Document 2 , p. 87 ] .
The CIA historian , contrary to neo -orthodox arguments regarding progress in the Vietnam war , concedes that U.S. pacification efforts failed in Vietnam — including the so - called " Phoenix " program — and traces this failure to several causes , including South Vietnamese lack of interest and investment in this key facet of the conflict [ Document 3 , p. xv-xvi ] .
The CIA was aware from the very early 1960s of the problems posed by Laotian drug trafficking to its Laos campaign , but not only took no action , it did not even make drug trafficking a reporting requirement until the Nixon administration declared war on drugs [ Document 5 , p. 535 ] .
The CIA 's Vietnam Story
By John Prados
The Central Intelligence Agency 's Vietnam war history actually begins in 1950 , when agency officers moved to French Indochina as part of the United States legation in Saigon .
During the French war in Indochina the CIA 's involvement grew to encompass a base in Hanoi but not much more , since the French did not encourage CIA activity .
The French tamped down further after an incident in which CIA officers were revealed as reaching past them to open channels to Vietnamese nationalists .
When the lands of Indochina — Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia — became independent " associated states " the CIA expanded its activity somewhat , and during the last year of the French war , 1953 - 1954 , agency involvement grew considerably as the French were obliged to accept U.S. assistance with unconventional warfare activities as a condition of expanded military aid from the Eisenhower administration , and with the use of CIA proprietary aircraft of Civil Air Transport ( later Air America ) in Laos and at Dien Bien Phu .
Starting with the Geneva agreements of 1954 the CIA 's role expanded further and began to assume the shape it would keep through the remainder of the Indochina wars .
Agency stations were created in South Vietnam and Laos , an agency base remained in North Vietnam until the spring of 1955 , and the CIA was represented in Cambodia until that nation broke relations with the United States in 1963 ( a CIA station in Cambodia was created following U.S. intervention there in 1970 ) .
Besides its crucial importance in gathering intelligence and providing interpretations of events in Indochina , the agency was arguably as important as the U.S. embassy in political relations with the South Vietnamese government .
Moreover , as the primary action agency for counterinsurgency through most of the war , it actually conducted a full - scale war in Laos and ran a variety of paramilitary programs in South Vietnam .
The agency 's broad span of activities reached into virtually every aspect of the Indochina war .
The newly declassified CIA histories cover much but not all of this ground .
Despite their massive size — almost two thousand pages in six volumes — the histories leave out significant pieces of the story .
The most notable lack is any substantial treatment of U.S. intelligence analysis on Indochina , although a complementary study by General Bruce Palmer , Jr. , published in 1984 , dealt with intelligence estimates in some detail and the reports themselves have since been declassified .
( Note 1 ) The present set of monographs nevertheless stand as the broadest recounting of CIA operational experience in the Southeast Asia conflict , a substantial achievement for their author , Thomas Ahern , a clandestine services officer who served during the war in both South Vietnam and Laos .
Ahern began work on the series in the early 1990s , completed the first in 1998 and finished the last of the series in 2006 .
Some discussion of the individual studies appears below .
In terms of overall scope , Ahern began with South Vietnam , with a discussion of CIA 's role during the high years of the war and the crisis of the final evacuation from Saigon .
Published in October 1998 under the auspices of the agency 's Center for the Study of Intelligence , Ahern 's CIA and the Generals deals with the agency 's political action programs , its role in elections , in secret negotiations , and CIA liaison with the South Vietnamese government from 1964 through the end of the war in 1975 .
Ahern 's second monograph , CIA and the House of Ngo ( June 2000 ) , returns to the dawn of the American involvement and covers the same ground for the period of the leadership of Ngo Dinh Diem , which ended late in 1963 .
The third volume in the series , CIA and Rural Pacification in South Vietnam ( August 2001 ) , bridges both eras and focuses in on operational programs that attempted to gain the loyalty of Vietnam 's peasantry for the Saigon government or to neutralize the parallel hierarchy of the insurgents , the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam .
In February 2004 the Center for the Study of Intelligence put out Ahern 's more limited monograph , Good Questions , Wrong Answers : CIA 's Estimates of Arms Traffic Through Sihanoukville , Cambodia , During the Vietnam War .
In this study Ahern comes closest to reviewing intelligence analysis , although most of his treatment of the subject remains redacted in the version of this document that the CIA recently declassified .
Another specialized study followed in May 2005 , The Way We Do Things : Black Entry Operations into North Vietnam , in which Thomas
Ahern turns his attention to CIA efforts to mount clandestine espionage and sabotage missions into the Democratic Republic of Vietnam , primarily in the period until 1963 , although there is some treatment of later efforts .
By far the longest of the Ahern narratives is his 2006 monograph on the CIA in Laos , Undercover Armies : CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos , 1961 - 1973 , in which he deals with the full panoply of agency activity in that landlocked Southeast Asian nation .
All of these studies provide much detail , although , as noted , they are thin on some aspects of CIA 's work .
Aside from intelligence analysis , the CIA monographs contain little on early agency activities during the French war , on the organization and function of the agency 's Saigon Station , on intelligence collection ( excepting specific cases of particular operatives , and the question of collection on Sihanoukville ) , on its activities in Cambodia ( except as just mentioned ) , on CIA coordination with the U.S. military , on its relations with agency proprietaries like Air America , or ( except in the case of CIA missions into North Vietnam ) on the specifics of CIA 's cooperation with South Vietnamese police and intelligence services .
Nowhere in these many pages will the reader discover a figure for the overall number of CIA officers who served in the Vietnam war or on the agency 's casualties in that conflict .
A second problem is the deletion of materials which CIA censors continue to keep secret .
This is a particular difficulty with Ahern 's monographs on North Vietnamese operations , the Sihanoukville intelligence dispute , and the volume on Laos .
The Sihanoukville study , in particular , is so heavily redacted that readers may fail to grasp the story .
( Note 2 ) The monograph on pacification was previously declassified in 2007 .
A comparison between that version of Ahern 's study and the one released in 2009 reveals that the bulk of materials protected by CIA censors in their earlier redaction are of purely historical interest .
It can only be hoped that censors today are protecting true national security secrets .

This volume covers the early years of the agency 's work in Vietnam , and ends with the South Vietnamese military coup that overthrew Saigon leader Ngo Dinh Diem , of which the CIA was aware if not complicit and the Kennedy administration was involved .
The CIA historian stops short of any admission that the agency was an actor in the Diem coup .
Except in minor details this CIA monograph does not go much beyond what is already in the public record .
( Note 3 ) One minor detail of interest is that , as late as the morning of the day the Diem coup actually occurred , the U.S. military command in South Vietnam advised CIA that nothing was happening in Saigon and that the agency should stop reporting that any coup was imminent [ p. 207 ] .
Among other highlights this CIA history notes that agency experts recognized as early as August 1954 that Diem would have political problems , that the CIA went beyond headquarters guidance — and effectively set policy for supporting Diem — and that its relationship with his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu began as early as 1952 [ pp. 21-31 ] .
The CIA history concludes that the " most fateful episode " in the agency 's relationship with Diem came not at the time of the 1963 coup but during a Saigon political crisis in the spring of 1955 [ p.75 ] .
By October 1958 , before the communist insurgency in South Vietnam had even begun , CIA had assessed that Diem 's popularity was in decline [ p. 127 ] .
In fact , in its overall conclusions the CIA history argues that " the near - destruction of the Communist apparatus in the countryside , between 1955 and 1959 , resulted not in the consolidation of Saigon 's control , but in the creation of a political no - man 's land , " and further that " whatever the possibilities in 1955 , it is possible that by 1963 the conflict could not be won at all , or at least by any politically sustainable level of American commitment " [ p. 219 ] .

This volume of the CIA history picks up where the first one leaves off , providing an overview of CIA efforts from the moment of Diem 's 1963 assassination to the fall of Saigon in 1975 .
Roughly a third of the entire study is devoted to the two - year period after the Paris Accords of 1973 and the trauma of the evacuation of Saigon , which agency sources regard as the highlight of the work .
( Note 4 ) The CIA history nevertheless packs a host of important material into its condensed account of the decade that followed Diem 's rule .
The account shows that the CIA 's relationship with Saigon leaders changed over time , depending on the agency 's station chief , the U.S. ambassador , and the South Vietnamese leaders involved .
In the final period from about 1969 , when Nguyen Van Thieu led the Saigon government , " Thieu 's mistrust of the U.S. increasingly focused on the CIA " [ p. 87 ] in spite of numerous agency efforts to support him through political action , propaganda , and advice .
Among the highlights in this volume are material on the CIA and South Vietnamese Buddhists — whom the CIA secretly supported and trained in 1965 , shortly before the Saigon government launched a campaign against them , and whom the agency did not view as communist - instigated [ pp. 38 , 43 , 101 ] .
The agency 's involvement in South Vietnamese politics resumed in 1966 with cash subsidies to Saigon police accounts that had been drained to support loyalists for Saigon leaders and continued with substantial involvement in the South Vietnamese elections of 1967 and 1971 — at far greater levels than anything previously disclosed [ pp. 45 , 51 - 58 , 100 - 102 ] .
Agency involvement went beyond cash to include using CIA agents to feed ideas to South Vietnamese leaders , openly providing suggestions for a political platform , supporting individual candidates , using agents to counteract charges of electoral fraud , and manipulating the South Vietnamese National Assembly to certify election results .
Besides its interventions in elections ,
Ahern believes that the CIA 's most important political initiative was its clandestine contact with the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam .
The CIA history provides a detailed account of a series of feelers early in 1967 and again from late that year , past the Tet offensive , and into February of 1968 .
Feelers culminated in offers to exchange prisoners which were first approved and then sabotaged by the Saigon government [ pp. 47-50 , 58-63 ] .
The Tet offensive itself led to a proposal from an informal group of CIA Vietnam experts to present the Saigon government with a virtual ultimatum for reform , an " Operation Shock " [ p. 73 ] .
Agency officials differed on what the impact of Tet had been , however .
Late 1968 negotiations between the United States and North Vietnam over a bombing halt led Saigon leaders to break off their CIA contacts for more than a month , after which Thieu began to delegate his side of the relationship to other officials [ pp. 84 -86 ] .
By 1969 the CIA worried that political crisis might lead Thieu — as Ngo Dinh Nhu had once done — to denounce the CIA [ 87 ] .
In 1971 a Saigon official close to Thieu suggested U.S. officials arrange briefings for him in a way calculated to pressure the United States to crack down on its Vietnam dissenters [ 104 ] .
Despite some success in anticipating the North Vietnamese offensive of 1972 , the agency 's last station chief in South Vietnam argued that " the illusion that the war is over and we have won is shattered " [ 109 ] .
Document 3 : Thomas L. Ahern , Jr. , CIA and Rural Pacification in South Vietnam , Center for the Study of Intelligence , August 2001 SOURCE : FOIA
This volume of the CIA 's Vietnam history goes back to the beginning of agency involvement to lay out a record of its efforts in behalf of the South Vietnamese to encourage popular support for the Saigon government .
The CIA historian argues that the agency 's record shows the CIA " understood the insurgency little better than did the rest of the bureaucracy " [ p. xiv ] .
In fact the Saigon station took the lead innovating pacification measures throughout the conflict , with the headquarters role essentially limited to commentary on Saigon station proposals .
The major CIA initiatives through the war are profiled , including early civic action , the village defense program , the formation of mountain scouts , strategic hamlets , people 's action teams , census grievance and revolutionary development programs , the intelligence coordination and exploitation program , and the late - war " Phoenix " program — all of which flowed from agency field officers or the Saigon station itself .
Pacification proved unsuccessful , in the CIA historian 's view , partly because South Vietnamese authorities from the beginning were not well established in the villages — 80 percent of the government bureaucracy was located in Saigon or in provincial capitals in the beginning [ p. 5 ] , and later for reasons ranging from lack of American focus to Saigon obstructionism .
During the Diem period the CIA Saigon station 's paramilitary chief , a key actor in all pacification activities , is quoted saying , " The Vietnamese official is the real obstacle to success " [ p. 59 ] .
In the later part of the war , which the CIA historian views as 1969 to 1975 , he concludes that this period " saw the gradual decay of the CIA - sponsored pacification programs , as the Vietnamese elected not to invest in them " [ p. xv-xvi ] .
This conclusion in the CIA 's official history contradicts scholarship that argues the National Liberation Front was defeated by pacification success during this late period .

This volume of CIA history , a shorter monograph , centers specifically on agency programs to infiltrate singleton agents and reconnaissance / sabotage teams into the Democratic Republic of Vietnam .
Here
Ahern picks up the story from the beginning of the Diem government and focuses primarily on the period until late 1963 , when CIA 's primary role was ceded to the U.S. military .
There is a small amount of material on later cooperation with military programs until 1968 , and a bit on late war missions into North Vietnam ( greater detail regarding these is actually provided in Document 5 ) .
The CIA history shows that the initiation of penetration missions came slowly due in great measure to dilatory South Vietnamese action — the Diem government and its intelligence agencies repeatedly promised cooperation and then did little to advance the program for months or years .
One highlight is that Diem took the seagoing junk the CIA procured and modified for spy missions and leased it to a Japanese fishing company , while claiming success emplacing fictitious agent networks in North Vietnam .
Through 1959 agreements on intelligence sharing with CIA plus U.S. support of the South Vietnamese police yielded no data at all [ p. 8 ] .
Once the CIA began mounting its own missions , the first long - term agent inserted into the North initially sent a series of 23 messages to his handlers .
This represented " the longest and most prolific radio correspondence for any penetration of the program " [ p. 13 ] .
Dozens of subsequent missions and hundreds of commandos sent into North Vietnam , the CIA history makes clear , produced very little intelligence .
The study documents multiple cases where assorted elements cast doubt on the continued loyalty or reliability of commando teams while the CIA 's Saigon station repeatedly ignored the evidence to maintain the program still had value .
An important revelation in this monograph is that the CIA station , in the wake of the Geneva accords of 1962 , proposed a covert sabotage offensive against North Vietnam [ p. 29-30 ] .

In what is by far the longest of the CIA histories , Thomas Ahern takes on the ambitious task of examining the front of the Southeast Asian conflict where the CIA waged its own war , a full - service operation in which it served as the main action agency while also supplying its standard covert action and political warfare efforts .
The study details the inception and progress of the array of tribal secret armies the CIA recruited in Laos , most prominently that of the Hmong tribe , whose military leader was General Vang Pao .
While , in general , this volume is long on combat action it nevertheless passes quickly over certain key events , such as the specific Hmong role in the resumption of the Laotian war in 1963 ; and the key tipping point of Operation " Triangle , " in the summer of 1964 , when the U.S. cast off the Geneva restraints .
Other important military events of the 1969 - 1971 period , declassified elsewhere , are shrouded in secrecy here by censors ' redactions .
The book is best read in conjunction with the Air Force official history of the war in northern Laos , declassified through the Archive 's law suit against that agency and which the Archive posted in April 2008 .
( Note 6 ) This CIA history is also circumspect on relations within the U.S. embassy , on those between agency managers in Vientiane and in Thailand , on those between the CIA and U.S. Air Force , on the CIA 's management of Air America , on the operation of the CIA base at Long Tieng , and on political action in the Laotian twin capitals .
The role of Thailand in the CIA war is represented here largely by deleted material even though this has been declassified .
Among the highlights of this CIA history is the coverage of drug trafficking in Laos [ pp. 535-548 ] , and the treatment of missions into North Vietnam mounted from Laos during 1970 - 1972 [ pp. 349-372 ] .

( Source : CIA and the Generals , p. 108 Probably the most important intelligence dispute of the Vietnam war in the period after 1968 concerned the importance of the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville in supplying North Vietnamese and National Liberation Front ( NLF ) forces in the lower part of South Vietnam and the base areas located in contiguous parts of Cambodia .
The CIA began reporting on the importance of Cambodia to the NLF in 1965 , and arms traffic through the port became an issue the following year , with the first of a series of visits by Chinese merchant vessels .
The extent of this traffic was debated among U.S. intelligence agencies and the Military Assistance Command Vietnam ( MACV ) .
The dispute became extremely intense , featuring visits to South Vietnam by senior CIA officials , by study groups deputized by the United States Intelligence Board , and a variety of internal debates .
The CIA historian was right to have attempted a dissection of this dispute .
Unfortunately for the public , much of the dispute remains opaque in this agency monograph , which is so heavily redacted by CIA censors that much of the detail is simply missing .
The highlight of this monograph concerns government secrecy : whereas the CIA usually protects the specifics of raw intelligence reporting ( " sources and methods " ) , in the Cambodia case it seems to have released that material and kept secret much of the substance of the intelligence debate on this matter .

A TALE OF OBSESSIVE SECRECY
Before addressing the substance in the new CIA histories it will be useful to pause and consider what this case also shows about the U.S. Government 's broken system for declassifying and releasing records .
In actuality , this CIA release was not at all a voluntary contribution to American history , but was compelled by a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request .
Filed in 1992 , that FOIA request may be the longest running case in the CIA 's files , and its treatment shines a blinding light on how the agency handles its statutory duty to release records .
A whole series of questionable actions were taken by the CIA 's FOIA officers in handling the materials involved here , in fact a sordid story that only begins with the seventeen years that have been necessary to bring this information to light .
Only an agency obsession with secrecy can account for the way in which this FOIA request was treated .
At the time of the request none of the governments involved in the war any longer existed — even the North Vietnamese state had been transformed — the CIA actors were in retirement , the Vietnam war had entered history , and the most recent events concerned were almost twenty years into the past .
By 2001 , the time of the CIA 's initial response this was even more true , and by 2009 the continued presence of this FOIA request on the agency 's books was positively embarrassing .
The original FOIA request called for " any retrospective study or monograph , or official history " compiled on a series of subjects including operations against North Vietnam from 1960 - 1975 , in Laos between 1958 and 1975 , and the same plus administrative histories of the CIA and its stations in South Vietnam , and Laos in the years from 1960 to 1975 .
The CIA took nine years to respond to this request and when it did so , in early 2001 , it replied to the effect that no agency records could be identified that were responsive to the FOIA .
Not only did that claim not pass the smell test , dozens of CIA monographs that are directly responsive are cited in footnotes in these newly released histories .
This analyst had learned in the interim that the present CIA histories , written Thomas Ahern , were in preparation .
In an April 2001 letter appealing the CIA finding I cited these works as examples of materials that were obviously within the scope of the request .
In response to my appeal , the CIA released these histories through a letter on February 25 , 2009 .
In the course of its declassification work on this FOIA request the following irregularities have occurred : * CIA FOIA officers substituted the Ahern studies for the larger body of materials that were clearly implicated in the FOIA request .
This was a matter of policy , not the individual action of a CIA information official .
At the time of the request the agency had sought — and received — legislative approval , under the 1986 CIA Act , to exclude " operational records " from FOIA .
It happens that the CIA possesses an extensive collection of histories of its secret operations , both contemporaneous and retrospective .
In applying for the operational records exclusion , agency director William J. Casey made explicit promises to Congress that this grant of authority would be accompanied by a much more vigorous at declassifying historical material — of which these " Clandestine Service Historical Papers " are obvious examples .
Instead the CIA moved to extend the definition of " operational records to include the histories .
*
The agency also did nothing to fulfill its obligation to review the clandestine service records every ten years with a view to terminating their status as " operational records "
Ten year reviews took place in 1996 and 2006 under that requirements but it cannot be said that the Agency has followed the letter or spirit of the law .
For example , in its 2006 review , the CIA expanded the scope of Directorate of Operations file series that may be excluded from FOIA , including " Clandestine Service History Program Files " as well as files of the Directorate of Science and Technology and the " Security Center . "
Conversely , during the period when this FOIA request was pending , the CIA had no problem giving some researchers privileged access to historical material that it would not provide through the FOIA .
Favored authors were able to inspect histories of operations against the Soviet Union , in Eastern Europe , on psychological warfare and paramilitary operations , on the Bay of Pigs , and on the Berlin Tunnel operation , just to cite cases of which I am aware .
At a minimum this establishes that the CIA itself was prepared to disregard the operational records issue when it chose to .
In the present FOIA case , the CIA used its shaky legal authority to reject a request for older clandestine service histories substituting the Ahern studies for them .
* Agency authorities actually released one of the Ahern histories , the volume on Pacification , in 2007 .
In declassifying that material at that time , the agency did not provide the study to the original FOIA requestor in partial response to the freedom of information case , or even directly inform him that the material had been opened .
*
The recently released histories , in particular the Laos volume , have redacted material on subjects already in the public domain .
Excised passages in the Laos history , for example , judging from their context and positioning , must refer to items that were declassified in the corresponding volume of the Foreign Relations of the United States series that was published as long ago as 1999 .
Since references to the Foreign Relations series make up the vast majority of the limited number of footnotes the CIA declassified in this history , the agency had to be aware of this fact .
Fortunately , an Archive FOIA lawsuit against the Air Force forced declassification of an important official history of air operations in Northern Laos , which includes information that some CIA reviewers believed they were keeping secret when they scrubbed this agency Laos history .
This illustrates the subjectivity of the review process even at CIA .
*
This author responded to the actual FOIA release by filing an appeal of the deleted material in the Ahern histories that focused on the public domain material and other items that should no longer be construed as secret .
The CIA rejected the appeal on the grounds that the right of appeal had been exhausted when objecting to the CIA 's arbitrary claim that no Vietnam records existed .
In other words , the CIA chose to regard a protest of its administrative action as exhausting the statutory right of appeal on the substance of its actual declassification .
*
Beyond this highly questionable action the CIA failed to supply some missing pages from the Ahern histories even though the requester had noted in his appeal that certain pages of the Ahern histories had unaccountably not been included in the materials released .
It is normal practice to supply pages missing from documents .
*
In addition the agency larded its response to the FOIA request by adding many hundreds of pages of declassified National Intelligence Estimates and related documents which had not figured in the FOIA , and had in fact already been released — and published — by the National Intelligence Council on CIA 's behalf in April 2005 .
The only function of this action is to enable the agency to claim the pages as achievements in the official reports it is obliged to file with U.S. authorities on the extent of its declassification activity .
*
Less than a month separates the CIA 's response to this FOIA request from its general release to the public of the same material .
Because the National Security Archive is dedicated to making information available to the American people , it does not object to this final irregularity , but it should nevertheless be noted .
By this action , at a minimum , the CIA has implicitly recognized that release of these records was in the public 's interest all along — calling into question its seventeen year delay in making the material available .
*
Finally , the CIA summarily rejected a subsequent FOIA request for a number of the " Clandestine Service Historical Papers " identified in the Ahern histories — and in doing so it failed to meet the acknowledgement and response deadlines specified in the law .
The rejection was on the grounds that these were " operational records . "
These irregularities are not fanciful , they are matters of record , and they illustrate the weaknesses of a FOIA system that largely leaves federal agencies to be the judge of their own action .
The agency , it seems , cannot escape from its obsession with secrecy .
The Freedom of Information Act makes illegal the " arbitrary and capricious denial " of information but the CIA Act trumps that .
Plainly Congress needs to supervise the Agency 's actions under the CIA
Act to ensure that it conforms to the spirit and letter of the law .
This case also points to the need for changes in secrecy policy so that historical information is not treated like today 's secrets .
A useful change would be oversight by the Information Security Oversight Office ( ISOO ) of declassification manuals used by federal agencies .
Moreover , a new executive order on secrecy policy could end the CIA 's veto over decisions by the Interagency Declassification Appeals panel so it will not have that threat to block declassification action on mandatory review requests .

“ Flickr had removed the Joker image due to copyright - infringement concerns , Alkhateeb says the company told him in an e-mail .
A Flickr spokeswoman declined to comment due to a company policy that bars discussing inquiries about individual users . ”
There ’s an interesting piece over at the Los Angeles Times today about the unmasking of the author of the iconic Obama / Joker photo ( left ) .
The photo recently began turning up in Los Angeles with the word “ socialism ” printed underneath it in similar style to the famous Shepard Fairey Obama HOPE poster and since then has been the subject of considerable debate and online interest .
It turns about that , according to the Times , a 20 - year - old college student from Chicago , Firas Alkhateeb , is the artist behind the work .
Apparently Alkhateeb made the image using Adobe ’s Photoshop software .
After creating the image Alkhateeb posted it to his Flickr account and ended up getting over 20,000 views on it .
20,000 views that is until Flickr pulled the image down censoring him , along with everyone who commented on the image , citing “ copyright - infringement concerns , ” according to the Times .
Personally I think it ’s too bad that Flickr decided to censor this iconic image .
Whatever you may or may not think about this image and it ’s appropriateness , the image would absolutely and unequivocally be considered parody and parody has always been one of the most effective defenses against any copyright complaint .
Parody is why Weird Al gets away with creating a song called “ Eat It , ” directly to the tune of Michael Jackson ’s “ Beat It . ”
What ’s more , in the interest of free speech , political parody * especially * is perhaps given the widest berth of all .
This is why Ralph Nader was able to directly rip MasterCard ’s “ Priceless ” campaign and why the courts subsequently ruled in his favor after MasterCard sued him over it .
Earlier today , a friend and Flickr contact of mine from DMU , A Boy and His Prime , who is a law student , put it more directly .
“ If you produce something that is transformative , and not derivative , then it ’s fair use ( Folsom v Marsh ) .
In Campbell v Acuff - Rose , 510 U.S. 569 , Souter seemed to suggest that the main idea is substitutability , and that makes a lot of sense when you consider what copyright protects ( i.e. your interest in your own work ) .
The Jokerbama does not replace the original photo in any sense . ”
I ’m not a lawyer myself of course and would be interested if anyone else out there who is would like to add comment as well .
Personally , I think it ’s unfortunate that Flickr would embark upon yet another act of censorship when an image was so clearly parody and fair use .
What bothers me even more is that this is still another example of Flickr censoring users who are critical of President Obama and his policies .
In June Flickr deleted the entire account and photostream of Flickr user Shepherd Johnson after he posted comments critical of the President on the Official White House Photostream .
Now I ’m actually a Democrat who voted for President Obama and am super happy to see the President using Flickr .
But while Flickr ’s staff is obviously proud of the fact that they have President Obama ’s official photostream on Flickr , I do n’t think that this fact ought to be the impetuous for them to censor and delete users who are critical of the President .
I ’m also troubled by this censorship in light of the clear pro-Obama bias that Flickr ’s staff has shown .
If you do a search for the word “ Obama ” on the flickr blog you get 74 different results , many of them very positive .
By contrast a search for “ Bush ” on the Flickr blog only pulls up 5 results ( even though Flickr has existed much longer under President Bush ’s presidency than President Obama ’s ) .
Now I have no trouble or problem with anyone on Flickr staff or anyone at Yahoo personally supporting whatever candidate they want .
Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz personally contributed to both Bush and McCain and currently serves as a finance co-chair for Republican Gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman ’s finance committe .
But I think when personal politics begin to take on a bigger role in corporate communications and especially when it begins resulting in politically motivated censorship that things have gone too far in the wrong direction .
I hope that Yahoo does in fact consider it a mistake in hindsight to have deleted this clear fair use image critical of the President and that they take steps to ensure that this sort of politically motivated censorship by Flickr Staff is curtailed in the future .
I ’ve contacted Alkhateeb about his image deletion and will hopefully be able to report back with more directly from him when I hear back from him .
I ’ve also posted the exact same image that Flickr deleted to my own photostream .
Let ’s see if Flickr decides to censor me as well .
Update : bitchville over at Flickr pointed out that using the Weird Al example is actually a poor one since Weird Al actually had permission from Michael Jackson to record that song .
I should have researched that more .
A better example of the courts rulling in favor of parody would be that of the band 2 Live Crew and their version of “ Pretty Woman . ”
From publaw.com :
” The United States Supreme Court in Campbell v. Acuff - Rose Music , Inc. ( 1994 ) stated in no uncertain terms that a parody as a form of criticism or comment could be fair use of a copyrighted work .
Oh , Pretty Woman is a rock ballad written by Roy Orbison and William Dees .
Luther Campbell and his musical rapper group , 2 Live Crew , wrote a rap song entitled Pretty Woman that had substantial similarities to the Orbison / Dees song .
2 Live Crew attempted to obtain permission for their parody from Acuff - Rose , the publisher of Oh , Pretty Woman , but were refused permission .
2 Live Crew then proceeded without permission to release their rap song and accorded Orbison / Dees with authorial credit and listed Acuff - Rose as the publisher .
Acuff - Rose then brought a lawsuit , which at the trial court level ruled in favor of 2 Live Crew based upon its fair use parody defense .
This decision was reversed on appeal when the Sixth Circuit ruled against the fair use parody defense because of the commercial nature of the 2 Live Crew rendition and the presumption of market harm that the rap rendition might cause for the Orbison / Dees song .
The Sixth Circuit ’s decision was then appealed to the Supreme Court .
The Supreme Court accepted 2 Live Crew ’s song as a parody because the rap song mimicked the original to achieve its message and because it “ reasonably could be perceived as commenting on the original [ Oh , Pretty Woman ] or criticizing it , to some degree . ” ”
Update 2 : More from The Inquisitor , Read Write Web , and I Think .
Update 3 : News Busters points out that there are plenty of anti-Bush Time Magazine covers that are on Flickr that apparently are not “ copyright ” violations .
Update 4 : On Slashdot here .
Update 5 : RWW on the NY Times here .
Valleywag / Gawker on the issue here and Techmeme here .
Update 6 : Flickr is now saying that they received a DMCA takedown notice over this issue .
From Heather Champ at Flickr :
“ Flickr must be compliant with all local laws within the 21 countries where we are .
The Yahoo !
Terms of Service in all of those regions outlines what the process is for dealing with infringement of copyright .
In this intance , the Yahoo !
Copyright Team here in the US received a complete Notice of Infringement as outlined by the DMCA ( Digitial Millenium Copyright Act ) .
Under the DMCA , an individual may choose to file a counterclaim . ”
It is interesting that prior to this response by Heather that Flickr / Yahoo was stonewalling people on the issue saying that it is their policy not to discuss individual accounts .
And yet now they are discussing an individual account after a barrage of negative press .
Heather also points out that “ there appears to be a whole lot of makey uppey going in the news and blogosphere about this event . ” [ my emphasis ] .
It ’s nice to see Flickr treat adults , blogs and news organizations reporting on a serious issue like they are children .
As Flickr has received a DMCA takedown notice , my further questions would be
1 . Who filed the takedown notice ?
2. Does Flickr take any steps to ensure that takedown notices are valid or do they just blindly remove them 100 % of the time ( note that WordPress recently defended the Fake Chuck Westall parody blog after Canon Inc. , sent them a takedown request where they felt that there was no valid copyright concern ) .
3 . Did they retain a back up copy of both the image and all of the comments that were posted to the image to ensure that they can restore them if the DMCA notice is refuted ?
If not , why not ?

In an unrelated case it seems that Flickr has received yet another public criticism in their help forum today over yet another deleted account .
Apparently this account had women with bikinis on it who were tagged with the word “ babe . ”
So in addition to shots of men without their shirts on taken by professional photographers , it seems that photos of women in bikinis now also might be forbidden on the site .
No word yet if they received a DMCA takedown notice over this one yet or not of if it ’s just another one of their attempts to use their vague “ do n’t be that guy ” policy against a user .
In this dramatization of the 2000 Presidential election , Al Gore concedes the Presidency to George W. Bush , but recants when he learns of irregularities in the Florida vote count .

Between faulty voting equipment and the vagaries of Florida 's Secretary of State Katherine Harris , a thirty - six - day stalemate ensues .

I. Energy - source conversion and coal - mine labour
The Miike coal mine was first developed during the Meiji Restoration of 1868 and was nationalized in 1872 .
After nationalization it was government policy to use prisoners to work in the mines .
In 1888 there were 3,102 people engaged in mining , 2,144 or 69 per cent of whom were prisoners .
In 1890 the Mitsui Coal - mining Company bought the Miike mine from the government and continued to use prisoners to mine coal .
It was normal to force these people to work like beasts of burden in a system which produced a minimum of expenses and in which there was no need to advertise for labour .
In fact , after the mine had been taken over by the Mitsui Company , the number of prisoners employed began to decrease , though it continued as a prisoner - based operation until 1930 .
Although the mine was operated under favourable natural conditions , the treatment dispensed to the labourers was very bad .
Indeed , modernization of the mine began using prisoner - based slave labour .
When the Japanese military machine invaded China in 1931 , many of the labourers working in the mine were taken as cannon - fodder .
The resulting shortage of labour became acute and , in order to make up the shortfall , the company used Koreans and , later , Chinese prisoners of war .
In reality these people were subjected to the same harsh treatment that had been meted out to the former prisoners .
In 1945 , after Japan 's defeat in the Second World War , the Chinese and Korean labourers were released from servitude in the mine .
Japan 's production of coal in 1941 was 56,470,000 tons , decreasing to 20,38 ( ) . ( ) ( ) 0 tons in 1946 , a level that was 36 per cent of the 1941 total , just one year after the close of the war .
The Miike mine was no exception to this trend .
and the maximum production of 4,000 tons decreased to 30 ( ) tons in 1946 .
In the post - war period the coal industry faced some very difficult problems .
Even though it had an important role to play in Japan 's post - war economy .
the occupation forces of the United States were not interested in the production of coal .
Since the price of coal produced in Japan was much higher than the international price , the Japanese government had to provide supplementary aid to the industry , but in 1945 , on the instructions of the occupation forces , this aid was cut .
United States economic aid was invested in major industries which could expand on limited capital ; aid to the coal industry was first reduced and then dropped completely after 1949 .
When coal prices went up as a result , the effects were felt in the electricity - generation and steel industries .
The occupation forces abolished all limitations on the importation of coal and on the use of oil .
With this , the fate of the coal industry in Japan was sealed .
In January 1950 the occupation forces issued a memo which allowed the importation of oil and the operation of a refinery on Japan 's Pacific coast .
At that time the Standard Vacuum , Caltex , Tide Water , and Shell oil companies had begun negotiations with companies in Japan for joint venture capital tie-ups .
In the Middle East vast oil discoveries were being made , and the change from coal to oil as an energy source was going on all over the world .
Not only the occupation forces but Japanese economic circles welcomed the change from coal to oil .
However , the coal - miners opposed the change because of a desire to preserve their jobs .
The Miike coal mine became the centre of the opposition movement against this change .
Between 1959 and 1960 disputes arose between the mining capitalists and the labour union , but the miners were defeated .
In this instance about 1,200 miners were forced out of their jobs .
After the defeat of the union movement , the switch from one energy source to the other came into effect very swiftly .
Table 5.1 indicates that in 1955 coal as a primary energy source provided 50.2 per cent of energy needs , but that after the Miike dispute the level decreased , dropping to 16.4 per cent by 1975 , while the use of oil increased from 20.2 to 73.3 per cent .
Through this rapid change in the energy picture , coal mines were forced to reduce prices and increase productivity in order to compete with oil as an energy source .
Coal production at the Miike mine was 14 tons per labourer in June 1958 , but this was increased to 44 tons per person as of October 1963 .
Mined coal was transported by a belt conveyor system , leading to an increase in coal production .
In 1958 over 6,000 tons per day left the mine , rising to over 10,000 tons in 1962 and 13,000 tons by October 1963 .

Attendant upon the increased coal production , there also came an increase in coal dust in the mine , resulting in an ever - expanding risk of mine explosions .
The coal - dust problem should have been made a priority , but in fact the importance of this problem was minimized as production increased .
Twelve conveyor belts were installed in the first mine rationalization , with one person assigned to each belt drive motor and five charged with spreading water and rock dust in order to contend with the coal - dust problem .
This brought to 17 the number employed to control the hazard , but with the dispute between the miners and the company this was reduced to two .
The Miike coal mine was then once again on the upswing , experiencing a great increase in production .
Not only was there a decrease in the number of workers used for explosion security , but the number of coal - transportation and machine - operation workers was also reduced .
The number of workers employed outside the mine was also decreased so that they could be used in the mine .
As a result of these factors , many accidents occurred .
In 1961 , 16 labourers were killed , which was a higher toll than for any other year since 1951 .
Also , 1,922 persons were seriously injured .
Table 5.2 provides an indication of the death - rate per 1,000 man-days .
In November 1960 , before the reorganization of the mine following the labour dispute , the death - rate was 0.4 persons per 1,000 man-days , but after the dispute it climbed to 1.2 persons .
Leading up to the worst disaster in the Miike mine , month by month and year by year these death - rate figures increased .
II .
Modernization of the coal mine and labour conditions
The increases in production levels at the mine produced an intensification of labour activity ; the modernization and mechanization was motivated by the strong rivalry with the oil industry .
Because of the mechanization of the mining and product transportation methods , labourers suffered from ever - increasing hardships .
The mechanization of the coal mine in the post - war era started in 1948 when a flat - bed - type belt conveyor was imported from the Federal Republic of Germany .
If the speed of mining operations was too slow , the belt would not function properly , and this increased pressure on the labourers to speed up their extraction efforts .
In 1956 , a coal planer was introduced from the Federal Republic of Germany .
This equipment , which cut the bottom of the coal seam with its very sharp edges , made much deeper cuts than the equipment the miners had been using previously .
Thus the coal wall , after being cut out by this new machine ' would fall immediately on the conveyor belt and be carried away at once .
The belt conveyor was forced up against the coal seam through the action of water pressure ; then the belt conveyor with the coal planer was brought forward to the coal wall for cutting and immediate extraction .
With the old method , dynamite was used to blow out the coal - seam wall , but the new system eliminated most of the intermediate mining processes .
Because of the introduction of this system , the speed at which mining took place was increased by a factor of two .
The pillars that supported the ceiling of the mine had to be moved faster - water pressure was used to provide the locomotion necessary to move these supports .
Also , with the use of pressurized water , the coal - seam cutter speed was increased by a factor of four .
Because of this great increase in productivity all efforts had to be increased , from the coal - cutting processes to the coal - transportation systems .
With this came an increase in the activity of the miners as the pressures for increased productivity were brought ever more forcefully to the workplace .
There was no room in the production schedules for the maintenance of safety or reduction of hazards .
Mechanization meant that workers were forced to attend to one machine after the other in a very difficult subterranean environment .
Under these circumstances , crisis conditions increased as mechanization progressed .
The working conditions in coal mines are so bad that any comparison with the worst conditions in surface factories provides no adequate understanding of the difficulties involved .
The pressure on workers underground is such that they are under continual stress .
When the pillars that support the roof begin to weaken , rocks fall and much injury results .
There is also the risk of a sudden injection of underground water or problems produced by pockets of methane gas .
Fire is the main hazard in both surface and underground mines , while rocks and water are also major sources of danger .
Any crisis is magnified by the enclosed spaces that are an inherent aspect of underground operations .
The transportation systems for taking out the coal and bringing in tools spread throughout the underground maze like a great spider 's web , and hold the potential for even greater crises .
Rocks fall on the workers , and the coal and rock dust produces any number of lung ailments .
Increased productivity is bought at the cost of workers " health and safety .
It was inevitable that the mechanization of the coal mine should result in a vast increase in the number of crisis situations .

Source : Rodo tokei yoran ( Labour Statistics ) .
During 1959 , the labour union at the Miike coal mine was very active in the safety movement .
Among the 11,711 persons in the union , there was one death , 1,190 serious injuries , and 1,753 slight injuries : thus injury and death were at a 25 per cent level .
After the dispute between the union and the company in 1961 , there were 10,946 union members and the injury and death rate went up to 38 per cent of the membership , or 4,230 persons .
The death and injury rate was higher for coal and other mineral mining than for any other industry , as is clearly seen from table 5.3 .
The most dangerous hazard in any type of mining is that of coal - dust explosions .
At the end of the nineteenth and into the beginning of the twentieth century , in confluence with the rapid worldwide growth of the mining sector , mine explosions occurred with ever - increasing frequency and scale in Europe , the United States of America , and Japan .
In 1906 , the Curie mine in France experienced a massive explosion which killed 1,000 people .
From that time on , the mechanisms of mine explosions were clarified and their number decreased .
However , in Japan alone there was no reduction in coal - mine explosions .
The lessons learned by the international community on this score were not applied in Japan .
As was indicated earlier , safety personnel at the Miike mine had been greatly reduced in number in order that more people could be placed on the production lines .
In a word , the mine was being operated with almost no attention to safety and explosion prevention .
On 9 November 1963 , an explosion occurred in the Mikawa area of the Miike mine , as a result of which 458 persons were killed and 839 suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning .
It is clear that this tragedy occurred as a result of the neglect of mining safety .
III .
The worst of the coal - dust - related mine explosions
In relation to coal mines , and also to other large - scale plants like petrochemical complexes , the most important aspects of plant planning and construction are the preparations for possible worst - case accidents .
In the case of coal - mining , coal dust represents the greatest hazard .
In the first place , the scale of coal - mine explosions is considerable .
Explosions can be sparked by methane gas filling certain areas that are not properly ventilated .
Coal - dust explosions , however , present a particular problem , because coal dust is something that is produced at every point in the mining process and accumulates , through the movement of air and the transportation of coal , on the floors , walls , and ceilings of the mine , all the way from the mine entrance to the deepest shafts .
Therefore , when a small explosion occurs somewhere in the mine , it is followed by a chain reaction fuelled by the coal dust , and the resulting explosion envelops the entire mine infrastructure .
In the second place , coal - dust explosions are the worst type of explosion because there is a great amount of carbon monoxide produced .
As a result of this , many mine workers continue to suffer from the long - term after - effects of carbon monoxide poisoning even if they are lucky enough to be rescued alive .
Methane gas explosions create carbon monoxide when the density of the gas is high , but if there is not much gas it is more often than not dispersed in the air .
However , in coal - dust explosions the story is a very different one .
Coal dust , being a solid rather than a gas , does not burn completely , and high - density coal - dust clouds can be formed .
This prevents adequate air circulation , contributing to the production of carbon monoxide .
Even if a coal - dust explosion does not spread throughout the length and breadth of the mine , the resulting carbon monoxide gas does in fact spread in this way and all the workers are poisoned .
The Miike mine explosion of 1963 was a good example of this .
There is very little methane gas in the coal seams of the Miike mine .
Thus , the possibility of a gas explosion is relatively low and , even if such an explosion came about , the possibility of its initiating a coal - dust explosion is likewise low .
Therefore , in the case of the Miike mine , it is clear that some factor caused the dispersal of the coal dust throughout the mine and some ignition source produced the explosion .
There are two possible locations where the conditions for starting an explosion are ideal ; one is at the seam working face , and the other on the mining slope .
The Miike mine owners were very careless in relation to coal - dust prevention procedures during mining operations .
In order to prevent coal - dust explosions it is necessary to keep the dust out of the air by continuously sprinkling the area with water .
Alternatively , rock dust , which is incombustible , can be mixed with the coal dust to prevent a chain reaction .
However , on the first mining slope , there were absolutely no preventative measures taken in relation to the problem .
According to the testimony of mine workers at the Fukuoka Prosecutor 's Office , one to two centimetres of coal dust had accumulated even at the location of the switch - box for the high - voltage system in the mine , and the walls were black with dust .
The Fukuoka Mine Safety Department required that coal dust be cleaned away once a week , but , in locations where cleaning was difficult because of the height of the walls and ceiling , no such cleaning had taken place .
Thus , the risk of a large dust explosion was inherent in the coal - mining operation , especially when conditions existed that could provide the initial detonation .
IV .
The Miike coal - mine explosion of 9 November 1963
At 3.12 p.m. on 9 November 1963 , a thunderous explosion took place .
At the bottom of the first mining level , ten of the four - wheeled carts filled with coal were being hauled to the surface .
One of the lower three carts derailed and , because of the tension thereby created , the chain of the third cart broke .
At 1,180 metres from the entrance , eight cars began a free - fall run to the bottom of the mine .
They ran free for about 360 metres , increasing their speed by 33 metres per second , the momentum breaking archway support frames in the mine .
Then all of the carts were derailed and turned over .
At this point the explosion took place .
The rapid air displacement caused by the high - speed carts created air cur rents which caused the settled coal dust to mix with the surrounding air .
It is possible that the friction caused by the carts turning over produced the spark that ignited the coal dust ; alternatively , the crashing carts could have damaged the high - voltage cables , and this could have been the ignition point for the explosion .
The compression caused by the explosion moved toward the mine entrance , and , 100 metres from the first explosion , a powerful second explosion was created .
It has been estimated that the wind created by this second explosion was probably travelling at a rate of 1,000 metres per second .
The compression from the second explosion , as it headed toward the bottom of the mine , fortunately did not touch off another explosion , but the carbon monoxide that was created by the two explosions spread throughout the entire mine , creating a disastrous poisoning situation .
At that time the second shift of workers ( 2 to 10 p.m. ) had just started entering the mine , and some of the first - shift workers ( 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. ) were in the process of leaving .
Twenty people were killed by the direct effects of the explosions , but 438 died from acute carbon monoxide poisoning , and 839 suffered the after - effects of poisoning .
1,197 of the 1,403 workers in the mine at the time were either killed by the explosions or suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning .
There is to date no other coal - mine accident in the world that has produced such a large number of casualties .
Amazingly , the Mitsui Coal Mine Company management had no knowledge of the coal - dust explosion problem .
Most labourers believed that coal - dust explosions were caused by methane gas explosions and therefore were not open to ignition from other causes .
Since the coal mine contained almost no methane gas it was believed that coal - dust explosions there were an impossibility .
This explosion was to dislodge that myth very effectively .
If management had shown a greater sense of responsibility toward the potential for coal - dust explosions , appropriate methods of avoiding such disasters would have been taken , cutting down the damage done and minimizing the danger to life and health .
V. Increased numbers of gas - poisoning victims due to a lack of education
The number of deaths and injuries resulting from the explosions was greatly increased by the carbon monoxide problem .
In other words , had the carbon monoxide and other poison gases generated by the explosions been isolated in the immediate area , the amount of death and injury could have been kept to a minimum .
However , the mining company did not make any efforts to provide for such eventualities .
Moreover , it would seem that the company neglected to educate its workers in relation to the potential for gas poisoning .
Indeed , it provided misinformation by spreading the " myth " that coal - dust explosions were impossible in the Miike mine .
If the company was unaware of the relationship between dust explosions and the generation of poison gases , then it can only be said that it was irresponsible in the extreme .
In most cases the explosion victims were not injured in a physical manner , and many of the corpses recovered from the mine showed no scars or scratches at all , since they were victims of monoxide poisoning .
Many of those rescued alive showed very severe symptoms of monoxide poisoning .
The Mitsui Coal Mining Company was aware of these facts but made no attempts to rescue the workers .
It indicated that , because of the breakdown of electricity and telephone communications in the mine after the explosions , conditions inside were unclear , and therefore it was too risky to send in rescue crews .
One must infer from these statements that management was willing for the 1,400 workers trapped inside the mine to be subjected to the possibility of pervasive monoxide poisoning , with no hope of rescue .
The miners of Miike were angered by the situation , feeling that responsible persons should go immediately into the mine with oxygen tanks .
While management was safe from the problem , there were workers in the mine who were at 350 - to 450 - metre depths and 8 kilometres from the entrance in tunnels .
These workers did not know about the explosions and were forced to remain below ground without electricity or telephones .
Figure 5.1 is a sectional layout of the mine where the explosion took place .
The encircled numbers above the line indicate those who died because of the explosions , and those below the line indicate those workers present when the explosions took place .
Fig. 5.1 . Manning Chart at the Time of Explosion ( after Miike Roso , " ( s.38 . 11.g mikawako daibakuhatsu ) shozoku rosobetsu hisai basho hyo , " Miike karano hokoku dan 3 shuu ) .
Note : Circled figures indicate the number of miners assigned ( figure below the line ) and the number of deaths ( figure above the line ) at each station .
The workers who knew about the explosion numbered approximately 200 , who were located close to the bottom of a neighbouring mine shaft .
About SO who were close to the site of the explosions died as a direct result of the conflagration or from the poison gas generated by the sudden combustion .
Another 150 workers heard the explosion at a location where they were waiting for the lift out of the mine .
They were told by officers not to move but to wait .
These people lost their chance to Bet away from the destruction and died as a result of monoxide poisoning .
Therefore , of the 200 people who knew about the explosion , none of them were able to go and tell the other workers of the seriousness of the problem .
Figure S. 1 indicates that at a depth of 450 metres there were 120 workers , none of whom died .
At 350 metres more workers died .
It is said that at 450 metres there was air circulation from the Mitsui Company 's Yotsuyama mine , whereas at the 350 - metre level there were no provisions for isolating the poison gases and a ventilation fan worked to increase the rate at which the gas filled the area .
The workers who were at this level knew nothing of the explosion and , believing that clean air was being brought into their area , died while on their way to the lift .
Instead of stopping the air - circulation fan , management continued its operation , thereby ensuring a more rapid spread of the poisons .
The workers did not know about the gas problem and followed directions to use the passage that was normally used for ventilation ; however , this was already filled with poisonous gas .
As a result of these management blunders , 438 persons lost their lives unnecessarily .
There were 939 workers saved , but 839 of these suffered from serious carbon monoxide poisoning .
Many more might have been saved if the company had taken immediate emergency action or had made preparations beforehand for such eventualities .
VI .
Almost complete absence of a security policy
The rules for rescuing carbon monoxide victims are as follows :
1 . If a person looks well and is running out of the problem area , his stage of poisoning is probably well advanced .
2 . Poisoning victims should not walk .
3 . Poisoning victims should be carried out of the problem area into fresh air for treatment as soon as possible .
These three rules were laid down in 1936 by a medical doctor who had experienced many explosion accidents and had treated many patients at Mitsui Mining 's Yamano Mine Hospital .
However , the Mitsui Mining Company did not follow these rules .
In the first instance , it took more than two hours after the explosion for a rescue team to be formed with the participation of workers outside the mine and from other mines .
When the first crew of 22 workers reached the 350 - metre depth it was already 6 p.m. ' and the poisoning victims had already been breathing poisons for about three hours .
The situation was such that victims could in no way be carried out into the fresh air as soon as possible , since the rescue operations had been considerably delayed .
The Mitsui Mining Company must have been aware that the explosion took place at 3.12 p.m. and that 30 minutes after the explosion the gas victims were already suffering in the mine .
Some victims escaped to the entrances to the Yotsuyama and Miyaura mines through connecting tunnels ( fig. 5 . 1 ) , and through this the Mitsui Mining Company headquarters most likely received a report on the poisoning problem .
By 4 p.m. at the latest company headquarters had received news of conditions at the three locations ( 350 , 450 , and 520 metres ) from which workers had been evacuated .
In spite of this , rescue teams were sent into the mine two hours after these reports had been received .
During this two - hour period , workers trapped in the mine were suffering from gas poisoning and were trying to help each other find safe areas in the darkness .
During this same period also , many workers died .
The second problem lay with the fact that the rescue teams made a miscalculation in that they were concerned only with rescuing those who looked most seriously ill .
In other words , they carried out only those who had lost consciousness , while those who looked as though they were still able to move or who looked well were required to walk to the mine entrance .
Some whose legs below the knees were completely numb still had to walk out of the mine supported by others .
The rules for handling carbon monoxide victims are , first of all , those who look most well are most probably very seriously sick , and , secondly , victims should not be allowed to walk .
Neither of these rules were followed in any way .
The third problem lay in the fact that those who were monoxide poisoning victims had to help rescue other workers .
Those same poisoned workers who looked unharmed went back into the mine as rescue workers .
Information gleaned after the accident indicates that 227 workers who were already poisoning victims were employed to help those who could not walk out of the mine .
Furthermore , those who had been initially involved in rescue work should not have been made to go back into the mine a second time for further rescue efforts .
Table 5.4 compares the number of workers who appeared to be well after coming out of the mine with the small number of those same workers who were able to work afterwards .
There is no other explanation but that the original intention of the company was to use the poison gas victims as rescue crews in order to minimize the labour force losses that would have followed an increase in the number of workers involved in the rescue operations .
If the company had been concerned with the health of workers , the instituted measures would have been very different .
Rescue crews should have gone into the mine at once and safety provisions should have been made for the rescue workers .
But neither of these measures were taken .
The company knew that rescue crew members would suffer from monoxide poisoning after entering the mine , and the measures taken to deal with this problem were as poor as those taken to rescue workers from the mine .
As a matter of fact , of the 800 people assigned to rescue work only 323 were brought in from the Mitsui Company 's Myaura and Yotsuyama mines , leaving the rest of the workers at these other mines unaware of and uninvolved in the rescue of 1,400 of their endangered fellow - workers .

As was indicated previously , rescue crews went into the mine without knowing anything about the carbon monoxide problem and without any protection against it and the other poison gases present .
Not only that , the company gave no explanation to the rescue crews as to the nature of the accident or the purpose of the rescue mission , and many of the crew members were sent into the mine reluctantly .
After reaching the problem area they saw at once that the problem derived from a coal - dust explosion that resulted in poison gases .
They were told to hold hands with each other as they went into the rescue area , and were also ordered to bring out first only those who were still breathing .
This was done without oxygen tanks and in an area that was filled with poison gas .
Besides the rescue crew members , who had no protection from or knowledge of the nature of the problem and the poisons involved , there was a group of people in white uniforms and with oxygen tanks whose business it was to determine the density of the carbon monoxide using special instruments .
But these people were sent into the mine not to help with the rescue operation but to determine the damage done and to replace the telephone lines and other equipment items in order that the mine could be reopened as soon as possible .
In contrast to the rescue workers , they were very well equipped , which indicates that management was not serious about rescuing the victims of the explosion .
Therefore , because the company showed so little concern for rescue operations and followed none of the rules for saving carbon monoxide poisoning victims , the Mitsui Miike explosion resulted in the largest coal - mine disaster in the history of mining .
Is Wal - Mart turning blue -- blue enough to pull President Obama ’s healthcare chestnuts out of the fire ?
If the nation ’s largest employer is signing on to the president ’s agenda , his efforts to pass healthcare reform will have won an important ally .
The company employs 1.4 million “ associates , ” has stores in more than 400 congressional districts and maintains a powerful lobbying operation in Washington .
For years , Wal - Mart has been a poster child for low wages , skimpy health insurance and conservative red-state values .
Just a year ago , Wal - Mart managers organized meetings in hundreds of store to warn employees that if the Democrats won the White House , the company would face a disruptive unionization campaign .
But now , Wal - Mart supports a key , controversial plank in the health insurance reform plan : an employer mandate that would require big firms to “ pay or play ” -- either offer their workers an insurance plan or require a company to pay as much as $ 750 a year per employee to the government for coverage .
Advertisement
This “ pay or play ” plan puts Wal - Mart on the side of the unions and liberals and has evoked a virtual declaration of war from the National Retail Federation , whose officers reported themselves “ astonished ” at what they considered Wal - Mart ’s “ catastrophic ” endorsement of a government mandate that most retailers -- once including Wal - Mart -- have long considered anathema .
So why Wal - Mart ’s big switch ?
Critics have pounded Wal - Mart for years for its violation of the country ’s labor laws , for its low wages and for its failure to offer a health insurance plan that more than half of its employees would actually purchase .
During the presidential campaign , Obama told a cheering union audience that “ the battle to engage Wal - Mart and force them to examine their own corporate values and ... policies ... is absolutely vital . ”
Criticism of this sort has had a real effect on the company ’s fortunes .
One of its own surveys found that almost 10 % of those polled refused to shop there for essentially political reasons , and the company has been stymied in its effort to put a new generation of “ supercenters ” in coastal California , in Chicago and in liberal cities such as Boston , Washington and New York .
Two years ago , Wal - Mart slashed the number of store openings in the U.S. by a third .
Its stock price has been flat for almost a decade .

And then the new administration came to power , with Obama appointing Hilda Solis , a genuine labor liberal , to be secretary of Labor .
Solis would soon declare that “ there ’s a new sheriff in town ” when it came to stepped - up enforcement of the nation ’s labor laws .
Wal - Mart knew it would be a prime target , so in late December 2008 it announced that it was resolving 63 lawsuits in 42 states to settle accusations that it forced employees to skip lunch breaks , work off the clock and sidestep overtime laws .
The cost : somewhere between $ 352 million and $ 640 million .
The company has made the same kind of calculation when it comes to health insurance , not only to forestall bad press but because an employer mandate actually saves the company money when compared with the more conservative , small - government scheme being put together by the Senate Finance Committee .
Without a fixed employer mandate , individual firms would be expected to shoulder part of the cost of the federal subsidy that each of their low - income employees would need to afford the coverage they would be required to buy .
Because Wal - Mart , which still has most of its stores in the South and Midwest , has a lot of workers who come from poor families , the company would have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to offset those government payments .
The Senate Finance Committee plan is a Rube Goldberg contraption , sure to generate endless conflict and dispute over both the size of the employee subsidy and the company payment .
Indeed , it makes it likely that many firms will discriminate against potential employees who happen to have a lot of kids or come from poor neighborhoods .
So Wal - Mart has put aside founder Sam Walton ’s disdain for any new government regulation and the ideologically motivated hostility of the rest of the retail industry .
An employer mandate is a cheaper , simpler and more universal way to cover those workers who cannot now afford health insurance .

Here is an instance where we can hope that Wal - Mart throws around a bit of its legendary political and economic influence , especially with all those Blue Dog Democrats who hail from the red - state districts where its stores are clustered so thickly .
Sony has told Eurogamer that the in - game advert causing an increase WipEout HD load - times has been binned .

Double Fusion announced a deal with Sony yesterday to produce " dynamic " in - game adverts for a " handful " of titles , of which WipEout HD is the first .

And , says the museum ’s newly hired lawyer , the company is demanding that the museum ’s “ curators , ” Gary Doss and wife Nancy Yarbrough Doss , turn over all profits from the Pez shrine ’s 14 years in business .
“ From a branding perspective , I think Pez should embrace the Dosses and the museum , instead of trying to attack them , ” said Rodger Cole , the Mountain View - based trademark attorney from Fenwick & West LLP .
Fat chance .
Pez is the only candy that you load like the clip of a gun and eat after performing a toy tracheotomy .
Candy for the American market is manufactured in Connecticut , but the fountainhead of Pezdom is in Linz , also notable for having produced the Linzer torte .
The Burlingame museum features every one of the more than 550 Pez dispensers created over the years .
If the company made Biblical characters , the museum would be David and the Teutonic tort - slinging confectioner would be Goliath .
The candy company is represented in its lawsuit by Palo Alto - based attorney Larry Johnson of Alston & Bird LLP , who did not return calls seeking comment .
The Dosses opened the place in 1995 as a small computer shop , but soon they began displaying their Pez collection on the hulking Ataris and Commodores , and within a year the miniature figures had taken over .
Gary
Doss added the only rarity missing from his collection — a Pineapple Pez worth $ 3,500 — in 2005 , but his biggest prize is the Make - a - Face Mr. Potato Head Pez , worth an estimated $ 5,000 .
The museum is packed with battalions of five - inch tall cartoon characters , Jedi knights and other objects of fantasy .
The displays are neatly displayed and remarkably dust - free — no small feat considering the number of small feet .
Richard Greene of Redwood City , who says he has a collection of 10,000 Pez dispensers , buys them from the Dosses and at flea markets .
“ I do n’t know what kid did n’t have a Pez dispenser , ” Greene said while browsing last week at the museum .
“ I have yet to meet one . ”
Still , it ’s the Sasquatch - sized snowman that Pez - ophiles see first when they enter the museum ’s “ gift shop ” ( which is actually as big as the museum itself ) and which Pez began protesting almost as soon as it went on display in 2007 .
When the Dosses got letters from the company objecting to it being called “ the world ’s biggest Pez dispenser , ” they changed its billing to the “ world ’s biggest dispenser of Pez . ”
This distinction apparently was lost on Pez , who insist upon killing the counterfeit candy - coughing contraption .
“ My feeling is that it ’s a piece of art , ” says Gary Doss , sounding frankly a bit huffy .
“ It is one of a kind .
It is not for sale .
And one of its main purposes as a piece of art is that it draws people into our store so we can sell Pez . ”
To qualify for the Guinness record , the snowman had to be made out of the same material as one of the Pez dispensers you can buy for $ 1.89 , and it had to work like the original .
For $ 14.95 a pop , the head tilts back and out slides a box with a regulation - size Snowman Pez dispenser inside .
Within each box is a certificate of authenticity stating that the box came from the world ’s biggest Pez dispenser .
Sorry , the world ’s biggest dispenser of Pez .
So , to boil it down — and we are talking here about the legal case , not the giant Pez dispenser — if there is any justice in a company from a cold - weather country telling some Californians that they can’t build a huge plastic snowman , Gary Doss does n’t see it .
“ I ’m going to do everything in my power not to let them get away with this , ” he says .
“ Because I do n’t like people telling artists to destroy their art .
I mean , it ’s a toy that gives you candy .
What could be more perfect than that ? ”

Gran Turismo 5 – Click above for high - res image gallery
When Gran Turismo 4 was launched in Japan for the Playstation 2 , George Bush was just getting ready to start his second term and the Chrysler 300 was the big buzz in the auto world .
In other words , January 10 , 2005 was a very long time ago , and we 're probably going to have to wait a while longer before we can finally get our hands on the highly anticipated Gran Turismo 5 .
After half a decade of waiting for GT5 , Sony has finally announced that the racing franchise will go on sale – in Japan – in March 2010 .
That 's six months after the PSP version of the game goes on sale , and we still do n't know when we 'll be able to get our hands on the PS3 version here in the States .
When GT5 does arrive , all evidence points to a very dynamic gaming experience .
Advanced damage rendering , weather changes , night races , NASCAR and incredible detail have all been promised , and since we 're being forced to wait so long , we 're holding Kazunori Yamauchi personally responsible for GT5 's success or failure .
The following vintage pictures were taken between the late 19th century and the early 20th century .
In the second photos you can see the same place in our times .
All of the images are property of Kjeld Duits from Old photos of Japan .
Two streetcars pass by the Hattori Building in Tokyo ’s fashionable Ginza .
In the first photo carts are parked under the verdant trees .
This classic tree - lined avenue with buildings only three floors high is utterly different from the Ginza that we know today .
The only thing that is remotely similar is the existence of a clock tower .
Now there is one on Wako Department Store ( see left second picture ) .
These pictures were taken in Marunouchi business district of Tokyo , near the Imperial Palace grounds and the Ginza commercial district , Tokyo Station was designed by architect Tatsuno Kingo to celebrate Japan ’s victory in the Russo - Japanese War .
Unfortunately , the beautiful domes and the top floor were destroyed during fire - bombings on May 25 and June 25 , 1945 .
In the first picture a steam locomotive pushes wagons on the Tokaido railway line .
The photographer was standing on Aioibashi ( Aioi Bridge ) , a railway overpass , looking east with his back towards Kobe Station .
The railroad connection between Kobe and Osaka was opened in May 1874 .
It took 70 minutes to travel the 32.7 kilometer route .
Today it is about 20 minutes .
In 1876 , the line was extended to Kyoto and by 1889 passengers could travel between Kobe and Shinbashi Station in Tokyo .
Aioibashi connected Motomachidori , a major shopping street , with Tamondori , location of Minatogawa Jinja , one of the most important shinto shrines in Kobe .
A view on stately buildings along Kobe ’s Kaigandori , known among foreigners as the Bund .
The first picture was taken sometime between 1922 and 1927 .
This street originally directly faced the sea .
By 1921 , reclamation work in the bay had increased the harbor ’s capacity by 2.1 million ton .
This photo was almost certainly taken from the roof of the Kobe branch of the major shipping company Nippon Yusen .
Finished in 1918 ( Taisho 7 ) , this building still stands and is known as the Kobe Yusen Building .
There used to be farms at Negishi in Yokohama .
This beautiful rural landscape was a short distance from the foreign settlement .
Negishi was called Mississippi Bay by the foreigners , apparently this was coined by Commodore Perry whose flagship bore that name .
They also called it “ the most scenic spot in the world ” and would come here to enjoy the fantastic view on the sea and the faraway cliffs at Honmoku .
At the foot of the cliffs , local women and children combed for shellfish at low tide .

In the first picture wooden teahouses crowd the left side of the canal .
Italian born photographer Adolfo Farsari shot this photograph sometime between 1877 and 1887 facing east .
At the time , the city experienced a high level of prosperity as can be seen by the presence of gas lamps on the right side of the bridge .
This shit is tiring :
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says his party 's caucus has " absolute unity " on the need to pass health care reform this year .
The Nevadan , joined by other lawmakers , spoke to reporters Tuesday afternoon on a White House driveway after Senate Democrats met over lunch with President Obama .
Reid said Democrats wants to produce a bipartisan bill " if there 's any way humanly possible . "
Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus said , " The American people want us to work together . "
Really ?
The American people would trade an ineffective or watered down reform package in exchange for " bipartisanship " ?
I know the Beltway and people like Baucus have an unhealthy obsession with process , but no one gives a damn how good legislation got passed , but that good legislation gets passed .
Before cashing their social security or unemployment checks , do people wonder , " I wonder if this government program passed with bipartisan support ? "
Of course not .
Before using Medicare or Medicaid , do people wonder , " I wonder if this government program passed with bipartisan support ? "
Of course not .
Before taking part in the Cash for Clunkers program , do people wonder , " I wonder if this government program passed with bipartisan support ? "
Of course not .
Before taking public transportation , or driving a road , do people wonder , " I wonder if this government project passed with bipartisan support ? "
Of course not .
Before spending time at a national or state park , do people wonder , " I wonder if this funding for the forest service passed with bipartisan support ? "
Of course not .
Before sending their children to public schools , do people wonder , " I wonder if this school 's funding passed with bipartisan support ? "
Of course not .
People want stuff that works .
They do n't give a damn how you get there .
Too bad Harry Reid and Max Baucus and far too many Dems fail to understand this .
Or maybe they understand it all too well -- Republicans have a vested interest in killing health care support , as do the industry patrons of Baucus , Conrad , and far too many corporatist Dems .
Thus the issue is n't really about " bipartisanship " for the sake of bipartisanship , but a handy excuse to make common cause with Republicans to destroy reform efforts .
Dear Cecil :
There 's an old saw about God protecting drunks and fools .
I 'm particularly interested in the drunks part .
Almost nightly , it seems , we hear on the news that a drunk driver killed one or more people in another car but the drunk survived , sometimes without injury .
A family member suggested drunks are saved because they 've passed out and are more relaxed , but I 'm skeptical .
Is it just the crashes where the drunk walks away after killing another that make the news ?
PLT , Indianapolis
Cecil replies :
If somebody ’s going to walk away from a fatal car crash , you really want it not to be the inebriated loser who caused it .
However , while all the facts are n’t in , there ’s reason to think drunk drivers sometimes get a break they do n’t deserve .
We ’ll call what you ’re describing the lucky - drunk hypothesis .
Although it ’s been floating around for a long time , scientists apparently first examined it seriously in a 1982 study of trauma victims treated at a Texas hospital ( Ward et al , American Journal of Surgery ) .
Roughly a third of the 1,200 patients had been drinking .
Drinkers and nondrinkers had equally severe injuries .
The surprise :
The death rate among nondrinkers was one in six ; the death rate among drinkers , one in nine .
Complication : the researchers were looking at all kinds of trauma , not just trauma caused by car wrecks .
Subsequent studies have produced mixed results , but even those undercutting the lucky - drunk hypothesis had their puzzling aspects .
Some examples :
A two - year study at a Seattle trauma center found intoxicated men had lower death rates and less severe injuries than sober men for all types of trauma except car accidents .
( Women did n’t see much difference . )
Overall , the drunker the victim , the less severe his injuries and the less likely he was to die .
Examining data on more than a million drivers involved in car crashes in North Carolina , a research team headed by Patricia Waller reported in 1986 that drunk drivers were roughly twice as likely as sober drivers to be seriously injured in a car crash and two to four times more likely to die .
Oddly , however , they found drivers with blood alcohol concentrations ( BACs ) between 0.15 and 0.19 percent ( i.e. , really drunk — legally drunk is 0.08 percent ) suffered less severe injuries than those with other , often smaller amounts of alcohol in their system .
A 1992 study in Vermont focused on 427 trauma victims , 43 percent of whom had been in auto accidents .
Drinkers ( here meaning those with any amount of alcohol in them ) suffered more head injuries on average , had six times the death rate of nondrinkers , and were much more likely to suffer from serious injuries .
On the other hand , the legally drunk had fewer really bad injuries than the moderate drinkers .
The difference was n’t statistically significant , though .
A 1997 review found such studies of alcohol and injury fell into two groups showing opposite results : ( 1 ) Research based on reports from emergency personnel generally found alcohol use meant increased risk of serious injury or death .
However , the severity of the trauma often stemmed from side effects of drinking such as speeding or not wearing seat belts , not from drinking itself .
( 2 ) In contrast , most studies of hospitalized trauma victims found no relation between drunkenness and injury severity , and a few found alcohol had a protective effect .
One possible explanation :
The EMTs ’ injury assessment method exaggerated trauma severity in drunks , particularly those with head injuries , who were then more likely to be hospitalized .
So you had a lot of hospitalized drinkers whose problems seemed worse than they were , perhaps skewing the results .
No doubt hoping to settle things once and for all , Patricia Waller led a team that published another study in 2003 .
Taking numerous variables into account , the group looked at data for almost 1,400 car wreck victims and found that , on the whole , alcohol increased injury — but the effect was n’t linear .
As in previous studies , injury severity dipped sharply in accident victims showing a BAC between 0.15 and 0.19 percent , but also for victims with BACs above 0.25 percent , or ( theoretically at least ) very , very drunk .
Waller and company thought they could come up with an explanation for the high - end drop ( people in that category may have had an unusually high tolerance for alcohol and thus bucked the more - alcohol = more - injury trend ) , but the midrange dip was a complete mystery .
Conclusions for now :
1 . We sure do n’t know that alcohol protects drunks by making them more relaxed .
2 . It does seem to protect them in a limited sense .
In general , alcohol makes injuries worse , and no one ’s saying being drunk is safer than being sober , but research has repeatedly shown that under some circumstances drunks get hurt less than you ’d expect .
Waller , perhaps the most persistent of the many researchers looking into the lucky - drunk hypothesis , died of cancer in 2003 , so it may be a while before we get an answer more definitive than that .

Hackpact documentation ( week 2 )
Following on from week 1 of my hackpact hacks , here ’s
hackpact8
I had this feeling that a nice visualisation of polyrhythmic structure would be to plot patterns in a spiral .
I finally got it to work , and here ’s the first few results , rendered with cairo in Haskell :
{red blue orange purple , yellow brown pink}
[ red blue orange purple , yellow brown pink ]
{orange tomato , blue ~ purple ~ ~}
{orange yellow , blue green ~}
Where colours co-occur , they ’re mixed , thanks to the lovely Haskell Colour library .
I was surprised by the rhythmic gestalt these give .
In retrospect I realise that Mick Grierson would not be surprised at all by this , and neither would John Whitney .
Now I ’m a spiral lover too .
I ’ll release the code along with the rest of my pattern library next week .
hackpact9
Played around with spiral rendering , but came to conclusion that the spiral mapping itself was beautiful and not the patterns I ’m trying to visualise , because just about anything you put into it looks good .
Although you can see the pattern length in the spiral , if you mix different pattern lengths into a polyrhythm , it ’s very difficult to perceive more than one pattern length , one comes across more strongly than the others .
Perhaps a peano weave would be better , but I think I ’ve gone far enough with this , back to music tomorrow .
hackpact10
My lack of headphones bit me so I could n’t make music tonight .
Instead I played with context free art , which I ’ve been meaning to do for years .
No great masterpieces , but healthy , grammatically constrained fun .

hackpact11
Ok back to music finally .
I ’m going to try to add a function to my pattern library before making a quick screencast of the first time I use it to make music patterns .
This time I made a ‘ breakbeat ’ function , which takes a pattern of integers and uses it to trigger playback positions in another pattern .
I also found a bug which breaks things at the end .
I could add exception handling so these bugs would n’t break everying , but hey , it ’s good to livecode on the edge .
hackpact12
Added a couple of things :
stuff to my ghci interface so I can plug one active pattern into the composition of another .
an ‘ onsets ’ function that turns a pattern into a pattern of bools , true for the first beat of a phrase .
Used these things together to apply functions to effects that are responsive to the sound sample pattern .
It takes me a while to work out how to do it , and the end result is n’t particularly musical .
I ’ll be playing around with this some more , but in the spirit of showing the first time I use a function to make sound , here ’s the screencast .
( or it will be once the vimeo flash conversion finishes )
hackpact13
Implemented and played around with bpm patterns .
Also implemented simple ‘ tween ’ pattern for linearly tweening between two values over a given period .

A proof for God ’s existence came to Anselm in the dark of early morning , under the solemn sound of psalms , echoing against the stone walls of the church .
It was the year 1077 , at the monastery of Bec in what is now northern France .
Anselm was happy .
“ The grace of God shone on his heart , the whole matter became clear to his mind , and a great joy and jubilation filled his inmost being , ” his friend and biographer Eadmer would later write .
For Catholics , Anselm is a saint , a theologian and bishop who defended the Church from the encroachment of kings .
For philosophers , he ’s the inventor of an ingenious and still - controversial artifice of abstraction .
The great 20th century mathematician Kurt Gödel had this to say about him :
Reproduced from “ Kurt Gödel , Collected Works : Unpublished Essays and Lectures ”
( New York : Oxford University Press , 1995 ) , p. 431
It was the attempt to succeed at both Catholicism and philosophy that first put Anselm on my required reading list .
But the person I found in his pages was neither bishop nor logician so much as an effusive confidant .
It was the summer after I finished college , and I was passing a few weeks at home in Virginia before moving to California .
I stretched out on the carpet floor of my old bedroom in the basement , reading Anselm ’s “ Proslogion , ” finally , for the first time .
Dangling on the lonely precipice between a certain past and a long , uncertain drive west , I thought back on the bizarre choice I ’d wandered into , almost four years earlier , when I got myself baptized a Catholic .
Now , moving far away , with the chance to start over , I started to wonder if I believed in any of it anymore .
Did I still even think that God exists ?
Anselm ’s proof rained on me a drop of consolation .
It filled my head enough to cover over the hollow low in my stomach .
For years before his insight , Anselm had been searching for a new way of understanding God ’s existence .
He knew a handful of familiar arguments , but in the end , they were too piecemeal to satisfy him .
None seemed worthy to describe the God of his love and his longing .
The frustration tormented him day and night , distracting his attention even from prayers .
“ Gladness was hoped for , ” he remembered , “ and lo ! a source of frequent sighs ! ”
All the other proofs he knew depended on observations about the world : the order of nature and the physics of cause and effect .
Anselm , instead , gunned straight for the dream of the Greek philosophers : a God of pure , abstract reason , a secret God of the inner life , which the wise can recognize everywhere they go , sufficient unto itself .
Aristotle called it the self - thinking thought .
The proof , which would come to be called the ontological argument , purports to demonstrate the existence of God from ideas alone : the concept of a God that does n’t exist would n’t be much of a God .
A true concept of God , “ a being than which nothing greater can be conceived , ” would have to be a God that exists .
Therefore , God exists .
Nathan Schneider
It is a masterpiece of mental hedonism , an idea that satisfies itself .
And Anselm loved his proof .
“ I thank thee , gracious Lord , I thank thee , ” he gushed .
“ Because what I formerly believed by thy bounty , I now so understand by thine illumination . ”
He had found not just an argument , but a communion , a glimpse of the invisible Ever - Present .
I let the rapture in his proof take hold of me .
For passing moments , lying on my back with the book in my hands , I came to sense the whole vastness of a God wrapped around my little mind , like a lonesome asteroid must feel touching the gentle infinity of space .
Then , always , my mind wandered elsewhere and I forgot some movement of the logic .
The whole thing dissolved away , along with the sense of certainty .
I started to remember the echo of Kant ’s devastating complaint against Anselm : existence is not a predicate .
God seemed to disappear .
But I read on .
I was reminded it was n’t God ’s existence that plagued Anselm — of that , he had no doubt — it was the phrasing .
Modern arguments and evangelists and New Atheists have duped us into thinking that the interesting question is whether God exists ; no , what mattered for Anselm was how we think about God and about one another .
When Anselm discovered his proof , he was still a precocious young monk in the quiet of a monastery .
He loved silence and contemplation , yet constantly he reached out beyond it .
The letters he wrote to far - flung friends in those years overflow with longing , in language eerily like what he used to describe his proof .
“ Everything I feel about you is sweet and pleasant to my heart , ” Anselm wrote to another monk named Gundulf .
“ Whatever I desire for you is the best that my mind can conceive . ”
His passion in friendship is so palpable , and so unusual for its time , modern scholars have wondered whether these relationships were entirely celibate .
( They probably were . )
The God he conjured in proof he had learned from his friends .
The fullness , the absence , the solitude and the hunger — I recognized myself .
The answer I found in his proof is no answer at all , no truly abstract , autonomous assurance that I can have all to myself .
I have to stitch it out of memories , hopes and loved ones , as he did .
It is no self - thinking thought ; it ’s a pleasure built out of language and sharing .
Setting off for a new place , I was saddled in the past , in what I had been and done .
My conversion , and with it God , is not a thing I can live down , but something I ’ll always have to live in , through and around .
The very fact of it , that it happened at all , is a proof for its own ongoing existence .

If you ever wondered how former Lions # 2 overall pick Charles Rogers turned out to be such a bust , Jemele Hill of ESPN got the answer from him : Construda .
Construda AY - DAY .
In the sneak peek of the interview released by ESPN , Rogers tells
Hill he smoked marijuana on a daily basis , then became addicted to painkillers after breaking his collarbone twice , in 2003 and 2004 .
Wow , weed AND painkillers ?
Just call him Ricky Favre .

In 2005 , Rogers flunked his third drug test with the NFL , and was obligated to return $ 10 million of his $ 14.2 million signing bonus to the Lions .
Rogers was cut by the Lions in 2006 and never played in the NFL again , going to jail last December for violating probation stemming from a domestic violence arrest .
Watch this interview even casually , and it would appear as though Rogers is STILL baked .
In fact , the geniuses over at Tirico Suave have already noticed this and parodied it in record time with the video below .
The funniest part of the interview is when they cut to that fucking retard shitbox Matt Millen .

Fewer black women with postgraduate degrees are getting married and having children , according to research to be presented at the 104th annual meeting of the American Sociological Association .
" In the past nearly four decades , black women have made great gains in higher education rates , yet these gains appear to have come increasingly at the cost of marriage and family , " said Hannah Brueckner , professor of sociology at Yale University ; co-director of Yale 's Center for Research on Inequalities and the Life Course ; and the study 's co-author .
" Both white and black highly educated women have increasingly delayed childbirth and remained childless , but the increase is stronger for black women . "
The study , which is the first to review longitudinal trends in marriage and family formation among highly educated black women , found that black women born after 1950 were twice as likely as white women to never have married by age 45 and twice as likely to be divorced , widowed or separated .
The gap in the proportion of black and white highly educated women living with a spouse has grown over the decades , increasing from 9 percent in the 1970s to 21 percent in 2000 - 2007 .
" Highly educated black women have increasingly fewer options when it comes to potential mates , " Brueckner said .
" They are less likely than black men to marry outside their race , and , compared to whites and black men , they are least likely to marry a college - educated spouse . "
Although black women were more likely than white women to have children early in their academic careers , 45 percent of those born between 1955 and 1960 were childless at age 45 compared to 35 percent of white women born in the same time period .
Brueckner and the study 's lead author Natalie Nitsche , a graduate student in sociology at Yale University , analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau 's Current Population Survey to uncover marriage and family trends among black women with postgraduate degrees .
The Current Population Survey has surveyed approximately 50,000 households monthly for more than 50 years to collect data on the American labor force .

On 1 July 2009 , the RICA law has been implemented in South Africa .
What is RICA you ask ?
Its the Regulation of Interception of Communications Act ( and Provision of Communication - Related Information Act ) .
This requires everyone that has an active cell phone number or purchases a new Prepaid Starter Pack to register their SIM cards .
All current and new contract , top - up and prepaid customers are required to register their SIM cards .
Subscribers who have activated their cellphone numbers before the 1st of July 2009 have to register their personal details against that cellphone number / SIM card in order to comply .
Subscribers have 18 months to comply with this act .
New starter pack customers will be required to register a new SIM card and provide their personal details .
New cellphone numbers / SIM cards will only be activated on the cellphone network once the SIM card has been registered .
What is required when registering a SIM card ?
When registering a SIM card persons are required to have their cellphone number , full names and surname ID number or passport number handy .
The South African Green bar - coded ID document or Temporary ID certificate or Passport will be sufficient to confirm proof of identity .
A document that includes the SIM card holder ’s name and residential address ( eg. bank statement , municipal rates , cellphone or retail account , existing lease , rental or credit agreement , insurance policy , current TV or motor vehicle license ) will be required to confirm proof of residence .
Informal settlement residents will be required to provide an official letter and / or an affidavit from a school , church or retail store where they receive their mail .
When is RICA compliance required ?
RICA compliance is required if you own a SIM card .
It ’s also required if you ’re paying a cellphone contract for yourself .
RICA compliance is also required if a family member ’s cellphone bill is in your name or if you are a parent or guardian of minors using SIM cards .
Compliance is also required if you are transferring a SIM card from another individual ’s name into your name ( required for contract and prepaid subscribers ) and if you port your cellphone number to another network .
There is no registration fee , it ’s free .
Before you start screaming “ Big Brother ” , hold on and think about this for a second .
Yes , it ’s not nice to know that some cell phone company has your personal details on file just because you own a cell phone or a SIM card .
Yes , it does truly sounds like Big Brother is watching .
But , we live in South Africa , not in a first world country with a low crime rate .
We do have problems with crime in this country and criminals were abusing the system in order to have a free - reign in South Africa .
This might change if everyone is RICA compliant .
The way persons sell 2nd hand phones via classifieds publications could probably change significantly as well .
Under the old law criminals could purchase as many SIM cards as they liked without providing an address for registration .
The SAPS were not always keen to investigate a case further if a prepaid cell number was involved since no address was kept on file .
That might change in the near future .
The whole idea of making it harder for criminals to operate in South Africa sounds like a good one to me .
But like with most good ideas in South Africa , the question remains whether this will be properly enforced or not .
A few years ago fines were introduced in South Africa for persons talking on their cellphones whilst driving .
I still see plenty motorists using their cell phones whilst zipping through traffic though .
Only time will tell if RICA is going to be a detergent for crime .

YUCCA POISED TO BAN MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES
YUCCA VALLEY -
The fate of medical marijuana availability in Yucca Valley could be decided at Tuesday night 's planning commission meeting .
The Town 's moratorium on new dispensaries could be replaced by a development - code amendment prohibiting the establishment of a new business and the use of an existing business to distribute or sell marijuana .
The Town houses the only medical marijuana outlet in San Bernardino County .
California Alternative Medicinal Solutions , a nonprofit health collective that furnishes medical marijuana under state guidelines , received a business permit and has been operating lawfully for about a year at the Monterey Business Center .
Except for complaints that dispensaries breed crime , CAMS ' operations have been incident - free .
Marijuana has been legal for medical use in California since 1996 , and an ID card system identifying users as medically directed was established shortly thereafter .
San Bernardino County has been fighting in court against issuing ID cards until this year , when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the county 's appeal .
This month the county began taking applications from medicinal - use patients who wish to get official identification cards .
Applicants must appear in person at the county 's San Bernardino offices , furnish a doctor 's recommendation , picture ID and completed forms and pay a fee before the state will issue the card .
But unless they have green thumbs , the county 's legal users might have a difficult time getting the drug .
On Aug. 4 , the Board of Supervisors extended an ordinance that could prohibit the establishment of medicinal dispensaries in unincorporated areas until June 2010 .
Legal patients are allowed to grow a limited amount of marijuana plants for personal medicinal use .
At Wednesday 's meeting of the Hi-Desert Marijuana Anti-Prohibition Project at the Castle Inn in Landers , long - haired hippies and gray - haired grandparents vowed to have their legal rights respected .
" The law is on our side , " Hi-Desert MAPP chairman Rich McCabe told the assembly .
" They can't ban us , " agreed his wife , JoAnn .
" They used to use the feds against us , but not now ! "
One of the attendees was a little more cynical .
" If they prohibit dispensaries , where should we get the marijuana from - the Mexican drug cartels ? "

Social competition is and will always be the central preoccupation of the country club set .
It was n’t so long ago that that unending game of casual one - upmanship was waged over canapés and cocktails , but the arena has changed :
Now that everyone from Tinsley Mortimer to Lydia Hearst is on Facebook , Status Updates are the best way to assert your status .
It ’s not enough to share your most recent trip to Ibiza with a few of your clubby friends at the Rose Bar — it must be broadcast to hundreds of acquaintances ( or in Peter Davis ’s case , 5,001 ) .
The game ’s still the same old Keeping Up With the Joneses — but now it ’s weirder , more impersonal , and each word much be chosen carefully .
There are five key rules to using your status update to maximum status - signifying effect .
Learn from the masters .
1. CAREFULLY NAME -DROP

UNDERSHARE
FABULOUSNESS

AGGRANDIZE

DEPRECATION

In status updates , proper nouns are catchy — they lend an air of credibility and gravitas .
But names must be dropped carefully !
Give away too much , and you ’re a braggart with no respect for personal privacy ( “ I ’m having dinner with Anna Wintour ! ” How gauche ) .
Give away too little , and it ’s pointless ( “ I ’m having dinner with a friend ! ” Great , so you have at least one friend ) .
Here our updater thus utilizes the range of name - dropping from the overt to the obscure .
Initially she lures us by dropping “ Elaine ’s , ” the famously intellectual restaurant .
Then she baffles us with the vague character , a three - named hint of a man left mysterious .
Finally she injects an easily solvable enigma for those interested enough to Google “ June 16 Daily Show guest . ” ( Tom Folsom . )
Expertly played , though perhaps we did n’t need it tied together for us at the end .
Let your status speak for itself , darling !
In this case we ’re met with the inscrutable acronym — discretion that veers into uselessness — but we are at least assured that the meeting is a “ reunion , ” which suggests that the moment will be charged with an enviable energy .
And it will take place at Hotel Griffou , the new Beatrice Inn of the West Village .
Whatever this mysterious reunion is , it will be fabulous .
Facebook status updates are like playful mind burps of the psyche meant to be shed with the same nonchalance as shoes at a threshold .
Though you would be wise to merely spit out an update , the update ’s very efficacy rests on the premise that it is an undercrafted ejaculation .
Try too hard , and you will fall flat .
Nevertheless , you must at least hint at your glamorous reality .
Here our updater expertly teases with a beautiful if apocryphal photo .
She leaves it to us to inquire under what circumstances it ’s taken .
Then , in the inevitable reveal , she closes in on the kill , casually revealing she was ( a ) in the Hamptons , and ( b ) with a man named Rufus ( see rule No. 1 ) .
In one word and three syllables , this updater communicates that she is in some sort of relationship with Nantucket — probably summering there , but it ’s left coyly unclear — and that she is sufficiently jaded by the island rat race .
If only all writers could be as succinct and elliptical .
She ’s the William Carlos Williams of updates .
Your life is worthy of envy , but it is not perfect — otherwise everyone would hate you , and we ca n’t have that .
And so the fabulous undershare must strike a counterbalance , and the results can be fantastic .
This updater ’s status , nominally a complaint about a nasty hangover , is really a subterranean boast that ( a ) the updater has a Dionysian appreciation for the high life , ( b ) has rather limitless supplies of Rose [ sic ] wine , and ( c ) is in Ibiza .
Nothing stinks more than having acollection made up solely of Criterion editions of French New Wave directors except , perhaps , being torn between your loyalty to art and your desire to watch Bill Murray in a onesie .
You ’re highbrow but love the lowbrow — you are the kind of person everyone wants to be friends with .
Your personal glories should be wrapped in the leaky sackcloth of self - deprecation .
As we ’ve mentioned , bragging is unacceptable .
But when you simply happen to leak that you have a maid in the course of revealing a funny anecdote — you ’re illiterate , ha ! — you ’ve broadcast your fabulousness without the incriminating prints of arrogance .
Here our updater plays coy with self - awareness , melding Complaint ( Rule No. 3 ) with self - deprecation .
With such a flimsy excuse to return to the Hamptons , this is the This is Spinal Tap of Facebook updates , a symbiotic system of ridiculousness , in both awareness of said ridiculousness and beneath that ridiculousness .
Most likely written from the Jitney .
Taking a cue from Shakespeare ’s King Lear , another avenue of the indirect boast is putting the goods in the mouths of fools , or in this case , foreigners .
Our updater ’s status would be diminished if it had read only “ beautiful shorts , ” but when it ’s a strange foreign man who says it , we also have an opportunity for complaint ( see rule No. 3 ) .
By placing her bragging in the lying mouth of a subway stranger , this updater covertly asserts the prestige of her position and at the same time insulates herself against similar claims .
Particularly masterful is the covert assumption here that her position is one sufficiently grand to be the ethereal stuff of A train boasting .
[ Note : She ’s also listed on the masthead as a contributingwriter . ]
‘ Same sex or opposite sex ? ” barked the young woman , gold hoops in her ears to match her attitude .
I was at the Edenvale home affairs office , on a strip of motor repair shops and scrapyards , to book my marriage .
It took me a moment to comprehend : “ Same sex , ” I said , a little too loudly , looking around to see if anyone of the other clerks in the room would look up in shock , or perhaps just interest .
They did not .
“ The marriage officer likes to do the same - sexes early in the morning , ” the woman said briskly , consulting her book .
“ Too much paperwork , you people — ”
Three years previously , Parliament passed a law permitting same - sex marriage , upon injunction from the Constitutional Court .
My partner and I had been together for nearly two decades , but we had little interest in the rites of marriage .
We had decided to do it now solely because it would facilitate our move to France , where he had been offered a job .
It was , we told each other , merely an administrative matter .
We could have done it more easily — through a gay judge who is a friend — but we wanted to see the system work for us .
Thus far , I was not encouraged .
Like all home affairs offices , Edenvale was grimy and arcane , contemptuous and chaotic ; the last place on earth you would want to get married .
In the old days home affairs was the processing room of apartheid : it told you who you were and where you could ( and could not ) be .
It was still a place of profound alienation ; of a million frustrations and rages a day .
And I was about to have one of them .
But the woman pre-empted my lecture on public service and constitutional rights by shoving a form across to me that noted the time and date of our appointment .
Pulling out a pink highlighter , she underlined a reminder that at least two witnesses were required .
“ We have room for 20 , ” she said , “ so bring all your friends and family . ”
“ No , no , ” I protested .
“ It ’ll be just two .
We do n’t want to make a fuss . ”
“ Why not ? ” she demanded .
“ A marriage is a big deal .
Make a fuss .
And do n’t forget the rings . ”
When I said I did not think we would be doing rings , she really thought she had my number .
She looked up at me , in counselling mode now : “ Do you think you are a second - class citizen just because you are gay ?
You have full rights in this new South Africa .
You have the right to make a fuss . ”
Here I was , an entirely empowered middle - class , middle - aged white man , being lectured by a young black woman about my rights .
And here we were , three weeks later , with rings but , alas , only two witnesses , in “ Room 9 : Marriages ” at the back of the building .
We entered a parallel universe .
The room was draped in lace in the same colour palette as the orange - and - brown dried flowers set in vases between white porcelain swans .
There were wedding photos of various couples tacked to the walls and , on every available surface , cascades of what , on closer inspection , turned out to be empty ring boxes .
It was inexplicable at first , then comical , then unexpectedly moving .
“ You like it ? ” trilled a voice behind us .
An older Afrikaans woman had entered .
She introduced herself as Mrs Austin : she was actually in finance , but she loved marrying people so much that she had applied for a licence and now did it two mornings a week .
“ This is all my work , ” she said of Room 9 , explaining that every couple she married was invited to leave its ring boxes behind .
Our actual marriage was a sideshow .
The main event was Mrs Austin herself .
She ’d had to “ go on a training ” to learn how to marry gay people , she told us , but it had been well worth it , and she was proud of the fact that she had done nearly 200 “ same sexes ” already ; more than anyone else in the region .
She made no secret of her disappointment at our lack of campery : where were the feathers , where was the champagne ?
After presiding over the swapping of rings , she extracted a red heart - shaped ring box from her installation and balanced it between our two hands , which she delicately arranged for a photograph .
We spent more time on this ritual than we had on the actual ceremony .
Even though Mrs Austin kept on referring to us as “ same sex ” and heterosexuals as “ normal ” , we were swept out of Room 9 on a tide of hilarity .
Even the fact that she could not furnish us with a marriage certificate — the computers had been down for six weeks because someone had stolen the cables — did not tamp the good feelings .
We were a white man and a black man , free to be together in the country of our birth , treated with dignity and humanity by a system which had denied both for so long .
Well worth the fuss .

Sloth in a box .
These animals are so fascinating and strange .
The sloth is the world ’s slowest mammal and is found in Central and South America .
Sloths are identified by the number of toes they have on their hind feet .
The claws are used for climbing , because sloths are arboreal animals .
They eat , sleep , mate and give birth in the trees .
Because of their upside down life , sloths have many of their internal organs in different positions from other mammals .

Yes folks , you read that correctly .
Snow Leopard will be a $ 29 upgrade for Leopard users , and will hit stores a month before Windows 7 .
Typical Mac OS upgrades run about $ 129 , so this is certainly a welcome surprise .
As opposed to OS upgrades of the past , many of Snow Leopard ’s more significant changes are under the hood , working to increase system efficiency and speed .
Without out a slew of “ killer features ” to promote , some wondered how Apple would be able to convince users to fork over $ 100 + for a new OS .
Now we have our answer .
$ 29 bucks is a steal .
Well done Apple , well done .
A family pack will run about $ 49 .
Unbelievable deal .

Very cool news .
Today Microsoft announce the creation of the CodePlex foundation .
That 's CodePlex.org .
It 's amazing the amount of work that goes into something like this .
I was in on a lot of very boring ( but important ) legal conference calls with a lot of folks from within Microsoft but it was fascinating in its own legal way .
There 's a lot of people who want to see this work and really be something special .
CodePlex.org is different from CodePlex.com , of course .
The CodePlex foundation is a 501 ( c ) ( 6 ) organization , separate from Microsoft .
It 's created to help commercial software developers use Open Source software .
Here 's the best part :
" The Foundation has no pre-suppositions about particular projects , platforms , or open source licenses . "
This is n't the " Visual Studio Foundation " or the " . NET Foundation " or the " MS - PL Foundation . "
This is on purpose .
Over the next few months we 'll start hearing about how Projects can get involved and align themselves with the CodePlex foundation .
When I was working with Corillian / CheckFree , it was a challenge to get Open Source software used on big proprietary projects .
There was fear and confusion at all levels .
We eventually got it done , and there 's open source software from then - Corillian running at large banks and small credit unions all over the world .
in my opinion , if CodePlex.org succeeds , open source software will be used by more professional software developers .
Here 's the interim board of directors and board of advisors .
You can see it skews Microsoft initially , but that 'll change in the first 100 days when we find permanent members .
If you want to get involved , do !

From the site :
Sam Ramji will serve as interim President of the Foundation .
He will be supported by an interim Board of Directors , whose other members are Bill Staples , Stephanie Boesch , Miguel de Icaza , Britt Johnston , and Shaun Walker .
Mr. Ramji and the interim Board will immediately begin a search for a permanent Executive Director , who will manage the day - today operations of the Foundation , as well as a permanent Board of Directors and a Board of Advisors .
For the policy wonks , here 's the foundation 's bylaws ( PDF ) for you to peruse .
This is important also , from the FAQ :
Q : What is the difference between the CodePlex Foundation and CodePlex.com ?
CodePlex Foundation is an extension of the CodePlex brand established by Codplex.com .
Codeplex.com has not only built a strong community , with more than 10,000 projects now hosted on the site , but has steadily built a recognized brand .
CodePlex.com launched in June of 2006 out of a need for a project hosting site that operated in a way that other forges did n't – with features and structures that appealed to commercial software developers .
The next chapter in solving for this challenge is the CodePlex Foundation ( Codeplex.org ) .
The Foundation is solving similar challenges ; ultimately aiming to bring open source and commercial software developers together in a place where they can collaborate .
This is absolutely independent from the project hosting site , but it is essentially trying to support the same mission .
It is just solving a different part of the challenge , a part that Codeplex.com is n't designed to solve .
I 'm on the Advisory board , which is cool , along with other folks whose names I hope you recognize and respect as non-evil .
If you 're not familiar with the names , I 've added my own mini - bio for each .

As you walk into the Retiro train station in downtown Buenos Aires these days , you pass a long line of people snaking their way from the station ’s entrance to a single window .
At first glance , this is unsurprising : what ’s more common than a queue in a train station ?
But there is something distinctive about this line : it ends at a window bearing a sign that reads “ Coins . ”
The people standing patiently in line are not , it turns out , waiting to buy train tickets .
Instead , they ’re waiting to do something that ’s become very difficult in Buenos Aires : make change .
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
The Retiro queue is a sign of the most peculiar economic crisis in recent memory : the great Buenos Aires coin shortage .
For well over a year now , small change has been hard to come by there .
Stores hang “ No Coins ” signs in their windows , and offer candies instead of change .
Taxi - drivers round up — or down — to avoid giving up precious coins , while smaller merchants sometimes turn away business if you have only bills to offer them .
The government has fined banks thousands of pesos for refusing to hand over coins , and , in October , the city ’s subways became temporarily free when the booths ran short of change .
For the average Bonaerense , everyday transactions now entail a complicated calculation of where coins can be acquired and when they will be needed .
That ’s especially true because most people need change to get around Buenos Aires : the city ’s buses accept only coins .
This has made them an obvious culprit in the shortage , as they take in millions of pesos in coins but , unlike other businesses , do n’t hand any out .
If the bus companies hold onto the coins rather than depositing them in a bank , they can make a significant dent in the amount of change in circulation .
And they did have an incentive to do this : before the government cracked down on them , they were reselling coins to businesses at a hefty markup .
But the buses alone ca n’t be responsible for the shortage : they ’ve been coin - operated for many years , while the coin famine is a recent phenomenon .
So two other theories of the origin of the crisis are regularly floated in the city .
The first is that the left - wing government of Argentina is conspiring to make the right - wing government of Buenos Aires look bad , before coming to the rescue itself .
And , indeed , the national government is supposedly implementing a plan for electronic bus cards , though it ’s now well behind schedule .
The second , and more common , explanation is that people are hoarding coins because inflation is making the metal in them more valuable than their face value .
Hoarding of this sort , and the resulting coin shortages , was once a recurring economic problem , one that the Italian economic historian Carlo Cipolla dubbed “ the big problem of small change . ”
But these shortages were thought to be a feature of premodern times , when coins were made out of precious metal , and people literally brought silver to the mint to have it turned into coins .
If the value of silver rose beyond the face value of coins , hoarding silver was a natural response .
Today , coins are government - issued tokens , and their value is theoretically unconnected to the metal they contain .
This is n’t to say that the material worth of a coin ’s metal ca n’t still exceed its face value ; the rising value of zinc , for instance , meant that , last year , every new penny issued cost the U.S. Mint about 1.7 cents .
But hoarding no longer makes sense unless it ’s done on a large scale , and most people in Buenos Aires are not melting down their coins into hunks of copper .
Yet , even if they ’re not , the anxiety that others might be hoarding coins and melting them down seems to have been enough to start a panic .
Hoarding causes shortages , but shortages also promote more hoarding .
It ’s no coincidence that this kind of panic has taken hold in Argentina : the country ’s history of financial crises has made people there profoundly skeptical of the way markets work .
The sharp spike in inflation in the past couple of years , for instance , was almost certainly exacerbated by Argentina ’s previous experience with hyperinflation .
Businesses that have gone through an episode of hyperinflation become understandably alert to the threat of it : at the first hint of inflation , they ’re likely to increase prices , since they ’ve learned that if they do n’t , and inflation hits , their businesses will be wrecked .
In the same way , when it comes to holding onto coins , people hoard first and ask questions later .
You could , then , dismiss the Buenos Aires coin shortage as an anomaly .
But the Argentine experience actually underscores the degree to which all modern financial systems depend on confidence , and the problems that erupt when that confidence disappears .
In the U.S. , after all , the chaos of last year both led to and has been exacerbated by a shortage of its own : credit .
As people became worried about the health of the system , they took money out of any investment that smacked of risk and put it into cash ( bank deposits have soared in the past six months ) or government bonds .
That , in turn , made others more anxious : less willing to lend and more interested in holding onto their money .
Fear bred a credit crunch , which , in turn , bred more fear .
And if fear has left the Argentines with too few coins , it has left us , paradoxically , with too much cash ( and too little credit ) .
This is n’t to say that financial crises are all in our head ; certainly our own was sparked by problems that were very real .
But there is an irreducible psychological dimension to both crises and recoveries .
And if it ’s hard for people in Buenos Aires to give up their pennies , think how much harder it will be for Americans to start taking risks again . ♦
In one of the most f'ed up things I 've seen in recent history , the University of Arizona Medical Center has a robotic woman that gives birth to a robotic son so that medical students can witness the horrors of robotic birth firsthand .
Named Noelle , she grunts , screams , yells at the doctors , pees , bleeds -- and yes , even gives birth ( to a cute little robot baby named Hal ) .
Paid for with a $ 40,000 grant from Miami - based Guarnard Scientific , the university bought Noell , baby Hal , and another , smaller robot - baby in January .
Then Noelle was taken out of commission for a while when medical students ( yelp ! ) broke her pelvic bone .
an average of 20 medical students a week diagnose all sorts of birth complications like cesareans and breach births .
Noelle can even hemorrhage , all while screaming in pain and yelling things like " do n't touch me " at the medical students .
Great , at this rate she 's gonna have like 1,000 babies a year .
WHO KEEPS KNOCKING THIS ROBOTIC BITCH UP ?
I 'm looking at you , shifty night patrolman !

Afghans who fled the migrant camps in Calais before police raids are waiting until it is safe to go back and try again
Crouched beside the public tap in Villemin park near Paris 's Gare de l'Est , Gulem was rinsing his socks and hanging them on a fence to dry .
Beside him , Ali , 13 , was washing his hair , bent over under the ice - cold water as an older migrant squeezed him a ration of shampoo .
Hours after the raids on the Calais migrant squatter camp known as " the jungle " , Gulem described how he and other homeless Afghans had fled to Paris by train to avoid being caught .
He had lived in one of the " jungle " camps for a month , under pieces of ramshackle plastic sheeting set up under trees on sand dunes near Calais port .
From there , he had made repeated attempts to stow away to England .
" It was filthy .
We had nothing – no water , little food – but it was our only hope , " he said .
With other Afghan migrants , he was now calculating when it would be safe to return to Calais to set up again .
" We 're just waiting to get back to Calais .
We 've got no choice , no hope unless we 're up there trying to get to England .
What else can we do ? "
In the meantime , he will be sleeping rough in Paris , amid the scores of Afghan migrants who bed down on pavements and alleyways around this picturesque Paris park despite police raids .
Like others in " the jungle " , Gulem , a 35 - year - old tailor from southern Afghanistan , had paid a vast sum to be smuggled through Pakistan , Iran and Turkey and into Europe , but got stuck at the no man 's land of migrants outside Calais port .
Many talk of paying € 10,000 to reach Europe .
Gulem said only : " It was the equivalent of an entire eight years ' salary , plus contributions from my brothers and my whole family . "
He had been squatting in a small " jungle " camp of mainly Hazara and Tajik Afghans away from the main Pashtun area that was raided this morning .
His camp , rebuilt after a raid three weeks ago , was so far still standing .
Earlier this month t50 people had been living there .
This morning there were five after most left to avoid the police , but several hoped to go back and chance their luck again .
If their camp is destroyed as raids continue in coming days , they plan to build it again somewhere else .
Like the " jungle " in Calais , Villemin park has become a symbol of the failure of France and Britain to tackle the migrant crisis since the closure of the Sangatte Red Cross camp in 2002 .
Today , the Afghans gathered there suggested the Calais raid would not solve their problems but simply displace them .
From mid-morning small groups of Afghans who had come to Paris to escape the police operation were discussing when and how to get back .
The park lawns , spreading down to the gentrified cobbled pathways of Paris 's Canal Saint Martin , have become a congregation point for Afghan migrants , many of whom sleep rough in the surrounding streets .
Those who had left Calais to seek temporary shelter were more than ever at the mercy of people traffickers , keen to make money by helping them back to the coast .
As a group of Afghans , including several teenagers under 18 , played basketball on the park 's court , two people traffickers approached with offers to get people back to Calais at the right moment .
Some Pashtuns were fuming at being exploited for more money .
Some migrants in the park said that in the run-up to this morning 's raid in Calais , it had become slightly easier for people to slip into England , stowing away under lorries and avoiding checks .
" In our camp , two seemed to get through in one week , " Gulem said .
" In the Pashtun camp it seemed more , maybe 15 a week . "
Charities and NGOs in Calais confirmed there had been a wave of stories of successful passages to England .
People traffickers had already begun using the rumours as " a marketing ploy " to lure more migrants to pay up for help in reaching England .
The French government knew that announcing the raids in advance would mean that police would find only a few hundred at the main " jungle " camps , rather than the usual 800 people sleeping rough .
Some had simply scattered along the Nord - Pas de Calais coast or outside the town , others had moved to the port of Dunkirk .
Charity workers denounced what they called a PR exercise that would not solve the migrant problem , but temporarily displace it .
Reza , a student in his 20s from northern Afghanistan , had been sleeping rough in and around the Paris park for six months and preferred it to the limbo of Calais .
He had noticed the new arrivals who had fled the " jungle " in recent days in fear of the police .
" Here , we 've got nothing , we 're forced to sleep like alcoholics under bridges .
We try to get papers in France and are just left hanging on .
A lot of people want to get back to Calais to try their luck . "
Isarullah , 21 , a former student , showed knife scars on his stomach and chest , saying violence had made him leave his village outside Kabul .
He had been sleeping in and around the park for a month .
" The conditions here are a nightmare , " he said .
" I had a blanket , it was stolen .
I sleep in my clothes , under bridges , under buildings , moving from night to night .
We 've got nothing to eat except a bit of bread we get as hand - outs .
If we see food , we fall on it like animals , we 're so hungry .
I can't go back to Afghanistan , it 's too dangerous .
We 're afraid of the French police .
There 's a whole generation of young Afghans here who just want papers and a chance to work , but it seems more and more hopeless . "
The US marine corps have become the latest branch of the American military to ban the use of social networking sites , after officials expressed concern about potential security risks .
An order sent out to marines yesterday informed them that they could no longer use sites including Facebook , MySpace and Twitter in case enemy groups used the information they contained to their advantage .
" These internet sites in general are a proven haven for malicious actors and content , and are particularly high risk due to information exposure , user - generated content and targeting by adversaries , " said the order .
" The very nature of social networking sites creates a larger attack and exploitation window . "
Coming just days after US deputy defence secretary William Lynn ordered a review of the military 's social networking policies , the move is being seen by some as a signal that the Pentagon could enact a blanket ban on social networks across the entire military system .
Lynn 's review , which is due to be completed by the end of August , plans to weigh up the benefits and drawbacks of allowing members of the army , navy and air force to use social media .
Officials recognise that thousands of active personnel use sites like Facebook to keep in touch with friends and family at home , sharing information and swapping photos while on long tours of duty .
But the benefits of such freedom are often contrasted with grave concerns over the possibility of classified information leaking out .
As a result , the order from the marines is not the first time they have brought the curtain down on certain aspects of internet use .
In 2007 the Pentagon blocked its computer networks from accessing sites including YouTube and MySpace in an attempt to keep a tight rein on information about troop activities .
Official documents at the time cited not only threats to safety , but also the increasingly heavy burden being placed on the department 's internet capability while troops were active duty in such as Iraq and Afghanistan .
Although that ban was eventually lifted , last year the Pentagon used a fresh tactic to try and control the flow of information by launching TroopTube - a military - sponsored version of YouTube that allows serving personnel to share videos with only their friends and family members .
All videos placed on the site must be checked by a Department of Defense worker before they are approved .
At the same time , the military has discovered the benefits of using the social web to its advantage .
The Pentagon recently launched its own Facebook page in an attempt to entice new recruits into the military , while Admiral Mike Mullen - who serves as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , the highest - ranking military officer in the US - is an avowed Twitter user with more than 4,000 followers .
Some personnel will be allowed to continue using social networking sites , but only with a waiver from higher - ranking officers or in " mission critical " circumstances .

In 1969 , a free concert at Altamont Speedway turned deadly .
Hells
Angels were acting as security guards .
Throughout the evening , scuffles and fights broke out between the Hells Angels security guards and the crowd .
During the Rolling Stones portion of the concert , a man named Meredith Hunter was stabbed to death .
This video shows the events shortly before , during and after the murder .

Reports are coming out of a very unique beer in the works from the Brooklyn Brewery .
My hope is that it finally makes drinking beer before 10 AM a socially acceptable , respectable act .
It seems that brewmaster Garret Oliver is looking for ways to get bacon into beer .
The reports are sketchy at best , but it appears the beer is starting out with two parallel threads that will be blended at the end .
As Garret puts it “ Either this will be the most amazingly disgusting thing you ’ve ever tasted in your life , or I shall rule the earth . ”
I must agree , but how ’s he doing it ?
A barleywine has been brewed using malt that was smoked in the same room as a batch of Benton ’s bacon ( Allan Benton is apparently a legend among bacon producers ) .
A brown ale is being infused with the essence of bacon fat by a process known as “ fat washing . ”
This process has already been used to produce bacon flavored rum and bourbon apparently ( who knew ? ) .
The fat is heated until completely liquid , then mixed into the beer .
Then the whole thing is chilled until the fat congeals back to a solid state and rises to the top of the beer , where it ’s skimmed off .
In the process , the non -fat goodness of the bacon is left behind , dissolved in the beer , while the fat is removed from it .
This keeps the beer from developing a greasy mouthfeel ( also lipids in beer have a nasty effect on head retention as they interfere with the formation of the protein matrices that form bubbles ) .
The brown ale will then be aged in Bourbon barrels .
In the end , these two forces will combine like antimatter to produce a beer that may very well change the world as we know it .
I wait with bated breath , very excited and a little afraid …

How to Store / Load Wii Games via USB Hard Drive
Though it inspired controversy over the last week , President Obama ’s back - to - school address to America ’s students Tuesday ended up being decidedly motivational rather than political -- and even won praise from some Republicans .
Speaking to students in a nationwide broadcast from a suburban Virginia high school , the Democratic president urged children to rise above their mistakes and challenges to succeed in school , offering himself as an example of “ a goof - off ” who went on to make good .
“ You ca n’t drop out of school and just drop into a good job , ” Obama said .
“ You ’ve got to work for it and train for it and learn for it . ”
After the speech , Republican former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia said the country would be “ much better off ” if Obama could replicate its tone when he addresses Congress today .
A conservative Republican Senate candidate in Pennsylvania applauded the address as “ inspiring ” and “ moving . ”

Even the president ’s sharpest critic on the broadcast joined the chorus of approval , although he suggested that criticism may have shaped the event .
“ My kids watched it , and I thought it was appropriate , ” Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer said .
“ The White House responded to the concerns of parents and educators across this country . ”
White House officials were not sure how many schools had shown the speech , broadcast on CNN and C - Span as well as via live podcast .
Officials in a handful of districts across the country had said they would not show the speech in class .

The dispute erupted last week over materials the Department of Education had put together for teachers , suggesting a classroom activity in which students would be asked to think of ways they could help the president meet his goals .
Greer issued a statement condemning Obama ’s “ socialist ideology , ” and he and others took to the airwaves with complaints that such classroom activities amounted to propaganda .
The discussion dominated cable and talk radio shows for days .
Before the speech , the administration revised the materials to instead suggest that students set their own educational goals .
The White House also posted an advance text of the speech online .
By the time Obama arrived at Wakefield High School in Arlington , Va. , on Tuesday morning , some critics were already complimenting the address .
Advertisement
At a question - and - answer session with a small group of Wakefield ninth - graders , one student told Obama that his parents were divorced , and asked the president how his life might have been different if his father had been around as he was growing up .
The absence of his father , Obama said , “ in some ways forced me to grow up faster . ”
“ It meant that I made more mistakes because I did n’t have somebody to tell me , here ’s how you do this or here ’s how you do that , ” he said .
“ But on the other hand , I had to , I think , raise myself a little bit more .
I had to be more supportive of my mother because I knew how hard she was working .
And so , in some ways , maybe it made me stronger over time , just like it may be making you stronger over time . ”

Afterward , the president went to a gymnasium filled with hundreds of students , faculty members and elected officials , where he talked to a nationwide audience about his childhood , the challenges he faced and the mistakes he made .
“ Now I know it ’s not always easy to do well in school , ” he said .
“ I know a lot of you have challenges in your lives right now that can make it hard to focus on your schoolwork . ”
With his father gone and his mother struggling to pay the bills , he said , he was sometimes lonely and felt as if he did n’t fit in .
“ So I was n’t always as focused as I should have been , ” said Obama , who in his autobiography confessed to experimenting with drugs .
“ I did some things I ’m not proud of and got in more trouble than I should have .
And my life could have easily taken a turn for the worse . ”
Advertisement
But he made the most of his opportunities , he said , and he asked students to do the same .
“ The president ’s emphasis on responsibility and the personal stories about his own education are exactly the kind of inspiring messages our children need to hear from our country ’s leaders , ” said Pat Toomey , the conservative Republican running for Senate in Pennsylvania .

As soon as the tax was announced , a text message began making the rounds saying : " The government has imposed a tax on all messages .
This means that until now President Zardari was getting abused for free .
Now he 'll get paid every time someone abuses him ! "
I am a fan of Sarah Palin’s .
I think she has the right to energize the Republican Party and become the Ronald Reagan of the 21st century .
I bet , in a couple of years , we will be hearing a lot about the “ Palin Democrats . ”
I certainly hope that , despite her sudden and mysterious resignation as Governor of Alaska , she will run for and then win the White House in 2012 , unless either Ann Coulter or the Michigan Congressman Thaddeus McCotter runs .
( That Palin ’s election as President will undoubtedly bring back Tina Fey to SNL for hopefully eight years is just one of the benefits . )
As much as I like Sarah Palin , however , in the recent controversy between Palin and Letterman , my loyalty is firmly with Letterman , of whom I have been a devoted fan for a quarter of a century .
Palin was simply wrong to take on Letterman on this issue .
Before discussing what Palin got wrong , I need to point out what she got right .
Palin and other critics of Letterman and CBS were absolutely correct to point to the well - known strong liberal in the media .
There is no way that Letterman would have made similar jokes about Democratic politicians , and , had he had the folly to do so , he would have been fired by CBS in a nanosecond .
Feminist organizations like NOW only defend liberal women , and are always conspicuously silent when conservative women are attacked .
So Palin and her supporters were correct to point out the liberal hypocrisy in the media .
Having said that , however , Palin was wrong on at least two fronts .
First , as I explain in an earlier post , there is no such thing as an offensive joke .
Jokes are either funny or unfunny or somewhere in between .
The only purpose of a joke is to make people laugh , so the only legitimate criterion on which to evaluate jokes – all jokes – is whether and how well it succeeds in accomplishing their goal of making people laugh .
I personally thought that Letterman ’s jokes at Palin ’s and her daughter ’s expense were funny , but reasonable people can certainly disagree on the judgment .
But the worst thing that anyone – including Palin – can say about the jokes is that they were not funny .
Jokes – like scientific theories – cannot be offensive , sexist , racist , dangerous , or any other adjective .
Second , from a purely biological perspective , it was odd that a large part of the controversy apparently hinged on whether , in making fun of Palin ’s “ daughter , ” Letterman meant the 18 - year - old Bristol or the 14 - year - old Willow .
Many critics of Letterman seemed to agree that it would have been perfectly fine for Letterman to make sexual jokes about the 18 - year - old Bristol , because she was “ of age , ” whereas it was completely inappropriate to make similar jokes about the 14 - year - old Willow , because she was “ underage . ”
While I can understand this distinction from a legal or social perspective , it is one that makes no biological sense .
There are only two meaningful and qualitatively different developmental life stages for humans : and adulthood .
And what marks the qualitative transition from childhood to adulthood is .
Purely biologically speaking , any human past puberty is an adult , fully capable of sexual intercourse and reproduction .
That ’s the whole purpose of puberty , to make the human capable of and ready for reproduction .
There is nothing magical or biologically meaningful about the age 18 ( or any other age of consent or legal adulthood ) .
Nothing happens on the 18th birthday , and an 18 - year - old on her birthday is essentially exactly the same as she was a day , a week , or a month before .
From a purely biological perspective , 14 - year - old girls ( past puberty ) are no different from 18 - or 21 - or 25 - year - old girls .
True , 14 - year - olds on average tend to be less mature than 18 - year - olds , but then 30 - year - olds on average tend to be less mature than 40 - year - olds , but nobody thinks of treating 30 - year - olds as children incapable of making their own decisions .
Biologically , 14 - year - olds are fully adults , and the choice of 18 as the age of legal majority is entirely arbitrary .
Whether Palin and other critics of Letterman like it or not , 14 - year - old girls in the United States and the rest of the world are having every day .
In fact , throughout human evolutionary history , the modal age of for women was probably shortly after puberty ( although puberty likely happened much later than it does in Western industrial nations today ) , and the statistically most typical marriage in the ancestral environment was between a newly pubescent 14 - year - old girl and a 40 - year - old band ( as in the leader of a hunter - gatherer band , not Paul Shaffer ) , who takes her as his third or fifth wife .
The difference between a 14 - year - old girl and an 18 - year - old girl is a wholly socially constructed one without any biological merit .

Children under 15 are particularly vulnerable to the disease
At least 200 children have died in an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in northern India , health officials say .
So far , 900 affected children have been admitted to hospitals in Uttar Pradesh state .
Some patients have come from neighbouring Bihar state and Nepal .
There is no specific cure for the mosquito - borne disease which has killed thousands in India since 1978 .
Health experts complain that red tape has prevented development of an effective vaccination programme .
The disease occurs regularly during India 's monsoon .
Doctors say children between the age of six months to 15 years are worst affected and most of the victims are poor people from rural areas .
Breeding ground " The attack of the encephalitis virus is extremely ferocious this year , " says Dr Rashmi Kumar , an expert on Japanese encephalitis at Lucknow Medical College hospital .
" Children are developing a serious condition within a day or two of getting infected , " she says .
Health officials in the state capital , Lucknow , say cases of acute encephalitis are being reported mostly from 14 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh in the foothills of the Himalayas .
The low - lying areas are prone to annual floods , and severe water - logging and a lack of sanitation provide a breeding ground for mosquitoes .
Doctors say Gorakhpur town is the epicentre of the disease .
Last year , the government said it would spend 60 million rupees ( $ 1.24 m ) to upgrade facilities at Gorakhpur Medical College hospital .
But , doctors say , the hospital does not have adequate numbers of medical staff to deal with the large numbers of patients .
Doctors say the children who survive will have to face lifelong problems as the disease has a crippling effect .
' Preventable '
While there is no specific cure for the disease after it has been contracted , three vaccines are in use worldwide that have reportedly been successful in preventing the disease .
But India has so far failed to develop an effective vaccination programme .
After the disease killed 1,500 children in 2005 , a public outcry forced the government to import vaccines from China and a mass vaccination project was started .
However , doctors say the vaccine coverage has not been satisfactory this year , with many parents of affected children saying no vaccination was done in their areas .
Japanese encephalitis , which causes high fever , vomiting and can leave patients comatose , usually hits Uttar Pradesh state in July - August .
The disease has recurred annually in eastern regions of the state since 1978 .

2009 Vuelta a España , Stage 13 : VeloNews European correspondent Andrew Hood catches up with a frustrated Cadel Evans .
Photo : Graham Watson
Cadel Evans just ca n’t seem to catch a break this season .
The Australian ’s chances of overall victory were torpedoed Saturday with an ill - timed puncture near the top of the decisive Alto de Monachil climb late in the five - climb 13th stage .
Confusion over a wheel change cost Evans critical seconds and he lost contact with the top GC rivals just as the leaders were nearing the final charge up to the summit finish at Sierra Nevada .
Evans crossed the line eighth at 2:24 back , forfeiting 1:08 to race leader Alejandro Valverde ( Caisse d’Epargne ) , and slipped from second place at just seven seconds back to fourth , now 1:23 back .
It was a heartbreaker for the Silence - Lotto rider , who was enjoying a great Vuelta after a frustrating Tour de France .
“ I do n’t deserve this .
I do everything right in the fucking sport and I do n’t deserve this shit , ” Evans told VeloNews at the Sierra Nevada summit .
“ ( The ) wheel change was the problem . ”
Evans ’ bad luck was compounded by several factors .
Huge crowds lining the top of the climb meant that Silence - Lotto ’s team car was caught up behind other cars stacked up in single file going up the narrow road .
That prompted Evans to take a wheel from the Shimano neutral support , but team officials were n’t sure if it was a 10 - speed or an 11 - speed casette , so Silence sport director Marc Wauters made the call to stop Evans again and switch his bike .
They later discovered that the neutral support wheel was the correct one .
“ We decided to switch bikes , so he lost even more time , ” Wauters said .
“ It was terrible luck for Cadel .
He ’s riding great and I ’m sure he would have been able to stay with those guys all the way to the end .
He ’s still close to the podium , but to lose a chance at victory like that in a grand tour is n’t fair . ”
Evans later charged on a Twitter posting that media vehicles , most likely Spanish TV motorbikes , also complicated his situation .
Evans Twittered : “ A puncture in a crucial moment of the Vuelta I can handle .
Useless neutral assistance and media blocking the road I really do n’t deserve . ”
Silence - Lotto had Francis De Greef up the road from the day ’s early breakaway , who sat up and helped as much as he could to try to help Evans chase , but after being in the breakaway all day , De Greef soon left Evans to fight alone .
There was some question about whether the other favorites should have waited for Evans in a gesture of solidarity .
There ’s the unwritten rule of not attacking a GC leader when he suffers a mechanical or crash , but Evans obviously was n’t in the lead , and with the race full on and the leaders barreling down the harrowing Monachil descent , there was no time for compassion .
“ I did n’t even know that Evans flatted .
All I know is that I looked back and he was n’t there , ” Valverde said .
“ We all agreed ( Basso and Gesink ) that we should collaborate together to try to distance Evans and ( Samuel ) Sánchez .
Evans would have been very dangerous in the final time trial if things had stayed the same until then . ”
Evans ’ bad luck was a boon for Valverde , Robert Gesink and Ivan Basso , three climbers who were worried about the superior time trial abilities of the Australian .
“ It ’s too bad that Evans lost his second place like that .
He does n’t deserve that , ” said Gesink ( Rabobank ) , who slotted into second overall at 27 seconds back .
“ It ’s good for me that Evans , ( Tom ) Danielson and Sánchez all lost time , because they are all better time trialists than me , so my podium chances are looking better . ”

Almost 500 children were abducted from the UK and taken abroad illegally last year , according to figures released to the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act .
There were 336 cases of child abduction reported to authorities in the UK in 2008 , an increase of 20 % on 2005 figures .
These cases involved an estimated 470 children last year .
More children were taken illegally to Pakistan than any other country ( 30 cases in 2008 ) , followed by the USA ( 23 ) , Ireland ( 22 ) and Spain ( 21 ) .
Other abduction hotspots included Australia , France and Egypt .
Abductions usually occur when marriages break down between couples of different nationalities , and the parent who is not awarded custody kidnaps their children .
Now is peak abduction season , as children are taken abroad during the school summer holidays and not returned .
Usually , the cases are n't publicised as they are dealt with in the family courts where reporting restrictions apply to any cases involving the welfare of minors .
But they are becoming increasingly common – when the Guardian spent a day in a family court in London recently , eight out of 14 cases heard involved child abduction .
The government has little power to intervene in around 40 % of all abduction cases , as they involve children being taken to countries not signed up to the Hague convention , an international treaty which obliges nations to promptly return children wrongfully retained in their jurisdiction .
Experts say it is often almost impossible for mothers to get back children taken by their fathers to Islamic countries with sharia law , such as Saudi Arabia , which prioritise male parental rights .
But recently Gordon Brown and the new health secretary , Andy Burnham , have personally intervened in the case of Nadia Fawzi , then a four - year - old British girl taken from Wigan to Libya by her Libyan father .
A month ago , Burnham , the girl 's MP , flew to Tripoli for meetings with the Libyan justice ministry and police force about the case , and Gordon Brown asked the Libyan leader , Colonel Gaddafi , to help return the girl to the UK when the two met for the first time at the G8 summit in Italy .
Nadia was picked up from her home in Wigan by her father , who said they were going to a party .
But instead , he drove to Manchester airport , where he was captured on CCTV buying plane tickets to Libya .
Nadia has n't been home since .
Her British mother , Sarah Taylor , saw her daughter on a few occasions in the months after her abduction , but has had no contact with her since Christmas 2007 .
Taylor has spent the last two years doing everything in her power to be reunited with her now six - year - old daughter .
Libya is a notoriously difficult country to negotiate with on such matters – it has not signed up to the Hague convention , and so the UK government is limited in the support it can offer .
In November 2007 , Taylor took a drastic step .
She sold her house , gave up her job and moved to Libya to fight through the local courts for the custody she had already been awarded in the UK courts after her marriage to Nadia 's father broke down .
After a long and difficult battle in the labyrinthine sharia legal system , Taylor won full custody of Nadia in 2008 .
But her ex-husband refused to comply with the court order , and despite quiet but firm interventions from the Foreign Office and assorted other agencies in the UK and Tripoli , he still has the little girl in his care .
Or at least Taylor believes he does – no one is entirely sure where in the Libyan capital father and daughter are currently living .
Burnham told the Guardian he is hopeful that mother and daughter will soon be reunited .
He said : " This awful injustice and crime has now been raised at the highest level and we now expect swift action .
This is a story about a young girl taken illegally off the streets of my constituency and I will go to any lengths to right that wrong . "
In 2008 , 134 out of the 336 cases of child abduction involved children taken to non-Hague countries , including Bangladesh , Russia , Iraq and Nigeria .
These cases are dealt with by the Foreign Office , while Hague cases go through the Ministry of Justice in England and Wales , and the Scottish and Northern Irish court services .
Scotland dealt with nine cases last year involving 12 children .
In Northern Ireland last year there were 12 reported instances , involving 20 children taken to the Republic of Ireland , the USA , Israel , Germany , Finland , Poland and France .
The increase in cases is an " inevitable consequence of greater migration " , according to Andy Elvin , chief executive of the charity International Social Services , which helps parents secure the return of their children .
" Child abduction is a growing trend as we have an increasing number of families where at least one parent is originally from overseas , " he said .
Denise Carter , director of Reunite , a UK charity specialising in international parental child abduction , said : " The increase in international travel and more and more people travelling on short - term contracts and changing their habitual residence also has an effect . "
Figures from Reunite show that since 1995 , the number of children abducted from Britain and taken to another country has risen by 93 % .
The government 's figures clearly show the effect of EU enlargement .
For example , until Latvia joined the EU in 2004 , there had been no reported cases of children being abducted there from the UK in the previous four years .
But in 2005 , three cases were reported , and there has been at least one new instance every year since .
Similarly , while there were no reported abductions to Poland in 2003 , the year before the country 's EU entry , there were 10 in 2006 and 2008 .
" We expect to see more and more cases from countries like Poland as the years go on and more couples marry , have children and get divorced , " said Elvin .
A Foreign Office spokesperson said : " When there is no international mechanism in place , usually the left - behind parent 's only option [ other than trying to come to an agreement with the other parent ] is to file a case in the courts of the country where their child has been taken .
However , pursuing such a case will often be expensive and there is no guarantee the courts will decide that the child should be returned to the UK . "
I ’m reading Murray Rothbard ’s America ’s Great Depression , which is both fascinating and frightening because of its relevance .
The book argues that loose - money and government tinkering in the 1920 ’s led to the crash in 1929 .
Rothbard presents a logical and detailed case , which happens to go against everything our current leaders believe .
The passage below especially struck a chord with me .
It describes various attempts to keep the bull - market going 1926 - 8 .
This 1928 quote by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon sticks out , “ There is an abundant supply of easy money which should take care of any contingencies that might arise “ .
Mellon is often portrayed as a ultra - free - market liquidationist , but only the latter part of that may be accurate .
He appears to have intentionally goosed the markets in the 20’s ( Rothbard offers a lot of evidence of this ) and advocated shoveling cash at problems in ’ 28 .
This section of Rothbard ’s book casts doubt on the widespread belief that The Great Depression could have been avoided if government acted more quickly .
They were providing liquidity as a crutch long before the crash in 1929 .
From 1921 - 1929 there was 7.8 % annualized inflation , almost all of it caused by various government interventions .
This was exacerbated by creative abuse of reserve requirements , which increased the multiplier effect .
People have been trying to engineer an everlasting bubble for a long time , undeterred by the fact that it has never worked .
It reminds me of the the perpetual motion machine .
It is 100 % physically impossible , yet people keep tinkering away with magnets and ball bearings .
The Fed is the same .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s public pension fund , the world ’s largest , said on Tuesday it could become a net seller in the markets from this financial year ending in March 2010 , but the scale of it selling is likely to be modest .
The Government Pension Investment Fund , which manages about 117.6 trillion yen ( $ 1.2 trillion ) in Japanese bonds , foreign bonds , domestic equities and foreign equities , has been a net buyer up until last financial year .
“ We may sell some amount , but the sales are not expected to be big as we can cover the shortfall from maturing bonds , ” GPIF President Takahiro Kawase told the Reuters Japan Investment Summit .
“ I do n’t expect ( GPIF selling ) to have a major impact on the market , ” Kawase said .
The GPIF may need about 4 - 5 trillion yen of funds to supply the national treasury to help repay benefits to pension recipients for the current year , Kawase said .
But the public pension fund may not have to sell too much , as it can make up some of the shortfall with proceeds from maturing Japanese government bonds , which are also expected to total about 4 - 5 trillion yen , he said .
Kawase said the GPIF did not sell assets in the April - June quarter .
The GPIF could potentially sell assets where it has overweight holdings to raise cash for pension payouts if it can’t cover the shortfall with the maturing bonds , Kawase said .
The GPIF is only overweight in domestic bonds in its portfolio , which has 74 percent of its money in Japanese bonds compared with 67 percent in its model portfolio .
Government Pension Investment Fund President Takahiro Kawase speaks at the Reuters Japan Investment Summit in Tokyo July 7 , 2009 .

Kawase added that the GPIF could remain a net seller in the markets for the next few years .
Last fiscal year , the fund had fresh inflows of investment money totaling about 11 trillion yen due to repayments of loans from semi-government entities and other public bodies and proceeds from “ zaito ” government - related agency bonds , but such inflows have now ended .
Regarding the introduction of a new model portfolio , the pension fund ’s allocation for bonds is expected to stay high , as it is in its current portfolio , Kawase said .
But he added that he did not expect its target portfolio in equities to rise sharply .
“ We have to invest in safe and efficient instruments under the law .
We care about safety very much , ” Kawase said .
“ We ’ve been taking risks in line with the risks matching domestic bonds .
So it ’s unlikely ... for example , that the weightings in stocks would rise to 40 percent from 20 percent , ” he said .
As of the end of March , the GPIF had 73.9 percent of its investments in domestic bonds including “ zaito ” government - related agency bonds , 9.7 percent in Japanese stocks , 7.7 percent in foreign stocks , 8.5 percent in foreign bonds and 0.1 percent in short term assets .
GPIF manages its fund in line with a model portfolio in which 67 percent is invested in domestic bonds , 11 percent in domestic stocks , 9 percent in foreign stocks and 8 percent in foreign bonds .
GPIF is set to manage its funds under a new model portfolio from April 2010 .
Kawase said it managed to outperform other major foreign funds such as Calpers , or the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System , as its exposure to equities has been low .
The GPIF last week posted a record loss of almost $ 100 billion yen for the year ended in March , hit by the financial crisis , although it cut it losses by about half in the April - June quarter mainly to due a recovery in stocks .
* Obama walks fine line to keep healthcare bill moving
* Torn between competing demands of coalition supporters
* Challenge to keep votes in line in Congress
WASHINGTON , Aug 19 ( Reuters ) - The Democratic Party feud over a government - run insurance plan has been another harsh reminder for President Barack Obama of how quickly his fragile healthcare reform coalition can splinter .
When Congress returns to work on his top domestic priority in September , Obama will face competing demands from liberal and conservative Democrats , leaders in the Senate and the House of Representatives , and Senate moderates from both parties -- all of whom could muster the votes to bury his plan .
" This was never going to be easy .
There are going to be some very painful moments , " said Bob Blendon , a health policy and political analyst at Harvard University .
Most analysts still expect a healthcare bill ultimately to make it through Congress .
But its size and scope could be reduced and a long battle with Republicans could take a political toll on Obama , who entered the White House promising a new era of bipartisanship .
" There are a lot of hard votes and difficult negotiations ahead , and the path to the end is still not clear , " Blendon said .
Obama got a preview of the challenges this week , when liberal Democrats threatened to withhold their support after the White House seemed to waffle on its commitment to a public insurance option that would compete with private insurers and offer more choices for consumers .
The liberal rebellion came three weeks after a group of conservative Democrats blocked consideration of healthcare legislation by a House panel until they won concessions from the administration .
Obama 's courtship of Republicans also has failed , leaving Democrats pondering whether to go it alone .
Three Republicans and three Democrats from the Senate Finance Committee are still negotiating a compromise , but it is uncertain if it will attract any Republican votes -- even from the negotiators .
" When Obama moves right he loses the left , and what seems possible in the House does n't seem possible in the Senate -- it 's not clear how you get there from here , " said Steven Schier , a political analyst at Carleton College in Minnesota .
Obama 's push for a healthcare overhaul that reins in costs , constrains insurance companies and expands coverage to 46 million uninsured Americans has been assailed by critics on all sides and slowed by negotiations on Capitol Hill .
To ensure approval , he needs 218 votes in the House , where Democrats have 256 seats , and 60 votes in the Senate , where Democrats and their allies have exactly 60 seats -- enough to break any Republican effort to block the legislation through procedural tactics .
To reach the magic number in the House , Obama must walk a tightrope between more than 50 conservative " Blue Dog " Democrats , many from Republican - leaning districts , and more than 80 liberal members , most from safe Democratic seats where they rarely face a re-election challenge .
Liberals have demanded inclusion of a government - run insurance option and threatened to withhold support without it .
Many Democratic conservatives have voiced concern about the cost , the public plan and the impact on small businesses .
PUBLIC OPTION IN HOUSE BILL
Three House committees have passed a healthcare measure that includes a strong public option , so for now Obama and supporters will have to find other areas to placate House conservatives .
The government - run insurance plan , designed to bolster competition and choice in the market , has been the focal point of critics who say the overhaul would amount to a government takeover of healthcare .
But some analysts said the battle over the public option , which a recent Congressional Budget Office report estimated would attract 10 million to 11 million people by 2019 , was overblown .
" It 's become a bigger symbolic issue than it is a substantive reality , " said Drew Altman , president of the Kaiser Family Foundation , a non-partisan health policy group .
" When the Congress comes back the debate will refocus on the core issues rather than the hot - button issues ... how to pay for health reform and whether there can be even cosmetic bipartisan support , " he said .
In the Senate , Democrat Kent Conrad , one of the so - called " Gang of Six " negotiating the Finance Committee bill , says Republican votes will be needed to reach the 60 mark .
Three moderates who vote with Democrats -- Ben Nelson , Mary Landrieu and Joe Lieberman -- have voiced doubts on the public option .
Two other Democrats , Edward Kennedy and Robert Byrd , have been sick and their availability to vote is uncertain .
Three Republicans -- Charles Grassley , Mike Enzi , and Olympia Snowe -- are negotiating a compromise , but Grassley has said he is unsure if he will back the final product .
" The question now is at what point do Democrats say 'ok , we 've given it our best shot , it 's clear you do n't want to deal , so we 'll move ahead ourselves , ' " said Richard Kirsch , campaign manager for Health Care for America Now , an umbrella organization for groups advocating reform .
Obama has given the Gang of Six until mid-September before he decides whether to press on without Republicans , a move that would make it an even bigger partisan issue in next year 's congressional elections .
" Our preference is to work through this process and hopefully come out with a bill that has agreement among both parties , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
Sen. Kennedy ( left ) appealed to Leonid Brezhnev to allow the Katzes ( Boris with Jessica ) to leave the USSR .
BOSTON , Massachusetts ( CNN ) --
She was called " the littlest refusenik , " one of the many Soviet Jews denied permission to leave the Soviet Union because her father had been exposed to government secrets .
But the case of Jessica Katz was special because she was a baby born with a nutritional deficiency that stopped her from growing .
She was a tiny baby dying in a Moscow hospital , getting weaker by the day .
It was U.S. Sen .
Ted Kennedy who , her parents say , eventually saved her life .
Jessica was born in Moscow in 1977 with malabsorption syndrome , which prevented her from digesting food or milk properly .
All she needed was baby formula , but it was n't available in the Soviet Union .
The Soviet doctors could n't save her .
Jessica 's parents , Boris and Natalya , were desperate .
Jessica 's grandmother had immigrated to Boston , Massachusetts , with two of her sons and was campaigning to get her baby granddaughter out of the Soviet Union .
At first she helped urge American tourists to take baby formula to Moscow for the Katz family , and for a little while , it worked .
It seemed to bring Jessica back from the brink .
Watch more of the story of " the littlest refusenik " »
But it was n't enough .
The Katz family knew they needed a permanent solution -- access to doctors in the West .
Eventually , the grandmother 's campaign reached Kennedy 's office , and the senator decided to step in .
In September 1978 , Kennedy traveled to Moscow for a meeting with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to urge him to let the Katz family -- or at the very least , Jessica -- leave the country immediately .
" If not for his intervention , I would have been arrested very soon [ afterward ] and it would have been too late for him to intervene , " said Katz , recalling the fate of many of his Jewish friends .
" So he saved Jessica , he saved me , he saved the rest our family . "
The first the Katzes knew of it was late one night when they got a mysterious phone call .
The caller invited Boris Katz to a midnight meeting with an unnamed guest -- and in Soviet Russia , Katz did n't dare ask who it was .
" You know in the Soviet Union not to ask too many questions over the phone , " he said .
Katz arrived at the meeting and , much to his shock , in walked Kennedy .
" A bunch of KGB men came with him into the room and he just turned around and told the KGB men , ' Go away , ' " Katz recalled .
" This was clearly the first [ time ] ever I witnessed something like this .
Here the all - powerful KGB men wanted to be at the meeting and the senator just told them to go away , and they looked at each other and just left .
And that was , again , a powerful scene . "
Kennedy spoke to other refuseniks already gathered in the room before pulling Katz aside .
" He said that earlier he had a meeting in the Kremlin with the Soviet leaders and that he specifically asked to allow us to leave the country for medical reasons , " Katz said .
" He said that they said yes . "
At first , Katz said , he did n't believe him , sure that the Soviet authorities would find a way to scupper the plans .
Katz went home and told his wife , who also did n't believe it , he said .
The next morning , a friend called Katz to say he heard Kennedy on the Voice of America radio network listing the names of people leaving the Soviet Union .
The Katz family was on the list , the friend said .
Despite the report , however , the Soviet authorities denied it , Katz recalls .
" ' We are telling you that this is not the case , ' " he remembers them saying .
" But this was just part of the game that they played . "
About three weeks later , with no fanfare , a card arrived in the mail telling the Katz family to pick up their visa .
They now had their ticket out of the country .
The exit was n't straightforward -- the Katzes ' second daughter , Gabriella , was born two days before they were due to leave , so they postponed their exit by five days .
And they had to stop over in Vienna , Austria , where they were met by a Kennedy aide for the final leg of their trip .
On landing in Boston , Kennedy was the first person they met .
They gave each other a big hug , Katz said .
" Jessica certainly would not have made it if not for his contribution , if not for him taking on the case , getting interested in the case , patiently talking to the Soviet authorities , " Katz told CNN .
" It was lucky for us .
It saved the baby 's life and created new life for Natalya and me and our children . "
Kennedy 's help for the family did n't end there .
He helped Boris Katz , who had worked with computers , find a job at a computer software company .
Today , Katz works at the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where he is the principal research scientist at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory .
" He did it because he wanted to help , " Katz told CNN .
" I think that is what he does -- did -- for many other people .
I went to a number of events where other people whom he helped gave various speeches and I learned many more cases [ where ] he helped people because he likes to help people .
It is his job to help people . "
Today , little Jessica Katz is 31 years old .
She got engaged last year , on the same weekend Kennedy 's cancer diagnosis was announced to the public .
Inspired by Kennedy 's life of public service , Jessica Katz works at finding housing for the homeless in New York City .
She says she has no choice but to look after those less fortunate than she is , because Kennedy proved to her how much it means , and that it can work .
Jessica Katz lacks the cynicism about the government that many others in her generation may have .
Kennedy , she said , proved that some politicians have a desire to accomplish good things and fight injustice .
" He saved my life .
He could have spent his time doing anything , " Jessica Katz said .
" He 's from the fanciest , most powerful family in Massachusetts , and probably in the country , and he decided to spend his time helping out me and my family . "
That has instilled in her a deep sense of public service , she said .
And that may be the best thing Kennedy has left behind .
" That that would be his largest , biggest part of his legacy -- as someone who cared deeply about people , who felt , I think , very deeply people 's suffering and wanted to alleviate it and wanted to help , " Jessica Katz said .
" And I am pretty confident that this is how he will be remembered .
He was an extraordinary individual and this is how he will stay , certainly in our memories and the memories of millions of others . "

Mountain View , CA -
In response to Apple pulling the Google Voice application from the iPhone App Store , Google has removed all search results leading to Apple.com from its index .
Google is also redirecting searches for " iPhone " and " app store " to the IMDb.com page for Payback .
The official explanation was that the Google Voice app duplicated functions on the iPhone , but many think the rejection order came from AT&T .
The application would allow users to make calls and send SMS messages for free using the app , threatening the profits of AT&T .
The Google Voice application is still available for Blackberry and Android phones .
Google 's official explanation for removing Apple from its search results came from Vice - President in charge of search , Marissa Mayer , " Those search results duplicate a lot of the functionality of other sites .
For example , people can find cell phones on many other sites .
We just think this makes it easier for our users . "
Exclusion from the search results could mean lower profits for Apple , as 90 % of visitors reach their site by typing " apple.com " into Google .
Mayer denied that this was a direct response to Apple rejecting the Google Voice application .
" It 's just a coincidence , " said Mayer .
Steve Jobs hinted that another strange coincidence might occur soon .
" Safari may be getting a different search engine , just saying , " said Jobs .
" Oooh , I 'm shaking , " said Mayer .
Some industry analysts think the retaliatory moves could result in all - out war like back in 1939 , when a Polish sausage company stopped using pork from Germany .
In response Germany invaded .
" We do n't want another situation like that , " said Bank of America 's George Pendry .
Apple stock was down on the news .
Update : Google 's Marissa Mayer responds to the article .
Matt , The Office Mortar
July 16 , 2009
Ah-ha !
I have another ghost - blog entry , sent in by a tortured enterprise - peon who wishes to remain anonymous .
( Personally , I like to imagine the voice of David Attenborough when reading this one . )
Matt , The Office Mortar
Like its military namesake , the mortar found in offices has one primary purpose - the lobbing of grenades .
The Office Mortar often uses domain or technical knowledge , anecdotes or rule - lawyering to inflict heavy casualties .
In an open , pluralist office where everyone is encouraged to speak up about problems it is difficult to deal with a mortar directly , but many people see them for what they are , constantly throwing out problematic issues that either need to be defused or blow up in somebody 's face .
Often used by insurgents keen to derail a project , a mortar placed in a strategic position such as testing , architecture or business analysis , can keep a team pinned down for weeks or months , and cause horrific loss of morale and productivity .
Although the mortar likes to deliver its lethal payload by lobbing grenades indiscriminately into groups ( in office parlance this is called a " meeting " ) mortars in the 21st century have devised a new means of spreading fear and error - grenades delivered by email !
Now , Let 's watch as this mortar unleashes a deadly barrage of nebulous issues , process meta-questions and second guessing .
Organizer :
We 're here to finalize any remaining details of the user stories in the development cycle that 's now underway ...
Matt the Mortar : Half these need to go .
X is n't fully specified , and there 's no point doing Y without it .
And why is n't Z in scope ?
Organizer : Sorry Matt , we agreed on the list of stories last week .
You were in that meeting , and as a group we all agreed on this list .
Matt the Mortar :
The whole process is broken !
What 's the point of saying we 're agile if we 're unwilling to change .
Organizer :
We value your opinions Matt , but perhaps this meeting is n't the best forum to ...
Matt the Mortar :
There should be a full review of the process by which the list of stories is defined for the cycle , and I 'd like the outcomes of any meetings where scope is discussed to be mailed to the whole team .
Organizer : Now Matt , we held a retrospective meeting just last Thursday , and all of these points would 've been excellent things to raise on that occasion ...
Matt the Mortar : Furthermore , let me say that I for one do n't have any faith in these so called ' business reps ' and whether or not they actually represent the business itself .
You need to raise that back to the project sponsors .
Organizer : The what ?
Look , getting back on track , we need to ensure the first user story is ...
Matt the Mortar :
That story is completely broken -- it will never work with the FizzBuzz system they have in production .
Organizer : Hold on , integration with the FizzBuzz system is strictly out of scope for this project .
Matt the Mortar : No , I 've been talking to other business reps and they 're very keen to see a lot of improvements to FizzBuzz as soon possible including cloud based ...
And we leave our meeting there , irretrievably drowning in a deep vat of confusion .
Matt will of - course have forgotten all of these bomb shells when the next retrospective is held .
He will instead insist that the retrospective is a waste of time that stops them from implementing many important features that he alone understands .
It is at moments such at this that managers around the world choose to bring in a highly successful counter measure : The Office Sharp - Shooter .
But more on that topic next week .

WASHINGTON -- China is on track to become the first purchaser of notes issued by the International Monetary Fund , a move that would diversify its foreign asset holdings and could give the IMF 's quasi- currency more clout .
The IMF on Wednesday said China has signed an agreement to purchase approximately $ 50 billion in notes from the fund .
The notes are denominated in Special Drawing Rights , a quasi- currency issued by the fund and promoted by China as a potential replacement for the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .

Coffee History According to a coffee history legend , an Arabian shepherd named Kaldi found his goats dancing joyously around a dark green leafed shrub with bright red cherries in the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula .
Kaldi soon determined that it was the bright red cherries on the shrub that were causing the peculiar euphoria and after trying the cherries himself , he learned of their powerful effect .
The stimulating effect was then exploited by monks at a local monastery to stay awake during extended hours of prayer and distributed to other monasteries around the world .
Coffee was born .
Despite the appeal of such a legend , recent botanical evidence suggests a different coffee bean origin .
This evidence indicates that the history of the coffee bean beagan on the plateaus of central Ethiopia and somehow must have been brought to Yemen where it was cultivated since the 6th century .
Upon introduction of the first coffee houses in Cairo and Mecca coffee became a passion rather than just a stimulant .

How EU institutions work : Overview Published duration 9 November 2010
The institutions of the European Union form the framework for co-operation between the 27 member states .
The European Commission is the only one that can initiate legislation .
It submits its proposals to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers , to be approved or rejected .
The parliament also has responsibility for supervising the 27 commissioners and is the only institution with the power to sack them .
Commissioners are appointed by the Council of Ministers and then approved by the parliament .
Once legislation has been passed , the European Court of Justice makes sure it is interpreted uniformly across all the member states .
The Court of Auditors is the watchdog for the budget , checking that the money is being well spent .
What ’s in your Cart ?
Finding the right theme can be a long and arduous process – a process that becomes more important when we ’re talking about Shopping Cart or eCommerce themes .
There are two big differences between picking a theme for your Dallas - Cowboys - bashing blog and the theme for your custom furniture shop .
Credibility : Your blog has the luxury of being superficial – looking good is important to attract readers .
When it ’s your storefront , looks sometimes have to be sacrificed for personality .
Shoppers not only want to be aesthetically pleased , they want to believe you will hold up your end of the bargain .

Shoppers not only want to be aesthetically pleased , they want to believe you will hold up your end of the bargain .
Cost : With great credibility comes great responsibility … wait , that ’s not how it goes .
Anyway , when it comes to shopping cart themes , you will see less for ‘ free ’ .
This is because it is a more difficult task to construct a decent theme for a shopping cart – there is far more involved .
Do n’t think of the price as an inhibitor – if your store sells , you ’ll easily recoup the costs and you ’ll feel better about a higher quality template .
We ’ve tried to include some of both ( free and premium ) samples here .
In this article , our goal is to show you some of the better themes for your shopping cart – we ’ve got themes here for WordPress , osCommerce , Magento , Zen Cart , and CRE Loaded .
In case you have n’t decided on a platform yet , we ’ll take a moment to look at the advantage of each , and then dive into the templates .
Things we kept in mind when making our selections :
Credibility : Is this a store that I would buy from ?
Many themes are built around a generic store type ( Has anyone else realized how many ‘ Lingerie Shop ’ templates are out there ? ) so we only choose themes where we could imagine them selling products other than what was shown .

Aesthetics : Yup , at the end of the day , although it may not factor into your ability to sell ( depending on your target audience ) we just want things to look impressive .
We used ‘ looks ’ as a tiebreaker after personality ( just like the real world ) .

Price : Finding free themes is tough – finding free themes you trust enough to download can be even tougher .
Some artists have been kind enough to offer their talents for free , but we have also included a good deal of paid Premium templates .
We looked for those ‘ reasonably ’ priced themes though , and kept out ones where we thought the price was not proportionate to the quality .
WordPress
We all probably know WP as a blogging platform , but extensibility is a powerful thing .
Although there are a few eCommerce plug-ins for WordPress , the most notable is the wp e-commerce by a group called Instinct .
They ’ve also added a ‘ Gold Cart ’ upgrade for those of you who find success and need to step it up again .
Vanilla Cart

Magento
Magento is a strong offering in the shop - cart world with a ‘ Magento Community ’ edition , which is offered at no cost and is open source .
Magento full features list ( link ) is impressive , but its clear they are now focusing more on their ‘ Enterprise ’ level solution .
Their ‘ Community Edition ’ product page includes a small blurb which spends half its time telling you the product is provided ‘ as - is ’ without support , and also includes a link to their Enterprise page .
That said , Magento is still a strong offering and offers a range of features and usability not easily rivaled .
Just keep in mind you will have to offer yourself support , which is something that some small businesses can’t afford to do .

Zen Cart might have been this developing industry ’s leader at one point in time , but it does n’t appear to compete as well against some of the other offerings today .

It does offer a lot of the same features as some of the other players , and also offers a newsletter manager , coupons and certificates , and bulk pricing – all interesting features .

CRE Loaded
Before writing this article , I had honestly not heard of this company .
It did n’t take me very long at all to understand that their major selling point was PCI compliance .
I ’ve had enough technical conversations with those who work finance in web companies , and , while they have no idea what PHP , ASP , or CSS is , their eyes light up when you say PCI .
It ’s often a dealbreaker .
Do n’t know what PCI Compliance is ?
Shoes Store
An interesting use of space at the top of the template .
High contrast on the nav bar above helps a user with crucial links ( i.e. cart )

More than three years after her brother was kidnapped into the Gaza Strip , Gilad Shalit 's sister Hadas will enlist in the army on Wednesday .
Hadas has asked not to link her enlistment to the struggle for her brother 's release .
The activists leading the campaign for Gilad 's release said Tuesday they understand and respect Hadas ' request : " We congratulate Hadas on her enlistment , wish her luck and respect her decision to take part in the struggle for her brother 's release in her own way . "
Wary Shalit activists not optimistic over reported progress Reuters , Daniel Edelson While Hamas says German mediation has advanced talks for Israeli soldier 's release , head of Shalit campaign says , ' We 've been at this point before '
Shalit activists not optimistic over reported progress
Noam and Aviva Shalit 's youngest daughter recently concluded a year of community service at a school in Jerusalem .
" She could have given up army service , but chose to contribute to the state , " one of her friends told Ynet .
" She thinks it is important for her to be like any other young person who cares about the state , " the friend added .
" In all of her conversations with her friends it was clear that despite the difficult situation Hadas would not give up military service .
" We know that Aviva and Noam greatly respect her decision and stand by her . "
Hadas , Yoel and Gilad 's young sister has kept away from the limelight in the last three years .
However , friends and family say she makes sure to remain updated on all the developments concerning Gilad .
Hamas : Deal encounters difficulties
A senior Hamas official commented Tuesday on the recent reports on progress in the negotiations for Shalit 's release .
" There is progress but a deal has yet to be reached and there are quite a few difficulties , " he told Ynet .
He added that although talks have intensified in recent days , no breakthrough has been recorded .
" The negotiations are conducted consistently and diligently in an attempt to resolve every disputed issue , " said the official .
" The talks have even reached a stage where each name is being discussed , but there are still some obstacles . "
He added that the German mediation has helped advance the talks : " It 's not that the Egyptians have not been effective , but it seems that the German experience in prisoner exchange deals has an effect , and things are moving forward , " he stated .
However , the official noted that similar progress has been recorded on several occasions in the past , but has led to no concrete results .
" Things appear to be serious , but its ' too early to make any statements . "
The official stressed that Hamas ' stance in the negotiations has remained almost unchanged .
A Hamas delegation is currently in Cairo for talks with senior Egyptian officials on the matter .
Meanwhile , European sources told al - Manar , an independent Palestinian newspaper based in east Jerusalem , that a prisoner swap will be announced ahead of the high holidays .
According to the report , the German mediator who visited Israel and Egypt last week and met with Hamas representatives has managed to remove the last obstacles facing the deal .
The newspaper further said that Germany has helped find countries willing to accept the prisoners slated to be deported in the framework of the exchange .
Sources told the paper that Syria , Sudan and several European countries have agreed to host the freed prisoners for a period of one year , after which they will return to their homes .

Unemployment in the eurozone has risen by 3.17 million since June 2008 Eurozone unemployment hit 9.4 % in June - the highest in 10 years and another sign of the economic slowdown .
The number of jobless grew by 158,000 during the month , taking the total number of unemployed in the area using the euro to 14.9 million .
The figures came as separate data showed that inflation had declined more than expected in the eurozone in July .
Consumer prices in the 16 - nation area fell a record 0.6 % compared to a year earlier , according to Eurostat .
It was the second month in a row of falling prices following June 's decline of 0.1 % .

Lowest unemployment rate in the Netherlands : 3.3 % Highest unemployment rate in Spain : 18.1 % Overall eurozone youth unemployment ( under 25s ) : 19.5 % Lowest youth jobless rate in the Netherland : 6.3 % Highest youth jobless rate in Spain : 36.5 % " That is the lowest inflation rate for the 16 countries sharing the euro in more than 50 years , " said economist Martin Van Vliet of ING .
He said it should provide " a stark reminder " to the European Central Bank that inflation may fall further in the medium - term .
' Inflexible labour market '
As consumers lose their jobs and tighten their belts , this leads to lower spending .
To attract customers , retailers have been cutting prices further .
The European Central Bank predicts that consumer prices will decline for a few months due to the comparison with record high oil and food costs a year earlier .
Eurostat has calculated that 3.17 m people living in the eurozone have become unemployed since June 2008 , when the unemployment rate was 7.5 % .
Analyst Juergen Michels of Citigroup said : " We expect in the coming months to see further increases in unemployment and that is likely to have a negative effect on consumption . "
Spain was particularly badly hit with unemployment up 18.1 % in June , and a youth unemployment rate of 36.5 % .
Economist Jorg Radeke of the CEBR said the country was suffering from a " collapse in the construction sector and an inflexible labour market " .

To make matters infinitely worse , we are seeing tactics employed by our opponents nationwide that are utterly antithetical to the very concept of representative govt .
Shouting down someone who 's trying to describe what happened when a family member got cancer is not only incredibly bad manners , it 's an overt acknowledgement of the fact that you have no respect for the experiences or the views of your political opponents .
Add in the hangings in effigy , the Limbaugh Nazi allusions , and the " lynching " comment , and you begin to understand the depth of the depravity at work here .
How is our party " leadership " reacting to this low - intensity insurrection ?
Well , according to today 's NYT , they offer the following bon mot :
President Obama , underscoring his call for a bipartisan bill , invited a group of six negotiators on the Finance Committee — three Democrats and three Republicans — to meet with him at the White House on Thursday .
Even as debate begins to heat up around the country , that bipartisan group has continued to slog its way through complex sections of the bill .
Mr. Bayh said he was eager to see what the group put forward to bridge outstanding differences .
But he was pleased enough with what he heard at the Democratic caucus meeting on Wednesday that he chimed in with a rare comment , suggesting that many of the proposals could win the 60 votes typically needed to pass legislation in the Senate .
Bayh and his soulmate Sen.
Conrad offered more legislative wisdom :
" Let ’s not lose sight of the historic advancements that we all agree we can make , " he said , " starting with eliminating pre-existing conditions as a reason for people not getting insurance , no lifetime caps so if you get a catastrophic illness you are not going to lose your coverage . "
Mr. Bayh also cited an expansion of Medicaid , subsidies to help working families buy insurance , incentives for small businesses to provide insurance to employees and the closing of a gap in Medicare drug coverage — all of them provisions " I strongly support , " he said , " and you ’d get 60 votes for those right now . "
Lawmakers said Mr. Baucus and another Democratic negotiator on the Finance Committee , Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota , had told them that the Republican negotiators seemed sincere in seeking a deal .
W/ all due respect , Sen. Conrad , if you see " sincerity " on the GOP side , there are thousands of acres of Everglades not too far from me that you could probably buy for a bargain price .
W/ all due respect to Sen .
Bayh , if your goal is 60 votes , stop pretending that you have any interest in really reforming a thoroughly rotten and corrupt health care system .
You 'll save a whole lot of controversy , and you 'll save a whole lot of activists a whole lot of effort if you openly admit that all you want to do is to tinker around the edges .
The one positive I see about these events is that they 're making tinkering around the edges an increasingly less viable alternative .
In 1861 , Lincoln 's sole goal was the restoration of the antebellum status quo ante .
By 1863 , events had forced Lincoln to seek far more sweeping goals .
Perhaps events will similarly force Obama 's hand now .
When you keep extending an olive branch to people , and they continually reply by spitting in your face , at some point , you put the olive branch away .
It 's time to put the olive branch away here and start reminding the GOP that elections have consequences .
UPDATE -- I greatly appreciated the contributions below from those who addressed the reconciliation issue in some detail .
As I see it , we clearly have the necessary House votes , and the only remaining question is getting 60 votes to avoid a Senate filibuster .
Since we have ( in theory ) 60 Senate Dems , filibuster should n't be an issue .
If filibuster is a problem , it has an easy solution .
There are 2 current GOP senators who voted for the Stim .
They 're from the same small state , and 1 of them ( Snowe ) has expressed flexibility on the public option .
Meet w/ them privately , and offer them the sun , the moon and the stars for ME .
Give them roads , bridges , more ships to build at Bath Iron Works , whatever they want .
All you need to do is to cut a deal w/ 2 senators in order to guarantee passage of health care .
Instead , Baucus and Conrad are screwing around w/ Grassley and Enzi on a total fool 's errand .
Meanwhile , the teabaggers are derailing democracy and making the Dems look besieged and ineffective .
Sometimes , the stupidity of it all is appalling .
UPDATE 2-- Upon further reflection , tonight 's events make it clear that the issue has gone well beyond the success or failure of HCR .
What 's at stake now is the core concept of govt by the people , of the people , and for the people .
In 2000 , a vociferous minority , w/ the help of 5 Supremes , managed to steal a presidential election .
Now , an even more vociferous minority is trying to hijack the results of the 2008 election .
Obama obtained the highest popular vote total of any candidate in 20 years , and his party was swept in w/ commanding majorities in both houses .
The freepers and the teabaggers do n't care .
They openly challenge the legitimacy of Obama taking office .
They distort and dissemble about his legislative agenda .
They consciously choose to disrupt town meetings that are the essence of American democracy .
The main difference between the teabaggers now and the Confederates in the 1860s is that the teabaggers have yet to take up arms against a lawfully elected federal government .
If they 're not thwarted soon , they may cause incalculable damage to the body politic .

( Final )
My article here is the story leading up to and including FastFigures finance calculator ’s first month in the iTunes AppStore .
If you ’re not interested in the story , feel free to jump to my conclusions at the bottom .
Pre-Amble
We started developing FastFigures Financial Calculator for iPhone and iPod Touch in November of 2008 with a team of two people .
I developed the UI ; Rick developed the engine and back - end .
We spent some time through the summer reading and learning Objective - C ( which would have gone a lot faster if the NDA was n’t in place ) , but real development started in November after a contract job we were working on ended .
My intention was to develop an offline companion to our online version of FastFigures .
I started with a list of about 100 of my current customers that requested the product for iPhone .
By the time we shipped , that list grew to 250 .
I emailed with this community about every two weeks , soliciting feedback , getting input , learning how they have used our products so I could make FastFigures better than they expected and , hopefully , have a bunch of customers ready to go at launch .
Pre-Launch
In retrospect the smartest thing I did before launch was start a dialog with my customers .
As mentioned we had about 250 people requesting our products for iPhone .
This community gave me endless feedback regarding their most important calculator templates , the structure of the application and features that they needed to have .
My goal was to never accept just a feature request but instead to always ask why they wanted that feature as well .
In the process , I learned more in three months of development than I did in the first 12 years of running Infinity Softworks about my customers and how they use the product .
The second smartest thing I did was hire a designer .
Kelly Beile ( web site here ) did a tremendous job of adding a professional look to both the application and our web site .
This , I believe , is more important on iPhone that it has ever been on any other mobile device before .
One of the major pre-release issues was pricing .
We have demanded and received upwards of $ 50 to $ 150 for our applications in the past and price sensitivity tests had shown dropping the price did n’t increase sales significantly .
I knew we were going to have to re-think pricing for iPhone as $ 10 is considered expensive in the AppStore .
Again , we conducted a survey of these pre-release customers using a method perfected by Mark Paul at Synergy Consulting .
( While nothing replaces hiring him , his books are here and here . )
The price sensitivity data showed a starting price of $ 9.99 maximized revenue but I was concerned that these customers were too familiar with our products and would n’t represent the broader world of iPhone users .
After agonizing over this for over a week , I decided to adjust the pricing based on some additional factors and settled on $ 5.99 .
This decision is proving to be both a good one and a bad one , and I struggle with selling our applications so inexpensively to this day .
One mistake I did make in these early days was not spending enough time making sure the paperwork was in order .
This cost us two days in the end — two critical days when we would be high on the What ’s New list of applications .
Launch
As mentioned before , I planned on launching two versions of FastFigures , a web - based version called FastFigures Online and a version that runs without an Internet connection for iPhone and iPod Touch called FastFigures Mobile .
Each product would work for a wide variety of potential customers : real estate , finance , investing , science and engineering , math , medical and more .
I wrote the copy with our part - time marketer , Janet Lee Johnson based here in Portland , and got everything set up in the AppStore .
We submitted to Apple on February 13 , hoping for a February 18 release date but was rejected on February 17 with a very minor issue .
It went back into review that same day and Apple signed off on February 22 .
And this is where not understanding the process hurt us .
First , I did n’t realize that there was some additional paperwork that needed to be completed .
That was completed on the 23rd .
Then , once everything is signed off , it takes 24 hours to show up in the AppStore .
Finally on the 24th , I ’m looking for the application in What ’s New and ca n’t find it !
Panic struck until I went to the second page of applications and saw it listed as released on February 18 .
Apple launches your app on the earlier of their sign - off date ( Feb 22 in this case ) or our requested launch date ( Feb 18 ) .
I did n’t think to change the desired launch date , figuring the date would be the date it actually appeared in the Store .
Once I figured this out , I was able to adjust the date back to Feb 22 but by then it cost us two days of coverage on the front page of Apple ’s iTunes AppStore .
The good news was we had these 250 people ready to go ( not all of which purchased ) .
This got us off to a great start and gave us product reviews and sales we would n’t have had otherwise .
We started out at number 22 Top Paid Finance apps and stayed in the Top 25 for our first week .
But once sales slowed down , it became apparent quickly that we would not be found in the AppStore .
Adjustments needed to be made .
Month One
We were quickly learning that the noise level for iPhone applications was very loud .
Janet was doing outreach to iPhone bloggers and others .
We were n’t getting much of anywhere .
In the meantime , it was clear that if I did n’t fix our search issues in the AppStore , we would just disappear .
The free fall started the first week of March , just as we left the What ’s New listing .
On March 3 , we were at 30 in Top Paid Finance apps .
Four days later we were at # 40 ; two days after that # 45 .
We bottomed out at # 50 on the 14th of March .
I was also watching a few search terms .
For us , specifically , that was “ calculator ” , “ finance calculator ” , and “ financial calculator ” .
We did n’t show up for any of these terms on March 2 , when I made the first description change .
Realizing that we needed to be less generic in description and capability , I renamed the application to FastFigures Financial Calculator .
We showed up on all three the next day : # 59 , 19 and 6 , respectively .
A week later we had slipped to oblivion levels , however , at # 74 , 26 and 8 .
At this point , I changed the description again , to FastFigures Finance Calculator ( finance calculator is searched for in Google far more often than financial calculator ) , which caused us to disappear from “ calculator ” and “ financial calculator ” searches .
I made the last ( and final ) changes two days later , peppering the first description paragraph with the term “ financial calculator ” .
That finally did it , getting us back on the list for all three and starting to see a climb up the ranks .
The beauty of low sales numbers is that I felt more comfortable experimenting .
If we were doing great sales , I would have been hesitant to play with the search positions .
We bottomed out on March 14 , 1/3 of our original projections , and stayed close to this bottom per day until the 19th .
Meanwhile , those who purchased LOVED FastFigures .
We had great reviews .
On March 19 , we passed 20 reviews in the U.S. Store , receiving 18 - 5 stars , 2 - 4 stars and a 2 - star from reviewers .
Two things happened around March 19th that changed our fortunes .
For one , we hit that magical 20 review level I ’ve talked about before ( link ) .
Second , one of the products in the Finance category most similar to ours went free .
There has been a lot of discussion on the web about free applications versus paid applications and that the two customers are n’t the same .
And this competitive application proved that .
It did n’t take the developer long to realize he made a mistake , changed back to paid but disappeared from the Top Paid list , surfacing down in the 70s .
( He ’s since recovered and is back in the Top 20 but with a price at $.99 instead of $ 5.99 . )
Meanwhile , our sales started to grow .
Was it a better search position ?
The reviews ?
This other app disappearing ?
Increased sales increasing our Top Paid Finance App position that made us more findable and thus increased our sales ?
I have no idea which factor but the combination was working for us .
From March 19 to March 27 we quadrupled our daily sales and went from Top Paid Finance position # 40 to our highest position at # 18 .
Since then we have stayed between 20 and 23 Top Paid Finance Apps and our search positions kept getting better .
FastFigures Finance Calculator is now at # 25 for “ calculator ” , # 6 for “ finance calculator ” and # 4 for “ financial calculator ” .
Best yet , we seem to have leveled out at a new baseline for sales and can work to increase them from here with outreach to our potential vertical market customers in finance , investment , business and real estate .
Road Ahead
Obviously , we want to continue increasing sales as we are still 1/3 of breakeven .
I now have enough data to predict the unit sales for a particular position in the Top Paid Finance apps .
I can even tell what my competitors are selling every day .
I do know that my daily targets for FastFigures Finance Calculator are attainable .
I do feel hemmed in on price , though .
When I decided to release at $ 5.99 , Mark Paul advised me to release at $ 9.99 as the data indicated .
He argued that it would be hard to raise the price .
He ’s right but not for the reason he said .
Now that I ’m happy with our sales baseline , I do n’t want to raise the price because I ’m concerned about how it will negatively impact sales .
( Reports I ’ve read say any price increase will drop sales at least 25 % ) .
This issue — and the low AppStore prices in general — have forced me to re-think how we deliver the product .
I decided to keep the existing , low $ 5.99 price and offer additional capabilities and power user features a la carte .
A second change is that it has become clear that we needed to separate scientific from finance from medical versions of the product .
( My customers advised me of this , by the way , and I initially ignored them . )
It is just too hard to be found in the AppStore with a broad product .
So we ’ll go niche and give our customers an alternative way to get the all - inclusive calculator .
Conclusions
A few conclusions based on my first month in the AppStore :
Reviews :
If you do n’t have 20 people ready to buy and review when you launch in a single AppStore country , do n’t bother .
The reviews are critical to any application ’s success .

Professionalism : Having a professional design and web site help make the sale .
Also , producing a series of videos help make the case since there are no trial versions .

Monetizing :
Think more broadly about your application than just a single product .
Can you develop similar products that the same customers will need and connect them somehow ?
Can you sell add - ons ?

Saturation : The AppStore is saturated .
Getting press for your application is very hard .
There are very few instant - riches stories .
They are clearly the exception to the rule .

Niches : Focus on doing well with a single product in an individual AppStore category .
If you are making an application that appeals to students and to travelers , think about making it two apps : one that would do well in the Travel category and one that would do well in the Education category .
Some conclusions regarding Top Paid and Search :
Country - Specific : Top Paid and Search results are different for each country ’s AppStore .
: Top Paid and Search results are different for each country ’s AppStore .
Getting Sales :
When it comes to numbers , there are only three that will impact your customer ’s purchase decision : Top Paid position for your respective category , ranking for Search terms , and the number of reviews .
Figure out how to rank high in all three .

Top Paid Ranking : Top Paid position for a specific category is critical .
In the iTunes Store it ’s Top 20 ( and it ’s not obvious how to see more ) .
In the AppStore on the iPhone , it ’s Top 25 and easy to see another 25 .
If you are beyond 50 , you wo n’t be found at all .

Top Paid Position : I believe — but ca n’t confirm — that Top Paid is based on more than just raw numbers of sales in a given country ’s AppStore .
Clearly there are other factors at work and maybe based on some rolling average .

: Search positioning is based on some combination of number of reviews , review star ratings , sales and search terms .
Search Terms : Search is word - based .
The AppStore search does not know that “ finance ” and “ financial ” are the same .
Can you make money in the AppStore ?
Yes .
But the competition is fearce and it ’s very hard to differentiate your product from others .
My suggestion : Spend plenty of time up - front figuring out how to get above the noise with factors you can control .
There are an estimated 45 million users of Twitter
Social networking website Twitter has confirmed that it has closed a " significant round of funding " .
Co-founder Evan Williams said in a blog post that the site had secured money from five investment firms .
However , he did not confirm earlier reports that suggested the firm had managed to secure $ 100 million ( £ 62 m ) , which would value the firm at $ 1bn .
The site , which allows users to write and share 140 - character messages , has more than 45 million users worldwide .
The site had previously raised $ 35 m in February in a deal that valued the business then at $ 255 m .
" It was important to us that we find investment partners who share our vision for building a company of enduring value , " wrote Mr Williams .
" Twitter 's journey has just begun . "
Industry watchers have pointed out that the firm still has no way of making money .
However , earlier this month the site revised its terms and conditions to allow advertising on its service .
" We leave the door open for advertising .
We 'd like to keep our options open , " wrote co-founder Biz Stone in a blog .
The new funding has come from new investors Insight Venture Partners and T Rowe Price , as well as existing backers Institutional Venture Partners , Spark Capital and Benchmark Capital .
Bill - Population institute works with leadership groups to educate them and involve the in population issues .
Population in many ways is the unmentioned elephant in the living room of global sustainability issues .
The institute is there to remind people that 6.7 billion people growing to 9.2 billion people in a short 50 years is a huge factor in all of the issues that the planet is facing .
Ben -
How big really is the elephant ?
How fast is the world 's population expanding ?
Bill -
There are many ways to answer that question .
You can say one per cent .
People say one per cent does n't sound very much , I earn more than that on my money market funds .
On the other hand 1 per cent means the population 's doubling every 70 years .
When you have such a huge population : now four times what it was a century ago and it doubles in just 70 years the impact is huge in terms of planetary resources .
Population is a driver of almost everything else with regard to both environmental and food security and international security issues .
Ben -
What can be done about the rising rate of growing populations ?
Bill -
One of the key barriers to solving the population problem has to do with perceptions by people and information or misinformation that they may have .
For example , among the roughly 130 million couples who do n't want to have additional children and are not using contraception maybe 2 % give lack of access to services as their reason for non-use of contraception .
The primary reasons are they 've heard it 's dangerous , they 've no idea that having 10 children starting at age 15 is far more dangerous .
They also cite male opposition .
They think their husbands or partners oppose .
They think their religion is opposed .
It may come as a surprise to listeners but there 's no religion that is opposed to planning one 's family or to planning one 's life .
No religion is telling their followers to have more children than they can afford to feed or care for .
Religious opposition is something that people mistakenly believe is a factor and also fatalism .
Many women , when asked how many children they want , say , ' I want no more than I currently have because I can't feed the ones I have . '
Then they 're asked do you understand that because you 're not using family planning that you could become pregnant and have another child .
Then they 'll say , ' that 'll be ok because if that 's god 's will then that 's why I 'm here . '
It 's as if god , at the beginning of the universe , has decided how many children they 're going to have .
Changing those cultural and informational barriers to family planning use is critically important .
How do we do that ?
We 're role modelling small family norms , use of family planning , elevation of women 's status , daughter education and similar measures through long - running , serialised melodramas .
Let 's call them soap operas for social change .
These programmes , which will go on for months and years , can create characters who ultimately find their way to a new set of values , new behaviours .
They realise in front of massive audiences the benefits of those behaviours and they change social norms .
Among the roughly 50 % of married women in Ethiopia who are listening to one of our serial dramas there was a tripling of family planning use .
Similarly we measured a quadrupling of HIV testing in male listeners and a tripling among female listeners .
So these programmes can be very influential , particularly if they 're well - written , if they attract huge audiences episode after episode and follow the evolution of these characters , see the benefits for these characters and decide without ever being told what to do that indeed this is a strategy they should try .
Home / Tutorial 1 : Sort of sketch style rendering with nodes
Introduction
In this tutorial , we are going to make a black and white sketch style with shadows rendering without changing the materials of the scene .
This type of rendering is easy to do without the nodes changing the materials .
But I needed to do a realistic rendering and a sketch style rendering from the same scene .
To be clear , we are going to make the second image below from the first :
This tutorial needs Blender 2.43 .
We are not going to see very basic things , so you need at least some basic blender knowledge to make it .
Step 1 : the render layer for the edges
To see the edges in the rendering , you need to activate Edge in the render panel .
We can check too that Ray and Shadow are activated , as well as Do Composite ( for the rendering to use nodes ) .
Go now in the Render Layers panel , and you should have something like that :
Edges
single
Step 2 : First nodes
Open a Node Editor window and check the Composite Node ( the small face )
We will need the three very basic nodes for a beginning .
I will not explain here the basic usage of nodes , if you want to know more , you should find some other tutorials easily .
Spacebar , Add , Input , Render Layers : if this is your first node , congrats !
In this node ( marked as 1 in the screenshot below ) you can choose what render layer we will use .
Spacebar ,

Viewer :
Lets forget about nodes for a while .
If you know the edge settings , you can jump to Step 4 .
In the Output panel , with Edge Settings you can change the color and darkness ( Eint ) for the edges .
First image below has Eint set to 11 , the second to 255 :
Step
Lets make a second render layer " shadows " with the following settings :
We need to make ADD NEW , choose the name , check Solid ( to have shadows ) but nothing else .
We need to check Sha too , so that the shadows are rendered in a separate pass .
In the node editor , we add a new input render layer , we choose the render layer shadows and we can see another output for this node called shadow .
If you connect it to the viewer , you should have something like that :
Now we are going to mix the two render layers with a mix node ( Spacebar , Add , Color , Mix ) .
This node has two yellow inputs for our two render layers and one output we are going to connect to both viewer and composite node .
The default settings are Mix and Fac=0.5 , which are convenient here .
You can try other settings ( if you know The Gimp or the other one , you will understand easily how it works ) .
So at the end , we have something like that :
Conclusion
This is the end .
But you can continue with my other tutorial to see how to have this type of render :

Officials have confirmed a body was left to decompose for four days in Sydney 's Royal North Shore Hospital because a worker forgot about it and went home .
A hospital spokesman says a family had viewed the body in a room in the morgue complex at the hospital earlier this year .
But a worker responsible for returning the body to the morgue forgot to do so and went home .
The body was not discovered for four days .
The spokesman says the next - of - kin was told about the incident at the time .
He says " individual human error " was to blame and if correct procedures had been followed the incident would not have happened .
He says the worker involved has been counselled and policies have since been reviewed .
Earlier this month , security was upgraded at the morgue because of fears people could have accessed the area when doors were left unlocked .
The North Shore - Ryde Health Service said a security assessment of the morgue early this year did not identify any concerns .
The service 's general manager , Sue Shilbury , said there were no cases where bodies had been collected inappropriately or without paperwork being completed .
But she said automatic locks were being put on the doors .
" There possibly has been an occasion when the doors have been left unlocked and the staff have been spoken to about that , " she said at the time .
" We 're all human and we make mistakes but we 're moving to fit locks that do n't rely on an individual make sure that the doors are shut and locked securely . "
The state opposition 's Health spokeswoman Jillian Skinner says the morgue is clearly not being run properly .
" This morgue is obviously dysfunctional , " she said .
" With bodies being left and lost for four days it could not be described as anything else . "
While developing Windows 7 , Microsoft ran many different performance tests to make sure the operating system was an improvement over its predecessors .
One of the tests focused on upgrade performance : Microsoft wanted to make sure that an upgrade from Vista SP1 to Windows 7 was within a five percent threshold faster than an upgrade from Vista SP1 to Vista SP1 .
Microsoft gave three reasons for using the Vista SP1 to Vista SP1 upgrade as a baseline instead of Windows XP to Vista :
Windows XP is a vastly different operating system compared to Vista and an upgrade from Windows XP ->
Vista would not be a good comparison with Vista -> Windows 7
Windows XP did not support 64 - bit upgrades and we wanted to track 64 - bit upgrade performance as well as 32 - bit upgrades for Windows 7
Vista SP1 ->
Vista SP1 is a valid upgrade path that exercises all upgrade code ( this upgrade is commonly used by Product Support Services for a repair scenario )
The metric used was total upgrade time across different user profiles ( with different data set sizes and number of programs installed ) and different hardware profiles .
According to the test results that Chris Hernandez , a Microsoft Software Engineer , posted on his blog , Redmond managed to get the Windows 7 upgrade time to be faster or equal within the five percent threshold to the Vista SP1 upgrade time .
We 've summarized the Windows 7 upgrade time results in the table below ( check the above link for the exact hardware specs of the hardware profiles ) :
Data Profile Low End Hardware Mid End Hardware High End Hardware Clean
No data and 0 applications 32 - bit : 40 minutes
64 - bit : 50 minutes 32 - bit : 30 minutes
64 - bit : 35 minutes 32 - bit : 30 minutes
64 - bit : 35 minutes Medium User
70 Gb of data and 20 applications 32 - bit : 175 minutes
64 - bit : 185 minutes 32 - bit : 115 minutes
64 - bit : 95 minutes 32 - bit : 100 minutes
64 - bit : 85 minutes Heavy User
125 Gb of data and 40 applications 32 - bit : 345 minutes
64 - bit : 355 minutes 32 - bit : 185 minutes
64 - bit : 165 minutes 32 - bit : 160 minutes
64 - bit : 150 minutes Super User
650 Gb of data and 40 applications N/A 32 - bit : 1220 minutes
64 - bit : 675 minutes 32 - bit : 610 minutes
64 - bit : 480 minutes
The biggest thing that stands out about this chart is the very broad range of the upgrade time : from 30 minutes to 1,220 minutes .
That second extreme is not a typo : Microsoft really did time an upgrade that took 20 hours and 20 minutes .
That 's with 650 GB of data , 40 applications , on mid-end hardware , and during a 32 - bit upgrade .
We do n't even want to know how long it would take if Microsoft had bothered doing the same test with low - end hardware .
The other interesting point worth noting is that the 32 - bit upgrade is faster on a clean install than a 64 - bit upgrade , regardless of the hardware configuration , and is faster on low - end hardware , regardless of the Data Profile .
In the other six cases , the 64 - bit upgrade is faster than the 32 - bit ugprade .
We always recommend a clean installation over performing an upgrade installation .
It 's the best way to avoid lots of problems with a new operating system .
Now we 've got another reason to make the recommendation : in certain ( extreme ) cases it may just save you a ton of time , even if you have to back everything up and reinstall your applications .
Update
There 's been a lot of commotion about the mention of the upgrade from " Vista SP1 to Vista SP1 . "
This is not a typo : while it is obviously not something that is typically done , but it can be used as a repair method : the upgrade process reinstalls the operating system by replacing any corrupt and modified system files .
In this case , the method was used so as to have something to compare against in the benchmarking process .
The reason " Vista SP2 to Vista SP2 " was not used instead is simple : Vista SP2 was n't out yet when Windows 7 was in development .
Update 2
Hernandez commented on his own blog post explaining what we already guessed : the case scenario that took over 20 hours was n't meant to represent regular users .
Nevertheless , it 's good to hear it straight from the source :
" Freezing is easier than traditional canning , but do n't just start chucking plums into the freezer with reckless abandon . "
Get the Recipe Seriously Sick : Food For When You 're Under the Weather
Summer is on its way out the door and it's taking delicious fruits and vegetables with it .
Now 's the time to preserve the bounty from your garden or local farmers ' market , to keep you eating local during the tomato - less and berry - less days ahead .
Over the past couple of years , I 've fallen head - over - heels in love with canning .
I 've canned blackberry - ginger jam and sweet pickles , spicy tomato sauce and sour cherry preserves .
I 've got a shelf full of canning books , both new and old .
I 've taught others to can , and I even wrote a 50 - page senior essay on the history and significance of canning .
But somehow with all of my jamming , canning , and processing of jars , I totally missed the boat on the freezing method .
For me , the freezer has been always a place for storing quarts of homemade chicken stock ( when I do n't feel like cooking ) and applesauce , but not much else .
I do n't consider myself a frozen vegetable kind of girl .
But when my friend Ellie relayed stories of her freezer success , I realized it was time to give the ol ' icebox a second thought .
This summer , I 'll be freezing the last of the tomatoes , corn , and anything else I can get my hands on .
The freezing method is frugal , quick , safe , and easy .
Some tips , after the jump .
Low - acid foods such as corn and beans can't be canned in a water batter canner ( they require a steam - pressure canner ) so I usually forgo canning them .
But the freezer does n't discriminate .
All fruits and vegetables , no matter the acidity level , are welcome .
Freezing is much less time - consuming than using a boiling water bath ( big plus here , folks ) since you do n't have to stand over a boiling pot during the hottest days of summer .
In addition , freezing products at their peak means they 'll retain most vitamins and minerals .
Yes , freezing is easier than traditional canning , but do n't just start chucking plums into the freezer with reckless abandon .
Equipment
If you want to freeze in plastic baggies , use thick freezer bags , which are specially formulated to prevent dreaded freezer burn .
To avoid plastic , I freeze food in quart and pint - sized glass Ball canning jars when I can .
If you choose this route , make sure to leave room for expansion so you do n't end up with explosive glass all over the freezer .
Ball also makes special plastic freezer jars and lids free of the bisphenol - A ( BPA ) chemical .
Measure and Label
Think about how you 'll be using the food .
Think about quantities you 'll want .
Freeze in portions that will suit you and your family .
Label clearly .
What seems obvious now might be a mystery object in six months .
Buy Seasonal and Buy a Lot
Take advantage of bulk discounts .
Just because the farmer does n't have a sign saying so , does n't mean they wo n't give you a special deal if you buy a large quantity ( say eight dozen ears of corn ) .
It never hurts to ask .
Also , try tromping around the farmers ' market just before the end - of - day closing bell for good deals .
If farmers have any product left , they 'll want to get rid of it fast .
They do n't want to lug produce all the way back to the farm .
Be Picky
Freezing is n't going to improve the quality of what you 've got so do n't freeze anything that you would n't want to eat right now .
Select ripe , firm berries and wash them in cold water , discarding any bruised or rotting fruits .
Cook it Now
Instead of freezing pounds of tomatoes , cook them down into more manageable quarts of ready - to - go tomato sauce .
Whip up an extra - large batch of pesto , freeze individual portions in plastic ice cube trays or muffin tins , then transfer the cubes to a freezer bag .
Freezer jam is also a revelation .
It does n't get cooked down like the normal stuff , so it really tastes of fresh fruit .
Blanch and Cool. Repeat .
Freezing things raw wo n't result in a fresher final product either .
A quick dip in a hot boiling bath stops natural enzymes from leaving your veggies with an off - flavor , color , and texture .
Onions , green peppers , and berries are the only things that can skip the bath .
Do n't skip this step otherwise .
You can check with your local extension agency for a list of blanching times or The University of Missouri provides an excellent guide .
As soon as the blanching time is complete , plunge the vegetables into an ice water water to stop the cooking process .
If you are putting away large quantities of food , you may want to think about buying a large bag of ice .
You 'll be going through it quickly .
Freeze Before Freezing
Round up your cookie sheets and enlist them to help you in a new service .
I favor the tray - packing method because it keeps individual pieces loose , allowing you to pour only what you need from a package .
After the vegetables are blanched , cooled , and drained , spread them out in a single layer on the trays and freeze .
Leave in the freezer just long enough to freeze firm .
For larger fruits -- such as pears , peaches , and nectarines -- peel , pit , and slice the fruit and then freeze the individual slices on trays .
Vacuum Seal
It 's easy to find inexpensive vacuum sealers for home use , but you can still do a pretty good job without one .
Go low - tech : use a simple drinking straw to suck out any remaining air from plastic baggies .
Worked for me .
Eat It
Finally , just because you 've stocked your freezer full does n't mean you should just sit back and admire your handywork .
Eat it !
As a rule of thumb , aim to eat everything within six to ten months .
Besides , if you let too much time go by , the fresh , local stuff will be showing back up in the markets once again .

django - registration is a pluggable Django app that implements a common registration - activation flow .
This flow is quite similar to the password reset flow , but slightly simpler with only 3 views :
register registration_complete activate
The basic idea is that an anonymous user can create a new account , but cannot login until they activate their account by clicking a link they ’ll receive in an activation email .
It ’s a way to automatically verify that the new user has a valid email address , which is generally an acceptable proxy for proving that they ’re human .
Here ’s an Information Architecture diagram , again using jjg ’s visual vocabulary .
Here ’s a more in - depth walk - thru with our fictional user named Bob :
Bob encounters a section of the site that requires an account , and is redirected to the login page .
But Bob does not have an account , so he goes to the registration page where he fills out a registration form .
After submitting the registration form , Bob is taken to a page telling him that he needs to activate his account by clicking a link in an email that he should be receiving shortly .
Bob checks his email , finds the activation email , and clicks the activation link .
Bob is taken to a page that tells him his account is active , and he can now login .
As with password reset , I think the last step is unnecessary , and Bob should be automatically logged in when his account is activated .
But to do that , you ’ll have to write your own custom activate view .
Luckily , this is n’t very hard .
If you take a look at the code for registration .
views.activate , the core code is actually quite simple :
from registration .
models import RegistrationProfile def activate ( request , activation_key ) : user = RegistrationProfile.objects.activate_user(activation_key.lower ( ) ) if not user : # handle invalid activation key else : # do stuff with the user , such as automatically login , then redirect
The rest of the custom activate view is up to you .
By Farooq Tariq
On August 9 , 2009 , Tariq Mehmood , a human rights activists and general secretary of the Labour Party Pakistan ( LPP ) in the Toba Tek Singh district issued a press release to the journalists in Toba Tek Singh .
He alleged that eight Christian women were raped by Muslim fanatics in an attack on Korian village in Gojra Tehsil on July 28 attack .
He also alleged that 40 women are still missing and no clue is yet found about their whereabouts .
He condemned this atrocious and horrific act and demanded the government to probe the case .
More than 60 houses were burnt by fanatics in the village on the accusation of blasphemy .
This act led to another attack on Gojra Christian community and nine people were burnt alive .
On August 10 , a first investigation report ( FIR ) was registered by Gojra police and Tariq Mehmood was invited by police in Toba Tek Singh district for “ talks ” .
As he arrived , he was arrested .
Several serious charges have been issued against him including seven under the Anti-Terrorist Act and at least 13 charges under other laws .
He appeared in the court of an anti-terrorist judge in Faisalabad and police asked for his physical remand .
The judge denied physical remand and sent him to Toba Tek Singh jail on judicial remand .
The fact that a press release issued to journalists reached the police immediately has to be investigated yet .
Who is Tariq Mehmood ?
A young activist ( 24 years old ) from Basti Danishmandan village in Toba Tek Singh district , he has been active with the Labour Party Pakistan for five years .
He is also an official representative of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in the district .
He has been active in social and labour movements and has brought thousands of youth , brick kiln workers and public employees out on the streets of Toba Tek Singh on issues related to violations of human rights .
Tariq Mehmood has been helping cases in which women have been sexually assaulted , raped , tortured or been subject to violence after forced marriages .
He publicly condemned religious fanatics after they attacked the village of Ahmadies .
In fact , he and his comrades have been on the backbone of every battle involving the working class in the area .
He helped rebuild the movement of bhatta ( brick kiln ) workers and thousands have been on the streets demanding an end of bonded labour and the pershgi ( advance ) system .
He has helped the textile workers , shoe makers and public employees in their struggles for better lives .
This brave young man was followed by intelligence agencies and fanatics all the time .
Yet he refused to stop his activities in support of minorities and the working class .
Many fanatics termed him as Christian and not as a Muslim because of his consistent voice in their favour .
The Gojra incident
Tariq Mehmood and his comrades were first to arrive at the spot in village after the incident and gathered firsthand information .
He immediately issued a press release and condemned the action of Muslim fanatics .
He helped many journalists from outside the district to cover the story .
He also played an important role alongside with fellow LPP members and Christian youth leaders to blockade train service by bringing the seven bodies to demand a case be registered against the district police office ( DPO ) and district coordination officer ( DCO ) on August 2 .
This was international news as the protesters blocked the railway line for hours until the government was forced accept the demand .
In a very unusual act , the police registered a case against their top police and administrative officers on failing to protect the lives of the Christians .
The DCO and DPO were called back from duties and a judge of the Lahore High Court is now investigating the case .
The police and administration were looking an excuse to attack Tariq Mehmood and other LPP activists in the district .
Instead of looking into the allegations of rape and disappearance of Christian women , police arrested him on very serious charges that can lead to the death penalty .
The Labour Party Pakistan demands an immediate release of Tariq Mehmood and calls on the government to investigate the rapes and disappearances .
The LPP will not let this incident go unnoticed .
Please snd protest letters
We have launched an international campaign for the release of Tariq Mehmood .
Please sign the following and send it to the addresses below :
Subject : release Tariq Mehmood , a human rights activist in Toba Tek Singh
Honorable Prime Minister ,
Islamic Republic of Pakistan ,
Dear Sir ,
We wish to draw your attention to the illegal and totally unnecessary arrest of Tariq Mehmood , a well - known human rights activist and the general secretary the Labour Party Pakistan Toba Tek Singh district on August 11 , which is being commemorated as the Day of Minorities in Pakistan .
It is ironic to note that a staunch defender of the rights of minorities should have been arrested on a day officially dedicated to the rights of minorities , while the perpetrators of violence against innocent Christians of Gojra remain at large .
It is even more reprehensible that the Toba Tek Singh police have framed absurd charges of terrorist activities against a peaceful and conscientious activist who risked his life to defend poor victims of religious intolerance .
He has consistently highlighted the case of the brutal burning to death at Gojra .
He had also been demanding the arrest of those who were responsible for the killings .
On August 6 , he was targeted and threatened with dire consequences by a group of religious fundamentalist at a press conference in Toba Tek Singh .
Instead of protecting those who are in the forefront of a fight against religious extremism , the police are arresting them .
We demand Tariq Mehmood ’s immediate release and a probe into police behaviour that has led to an unnecessary arrest of a human rights activist .

Life on Mars theory goes up in a puff : Scientists find methane gas would make planet poisonous
The discovery of seasonal plumes of methane on Mars was embraced as evidence of life on the red planet .
With most of the methane on Earth produced by living organisms , the Nasa finding earlier this year was a tantalising sign we may not be alone in the universe .
But alas , it now seems it could actually be the opposite .
Are we alone ?
Scientists believed methane gas on Mars was proof of life on the planet - but now that theory could be wrong
French scientists say the methane means
Mars would be a very difficult place to live - even for the hardiest bacterial alien .
Their calculations suggest the methane in the plumes is being broken down extremely quickly , probably by aggressive chemicals on the planet 's surface .
Any living organisms would also fall foul of the ' chemical weapons ' , the journal Nature reports .
The researchers , from the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris , said : ' This would suggest an extraordinarily harsh environment for the survival of organics on the planet .
' This would leave little hope that life as we know it can exist at present or that evidence of past life can be preserved in the shallow surface layer . '
Dr Robert Massey , of the Royal Astronomical Society , said : ' The surface is very cold and the atmosphere , such as it is , is not only very thin but would be poisonous to us . '
But he added life could be hanging on below the surface .
' It is just possible that if you drilled down 10 or 20 or 100 metres , you would find it , ' Dr Massey said .
' If you want to settle the debate , it means sending probes , or ultimately , people , to the source of the methane to check it out .
' Everybody wants to know if there is life elsewhere in the Universe and finding life on Mars is a big start . '
Mark Sephton , a University College London scientist who is researching life detection instruments for a 2018 European robotic mission to Mars , said : ' I am one of those people who believes life is a natural consequence of the environment .
' I think there probably was something on Mars in the early days and we will hopefully find the remains of that life . '
Last month , Buzz Aldrin , said the Moon race was dead and Nasa should focus its energies on Mars instead .
The second man to walk on the Moon said : ' America helped to take the world to the moon 40 years ago and America certainly can help lead the world in the direction of Mars .
' All we need it determination , imagination and willingness . '
During a time of immense cannabis law reforms and major shifts in public opinion in favor of such , emerges now a throwback to the dark ages of America ’s war on some drugs from the 1980s : The Congressional Anti-Cannabis Caucus .
Escaping any real media attention last week was the formulation of a new anti-marijuana caucus in the House of Representatives .
As reported in Roll Call on July 13 , a press conference was held with former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert ( R- IL ) , Jason Chaffetz ( R - UT ) and Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) that seeks to re-commit the Congress to the status quo of ‘ fighting a war on drugs ’ .
The photograph displayed on Roll Call ( which is a subscription publication ) of the press conference prominently featured an anti-medical marijuana prop ( made from a shoe box ) .
Heard on the Hill : Issa clutched a prop , a box that represented a shipment of medical marijuana .
On the box was the handwritten phrase “ Medical Rx ” and a drawing of a pot leaf . …
The newly formed House Drug Task Force elected ardent anti-cannabis congressman John Mica ( R - FL ) , who , according to the Deseret News , complained that the Obama administration “ seeks to shut the war on drugs down . ”
And that , “ the record to date is dismal with the demotion of Drug Czar ’s office to a sub-Cabinet position , the announced support for needle exchange programs , the decriminalization of illegal narcotics and other measures that would weaken current national anti-drug efforts . ”
Deseret News reports that the task force–which currently only has Republican members –has four core initiatives : stopping drug use before it starts through education and community action ; healing drug users ; disrupting the narcotics market ; and stringent narcotics enforcement .
In other words , this ‘ new ’ anti-cannabis caucus would like to continue wasting taxpayers ’ money , keep twisting the Constitution into knots , and continue killing innocent bystanders and drug users –while at the same time –hypocritically supporting government regulatory schemes that allows for the production , sale and taxation of more dangerous and addictive drugs such as tobacco , alcohol and pharmaceuticals products .
The members of this new anti-cannabis caucus in the Congress are : Dan Burton ( R- IN ) , Jason Chaffetz ( R- UT ) , Darrell Issa ( R- CA ) , Jim Jordan ( R- OH ) , John Mica ( R- FL ) , Aaron Schock ( R- IL ) , Mark Souder ( R- IN ) and Michael Turner ( R - OH ) .
What ?
No Mark Kirk ( R - IL ) ?
Two relevant points : 1 ) As this so - called ‘ House task force ’ is only populated with Republicans , it is hardly a ‘ House ’ task force , and 2 ) back in the overzealous ‘ anti - drug ’ 1980s , there was a large , powerful and bi-partisan ‘ Select House Subcommittee On Narcotics ’ , chaired by uber - powerful Charles Rangel ( D - NY ) , and strongly supported by the Congressional Black Caucus ( CBC ) .
This committee dubiously helped champion the creation of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , Partnership for a Drug - America campaign , DARE program in public schools , civil forfeiture laws , mandatory minimum sentencing , mass drug testing in the workplace , etc … ..
Where is the CBC and Way and Means Committee Chairman Charlie Rangel these days on the so - called war on drugs ?
In general , Rep. Rangel and the CBC ( headed by Rep. Barbara Lee , D - CA , of Oakland ) no longer support ‘ warring on drugs ’ as much as they embrace the effective public health doctrine of ‘ harm reduction ’ .

ISLAMABAD : Pakistani authorities last night arrested pro-Taliban cleric Sufi Mohammad , who brokered a now - failed peace deal between the government and militants in the Swat Valley .
Mian Iftikhar , the Information Minister for the North West Frontier Province , said police arrested Mohammad in Peshawar for speaking against the government and encouraging violence and terrorism .
" Instead of keeping his promises by taking steps for the sake of peace , and speaking out against terrorism , he did not utter a single word against terrorists , " Mr Iftikhar said .
He said that the cleric 's stance " encouraged terrorism , it encouraged violence " .
The cleric negotiated a deal with the government in February that imposed shariah , or Islamic , law in Swat in exchange for an end to two years of fighting .
But it was widely seen as an acquiescence to Taliban control of the valley .
The deal collapsed in April when the Taliban advanced into neighbouring districts , triggering a military offensive that prompted a spree of retaliatory attacks by militants .
The military offensive in the Swat Valley and surrounding areas forced two million people to flee their homes and take refuge in camps or with relatives across the country .
In the past two weeks hundreds of thousands have been returning home as the offensive winds down , although sporadic fighting persists .
The cleric 's arrest followed that of a former MP and a suspected Taliban militant in connection with the beheading of Polish geologist Piotr Stanczak , kidnapped near the Afghan border last September .
Investigator Malik Tariq
Awan said the two were taken into custody a month ago .
He named one as Shah Abdul Aziz , a member of a pro-Taliban party who was elected to parliament 's lower house in 2002 .
Mr Awan said Aziz was believed to have plotted the abduction of Stanczak , who was taken while surveying oil and gas fields .
A video emerged in February of Stanczak 's beheading .
His remains were recovered and flown back to Poland in April .

We are in the midst of an explosion of knowledge about how the human mind and brain work -- how memory comes in many different types , each stored in a different part of the brain ; how our minds constantly process information outside our conscious awareness ; how differences in brain function help to define differences in our personalities .
A lot of this new knowledge raises provocative questions , not least about human nature .
But as disgruntled students have been saying for ages :
How are we ever going to use this stuff ?

Comedian Kathy Griffin sat down with Jimmy Kimmel last night on his late night show and told him about a new ' movie ' project that she has completed .
Entitled Kate is Enough , it is a parody of the mother of eight Kate Gosselin .
Griffin enlisted the help of actor George Takei to play the role of Jon Gosselin and child actors to play the children .
The spoof is a takeoff of the TLC reality show Jon & Kate Plus 8 .
Kathy sports a Kate wig and her character catches Jon red handed with a girlfriend .
View the Kimmel video below - which includes the Kate is Enough footage at the 3:20 mark on the video slider .
Mortgage equity withdrawals accounted for billions and billions of consumer spending in California this decade .
The home became a private ATM that seemed to pump money out every year like clockwork .
This was a win for the homeowner since they were able to spend beyond their wildest imagination and the state enjoyed those wonderful sales tax revenues while local agencies enjoyed the higher property tax rates .
As we all know , all of this was built on sand and now the state is grappling with a $ 26.3 billion deficit and issuing IOUs like Wimpy haggling for another hamburger .
The large problems we will face with option ARMs and Alt - A mortgages will kick the California housing market down once again .
But you will need to know where to look to see this crisis unfold .
If we look at the current decline , it would look something like this :
We ’ve seen countless charts and this one is n’t drawn to scale but simply highlights the next phase of the housing decline .
The surge occurred in every segment of housing ; low , medium , and high all soared to the stratosphere .
But since the bust , we have seen the low end take the brunt of the price decline while the mid to upper priced areas remain stubborn .
They have started to fall and with the Alt - A and option ARM tsunami coming online later this year we will see these segments begin to fall .
Just be warned that you will undoubtedly hear pundits say , “ the median price has gone up ” but in reality what is happening is higher priced homes instead of sitting with delusional sellers asking for yesteryear prices and not moving , will now be competing with a surge of foreclosures in these areas that will be sold by anxious lenders .
Today I want to focus on Culver City again because this is the next prime candidate area to take a major hit in the next cycle of the bursting bubble .
These are your mid to upper range areas but not enough to be called “ über prime ” like Bel Air or areas of Santa Monica .
Let us first look at an example home that is in pre-foreclosure and has already had a notice of default filed on it .
Today we salute you Culver City with our Real Home of Genius Award .
Culver City – The Home Equity Machine
The home we will be examining has a Zestimate of over $ 1 million .
To give you a sense of the area , the home on the left sold for $ 860,000 in 2004 ( 2 beds 3 baths ) and the home to the right sold for $ 385,000 in 1995 ( 3 beds 3 baths ) .
The home we are looking at has 3 beds and 3 baths but this home went through what we would call the mortgage equity withdrawal machine .
Now keep in mind all 3 homes have a square footage of 2,600 to 2,700 and this area looks planned so I would imagine many of these homes are built by the same builder .
To confirm , I look at the date built and find that all 3 homes were put up in 1980 .
In California , that is a fairly new home .
So that should put this home in context .
According to estimates , these would be $ 1 million homes .
But let us see why the Alt - A and option ARM issues are going to explode in these areas over the next few years .
The mortgages on this home tell us a story of an epic bubble .
IndyMac was sure busy in Southern California !
The home sold in 1998 for $ 500,000 and then was either transferred or sold in August of 2003 for $ 580,000 .
At least in this respect , IndyMac was n’t the biggest gambler on the list which is probably one of the few times you will ever hear that said .
But after that , the home equity withdrawal machine kicks it into the next gear .
Only 4 months after closing , Greenpoint Mortgage Funding issues a $ 122,000 mortgage on the place .
At this point , in a matter of months some $ 702,000 in mortgages are placed on this property .
We are now in 2006 .
The California housing market is burning at a fever pitch and anything and everything is rising in value .
So in March of 2006 , the borrowers on this place get a 1st mortgage of $ 735,000 and take out a second for $ 157,500 .
So simply adding up these two mortgages , the home would have a lower range value of $ 892,500 assuming they went with 100 percent financing .
This looks like an 80/20 situation but the numbers do n’t exactly add up .
Either way , this home went from $ 580,000 in 2003 to approximately $ 900,000 in 2006 .
This would mean that in 3 years this home went up $ 106,000 each year !
Why work when your home brings in six - figures for you just sitting in it ?
Well as we all know the bubble exploded .
The Zillow chart for this area shows exactly what I am talking about regarding the tiered housing crash :
For most of the bubble Los Angeles , Culver City , and this home all trended neatly together but once the bubble burst , we start seeing home price falls segmenting out .
Now this area is in a prime location but prime does n’t mean $ 1 million .
Going back to the loan history , we see that in April of 2009 a Notice of Default was filed on this home with $ 24,018 payments in arrears .
Now for this zip code in Culver City we find that the median home price is now at $ 637,000 a drop of 21 percent from a year ago .
Here ’s the thing , only 5 homes sold in May in this zip code and obviously the homes that did sell are at the lower range .
I looked in this immediate area and there is only one home for sale and it is a 4 bedroom with an asking price of $ 1.1 million .
Of course , it has only been on the list for 3 days .
As I have discussed the Notice of Defaults are surging in California and this will provide ample inventory in the mid to upper priced areas to depress home values :
This home is a perfect example of the mortgage equity withdrawal machine .
Let us assume they try to sell this home for $ 900,000 .
What would your mortgage look like ?
We should assume that you will have 20 percent to buy this place :
Down Payment : $ 180,000
Mortgage : $ 720,000
PI : $ 4,911 ( assuming 7.25 percent jumbo 30 year financing )
TI : $ 937
Monthly Payment : $ 5,848
Many of the government loan mods ( aka kicking the can down the road ) try to get the mortgage payment down to a 31 percent debt to income level .
So how much income would you need to purchase this home ?
If we use gross you would need : $ 18,864 / per month or $ 226,368 / per year
To stay relatively within safe prudent standards , you would need an income of $ 226,000 a year and this is assuming you are coming in with an $ 180,000 down payment .
The median family income in Culver City is $ 82,000 .
I dug deeper in the data and searched for this specific zip code and found that for 2006 some 8,035 tax returns were filed with an average adjusted gross income level of $ 73,694 .
However you slice the data , you will have a tiny number of buyers for this home depending on the price .
If the price were set at $ 900,000 you would need a household income of over $ 200,000 and this is only a 3 bedroom home .
This is n’t your prime Beverly Hills location or some home in Rancho Palos Verdes .
You do n’t need to be a rocket scientist to realize that prices are going to fall and fall hard in these areas .
Today we salute you Culver City with our Real Homes of Genius Award .

I WANT YOUR COUCH
IF ANYONE HAS AN UNWANTED COUCH I CAN COME GET IT .
WILL TRAVEL UP TO 20 MINUTES FROM CONSHOHOCKEN .
PLEASE SEND PICTURES .
THANKS
From Me to **********@*********.org :
Hi there !
You can have my couch if you are still looking for one .
Let me know !
You can either e-mail me or call me .
Mike
From Juan ********* to Me :
HI MIKE
I STILL NEED YOUR COUCH .
HOW BIG IS IT ?
DO YOU HAVE ANY PICTURES ?
WHY DO YOU NOT WANT IT ANY MORE ?
YOU DID NOT GIVE ME YOUR PHONE NUMBER SO I CANT CALL YOU .
From Me to Juan *********:
Juan ,
The couch can seat three normal people , or two fat people .
I do n't have any pictures because my camera is broken ( I did n't realize it was in the garbage disposal when I turned on the switch . )
I am getting rid of the couch because my grandfather passed away on it a few weeks ago .
Every time I look at it , I am reminded of it , and I would rather it not be in my apartment anymore .
Just give me a call and we can set up a time for you to come get it .
Mike
From Juan ********* to Me :
MIKE IS THE COUCH STILL IN GOOD CONDITION .
YOU STILL DID NOT GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER .
From Me to Juan *********:
Juan ,
The couch is still in very good condition .
There are only a few minor blemishes , but you can't really notice them .
There is a little bit of blood on the couch and a pool of blood on the middle cushion from when my grandfather shot himself .
I tried cleaning it with club soda , but it had really soaked into the fabric by the time I found him .
The blood dried though , and now it is kind of a brown - ish color that I think actually makes the couch look better .
It is a brown couch anyway so you can't even notice it .
Mike
From Juan ********* to Me :
NO THANKS
From Me to Juan *********:
Why not ?
I thought we had a deal .
Is it because of the blood ?
You can just turn the cushion over and nobody will have any idea .
From Juan ********* to Me :
THE COUCH IS COVERED IN BLOOD WHO WOULD WANT THAT ?
GROSS !
From Me to Juan *********:
Do n't put words in my mouth .
I never said it was covered in blood - it just has a little blood here and there .
I did forget to mention , I believe my grandfather defecated on the couch when he died ( the paramedics say it happens all the time . )
I cleaned most of that up , but once again the couch is brown so you wo n't even notice it .
And this probably is n't a big deal , but he also had a cigar in his mouth and when he died it set part of the couch on fire .
On the plus side , it did burn away some of the old urine stains that the couch had on it .
The couch no longer smells like urine .
It kind of smells like a barbecue , which is great if you love barbecues .
From Juan ********* to Me :
THAT COUCH IS FUCKED
THROW IT OUT !
From Me to Juan *********:
Why would you waste my time if you were n't going to take the couch ?
I 'm sick of having to deal with people like you .
I 'm just trying to get rid of a decent couch , for free , and still people are wasting my time .
From Juan ********* to Me :
IF YOU TOLD ME UP FRONT THAT SOME ONE DIED AND SHIT ALL OVER YUOR COUCH THAN I WOULNT HAVE WASTED ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME !!
DONT YOU SPIN THIS ON ME BY TELING ME THE COUCH LOOKS GOOD WITH BLOOD OR SMELLS LIKE A BBQ .
WHO THE FUCK WANTS A COUCCH THAT SMELLS LIKE BBQ IF I WANTED TO SMELL BBQ I WOULD BUY A FUCKING GRILL
From Me to Juan *********:
Would you be interested in the grill I am selling then ?
It is a CharCooker 500 and has three burners .
Two of them do n't work because my grandfather shot at the grill when he was drunk , but the middle burner still cooks food really well .
I 'm asking $ 400 for it , and for you , I 'll throw in a couch for free .
From Juan ********* to Me :
I DONT WANT YOUR USELESS SHIT GUY !!!!

Quotations
Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown , speaking at a news conference today , said investigators believe the La Brea fire was started by Mexican drug traffickers because of the size of the marijuana garden and the equipment found at the campsite where the fire began .
Brown stood in front of large poster showing the blackened campsite .
He said that 30,000 plants , ranging from 2 feet to 6 feet , were discovered at the remote pot farm .
Also found were stacks of propane tanks , melted irrigation tubing , empty canisters of fertilizer , mounds of trash , a torched cooking stove and a semiautomatic rifle .
The growers diverted a nearby stream and planted the garden on the side of a mountain .
The suspects apparently fled as firefighters approached the source of the fire and are still at large , Brown said .
He warned rural residents not to approach anyone leaving the forest .
[ Updated , 2:20 p.m. :
It 's been a record year of pot seizures for the U.S. Forest Service and sheriff 's department narcotics agents in Santa Barbara County .
So far they have pulled 225,058 plants , with a street value of about $ 675 million .
In late July , agents eradicated 113,000 plants in a camp not far from the one where the fire started . ]
Brown said it 's virtually impossible to get rid of all the marijuana grown in forests .
" The reality is that we could have an army out there and not be able to cover all of that ground , " he said .
Every year , smaller fires are doused that have been started by suspected drug traffickers in the forest , said Russ Arthur , a special agent with the U.S. Forest Service .
But the 90,000 - acre La Brea fire east of Santa Maria is the largest ever , he said .

Our " Indie Nation " series highlights kickass independent games .
Here is everything you need to know about Research and Development :
- You can download it here
- Despite being a mod , it is better than the entirety of Half - Life : Episode One and most of Half - Life 2 .
A puzzle - based mod where your character is never allowed to wield a gun , Research and Development has better level design and more imaginative situations than most first - person games I 've ever played .
You know those moments in really well - designed puzzle games like Braid or Portal where a solution reveals itself and you think , " wow -- how clever " ?
Research and Development has about a dozen of those .
It also combines action and puzzle - solving with remarkable dexterity , and is seldom frustrating throughout its 2 - 3 hour running time .
I know we 're only halfway through 2009 , but I would be extremely surprised if another mod came out this year that trumped Research and Development in terms of imaginative puzzles and exhilarating level design .
I mean , do n't get me wrong -- the Radiator series is truly fantastic if you 're in the mood for introspective examinations of the human condition , but Research and Development provides clever fun in a way very few games -- nevermind how many modifications -- are capable of .
Even if you do n't like the kind of games I normally suggest , I find it hard to believe you wo n't enjoy Research and Development .
Get it here , or hit the jump for more theories on why this mod is so goddamned good .
I have to admit : with very few exceptions ( the Antlion siege in Episode Two foremost amongst them ) , I really do n't care for the gunplay in the Half - Life games .
In this respect , R&D immediately endeared itself to me in refusing to give the player a gun .
It 's not that there 's no combat ; it's that the game focuses primarily on setting up terribly imaginative puzzles that just happen to revolve around killing large amounts of people .
At one point , for instance , you 'll come across a group of Combine fighting a bunch of zombies in a flooded generator room .
Rather than taking them on with a gravity gun ( since you do n't have one , at this point ) or running past them ( since the game will automatically kill you ) , you might notice a loose power cable connected to a generator , its other end caught on one of the generator 's many metal protrusions .
Grabbing the loose end of the cable , you lower it into the water .
Running back into another room , you hit a power switch -- and celebrate as everyone in the room , zombies and Combine alike , are fried by your violent ingenuity .
It 'd spoil the R&D 's charm to explain too many more of its puzzles ( even writing the previous paragraph made me feel a bit guilty ) , but suffice to say that if the dude behind this mod does n't get a job at Valve , I 'll be incredibly surprised .
The mod 's creator managed to take all the base mechanics found in Half - Life 2 and push them further and harder than I would have ever thought possible .
Just when you think you 've seen everything the game has to show you , it 'll throw out something entirely different that will almost make you wonder if you 're still playing the same mod .
Some unfortunate game - ending bugs aside ( typically doing with scripted events not going off when they ought to ) , I honestly have n't seen this level of polish and ingenuity in a mod since God knows how long .
Considering how long it lasts ( my first runthrough took me about two hours ) and how much variety the creator packs into every stage , I almost feel guilty playing this game for free .
Every subsequent level somehow manages to top the one preceding it ( save for a single , fucking irritating level near the game 's end involving a suspended bridge and a rotating cargo container ) , until the spectacular final levels .
Seriously , I dunno why you 're still reading this .

There ’s been some interesting thoughts floating around the internet about rural , tacit and generational knowledge that we as a species are losing .
It seems strange to think that we could lose knowledge , especially in today ’s world of information on demand , but if you think about it , certain skills and know how are hard to come by .
At the end of 2008 , over one half of the world ’s population lived in urban areas .
Urban lifestyles come with their own characteristics and culture and so do rural lifestyles .
Urban populations do n’t have ready access to many of the experiences as rural populations do .
General knowledge of where our food comes from for example , the simple act of gardening , knowing the planting seasons , identifying plants and knowing when to harvest ; having the understanding of why bees are important , is not something that city dwellers grow up experiencing and knowing .
Based on this , I consider myself very luck to have grown up in a semi-rural area .
I was close enough to a city but within easy distance to farms , lakes and rural towns .
I learned many things because of this , both craft related and non-craft related and continue to acquire various tactile knowledge ( err tacit , but I like tactile better ) and I hope to never stop .
There was always a sewing machine in my house growing up .
I learned basic sewing skills in middle and high school in my industrial arts classes .
I was so proud of the stuffed animal pig that I made .
I still have n’t progressed much beyond basic sewing but I ’ve owned my own sewing machine since college .
I learned basic crochet when I was very young , lost the technique , then recently picked it back up .
I learned basic knitting from my mother in my early twenties .
I then advanced my knowledge through the vast amount of knitting information found online .
I recently learned how to make butter .
Not by endlessly churning it by hand , but with my stand mixer .
I love to bake and my grandmother makes the best fudge and the best chocolate chip cookies .
I do not know how to make fudge , nor do I know the secret to her cookies .
I do know how to make a pretty mean pie crust .
This I attribute to my mother .
I think the point to all of this is that , yes some tacit knowledge is difficult to obtain .
But with the advent of the internet is is n’t impossible .
As long as we are sharing our knowledge and teaching each other , than these experiences wo n’t be lost .
Industrial arts classes should be reinstated into school curricula .
Stitch and bitch groups should be expanded .
Quilting bees should flourish .
So ask your mom or grandma how to do that double cross stitch trick .
Take some urban kids to the country and explore a farm .
I know I ’m going to ask my grandma about her cookies and thank my parents for teaching me how to fish .

KJ : When I was a teenager , my youngest brother had a lot of issues , and did n't go to school .
He could n't go outside , so he could n't have friends , so he was basically a prisoner in my mother 's house .
There was an upright piano there .
And occasionally , my brother , knowing zero -- meaning really zero -- about piano , would work out anger or frustration , which he must have had gobs of , by going to the keyboard and just playing some shit .
He did n't know what notes he was hitting or what would come out .
But I realized there were moments that were so good and they came from his ignorance .
I 'm not sure he even knew they were good moments .
But I found myself thinking : how would a pianist ever -- how do you approach that if you know the instrument ?
He also gave me a piece of new , unreleased music to play for you .
Find a good pair of headphones ...
In a world teeming with astonishing musicians , Jarrett stands out .
He is the rare artist who has managed to create something profoundly new .
After a number of influential years on the jazz scene , including a stint in Miles Davis 's band , Jarrett began in the 1970s to perform full - length solo piano concerts that were purely improvisational .
He would step out on stage to a lone piano and , with no preconceived notions , play more than an hour of mesmerizing new music constructed on the spot from elements of jazz , blues , classical , hymnals , and atonal syncopations .
His piano provided the percussion , the bass , the melody , and every other voicing .
A single extended piece could convey rage , hope , melancholy , and quiet awe .
He called these excursions " epic journeys into the unknown . "
They simply have to be listened - to to be believed .
( Recommendations below ) .
Even for those familiar with jazz or rock improvisation , Jarrett solo concerts were -- and still are -- quite unlike any other experience .
They are so spectacular that it's often difficult at first to accept that they are improvisations .
In our conversation the other day , Jarrett brought up this phenomenon of disbelief several times , with some amusement .
More and more people are hip to his work , he realizes .
But still , after more than thirty five years , he will occasionally be approached after a performance by a newish listener who declares , " I know which ones you improvised ! "
" What are you talking about ? " Jarrett will say .
" Well , you can't have improvised the things that start right on the melody and have a totally integral structure -- like that last piece had to have been written and structured that way because it 's too dramatically done .
It had structure and melody . "
" Sorry , " Jarrett says .
" That was improvised . "
This is one of the difficult paradoxes of superior achievement : brilliance breeds alienation .
Success and fame bring great satisfaction , but also the frustration of being misunderstood .
Risk - taking is central here -- central to the audience awe / disbelief , and central to the process itself .
Most great achievers have learned the value of taking great leaps in their work , being willing -- even eager -- to fail , and learn from that failure .
Jarrett , though , does all this in front of an audience .
His leaps are his art .
Strikingly , the whole process is still partly a mystery to him .
" I 'm somehow working with this unconscious process and then the conscious , " he told me .
" The composer David Chesky said to me one night , ' You 're out of control and in control and I do n't know anybody else [ who does that ] .
If I could do this , I would n't compose .
I would n't hand a bunch of strangers my work .
I would go to the piano and do what you 're doing . ' "
Testament .
The album itself features two concerts : Paris 's Salle Pleyel on November 26 , 2008 , and London 's Royal Festival Hall on December 1 , 2008 .
This is the second piece from the Paris concert .
It is 10:36 , and follows an opening piece of slightly longer length .
( The selection is my choice , and was made both because it conveys many elements that I find particularly moving about Jarrett 's work and also because virtually every other piece from both concerts is much more difficult to appreciate out of the context of the whole performance .
This is not the most daring or even impressive piece on the album , but in this separated context , it may be the most moving , particularly to people unfamiliar with his work . )
Here 's a gorgeous sample of Jarrett 's live solo work , from his forthcoming 2 - concert , 3 - CD album .

( I am grateful to publicist Tina Pelikan , manager Steve Cloud ,
producer Manfred Eicher , and of course to Jarrett himself for
permission to do this -- something they have never before granted ) .
In our conversation , we spent a fair amount of time discussing the mindset that drives his improvisations .
It is rooted , of course , in a certain amount of confidence that his years of playing , practice , and listening have given him the tools to pull it off .
Beyond that , though , Jarrett emphasizes , paradoxically , how critical it is to clear his mind and set himself free from his own knowledge and habits .
Jarrett says :
How do you find these surprising combinations ... if you have perfect pitch and you know what everything 's going to sound like ?
How do you get past your own [ understanding ] ?
Those are barriers .
Perfect pitch would lead you to know exactly what it 's going to sound like before you 're going to play it .
So one of the things I do now as part of the risk - taking and have been doing more since Radiance [ 2005 album ] is not to play something .
If my hands are in a certain position at the keyboard , I do n't play in that position -- especially if I 've already thought about what that sound is going to be .
I just move my hand [ away ] and say : " Do something . "
This is an astonishing notion : that , in order to tap into your most provocative creative possibilities , you need to not do what comes natural , not do what is most instinctive and habitual .
Much more from my interview with Keith Jarrett coming soon ...

I had the privilege of visiting the nonpareil musician Keith Jarrett the other day at his woodsy lakeside compound in rural New Jersey .
As he enjoyed some downtime in advance of an October European tour , Jarrett made room to talk in his home studio about talent , improvisation , and his evolving relationship with his audience .
One year after it opened an incubator in San Francisco that offers free space to selected entrepreneurs , Polaris Venture Partners is bringing the concept to Cambridge .
The Waltham VC firm is formally announcing Dog Patch Labs Cambridge tonight at a special event at Fenway Parks EMC Club  which will also mark the successful IPO this summer of LogMeIn , a Polaris - backed start - up .
The San Francisco version of Dog Patch ( located at Pier 38 on that city 's waterfront , left ) was the brainchild of Mike Hirshland , a Polaris partner based in Waltham who focuses primarily on digital media companies .
Hirshland describes it as a frat house for geeks  that offers free desks , connectivity , coffee , and grub to entrepreneurs that the firm dubs interesting .
Unlike a traditional incubator , theres no formal agreement that gives Polaris equity , or even a right - of - first - refusal on investing in any companies hatched at Dog Patch .
But Polaris has put money into two West Coast ventures thus far : Thing Labs ( formerly Plinky ) and LOLapps .
Dog Patch Cambridge will be co-located with Allurent , a Polaris company that works on improving the e-commerce experience .
Hirshland explains that the Lab will be a venue for dinners , brown bag lunch talks , workshops , and conferences - and itll also serve as a hang - out for Polaris partners visiting the big city from their usual perch atop Mount Money in Waltham .
Part of Hirshlands plan is to create a bit of an exchange program between the Cambridge and San Francisco labs , so that entrepreneurs and Dog Patch Fellows ( friends of the labs who may be experts on some topic , or more experienced entrepreneurs ) can hop back and forth .
" The objective is to foster a vibrant community of entrepreneurs , " Hirshland writes in an e-mail .
" What we have to gain is being deeply immersed and engaged in the very early stage entrepreneurial ecosystem -- which we see as just an extension of what we are already doing every day ... "
Hirshland explains that Polaris does n't " see [ Dog Patch Labs ] as a feeder system for Polaris investments -- though as it has worked out in SF that has been a nice side benefit . "

Lazy veggies
In the gardens of paradise , all the vegetables would be perennial .
No endless replanting .
Just keep picking year after year .
Like fruits and nuts .
On earth there are more of these heavenly plants than you might think .
This book rounds ‘ em up , with terrifically informative summaries , clear photos , and useful hints .
A few of these recurring veggies are familiar — asparagus , rhubarb , artichokes — but most are exotics , so eating / cooking suggestions are given as well .
I am a lazy gardener who favors perennials in our landscape garden , so I am inclined to be lazy in the food garden as well .
But besides laziness , this is a great culinary adventure — all kinds of Andean root crops I ’ve never hear of , and bean trees , and bush spinach — oh my !
One hundred new friends .
As a bonus the author takes the long - view and makes suggestions about promising varieties that amateurs could breed into better perennials .
This is a fabulous book .

Excerpt
Malabar spinach is a climbing leaf crop that makes a beautiful ornamental .
*
One of the moments that really changed my life in terms of understanding the potential of perennial vegetables was the day I grazed on the leaves of this beautiful shrub at Plants for a Future ( PFAF ) in Cornwall , England .
To see a hedge of this beautiful silvery gray shrub producing copious quantities of edible greens virtually year - round , and to just stand there and stuff the tasty , salty leaves into my mouth , was a remarkable experience .
The author grazing on saltbrush as PFAF in England in 1997 .
It was hard to tear me away from that salty spinach : like pretzels in a shrub !
*
Every spring on the East Coast , from New England to New Brunswick , foragers go hunting along riverbanks and in floodplain forests for the shoots of this native fern , known as fiddleheads because their spiral shape looks like the head of a violin .
These foragers harvest large quantities to sell to restaurants and supermarkets , where they bring a good price .
Strangely , while many people grow this fern as an ornamental few home gardeners seem to grown it for fiddleheads .
In the wild , ostrich fern is found primarily in floodplain forests and riverbanks , but under cultivation it succeeds in a variety of moist , shady conditions .
Fiddleheads emerging in spring .
*
This crop , virtually unknown in the United States and Canada , is second in importance only to potatoes across vast areas of the South American high - lands .
It has become a commercial crop in New Zealand and has the potential to become a much more important crop worldwide .
In gardens oca can provide high yields in tiny spaces .
Oca 's beautiful tubers are shaped like fingerling potatoes and come in bright colors like yellow , orange , red , and purple .
They have a crisp , moist , waxy texture , and unlike many root crops make a sweet and tart , almost candy - like snack raw .
Flavor varies dramatically among varieties .
The varieties I have tested were mild , sweet , and tart when eaten raw , like a good star fruit .
When baked they lived up to their reputation of tasting like potatoes with sour cream already added .
Oca tubers come in many beautiful colors and have a delicious sweet , tart flavor .

Drawbacks of Perennial Vegetables
* Some perennial vegetables are slow to establish and may require several years of growth to begin yielding well .
Asparagus is a classic example .
* Like annual crops , some perennial greens become bitter once they flower .
Thus their greens are available only early in the season .
Perennial vegetables are not meant to replace annuals , but to complement them .
In this case , perennial greens are available early in the season , providing greens until the annuals are up and running .
* Many of the minor perennial vegetables have rather strong favors , especially those adapted to cold climates .
* Many perennial vegetables are so low - maintenance that they can become weeds in your garden , or escape and naturalize in your neighborhood .
Luis Granados , director of the AHA ’s publishing house , Humanist Press , responds to the Catholic bishops ’
Fortnight for Freedom , a 14 - day campaign which , according to the Washington Post , “ purports to champion religious freedom , but in actuality distorts it by promoting the use of religion as a license to discriminate . ”
Religious Privilege # 9 : The War on Contraception
The biggest impetus behind the “ Fortnight for Freedom ” which ends today is the bishops ’ opposition to the requirement that health insurers include contraceptive coverage as a standard part of their packages , thus indirectly resulting in those who oppose contraception helping to pay the bill for those who choose to use it .
The bishops ’ crocodile tears over “ freedom of conscience ” with regard to contraception are a canard .
History shows that whenever the church has had the political power to do so , it has gotten governments to legally ban the use of contraceptives , for everyone , individual conscience be damned .
This happened in a number of American states prior to the Griswold case in 1965 , and in countries like Ireland and Spain deep into the 1970s .
Only now that the church is on the back foot does it start whimpering about “ freedom of conscience . ”
I help pay for a lot of things I do n’t approve of .
Ethanol subsidies .
The war in Afghanistan .
An embassy in the Vatican .
Weapons for Israel .
Your list is probably different , but I ’m sure there are a lot of things you help pay for that you do n’t approve of , either .
Neither of us like it , but we know we ’re part of a bigger group , and it ’s not possible to make everybody in the group happy all the time .
So we do n’t demand special treatment , or an individual reduction in our tax payments for programs we oppose because we know government could n’t function if everyone paid only for the things they like .
No one is requiring any Catholic to use contraceptives .
The church has every right to argue that contraception is immoral and to urge people to repudiate it in their own personal lives .
No one is trying to suppress the church ’s right to make its case .
But when the church demands and receives special privileges – one law for the church , and a different law for everyone else – that ’s another matter .
The furor over the church - related organization mandate obscures the real scandal here , which is that churches themselves , along with other employers whose primary purpose is to espouse religious doctrine , are already exempt from the requirement to provide their employees with healthcare coverage that includes contraception .
This affects tens of thousands of people , the vast majority of whom have no moral objection to the practice .
One of the biggest arguments the bishops are making is that it ’s wrong for government to be drawing that kind of fuzzy line , to provide one set of health insurance rules for a church - sponsored seminary and a different set of rules for a church - sponsored medical school .
They ’re absolutely right : there ought to be one set of simple rules for everyone to follow .
And if the democratic process results in contraception or any other form of medical treatment being part of those rules , then it ’s the civic duty of the church to make the same payments everyone else has to make , and the civic right of the church to proclaim its view on the morality of actual use of the various treatments being offered .

The flap between Google and Apple over the latter 's rejection of the Google Voice application for the App Store has devolved to the point where the FCC has started poking around .
I 've been asking myself exactly why Apple or AT&T would stir up the hornet 's nest to deny the technology and risk the ire of both the government and one of their most valuable partners , and also why each company 's stance is full of contradictory actions .
After a little reflection , the answer became resoundingly clear : Apple is building a similar service to add to MobileMe .
First , let 's look at exactly what Google Voice - formerly known as GrandCentral - currently is and is not .
As currently constructed , Google Voice is a VOIP - enabled relay point and voice mailbox , providing one - number accessibility to numerous phones .
Google gives you a phone number , which can be configured to forward calls to any other number you want .
Put in your home , office and mobile numbers , and Google Voice will ring incoming calls through to all of them simultaneously to find you .
If you do n't pick up , Google Voice takes a voice message , which can be transcribed into text automatically and sent to you via SMS or e-mail .
Or , you can listen to the message by logging into the Website or clicking a link in the e-mail .
You can also dial out via Google Voice , designating the phone on which you will take the call , in addition to the number you wish to dial .
So Google Voice is not a VOIP client in the traditional sense , unlike Skype or Gizmo .
Because Google Voice forwards calls everywhere , the service will use VOIP to route calls around Google 's network , but all calls will hop off to the PSTN or cell networks to find the callers at the designated endpoints .
Certainly this could remove some calls from a mobile operator 's billing purview and could definitely impact usage of its voicemail system , but really it depends on what the user sets and where they pick up .
AT&T has been the logical scapegoat in the App Store rejection , and surely over time the inclusion of the application on the iPhone could eventually lead to a reduction in minutes used by AT&T 's customers .
But while AT&T may have voiced some displeasure to Apple over the application , the service provider has done nothing to remove vestiges of the application from the rest of its network - it has n't denied the application from other devices ( BlackBerrys ) , nor has it blocked access to the Google Voice Web application .
As longtime GrandCentral users may know , the old Website was barely operational in mobile browsers as it was primarily Flash - based .
Mobile users could not check their messages on the Web page , and iPhone users could not simply download a voice recording , as the iPhone did n't support that functionality .
However , since Google Voice appeared this spring , the Website works just fine through the iPhone 's browser .
Users can check messages , change settings or initiate calls .
An on - device application would certainly make the experience cleaner and easier , and provide integration into the phone 's contact database , but is absolutely not required for Google Voice mobile operation .
But , really , if it was solely AT&T looking to block Google Voice 's entry into the App Store , could n't Apple simply certify the application for international markets but not release it in the U.S. store ?
There have been plenty of instances in which Apple has certified applications in the United States but not made them available internationally .
( Skype in Canada , anyone ? )
Surely Apple could do the reverse , if it was interested .
Instead , Apple rejected Google Voice outright , under the " Conflicts with existing services " blanket rejection , without specifying exactly where the conflict is .
As we 've seen in the past ( with the Podcaster application and with NullRiver 's tethering application , NetShare ) , Apple feels free to use this excuse even if it does n't actually offer a comparable service at the time of rejection .
In hindsight in both of these cases , the conflicting features were in development at Apple at the time of rejection .
Podcast downloading was added last November in iPhone OS 2.2 , while tethering was added this summer in the 3.0 update , even if AT&T has not yet chosen to light up the feature domestically - in both cases , well after Apple 's initial rejection .
Given that history , I think we can assume Apple is truly the primary culprit in the rejection of both Google Voice and associated third - party tools ( GV Mobile ) because it is building out its own one - number solution .
I , for one , think that Apple was planning just such announcement for early next year , before the current brouhaha arose .
Let 's face it : Right now , MobileMe is really boring and expensive , providing limited storage and duplicate communications services that many get elsewhere for free , despite the introduction of new Find My iPhone feature .
One - number portability would greatly enhance the value and usability of MobileMe - as well as its viability in the marketplace .
And since the market is still very young ( Google Voice is available by invite only ) , Apple could quickly gain a sizable piece of market share if it could attract the still - burgeoning iPhone audience into the fold .
But first , Apple has to do a little of something it does best - stifle competition within its ecosystem .

Volgens een gespecialiseerde Chinese studie zou China met een beperkingspolitiek de uitlaatgassen kunnen verminderen vanaf 2020 om een piek te bereiken in 2030 .
Als Peking dit kan bereiken , kan de CO² - uitstoot van fossiele brandstoffen tegen 2050 vallen tot op het niveau van 2005 .
Het betreft een rapport van 900 bladzijden van de ‘ 2050 - commissie voor Energie en CO²-emissie ’ .
De commissie roept op om duidelijke doelstellingen te formuleren aangaande de uitstoot van broeikasgassen .
Vorig jaar werd China de grootste producent van dergelijke gassen in absolute cijfers ( maar niet per hoofd ) .
China wil een actieve rol spelen bij het opstellen van een nieuw klimaatverdrag in Kopenhagen en vindt dat de ontwikkelde landen eerst met beperkingen moeten komen omdat zij al langer vervuilen .
Volgens het verdrag van Kyoto , dat in 2012 afloopt , is China niet onderhevig aan kwantitatieve beperkingen .
China ’s onderhandelaar
Yu Qingtai zei eerder deze maand dat zijn regering de aangroei van broeikasgassen zo vlug mogelijk wil beperken , maar dat de uitroeiing van de armoede prioritair is .
Vorige week zei het kabinet dat het van de controle van de emissies een onderdeel wil maken van de algemene planning .
Als China geen maatregelen zou treffen , zou de uitstoot van steenkool reeds in 2040 pieken op 3,5 miljard ton per jaar , aldus de studie .
Met passende maatregelen kan dit gereduceerd worden tot 2,2 miljard ton in 2030 en vallen tot 1,4 miljard ton in 2050 .
Toevallig of niet komt een studie van het Amerikaans ministerie van energie tot de bevinding dat het aantal dagen lichte regenval tussen 1956 en 2005 daalde met 23 % door de luchtvervuiling in China .
Het Chinees ministerie van Landbouw maakte dit weekend van zijn kant bekend dat in de noordoostelijke provincies 2,5 miljoen ha ernstig te kampen hebben met droogte die de oogst in gevaar dreigt te brengen .

XIADIAN , China | Located just downstream from three steel factories , a paper mill and a bone - processing plant , the citizens of Xiadian have grown used to seeing the Baoqiu River turn red , yellow and sometimes white from what they say is untreated industrial wastewater .
The town also has seen at least 50 of its 3,000 residents die of cancer in the past five years ; an unknown number of others are being treated for cancer or other pollution - related diseases .
“ People get cancer and die ; there ’s not much to do about it .
There ’s not much to hope for , ” said Mrs. Zuo , a 24 - year - old restaurant worker who asked that she be identified by only her last name .
Although she ’s been married for almost a year , Mrs. Zuo said she does not want to have children - at least until she can save enough money to move away from the town about 40 miles southeast of Beijing .
“ Many people want to move out of the village , but they do n’t have the money to , ” she said .
Xiadian is one of dozens of places in China that local media have dubbed “ cancer villages . ”
Cancers of the liver , stomach and lung and leukemia are all showing up in these villages at rates environmental activists say are above average .
The situation brings into sharp focus the problems of rural communities where environmental protection is less stringent than in major cities such as Beijing .
After years of heavy pollution , the big cities are increasingly pushing their heavy industry to rural areas and away from their more middle - class and environmentally conscious residents .
In Xiadian , Ms. Sun , a shopkeeper who provided only one name , said she knows at least five people who have died of cancer in the past few years , as well as an 18 - year - old boy who is battling leukemia .
“ Yes , I ’m worried about my health , ” said Ms. Sun , 61 .
“ We only realized there was a problem in the past three or four years .
People began dying ; they would die only a few months after getting cancer and could n’t be cured . ”
Ms. Sun said the locals stopped drinking the well water about a year ago , and they no longer use the water for their animals or crops .
Drinking water is now pumped in from the neighboring county of Dacheng , and the villagers are given free health checkups once a year .
One man said that being diagnosed with cancer is a source of shame , so patients and their families choose not to talk about it .
A lot of the young people already have left the village , he said , leaving the poorer and older villagers behind .
At the local medical clinic , the one doctor on duty refused to speak about the pollution problems or cancer rates , saying he had only recently come back to the village .
Acknowledging the problems , China ’s Ministry of Environmental Protection said last month that it would release $ 134 million from a special fund to help build wastewater and sewage treatment facilities and ensure safe drinking water in villages throughout the country .
In June 2008 , the ministry said half of China ’s 800 million rural population did not have access to safe drinking water .
Officials said that while the water - quality situation had improved slightly over the past year , the situation still remained “ grave . ”
According to Wang Weiping , a leading specialist on waste in China , at least one - third of China ’s 663 cities do not have centralized garbage - disposal facilities to treat solid waste .
Ms. Sun said the local government also has been urging people to sell their land to developers and move away .
Mrs. Zuo said she knew of at least seven families that have left the village , but that where she lives no developers are trying to buy land .
When people call the local environmental department to report pollution problems , the factories only close down for a few days before starting up again , she said .
People got tired of calling , she said , because nothing would really change .
Song Jiebin , a legal specialist at the All - China Environment Federation , said there has been some improvement in the quality of the air , which keeps most residents inside their homes on hot summer days .
“ At least now they can open their windows in the evening , ” he said .
“ Before it smelled so bad , people did n’t dare open the windows . ”
Mr. Song said it was hard to persuade local officials to take a tougher environmental stance if it might harm the local economy .
“ Some officials pursue rapid economic growth at the cost of environmental degradation , ” he said .
“ Others pay much more attention to local environment , so there are different conditions all across China .
I think the most important is to make the local officials realize the importance of the environment , because they are the closest to local people . ”
Feng Jun , a Xiadian resident , filed a lawsuit against the main steel factory in 2008 , but did not win .
Mr. Feng had been trying to get compensation for the almost $ 88,000 in medical bills he and his family had to pay when both of his daughters were diagnosed with leukemia in 2006 .
His 16 - year - old daughter died about a year later ; the other girl survived and is now 13 .
Mr. Song said such lawsuits usually fail because it is very difficult to prove a direct link between the pollution and the cancer rate .
“ As far as I know , there is no testing institution that can definitively give the truth , so there are always ambiguous conclusions in the testing reports that ca n’t be used in a lawsuit , ” he said .

I started doing some concepts for fun based upon Valve ’s Team Fortress 2 game characters .
There seems to be some debate on the Valve forums about the validity or plausibility of female models for the game .
So , I just started messing with the idea to show that it was possible .
Just fun … but I have n’t drawn or posted anything here in such a long time I figured this would be a good task to pursue .
I ’ll try to get all 9 classes drawn and colored here .
Or maybe not .
The one key aspect of these designs is that they adhere to the male counterpart ’s basic body silhouette so that they are identifiable as the classes that they represent .
Also , the arguement ( on the Valve forum ) is that hitboxes would be smaller giving an unfair advantage to the players who select the female models .
I say , “ nay ! ” and hopefully these designs are convincing of that position .
Anyhoo … here ’s what I propose the TF2 Nurse would look like .
Enjoy !
( CNN ) --
In the seven weeks since the military - backed bloodless coup in Honduras , several hundred people protesting against the de facto government have been arbitrarily arrested and beaten by government forces , a new Amnesty International report says .
The marks of a police truncheon are shown on a student 's back after a protest , Amnesty International says .
The report , released Wednesday , said the beatings were meant to punish those who opposed the ouster of President Manuel Zelaya in June .
It includes testimony from , and photographs of , several people who were baton - whipped and detained by police officers who sometimes wore no visible identification and hid their faces behind bandanas as they broke up demonstrations .
" They beat us if we raised our heads ; they beat us when they were getting us into the police cars , " said a student whom Amnesty International interviewed in late July at the police station where he was being detained .
" They said , ' Cry and we 'll stop . ' "
Multiple requests to the government for comment went unanswered .
The government has said in the past that the demonstrators were arrested for engaging in violence and provoking authorities .
The Honduran political crisis stems from Zelaya 's defiant push to hold a referendum that could have led to extending term limits by changing the constitution .
The country 's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal .

He was ousted in a coup on June 28 .
The congress named Roberto Micheletti provisional president shortly after the military detained Zelaya and sent him into exile .
Micheletti and his supporters deny that a coup took place , calling the action a constitutional transfer of power .
The coup resulted in unrest throughout the country , with frequent clashes between police and military on one side and civilian protesters on the other .
At least two people were shot to death , Amnesty said .
Among several examples , the Amnesty report quotes F.M. , a 52 - year - old teacher , who said he was demonstrating peacefully when police descended on the rally .
" They grabbed me and shouted , ' Why do you ( all ) support Zelaya 's government ? '
They beat me .
I have not been informed as to why I am detained . "
He showed deep - red imprints on his back , which he said were from a beating with a baton .
" Detention and ill treatment of protesters are being employed as a form of punishment for those openly opposing the de facto government and also as a deterrent for those contemplating taking to the streets to peacefully show their discontent with the political turmoil the country is experiencing , " said Esther Major , Amnesty 's Central America researcher .

A tsunami warning was issued for New Zealand and other small Pacific islands after a major 7.9 magnitude quake struck in the ocean off American Samoa , U.S. government agencies said on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Graphics
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A tsunami warning was issued for New Zealand and other small Pacific islands after a major 7.9 magnitude quake struck in the ocean off American Samoa , U.S. government agencies said on Tuesday .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center , a branch of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , issued the warning after the quake hit about 120 miles southwest of the remote Pacific island of American Samoa .
It struck at a depth of 20.5 miles .
A tsunami watch was in effect for Hawaii , Papua New Guinea and other small Pacific islands .
The agency noted that its warning did not mean a tsunami had necessarily been generated by the quake .
The warning was issued because a quake of this magnitude had the power to generate a destructive tsunami , it said .
In 2004 , a quake in the Indian Ocean generated a powerful tsunami that killed tens of thousands people in Asia .
HOHENWALD , Tennessee ( CNN ) --
A pair of African elephants tramps through lush vegetation , stopping to scoop dust with their trunks and toss it onto their backs for protection from the summer sun .
Tarra , who was a year old when Buckley met her , was the inspiration for The Elephant Sanctuary .
Meanwhile , two others submerge their massive forms to splash and dip in the waters of a muddy pond .
It 's a scene that could have been pulled from a nature documentary .
But it takes place in an unlikely spot : a 2,700 - acre sanctuary in rural Tennessee .
It 's not where nature intended the animals to be , roaming free in the vast expanses of subtropical Africa and Asia .
But for most of them , it 's a life far apart from the ones they once lived .
Tarra lived in the back of a truck at a tire store .
Shirley performed at a circus until she broke her leg on a chain .
Then , she was moved to the freak show .
And Sissy was treated like a killer .
She crushed a handler in her enclosure at a Texas zoo where video shows she 'd been beaten into submission with ax handles .
" We consider all of these elephants to be rescue elephants , because they are taken out of that environment that is not healthy for them , " said Carol Buckley , co-founder of the Elephant Sanctuary .
Founded in 1995 on 112 acres about 30 miles southwest of Nashville , the sanctuary is now the largest natural refuge of its kind in the United States .
Twenty - four elephants , most of them sick , old or abused , have lived at the sanctuary ; it is currently home to 15 African and Asian elephants .
It 's a place where elephants can roam freely , largely feed and shelter themselves and interact with others , often after years living alone in captivity .
But Buckley and Scott Blais , the nonprofit sanctuary 's co-founder , are very clear about what it 's not .
The sanctuary is not a zoo .
Visitors are n't allowed onto the property to view the elephants , and only a handful of media members are able to visit each year , in an effort to make the animals ' lives as natural as possible .
" In order to accommodate the public , you would have to take away from the elephants , " Buckley said .
" People have their own emotions , that energy , " Buckley said .
" If you feel fear and they get close , they 're going to get hit with your energy .
For Buckley , the journey to running the sanctuary -- which operates on private donations and corporate sponsorships -- started with Tarra .
Studying to be a circus trainer , she bought the elephant , then just a year old , and trained her to perform .
But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened , Buckley came to believe that captivity , particularly in a traveling circus , was no life for an elephant .
" I did n't realize that elephants in captivity were suffering and that to train and dominate an elephant was really breaking their spirit , " she said .
" When you come to love elephants , when you really come to understand them and love them , you want more for them .
" And when you learn how elephants live in the wild , it just makes sense that you would want to create a space that resembles that so elephants can just be elephants . "
From years in the circus and in zoos , Buckley and Tarra made their way to a breeding program at a Canadian wildlife safari , where they met Blais .
It was then that the idea for the Elephant Sanctuary was born .
" We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them , what they truly deserved , " Blais said .
At the preserve , the elephants feed themselves primarily by grazing -- the Asian elephants eat as much as 100 pounds of grass a day -- supplemented with grains and vitamins from the staff .
They share space with deer , wild turkey , raccoons , skunks and other native Tennessee animals .
Life in a circus , and in most zoos , is abusive to elephants , highly intelligent and social animals who , in the wild , may roam dozens of miles in a single day , the pair said .
Research has shown that elephants , like humans , can suffer post - traumatic stress disorder after living in harsh or abusive conditions .
Watch more on life at the Elephant Sanctuary . »
" Typically , when elephants are in captivity , they 're under a lot of stress , " Blais said .
" Their entire life is abnormal ; it 's unnatural , and that can often lead to aggression .
" Some will resign themselves and just kind of end up in this blank space , and others will act out , just venting their frustrations , but it 's because of what captivity offers or what captivity does n't offer them . "
The elephants generally arrive at the sanctuary in one of two ways :
Either the government finds that an owner is abusing the animals and seizes them , or the owners approach the sanctuary on their own , wanting a better life for the animals .
In their 14 - year history , Blais and Buckley say , they 've been able to raise enough funds to keep expanding the sanctuary and its facilities .
But tough economic times are taking a toll this year , and for the first time , they are nervous they 'll bring in less money than they spend .
But the mission of providing a home for the elephants they love will continue , they say .
" We feel incredibly fortunate to be doing what we do , " Buckley said .
" It 's hard work , it 's long days , it 's long weeks , but you 're not going to hear us complain about it , because we 're fortunate , and we know that .
" This is the most amazing work to do in a person 's lifetime . "

According to the self - help adage , you ca n’t fix a problem until you first admit that you have it .
So it should be of interest to New York policymakers that if you adjust census data for cost of living , Gotham is the poorest big city in America , though Detroit could gain that unwanted distinction when new data become available .
And New York State , at least by one reckoning , is the poorest state , substantially worse off than the runner - up , Mississippi .
Seriously .
Let ’s begin with the city .
Based on data from C2ER , a company that has been producing cost - of - living estimates for years , someone earning $ 50,798 in Chicago or $ 62,741 in Washington , D.C. enjoys the same standard of living as someone earning $ 100,000 in New York City .
Not surprisingly , housing is the biggest factor .
In Chicago , the cost of housing is 69 percent lower than in New York .
In Washington , D.C. , it ’s 46 percent lower .
Utility costs are also lower — 29 percent in Chicago and 39 percent in Washington .
So are groceries , by 28 percent in both cities .
The result is that New York City residents have far less purchasing power than anyone seems to realize .
( What applies to New York City also applies to its suburbs .
A person earning $ 76,256 in Chicago has the same standard of living as someone earning $ 100,000 in New York ’s Nassau County .
Once again , housing is the main reason : its cost is 42 percent lower in Chicago than in Nassau . )
The next step is to apply these cost - of - living differentials to the most recent census estimates for per-capita income .
This calculation yields a measurement of each city ’s average standard of living .
Once you crunch the numbers , you find that the real standard of living in Washington , D.C. is 118 percent higher than in New York City .
In Chicago , it ’s 75 percent higher .
In order to compare purchasing power at the state level , it ’s necessary to turn to other cost - of - living estimates .
One somewhat older estimate was produced by the Taubman Center at Harvard University in 2000 .
It calculated that based on 1999 data , the cost of living in New York State was the fourth - highest in the nation .
But the state ranked 28th in terms of per-capita income as measured by purchasing power .
And if you use median household income instead of per-capita income — a fair statistical maneuver , since New York has a disproportionate number of extraordinarily rich people — you find that New York ranked 38th in the U.S. in 1999 in purchasing power .
The Taubman data help corroborate more recent estimates by Bettina Aten , a leading expert on purchasing power at the Bureau of Economic Analysis in Washington , D.C. According to her estimates , the cost of living in New York State in 2006 was 31.8 percent above the national average , second only to Hawaii , which , of course , is an island in the middle of the ocean .
Once you apply that cost of living to 2006 estimates of median household income , you realize that New York State ranked last in the nation in purchasing power .
The adjusted figure for New York was $ 38,986 ; for Mississippi , it was $ 42,984 .
Aten herself does n’t include certain items , such as government transfer payments , and that raises New York ’s adjusted income to $ 42,743 and lowers Mississippi’s to $ 39,649 .
But either way , it ’s a dismal performance for the Empire State .
It ’s clear that New York has a big problem .
On a comparative basis , we ’re poor , thanks to a stratospheric cost of living — which itself is the result , I believe , of excessive and poorly designed regulation , most notably in the area of land use .
With this in mind , I have started the Cost of Living Project to bring attention to the exorbitant cost of living in New York .
Ultimately , the project ’s purpose is to create a library of information that will make it easier to put price tags on different regulations , thus determining which serve a genuine public interest and which should be changed or abolished .
Reform wo n’t come easily or quickly .
But come it must , because right now , New York is simply too expensive .

There are times when you need to automate a particular periodic process associated with maintaining your application .
Many times , these types of jobs could be performed manually , but it can easily be forgotten about , until a few weeks later when you wonder why your data is out of sync with reality .
Take , for example , a process that obtains data ( legally ) through a third party vendor API and imports that data into an internal database so that recent information can be analyzed by users or programmatically processed in a timely manner .
Without this data migration process in place , it might take way too long to be considered a usable system by any reasonable person .
Programmers know that it is not efficient to use a series of manual processes to keep a business going .
All is fine and well when initially testing if your job is running correctly , but this often becomes a tedious or forgettable task .
Instead , we should always seek out ways to increase the efficiency of ourselves and the efficiency of the people and systems we support .
Most operating systems provide a way of at least scheduling tasks to run on a scheduled basis .
If you are deploying to a * nix environment , you ’re in luck , especially if the job needs to run specifically in the background .
Cron is a daemon started automatically from / etc / init.d that executes scheduled commands by searching its spool area / var / spool / cron / crontabs for crontab files named after accounts in /etc / passwd .
Those crontabs should not be accessed directly ; instead , use crontab -l to list a user ’s crontab , and use crontab -e in order to edit a particular crontab .
Cron also reads the files / etc / crontab and /etc / cron.d .
It wakes up every minute to examine the crontabs and ensuring that each job has run by its scheduled time .
If need be , the job is executed .
The format of cron entries is defined as the following :
.------------ minute ( 0 - 59 ) | .---------- hour ( 0 - 23 ) | | .-------- day of month ( 1 - 31 ) | | | .------ month ( 1 - 12 ) OR jan , feb , mar , apr ... | | | | .---- day of week ( 0 - 6 ) ( Sunday= 0 or 7 ) OR sun , mon , tue , wed , thu , fri , sat | | | | | * * * * * command_to_be_executed
Cron also comes with a small list of special shortcuts as well .
@reboot = run once at startup @yearly =
0 0 1 1 * = @annually = run once per year @monthly = 0 0 1 * * = run once per month @weekly = 0 0 * * 0 = run once per week @daily = 0 0 * * * = @midnight = run once per day @hourly = 0 * * * * = run once per hour
So how can use cron along with jruby ?
and rails ?
First , you ’ll need to ensure that you have a JRuby in the user ’s PATH for which you ’ll be using to define the cron jobs .
An easy way to do this is to define the paths for JRuby , Java in the user ’s . bash_profile .
$ > vi .bash_profile JRUBY_HOME=~/jruby-1.2.0-custom
PATH=$JRUBY_HOME /bin:$ PATH
# :wq => to write the changes out the file and quit $ > source ~/.bash_profile $> echo $ JRUBY_HOME /home/jrubyist/jruby-1.2.0-custom $> echo $ PATH /home / jrubyist / jruby-1.2.0-custom/bin : /home/demmons/Desktop/jdk1.6.0_14/bin : /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
Try running the job that you wish to execute once , manually , as the appropriate user to test the environment :
su -l jrubyist -c ' jruby - S vendor_api_data_import start '
If everything is running properly , you can be sure that the command you add to the user ’s crontab will work .
Let ’s say we wanted this import task to run every Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 6:45 pm .
You would add the corresponding entry to the user ’s crontab as the following , with a comment for describing the entry :
# Automated download / migration process that makes use of the API 45 18 * * * mon , wed , fri source /etc / profile && source / home / jrubyist /.bash_profile && jruby -S vendor_api_data_import start
Combining Cron , JRuby , Rails and Rake
The example above is all fine and dandy , but what if you want to call a rake task that needs access to say , a set of models defined for a JRuby on Rails project ?.
A few days ago , Felipe Coury @fcoury posed this question on Twitter : “ What gem / lib / etc do you guys use for Ruby daemons that needs to load the Rails env prior to execution ? ”
I love to browse twitter for # jruby questions so I can help out by finding answers to those questions and writing about it .
There ’s a fairly straightforward approach you can take to achieve this goal , and the boilerplate process is as follows :
1 ) Upon deploying the JRuby / Rails application , create a symbolic link to the root of the rails dir .
In the case of JRuby / Rails on JBoss , this means we want a symbolic link to the exploded war file .
2 ) The Rake task you create should be defined such that it depends on the rails : environment .
3 ) Tell the cron entry to start the jruby / rake task given the path to that symbolic link .
#1- Can be automated by using a clever trick to hook into the initialization of the rails application .
When your container deploys your rails app , as in the case of JBoss , the $ servlet_context will be defined ,
so a link to the deployed application directory will be created at “ /home/jrubyist/deployed-rails- app
# Create / config/initializers/symlink -deployment.rb if defined ?( $ servlet_context ) && RAILS_ENV == ' production ' symlink_file = " /home/jrubyist/deployed - rails - app " current_link = nil if File.exist ?( symlink_file ) && File.symlink ?( symlink_file ) current_link = File.readlink ( symlink_file ) end if current_link != RAILS_ROOT system ( " ln - sf # {File.expand_path( RAILS_ROOT)} #{symlink_file} " ) end end
# 2 – Example Rake Task that depends on your Rails models :
namespace : third_party_vendor do namespace :api do desc " Uses the 3rd party vendor API to import data into our internal databases . " task : data_import => : environment do #
Since we say that we depend on the : environment , # we now have access to our rails model objects .
For example ...
# eligible_401k_employees = Employees.find ( : all , : conditions => [ ' effective >= ?' , 1.year.ago ] ) end end end
If you need to have access to non-rails frozen gems as well , you will want to modify your config / environment.rb to include the following before the Rails : : Initializer.run do | config| …
# Load non-Rails frozen gems too ..
Dir.glob( File.join( RAILS_ROOT , 'vendor ' , '*' , ' lib ' ) ) do |path| $ LOAD_PATH << path end
Some people have reported that in order to get the environment to load correctly for your rails task , they had to add the following to the top of their Rake task :
require File.join( RAILS_ROOT , ' config ' , ' environment.rb ' )
# 3 – Modify your cron task so that it executes your Rake task defined in your rails app .
# Automated download / migration process that makes use of the API 45 18 * * * mon , wed , fri source /etc / profile && source / home / jrubyist/.bash_profile && RAILS_ENV=production rake -- rakefile /home / jrubyist / deployed-rails-app/Rakefile third_party_vendor:api:data_import
Finishing touches …
That should be enough to get you started .
Finally , if you want your background processes to not affect your production application environment , you might consider adding “ nice ” to the command .
nice maps to a kernel call of the same name .
For a given process , it changes the priority in the kernel ’s scheduler .
A niceness of - 20 is the highest priority , and 19 is the lowest priority .
You can read more about nice on wikipedia .
Another useful feature to add to your rake task is to have the output of stdout written to a log file .
That way you can go back and analyze the log file for any errors that might occur during the execution of your rake task .
Create a file that is writable by the cron user , and then add the following to your cron command .
The finished product is as follows :
# Automated download / migration process that makes use of the API 45 18 * * * mon , wed , fri source /etc / profile && source / home / jrubyist/.bash_profile && RAILS_ENV=production nice rake -- rakefile /home / jrubyist / deployed-rails-app/Rakefile third_party_vendor:api:data_import -- trace >> /home/jrubyist/logs/cron/import.log 2>&1
This technique is both useful and pragmatic .
Never worry again about running a periodic process .
Let the system do the work .
Of course , such extravagant claims are impossible to establish , but Mr. Vaynerchuk ’s audience on his Internet bulletin board certainly seems to have a higher percentage of novice wine drinkers than in the forums on either the Parker or Spectator Web sites .

While Mr. Vaynerchuk does not yet come close to Mr. Parker or the Spectator in his ability to move the wine market as a whole , his words do sell bottles .
In an episode of Wine Library TV in February , Mr. Vaynerchuk raved about a Sonoma Coast pinot noir from Sojourn Cellars , a small producer .
“ We took 500 e-mails and phone calls in 24 hours , ” said Craig Haserot , an owner of Sojourn .
“ Nothing has put more people on our database and sold more wine than Wine Library TV , and it ’s not even close . ”
Mr. Vaynerchuk ’s appeal is rooted in his undermining of the old - guard mantle of authority and detachment that wine critics of older generations like Ms. Robinson spent years trying to achieve .
In many reviews , he seems to subvert the established vocabulary for describing wine .
He begins with the usual jargon , talking about nose and mid-palate , describing flavors like apricot , buttered popcorn and lilacs , as many wine writers do .
But then he departs from the script , saying a wine smells like a sheep butt or that drinking it is like biting into an engine .
He might improvise a dialogue with a bottle of riesling , and when he talked about another pinot noir from the Sonoma Coast , a 2006 Kanzler , he seemingly went off the deep end in describing its flavor :
“ You hit a deer , you pull off to the side of the road , then you stab the deer with a knife , cut it , and bite that venison , and put a little black pepper and strawberries on it and eat it , like a mean , awful human being .
That ’s what this tastes like . ”
Audiences love it .
“ I immediately identified with his passion and enthusiasm , ” said Dale Cruse , a Web designer and wine blogger who started watching early on .
“ But I think it ’s worth noting that passion and enthusiasm is n’t going to get you very far in the wine world without some knowledge to back it up . ”
Indeed , Mr. Vaynerchuk does know his Pommards from his Pomerols , and he clearly loves wine and wants his audience to love wine , too .
Some herbal highs are just as harmful as cannabis and should be made illegal , according to the government 's drug advisors .
Scientists say that a plant based mix called Spice is coated with synthetic chemicals that work on the same part of the brain as the active ingredient in cannabis .
Three gram packets of Spice are sold for around £ 25 over the internet , at festivals and in the same specialist shops that sell bongs and other smoking accessories .
" You just do n't know what you are getting with these products , " said Professor David Nutt , the chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) .
" They potentially cause the same problems as cannabis . "
Head rush
Twenty - two - year - old Joey , not his real name , from East Anglia told Newsbeat that his experience of Spice was similar to smoking standard cannabis .
I found it stronger than the weed on the street ' Sarah ' , 17 , said she smoked Spice with her friends
" I was quite surprised at how strong it actually was , " he said .
" With cannabis we all know the dangers but some of these other products are sold as purely herbal so you do think they are a lot better for you . "
Seventeen - year - old ' Sarah ' , again not her real name , said she smoked Spice with her friends when cannabis was n't available .
" I found it stronger than the weed on the street , " she told Newsbeat .
" We thought it was much safer and we were n't going to get paranoid but it had the same effects . "
Legal highs boom
For years , the legal high market was dominated by small producers selling home - grown packets of natural herbs and weak pills laced with caffeine or the chemical ephedrine .
" They never really had much effect , " said John Ramsey , a toxicologist at St George 's Hospital in London and specialist in drug identification .
" We dismissed most of the herbs as just a bit of a joke . "
But a new generation of products started to emerge around five years ago , many with stronger effects more closely associated with illegal drugs .
At the end of 2008 scientists researching Spice discovered it was not herbal at all but sprayed with a range of chemicals with obscure names like JWH 018 and CP 47,497 .
These " cannabinoids " were first created back in the 1980s by drug companies hoping to develop products with some of the same painkilling effects as cannabis .
Most of the work was eventually scrapped as it proved difficult to replicate the medicinal or calming properties of the drug without the intoxicating effects .
The same chemicals are now being used by some makers of legal highs , according to drug researchers .
" Just because you buy it from a high street shop in a foil packet does n't make it harmless , " said John Ramsay .
" We just do n't know . "
Ban ' before Christmas '
Spice itself is officially marketed as a herbal incense and is clearly marked as " not for human consumption " .
Newsbeat tried to reach the manufacturers of the drug for comment but they could not be contacted for this article .
The specific chemicals used in Spice have already been banned in France , Germany and Austria .
But with hundreds of other similar cannabinoids available it was simple for the makers to switch to a legal alternative and continue producing a substance with the same effects .
The British government is now expected to follow the ACMD 's recommendation and push through a total ban on the chemicals in Spice and similar cannabinoids in an attempt to snuff out the whole industry in one go .
Newsbeat has been told ministers will signal their intention to outlaw Spice by the end of August with legislation likely this autumn and a full ban in place by spring 2010 .
But it might not be quite that simple .
The legal high market is now extremely lucrative and scientists say the companies involved are probably already developing more pills and powders .
An Atheist ’s View On Theistic Unconditional Love
It amazes me how often I see fellow atheists write about being shunned and ostracized by their family over their deconversion .
People who claimed to love them so much seem so ready to throw them in the trash the second their opinions deviate from one another .
I see this as being similar to libertarian parents throwing out their child for deciding they are a socialist .
I ’ve really lucked out as an atheist .
I have n’t lost any family and only a few friends over my lack of belief .
It ’s hard for me to imagine a loving parent being able to do such a thing over religious beliefs .
My family is pretty much entirely Christian and more than anything they ’ve just been curious about what I do believe .
We ’ve had hours of talks on things like the god of the gaps and the atrocities in the Bible .
The most strained relationship I have with any family member is with my Evangelical sister - in - law , and her approach is more of a “ let ’s just not discuss this subject ” than anything else .
I ’ve always been told that Christianity preaches unconditional love , but I rarely see that in practice when it ’s needed the most .
Deconverting is a painful process for atheists even without the pressures added by an intolerant and bigoted family .
The outside world is already going to treat this person like less of a human and the only place they seek solace is amongst family and friends .
If there is a Christian out there reading this who would do that to their child / family member :
Please think about what you ’re doing , this sort of thing can rarely be undone .
Do you really think your god would approve of abandoning a child over a philosophical disagreement ?
Unconditional love does not mean “ as long as you ’re a Christian / Muslim / Hindu / Etc. ” it means “ no matter what , without condition ” .
If you ’re willing to disown your family over religious deconversion alone then you do n’t deserve them .
An ambitious group of hardware hackers have taken the fundamental building blocks of computing and turned them inside out in an attempt to make PCs significantly more efficient .
The group has created a motherboard prototype that uses separate modules , each of which has its own processor , memory and storage .
Each square cell in this design serves as a mini-motherboard and network node ; the cells can allocate power and decide to accept or reject incoming transmissions and programs independently .
Together , they form a networked cluster with significantly greater power than the individual modules .
The design , called the Illuminato X Machina , is vastly different from the separate processor , memory and storage components that govern computers today .
" We are taking everything that goes into motherboard now and chopping it up , " says David Ackley , associate professor of computer science at the University of New Mexico and one of the contributors to the project .
" We have a CPU , RAM , data storage and serial ports for connectivity on every two square inches . "
A modular architecture designed for parallel and distributed processing could help take computing to the next level , say its designers .
Instead of having an entire system crash if a component experiences a fatal error , failure of a single cell can still leave the rest of the system operational .
It also has the potential to change computing by ushering in machines that draw very little power .
" We are at a point where each computer processor maxes out at 3 Ghz ( clock speed ) so you have to add more cores , but you are still sharing the resource within the system , " says Justin Huynh , one of the key members of the project .
" Adding cores the way we are doing now will last about a decade . "
Huynh and his team are no strangers to experimenting with new ideas .
Earlier this year , Huynh and his partner Matt Stack created the Open Source Hardware Bank , a peer - to - peer borrowing and lending club that funds open source hardware projects .
Stack first started working on the X Machina idea about 10 months ago .
Computing today is based on the von Neumann architecture : a central processor , and separate memory and data storage .
But that design poses a significant problem known as the von Neumann bottleneck .
Though processors can get faster , the connection between the memory and the processor can get overloaded .
That limits the speed of the computer to the pace at which it can transfer data between the two .
" A von Neumann machine is like the centrally planned economy , whereas the modular , bottom up , interconnected approach would be more capitalist , " says Ackley .
" There are advantages to a centrally planned structure but eventually it will run into great inefficiencies . "
By creating modules , Huynh and his group hope to bring a more parallel and distributed architecture .
Cluster - based systems are n't new .
They have been used in high end computing extensively .
But with the Illuminato X Machina they hope to extend the idea to a larger community of general PC users .
" The way to think of this is that it is a system with a series of bacteria working together instead of a complex single cell amoeba , " says JP Norair , architect of Dash 7 , a new wireless and data standard .
An electrical and computer engineering graduate from Princeton University , Norair has studied modular architecture extensively .
Each X Machina module has a 72 MHz processor ( currently an ARM chip ) , a solid state drive of 16KB and 128KB of storage in an EEPROM ( electrically erasable programmable read - 0nly memory ) chip .
There 's also an LED for display output and a button for user interaction .
Every module has four edges , and each edge can connect to its neighbors .
It does n't have sockets , standardized interconnects or a proprietary bus .
Instead , the system uses a reversible connector .
It ’s smart enough to know if it is plugged into a neighbor and can establish the correct power and signal wires to exchange power and information , says Mike Gionfriddo , one of the designers on the project .
The X Machina has software - controlled switches to gate the power moving through the system on the fly and a ' jumping gene ' ability , which means executable code can flow directly from one module to another without always involving a PC - based program downloader .
Each Illuminato X Machina node also has a custom boot loader software that allows it to be programmed and reprogrammed by its neighbors , even as the overall system continues to run , explains Huynh .
The X Machina creators hope to tie into the ardent Arduino community .
Many simple Arduino sketches will run on the X Machina with no source code changes , they say .
Still there are many details that need to be worked out .
Huynh and his group have n't yet benchmarked the system against traditional PCs to establish exactly how the two compare in terms of power consumption and speeds .
The lack of benchmarking also means that they have no data yet on how the computing power of an X Machina array compares to a PC with an Intel Core 2 Duo chip .
Programs and applications have also yet to be written for the X Machina to show whether it can be an effective computing system for the kind of tasks most users perform .
To answer some of these questions , Ackley plans to introduce the Illuminato X Machina to his class at the University of New Mexico later this month .
Ackley hopes students of computer science will help understand how traditional computer programming concepts can be adapted to this new structure .
So far , just the first few steps towards this idea have been taken , says Huynh .
Norair agrees .
" If they can successfully get half the power of an Intel chip with a cluster of microcontrollers , it will be a great success , " he says , " because the power consumption can be so low on these clusters and they have a level of robustness we have n't seen yet . "

Oh , chute !
A British skydiver plunged a terrifying 2,000 feet when his parachute malfunctioned — yet survived with a stroke of nearly incredible luck .
Paul Lewis , a parachutist of 20 years ’ experience , was videotaping a novice ’s jump from 10,000 feet Friday afternoon , The Times of London reported .
He deployed his main parachute , but it failed at 3,000 feet .
When his reserve chute also malfunctioned , he went straight down for nearly half a mile .
But the second chute snagged on the pitched metal roof of an airline hangar — saving him from falling the remaining 30 feet to the concrete below .
“ As soon as I saw the parachute spiral , I knew something was wrong , ” Colin Fitzmaurice , owner of the Parachute Centre told the paper .
“ Even before he hit the ground , I ’d called an ambulance .
“ He is incredibly lucky .
He ’s almost without injury .
If he ’d fallen 10 feet [ laterally ] either way , he would have landed on concrete .
I went to see him earlier today [ in the hospital ] , and he was in good spirits . ”
It took firefighters nearly an hour to reach Lewis , who suffered head and neck injuries .

Kadeer irks China , just by being there
WHEN Kevin Rudd , Australia 's Mandarin - speaking prime minister , came to power in late 2007 the country 's relations with China seemed poised to improve .
But the love - in has failed to happen .
This week Australia 's government announced that China had cancelled a visit by He Yafei , a foreign - affairs minister , earlier this month .
He was to attend a summit of Pacific island leaders , at which Mr Rudd hoped to discuss his plan for a new Asia - Pacific regional body involving China .
The snub was the latest setback in a relationship undergoing strains on several fronts .
Australia 's commercial relations with its biggest trading partner tend to collide with China 's unhappiness over its political stance , especially over human rights .
The cancelled ministerial visit was a response to a decision to allow Rebiya Kadeer , an exiled activist from China 's ethnic Uighurs , to visit Australia .
China has accused Ms Kadeer of inciting riots involving Uighur and Han Chinese last month .
Her visit was to attend the opening of an Australian film about her at the Melbourne Film Festival .
The organisers ignored pressure from Chinese officials to cancel the screening , moving it instead to a larger venue when publicity over the row fuelled demand .
China reportedly threatened Melbourne 's mayor with ending a sister - city relationship with Tianjin .
It also unsuccessfully leant on the National Press Club in Canberra to cancel an invitation to Ms Kadeer to speak there .
Yet this week another Australian minister was in Beijing for the signing of a deal under which China will buy liquefied natural gas worth A$ 50 billion ( $ 41 billion ) from Gorgon , off Western Australia 's coast .
The deal between PetroChina , a state - controlled company , and Exxon Mobil is reckoned to be Australia 's biggest - ever trade contract .
There are hopes that China might be signalling that commercial pragmatism will dictate relations with Australia .
It is proving hard , however , to disentangle the commercial from the political .
In June China was upset by what it saw as a threat to its interests when Rio Tinto , an Anglo - Australian mining giant , walked away from an offer by Chinalco , a state - run aluminium firm , to pay $ 19.5 billion to double its stake in the firm .
Instead , Rio struck a deal with BHP Billiton , its main competitor , to exploit jointly the vast iron - ore deposits of Western Australia 's Pilbara region .
Already , China is Australia 's biggest market for iron ore , to fuel its industrial expansion .
Australians mainly welcomed the collapse of the Chinalco deal , amid perceptions that China wanted to use its economic power to exert pressure on prices of one of the country 's most lucrative resources .
Scepticism towards China in Australia hardened in July after the detention of Stern Hu , an Australian who heads Rio 's iron - ore operations in China , and three colleagues .
Initially accused of stealing state secrets , seemingly to help Rio's bargaining position in the annual benchmark pricing negotiations for iron ore , Mr Hu and some colleagues were eventually charged this month with the lesser offences of commercial espionage and taking bribes .
Reflecting his own background as a diplomat in China , Mr Rudd has taken a low - key approach to resolving the affair of Mr Hu .
An opinion poll published this week found that 58 % of Australians approved of Mr Rudd 's handling of China .
But China 's recent tough tactics may have done little to reassure Australians about the intentions of their giant trading partner .
China Daily , a state - run newspaper , this week accused Australia of being “ the champion leader of anti-China chorus ” .
That chorus is unlikely to pipe down .
Randy Brinson , a conservative political consultant in Alabama , has been fielding anxious calls for weeks from business interests across the South .
Their concern is massive ad blitz on Christian and country - music stations across 10 states .
The ads , funded by a left - leaning coalition , urge support for congressional legislation to curb greenhouse - gas emissions -- by framing the issue as an urgent matter of Biblical morality .

Life as we know it can not exist without water .
It ’s all around us .
It ’s in us .
It is essential to almost everything we do .
It is essential to every living thing .
Where there is water , we have always found life .
“ Water ties together everything we care about , ” says environmental scientist Peter Gleick , president of the Pacific Institute , Oakland California , renowned for its research on water issues .
But , abundant as it is , he says , “ we are facing a crisis of running out of sustainably managed water . ”
With global population and development on the rise , we ’re consuming water like there ’s no tomorrow .
Humanity already appropriates more than 50 percent of all renewable and accessible freshwater flows , Gleick says .
Yet , an estimated 1.2 billion people , of the 6.8 billion on the planet , lack access to safe water .
“ There are places in the world where people have to walk several miles just to get a bucket of water , ” says engineer - economist R. K. Pachauri , chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , which shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Vice President Al Gore in 2007 .
“ This is not fiction , ” he adds .
“ And another 2.4 billion people lack sanitation facilities . ”
Combined , that ’s half of humanity .
Midway through the United Nations ’ International Decade for Action : Water for Life , 2005 –2015 , the Millennium Development goal to “ halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation ” is making “ [ s ] ome remarkable progress ” in meeting safe water needs , Gleick writes in The World ’s Water 2008 - 2009 , the biennial “ book on water ” he ’s been authoring since 1998 .
“ We are failing miserably , however , in meeting sanitation needs , ” and Africa is still “ neglected . ”
We have also failed some once - rich ecosystems , now overburdened by our use of their waters .
There is a threshold , a critical point Gleick and colleagues call “ peak ecological water , ” where humans use more water than the ecosystem can sustain without significant deterioration and degradation .
We may have reached that point in places like the Florida Everglades and the Aral Sea .
Despite restoration attempts , these vast wetland ecosystems tragically continue to decline .
“ If you follow the money since 1950 , you will follow the water , ” says Christian environmental ethicist Larry Rasmussen , professor emeritus at the Union Theological Seminary .
The route , he says , has taken us to this endpoint of undermining not only the quantity and availability of freshwater supplies , but also the capacity of nature ’s economy to thrive and survive .
“ The global consumer economy is colliding with Earth ’s economy , ” he says .
There ’s also the 600 - pound gorilla in the pond : climate change .
No one knows exactly how climate change will alter our world , but experts agree it will .
They also agree that we already see evidence of such changes on our water resources , especially in drought - ridden Africa , and other thirsty regions like the western United States .
The predictions are sobering .
The average supply of water per person worldwide is expected to drop by one - third over the next 20 years , in part because of climate change , according to the IPCC .
And climate change is predicted to cause a 20 percent increase in water scarcity up to 2050 .
The gorilla in the pond , meanwhile , is looming larger .
Will climate change ultimately cause us to merely suffer bouts of harsh inconvenience with relatively moderate loss of life ?
Or will we bear witness to catastrophic collapses that lead to starvation , massive migration , water wars , and millions of human ( and dozens of , ecosystem ) deaths ?
With all of our technology , living as we do on a planet that is 71 percent water , a renewable resource , it ’s hard to believe that our access to this vital element could be threatened .
Of all the water on Earth , however , just 3 percent is freshwater , 2 percent or two - thirds of which is frozen in glaciers and snowcaps , or locked in deep groundwater , leaving less than 1 percent available for our use .
That 1 percent must sustain the billions of people living today , as well as the two billion - plus more to arrive in the next 15 years , all the ecosystems and every living thing , great and small , within each of them .
Also , while water is a renewable resource , not all water use is renewable .
Some water uses are nonrenewable and unsustainable , following “ a peak - oil - type curve , ” as Gleick and colleagues have put forward , complete with a precipitous decline as we are now seeing in ecosystems around the world .
“ It used to be we had wide open rivers , ” says geographer and river scientist William Graf , professor at the University of South Carolina .
But humankind has taken over and changed the planet ’s natural landscapes , building dams that , however inadvertently , devastated entire ecosystems , altering the flows and changing the composition of the water by polluting it with agricultural fertilizers and pesticides , industrial chemicals , and the cocktail of contaminants we flush down the toilet .
Given all the ways we ’ve messed with Mother Nature , it ’s easy to see how pressure is building on that 1 percent .
“ We cannot afford to waste the quality of our waters or the quantity of our waters , because there is a limit to water of good quality for human beings , organisms , and ecosystems , ” says marine ecologist Nancy Rabalais , executive director of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium , who has spent two decades studying how pollution of the Mississippi River has led to ecological devastation in the Gulf of Mexico .
Since the planet ’s hydrology is truly a cycle , the oceans , surface water , and groundwater are all interconnected and interdependent .
Water is continuously moving through the cycle , on , above , and below the surface of Earth , often changing states as it travels , from liquid to vapor or ice .
Once contaminants enter the hydrologic cycle , they ’re there until we take them out or until it can , over the long term , detoxify itself organically .
Today , pristine water , in the classic sense , is rare .
In fact , only 2 percent of America ’s rivers still rank as “ pristine . ”
“ The era of taking water for granted is over , ” sums up water chemist David Sedlak , professor at the University of California Berkeley , known for his research into human steroids and pharmaceuticals in drinking supplies .
“ Now it ’s up to us to make the system work in the most sustainable way possible . ”
Despite all the mistakes and abuse of resources that will no doubt make our descendants blush with embarrassment , we are not doomed , says engineer - water manager Asit Biswas , founder of the Third World Centre for Water Management in Atizapan , Mexico .
“ Each of the problems can be solved economically , politically , and with science and technology . ”
The only question , absurd as it might seem , is : Do we want to ?
It will take cutting - edge science and new technologies , human ingenuity , and a lot of money and commitment , specifically a decades - long commitment , orders of magnitude beyond the 10 - second sound bite world in which we live today .
And it ’s going to take something else , something that may be the greatest — and most urgent — challenge for our global village , says Rasmussen .
“ There will be changes in the next few years on a scale that we have n’t seen before and our present ethical frameworks are not adequate for addressing this crisis , ” he says .
“ These issues and problems require people being motivated to do the work .
They require changes in the way people see things , changes in values that people hold .
In most of human history , change of this sort involves a spiritual or religious or a faith dimension .
Knowledge itself does n’t suffice in getting people to muster the political will to change the condition . ”
Up the Creek
The water crisis in America today can be traced in part back to good intentions , the Great Depression , and Western expansion .
“ Water was a key to development in the West , ” says Graf .
“ Dams played an important role in that resuscitation of the economy , providing employment and creating new systems , such as the Tennessee Valley Authority , that had lasting , positive impacts . ”
As a nation , we thought of dam - builders as heroes .
“ And they were , ” he says .
“ They created some of the most magnificent engineering structures in the world and those structures had enormous social and economic benefit . ”
Not too many people were thinking then about ecological consequences .
It turns out that the installation of dams came with “ surprising costs , ” particularly to ecological systems .
“ That has come home to roost , ” says Graf , from the Florida Everglades to the once mighty Colorado , where wholesale extinctions turned our magnificent creations into environmental tombstones .
“ The people working to restore the Everglades argue that if they ca n’t get it right in the Everglades , we ’re probably not going to get other places right , ” he says .
“ The problems there are the same as for other rivers — lack of a sufficient amount of water to keep human needs satisfied and , at the same time , operate the system so that it allows the survival of the natural species . ”
Damming changed the landscape and natural morphology of rivers .
“ The Mississippi River is no longer a ‘ natural ’ river , ” Rabalais points out .
“ It has been channelized , leveed , and allowed to flow into the floodplain . ”
Humankind has also used the Mississippi , like it has other rivers , as a dumping ground .
An estimated 40 percent of American rivers are now too polluted for fishing or swimming or aquatic life .
Synthetic fertilizers , rich in nitrogen and phosphorus , and pesticides , enhanced with designer chemicals , have washed off farmlands and into various parts of the Mississippi only to have “ direct effects ” on coastal ecosystems , says Rabalais .
“ Human activities thousands of kilometers away are determining the quality of water that reaches the northern Gulf of Mexico . ”
In fact , they ’re choking it .
The mix of chemicals running from the mouth of the Mississippi into the ocean waters has created a “ dead zone , ” a patch in the gulf where there is n’t enough oxygen to sustain aquatic life .
These agricultural fertilizers and pesticides are in large part contributing to the “ nitrogen footprint ” that we ’re leaving next to our carbon footprint .
“ The accelerated increase in reactive nitrogen in the global ecosystem is faster than the carbon dioxide [ greenhouse gas ] increase and it ’s just as important , ” Rabalais points out .
“ The nitrogen footprint has an equal potential , along with the effects of CO2 increase , to disturb the balance of a global ecosystem . ”
Beyond the output from synthetic nitrogen , the combustion of fossil fuels puts even more reactive nitrogen into the air , water , and soil .
This imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle raises agricultural yields , but it also causes degradation of water and air quality , biodiversity , ecosystem capabilities , and ultimately human health .
“ The carbon , nitrogen , and phosphorous cycles are interrelated , but not often considered together — and they should be , ” says Rabalais .
During the last several decades , our water supplies have also become contaminated with human hormones and chemicals from all the drugs , personal care , and cleaning products we use , some of which are laced with known carcinogens , not to mention everything else we flush out of our homes .
In his research , Sedlak found that wastewater - derived contaminants can cause adverse effects in aquatic ecosystems at extremely low levels .
The feminization of fish in rivers around the world , for example , has been attributed to steroid hormones , both natural and synthetic ( from birth control pills ) , excreted by humans and not filtered out in the treatment process .
The reason pharmaceuticals and other chemicals are not filtered out is simple :
Our wastewater treatment systems were never designed to remove these trace contaminants , Sedlak says .
Most American water treatment facilities are retrofitted , 19th - century sewage systems , designed as a means of disposal , “ to get sewage out of our cities , ” he explains .
Over the years , plants have been upgraded to remove nutrients and organics that deplete oxygen in the rivers , but not pharmaceuticals , because — who knew ?
But “ [ i ] n a number of important water supplies in the United States , wastewater effluent is a significant fraction of the drinking water supply , ” notes Sedlak .
While some drugs and contaminants are being removed as treatment plants are updated with new filtration methods , other chemicals and pharmaceuticals are not removed at all .
So , if they affect fish at very low levels , what about us humans ?
Does this mean that we ’re all , in effect , ‘ on drugs ’ now ?
“ That , ” says Sedlak , “ is the ongoing debate in the water quality and toxicology communities . ”
Down the River
The gorilla in the pond , meanwhile , is looming larger .
Will climate change ultimately cause us to merely suffer bouts of harsh inconvenience with relatively moderate loss of life ?
Or will we bear witness to catastrophic collapses that lead to starvation , massive migration , water wars , and millions of human ( and dozens of , ecosystem ) deaths ?
The unknown factors in the equation are us and it , says Pachauri — specifically , how we are going to respond to the water crisis upon us , and how exactly the climate system will respond to rising temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations .
Even in the best of all possible outcomes though , climate change will significantly affect our water resources , because , as Gleick bottom - lines it , “ [t ] he hydrologic cycle is the climate cycle . ”
The first signs of climate change have already appeared in fluctuations in precipitation , in extreme weather events , including droughts , floods , severe hurricanes like Katrina and Ike , and in the melting of polar ice and glaciers .
As population density increases and water availability decreases through global warming and climate change , the emerging problems will be numerous and often complex .
In the developing countries , the issue will likely be about access .
“ Cities like Delhi , Madras , Mexico City , Manila , and Bangkok will have a problem , but they will manage because these mega-cities are where the elite of the country sleep , ” says Biswas .
“ The real water problem , in just five to ten years , will be the more rural areas , and the small to medium - size cities of 20,000 to 500,000 , communities with no money , political power , expertise , no nothing , ” he says .
“ Their number is growing exponentially — and not a single country is thinking about this . ”
Here in the United States , and in other developed countries , water quality will top the water agenda , unless , of course , drought has parched a region .
In particular , the controversy of upstream communities discharging into the water supply of downstream communities will come to the fore , says Sedlak .
“ The Trinity River in Texas , for example , flows out of Dallas - Fort Worth downstream to Lake Livingston , a reservoir for Houston , ” he says .
“ Just about everyone ’s water supply has someone influencing it upstream , if not a sewage treatment plant , then maybe agricultural runoff or storm - water runoff from the city .
That is just the reality now . ”
Most experts envision an increase in political disputes and conflicts over shared water as climate change takes hold .
“ Throughout history there has been conflict over water , ” says Gleick , who logs the events for The World ’s Water series .
In the United States , there have been decades of dispute over Colorado River water in the West , for example , and , on the other side of the world , over rights to the Nile .
Not everyone in the water world , however , is so convinced scarcity and conflict are necessarily “ preeminent ” in our future .
“ That the world is facing a crisis right now because of physical scarcity of water , is a bunch of baloney , ” says Biswas .
“ My thesis is that if things are properly done and , at the same time , people who need the water and cannot afford to pay get a targeted subsidy — not everyone , only the poor — we can address this problem .
And there are plenty of examples of cooperation and collaboration among rivals , where water has unified people , from the United States to Asia , ” he adds .
Whatever the future holds , these experts agree it ’s time to get it together .
Otherwise , at the global level “ we ’ll be facing a continued failure to meet basic human needs for water and more than two million deaths per year from preventable water - related diseases , ” says Gleick .
Locally , he says , “ we ’ll see continued ecological destructions , loss of fisheries , extinctions of aquatic species , the drying up of river deltas in more and more places and more severely with climate change . ”
While we cannot stop the storms of climate change , “ we can move to a different future , ” he says , “ and meet the basic needs for water for everyone and every ecosystem . ”
Making the Sea Change
Acknowledging our place in , and impact on , the biosphere is the first step to initiating the sea change needed .
“ We need to think about our relationship to the hydrologic cycle and understand that it ’s not a simple cartoon where ocean water evaporates , goes to the mountains , rains down on us , and eventually goes back to the sea .
We have to recognize that we are part of the hydrologic cycle , ” says Sedlak .
From there , we step onto the “ soft path , ” Gleick posits , adapting the phrase coined by Amory Lovins in the 1970s with respect to meeting human energy needs .
Rather than seek endless sources of new supply , “ [ w ] e learn to use water efficiently , properly price water , bring communities into decision - making , protect our ecosystems , and give communities decision - making power over water . ”
The soft path for water , he says , is “ a comprehensive approach ” to water management , planning , and use that utilizes water infrastructure , but combines it with improvements in overall productivity of water use .
For the sake of the entire Earth community , as we change course to the soft path , we will need to address the issue of water justice or water democracy for all living things , says Rasmussen .
“ Water is the absolute requisite for life of any kind .
Ethically , you have to include nonhuman elements into the equation of who gets what . ”
Americans in particular will have to come to terms with the fact that clean water is not free .
“ The water crisis is poor management and quality governance , which includes the pricing of water , providing water , and making water management more efficient , ” says Biswas .
“ There are simply not enough resources in the world to provide free water or highly subsidized water as is given to the farmers in California .
When water is not free , then the culture that encourages water conservation will set in , ” he says .
“ Singapore had one of the worst water management systems in the world when a remarkable leader — Lee Kuan Yew — came in and took special interest in it , ” Biswas points out .
“ Now , Singapore has the world ’s best water management system even though its population has more than doubled .
The cost of water is high , but the loss is down from 85 percent in 1993 to 4.5 percent .
That ’s less than New York and other American cities . ”
Ultimately , everyone and every institution and organization — national governments , communities , businesses , both big and small , churches and faith communities , and individuals — will have to assume responsibility .
“ We really can make a difference in the watershed , in our own homes , and communities , past what the government can provide in oversight and regulation , ” says Rabalais .
One way to address the pollution in the Mississippi River , she says , is for the agricultural enterprise , “ driven mostly by large businesses , ” to manage the process better .
“ There are methods to keep the nutrients on the lands , such as not putting fertilizer down in the fall and having it wash off before spring planting , or treating the water with an artificial wetland that could denitrify it before it gets to the nearest stream , ” she points out .
“ The government could give subsidies only to conservation farmers .
That would improve the water quality both upstream and downstream , plus there would n’t be any loss of income for the agricultural business .
There are all sorts of possibilities . ”
People are rising to the challenge .
On the riverfront , the new ecotrend is in “ reoperating ” the dams .
“ In the short run , one major fix to halt , if not to reverse , the damage is using the things that caused the problem in the first place — the dams — as keys to solutions , ” says Graf .
These days , almost every one of the 137 major dams in the country — each having a reservoir with one million acre - feet of water or more — is operated “ at least in part ” for environmental quality purposes , he says .
Individually and collectively we will have to take it upon ourselves to stop contributing to the mess in whatever ways we can , beginning with giving up bottled water .
On the chemical front , pharmacists have instituted “ some innovative drug take - back programs , ” so people do n’t flush what they do n’t use , Sedlak points out .
“ But the larger question is how we select chemicals in the first place .
There are choices we can make , the same way we gave up spray cans that had ozone - depleting chemicals in them . ”
Think about antimicrobial hand soaps .
They have been clinically shown to be no more effective than ordinary soap and water .
They have also been shown to leave a host of chemicals in surface waters .
Are they really necessary for everyone to use every day ?
Transitioning to a new paradigm wo n’t happen overnight , especially given that water has forever been taken for granted in much of the world .
In some countries , age - old political structure seems to thwart change .
In Mexico and India , for example , heads of water utilities are appointed for very limited time periods , between 18 and 30 months , and thus , says Biswas , are ineffectual at making the necessary changes .
“ There are a lot of vested interests in the water utilities that want to retain the status quo , because they are benefiting from the existing , inefficient system , ” he says .
“ You begin making changes and you run into a lot of political problems . ”
As difficult as it will be to change institutional structures , if necessary , it will be more difficult to change habits , hearts , and minds .
One lesson learned from the current economic recession is that we need laws and regulations to control the human propensity for greed and to otherwise keep us from running amok .
Yes , there are laws protecting our water on the books , but they are not enough .
“ A big part of our water problem is a lack of adequate water quality laws , but another piece of it is that even where we have them , enforcement is sometimes ineffective or nonexistent , ” says Gleick .
“ In China — the poster child for how not to manage water — they actually do have some pretty good new national water laws .
But they ’re not enforced .
You cannot protect water resources without both good laws and strong enforcement . ”
Just like we have mileage standards for cars , we will one day have broad efficiency standards for water , says Gleick .
“ We already have a standard for toilets and a standard for washing machines is being developed , ” he says .
In some cities it is already against community rules to waste water .
Earlier this year , the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power put 15 fulltime “ water police ” officers on the streets ( in hybrid Priuses ) to enforce conservation regulations .
Those caught sprinkling during peak hours or oversprinkling or washing their cement driveways will be ticketed .
Fines begin at $ 100 .
The soft path paradigm will also require us to get over deep - seated notions about our waste and recycled water .
“ All cultures have evolved with the idea that you do n’t interact with your own waste — you get rid of it , ” says Sedlak .
“ But potable water reuse is really the key issue of the future . ”
Biswas agrees , noting that Americans seem to have “ an aversion ” to recycled water .
“ Their reaction is — yuck , ” he says .
“ But it ’s all psychological . ”
That aversion is , however slowly , changing .
It has to .
After decades in the works , the Groundwater Replenishment System in Orange County , California , the largest water purification project of its kind in the world , began operations last year to provide a locally controlled , drought - proof supply of safe , high - quality water for 500,000 people .
Using a state - of - the - art , three - step process , the system purifies highly - treated sewer water , then injects half into the county ’s seawater intrusion barrier and half into spreading basins in Anaheim , where it takes the natural path of rainwater , filtering through clay , sand , and rock to deep aquifers of the groundwater basin .
“ That is closing the loop , ” says Sedlak .
The consciousness about how “ tight ” the loops are in the hydrologic cycle is n’t there yet , he says .
“ But it really needs to be as we think about the redesign of our waste treatment infrastructures .
We have inherited a water infrastructure from the 19th century that ’s not going to serve us well in the 21st century .
Now that we are facing this issue of reusing our water , we have a chance to rethink our approach for dealing with waste by diluting it with water . ”
We ’ve got a lot of rethinking to do .
Consider that in even in environmentally friendly California the wastewater treatment and water delivery systems are the top consumers of electricity .
“ And a lot of this highly - treated water ends up being used to water the garden and or flush the toilet , ” Sedlak points out .
“ Firms are building desalination plants that use incredible amounts of energy to turn seawater into drinking water .
When we look holistically at energy use and climate change and the impact of using all this water , it leads us to the issue of efficiency . ”
What could be more efficient than seeing the inconvenient truth of our “ poop ” transformed into a hot commodity ?
It ’s more than urban legend .
“ There are so many people on the planet now we ’re realizing that our waste is actually a resource , ” Sedlak confirms .
Since ancient times human and animal excreta has been used as fertilizer , although in Europe and North America natural waste has been all but replaced by artificial fertilizers because of concern about health hazards .
What is old is about to become new again , as compost latrines and biogas that “ sanitize ” human excreta are coming onto the market .
From an international perspective , the United States has long been out of step .
“ America has got to get engaged with the rest of the world , ” says Pachauri frankly .
“ There is a vast sea of humanity elsewhere , whose stability , state of peace , and security matters to the United States .
As a model of freedom , universal human rights , and doing the right thing , the United States must now look at lifestyles and what its people have been consuming and set an example to the rest of the world by making a major shift to a sustainable pattern of development .
Nothing less than that is really going to help humanity . ”
Bridge Over Troubled Waters
The scientists and engineers know how to shift to the new paradigm .
“ We have the technology , ” says Biswas , “ and we have the knowledge and capability . ”
What we do n’t have — or do n’t have enough of — is the desire .
By most expert accounts , actually , the social or political will is the single most important factor in whether or not we — the collective ‘ we ’ of humanity — have enough water to drink in coming decades .
The bridges to a sustainable future are there for the making and “ the will is all we need , ” says Pachauri .
Although Americans may be out of step , we are also the ones being tapped to step up onto the international stage and blaze the path to sustainability .
“ That ’s because the United States is a remarkable country , where if people decide to do something , it gets done , ” he notes .
There ’s no time like the present .
Climate change is here .
The forces of the global consumer economy are clashing with the Earth ’s economy as Wall Street investors eye water as the market ’s next big hard asset .
Acquiring the will now is going to take real , bona fide change , a message that has not entirely sunk in across the board of civilization .
“ Some people just want to go back to where they can consume as they wish and just do it green , ” says Rasmussen .
“ The dominant economic school in this country views the human economy as an abstraction , as something inside its own box .
But it ’s not something inside its own box .
It is in the economy of the Earth .
They need to make that connection — and , so far , they have n’t . ”
The only way , really , to make that connection is by breaking the grip of the global consumer culture , accepting our place and role within the planetary biosphere , and living , as Rasmussen says , in “ an Earth - honoring way . ”
In order to effect that nationally and then globally , we will have to wipe out deeply imprinted notions like “ greed is good , ” “ bigger is better , ” and “ success is defined by stuff , ” and replace them with more noble principles and ideals , a deeper respect for life , and truer , more honest and equitable morals .
But how do we instill respect and honesty and equity in a world gone so disrespectful , so dishonest , so inequitable ?
Adapting an approach from author James Baldwin , Rasmussen suggests we start by “ doing our first works over . ”
In other words , “ reexamine everything from its onset and tell the truth about it , as best we can , ” he says .
We need to own up , admit our mistakes , our ignorance , and most of all our greedy consumption .
We would do well to take our cue from the planet herself , where recycling is fundamental , as he writes in Earth Community , Earth Ethics , where order thrives on diversity and perishes in the imbalance of uniformity .
There are people around the world who have made the connection , who are right now stepping away from the hard path of reckless use of resources and , as Rasmussen puts it , “ finding happiness and well - being not in being global consumers , but in something else . ”
Their numbers are growing , but the critical mass needed to cause the shift to turn tidal is not yet there .
Riding the wave all the way into shore wo n’t be easy .
“ The importance of water to life means that providing for water needs and demands will never be free of politics , ” reminds Gleick .
But cooperation and collaboration can , and in recent years , have gone a long way in places you ’d least expect it .
“ Take Bhutan , ” offers Biswas .
“ It had lowest per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the whole of South Asia 20 years ago .
Then , Bhutan ’s king enlisted its powerful neighbor , India , to help it build a small hydropower plant .
After taking only the energy it needed , Bhutan agreed to sell the rest to India at a mutually agreed low price for the planning , designing , constructing , and running of the plant .
As a result , Bhutan now boasts one of the highest per capita GDPs in South Asia and the two countries have expanded their relationship , ” he says .
“ By 2020 , there is no question that Bhutan will have by far the highest per capita GDP simply by cooperating with India in the area of water development . ”
Ultimately , it is not governments , but people , who hold the power .
“ People who are interested in maintaining high - quality , natural environments outnumber those who think they are unimportant and not worth preserving , ” says Graf .
“ The nation has decided , for example , that we ’re dedicated to protecting endangered species .
It ’s the wild things that are driving river policy and river science in the United States these days .
So , I think the decision to preserve and restore will win out . ”
The $ 64 billion question is : Will it win out soon enough ?
“ All manner of people now are thinking about that , ” says Rasmussen .
There ’s hope to be found in that — people thinking — and the conservation and restoration efforts that have been made and succeeded .
A number of riparian species driven to near extinction during the last 50 years are coming back .
The migrating population of whooping cranes was on the brink , down to just 15 birds in 1941 after dams changed the morphology of the Platte River , their “ hotel ” during migration between Texas and Canada .
“ Today , we have more than 200 migrating whooping cranes , ” notes Graf .
The story of the near loss of the country ’s symbol , the American bald eagle , due to DDT poisoning is well known , and there are many other indigenous birds and animals and plants on the comeback trail .
“ Huge damage has occurred to [ various ] populations and it ’s going to take a lot of skill and money to get them healthy again , but there ’s good news too , ” Graf says .
“ Rivers here in South Carolina you would n’t have wanted to go near in the 1960s or 1970s are places I now take my kayak on a Friday afternoon .
We ’re taking dams out on small rivers now and maybe some day we will take them out of larger rivers and learn how to walk on that softer path .
We have a long way to go , but we are making progress . ”
Since many people in the beginning will no doubt view necessary modifications as a threat to the lifestyle to which they ’ve become accustomed , leadership will be critical .
The world over , “ hope ” has become more than a campaign slogan as global leaders are turning now to America to carry the environmental torch down a new sustainable soft path .
“ Whether you ’re liberal or conservative , one way to read the election of President Barack Obama is that somehow we had gotten on the wrong track , ” Rasmussen reflects .
“ I take that kind of alarm , if you will , at the state of affairs to be a willingness to engage change on a rather large scale . ”
The up and coming younger generations are also giving these experts cause for hope .
“ There is a large effort to help the public be more environmentally literate and that education is starting to be more apparent in the younger kids who talk more about this than you ever thought they would , ” says Rabalais .
“ They are the ones , ” Pachauri offers , “ who could help put the genie back into the bottle . ”
As we look now to the future of a past that squandered Earth ’s resources , we know what we have to do .
“ The 20th century may be leaving us with a host of problems , but I ’ve also noted that it does seem darkest before the dawn , ” Walter Cronkite , one of America ’s greatest observers , noted before his passing in July of this year .
“ There ’s reason to hope for the 21st century , ” he said .
Every one of these experts — Biswas , Gleick , Graf , Pachauri , Rabalais , Rasmussen , and Sedlak — agree , and at the heart of that hope is water .
It is the lifeblood of Earth .
It is the lifeblood of every living thing .
It is our “ force . ”
It is what binds us together .
Without water , we shall perish from the Earth .

Recently by Matt Taibbi : Why Was Goldman Invited to the AIG Bailout Party ?
Laura Blankfein and her friend Susan Friedman , wife of another Goldman honcho , Richard Friedman , caused a huge scene at Super Saturday in the Hamptons last weekend when they arrived at the event before the noon start time and balked at waiting in line with the other ticket - holders .
 Their behavior was obnoxious .

I can’t believe I did n’t see this before .
Laura Blankfein going mental over having to wait on line at a charity dinner this is like the most awesome thing ever .
I can just imagine her the next morning , complaining to Lloyd while shining his head with Turtle Wax before he goes off to work .
Meanwhile this is more recent news , apparently :
Police in East Hampton , N.Y. , arrested the wife of longtime Goldman Sachs hedge fund guru Ray Iwanowski for drunk driving , according to The New York Post .
Jane Iwanowski , 48 , crashed her BMW into a tree in July .
A police report stated an intoxicated Iwanowski was unable to walk or stand ,  when questioned while at a hospital .
Fun times in the fast lane !

A Growing Epidemic
What is Internet addiction and how much time online is too much ?
How young is too young for children to go online ?
What can you do to better manage your technology use in your daily life ?
I address these questions and more in my first TED talk .
I launched the first study on Internet addiction in 1995 , I wrote “ Caught in the Net ” in 1998 , the first book to treat Internet addiction , and I have worked ever since to develop and discuss research and treatment for this rapidly evolving problem .

Medical tort reform is moving to the fore of the health care debate .
On Sunday in The New York Times , former Senator Bill Bradley , Democrat of New Jersey , argued that one way to gain support of both Democrats and Republicans might be to combine universal coverage with tort reform .
Mr. Bradley also suggested that medical courts with special judges could be established , similar to bankruptcy or admiralty courts .
On “ This Week With George Stephanopoulos , ” Senators Orrin G. Hatch , Republican of Utah , and John Kerry , Democrat of Massachusetts , seemed to agree that medical malpractice lawsuits are driving up health care costs and should be limited in some way .
“ We ’ve got to find some way of getting rid of the frivolous cases , and most of them are , ” Mr. Hatch said .
“ And that ’s doable , most definitely , ” Mr. Kerry replied .
But some academics who study the system are less certain .
One critic is Tom Baker , a professor of law and health sciences at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law and author of “ The Medical Malpractice Myth , ” who believes that making the legal system less receptive to medical malpractice lawsuits will not significantly affect the costs of medical care .
He spoke with the freelance writer Anne Underwood .
Q .
A lot of people seem to have taken up the cause of tort reform .
Why is n’t it included in the health care legislation pending on Capitol Hill ?
A .
Because it ’s a red herring .
It ’s become a talking point for those who want to obstruct change .
But [ tort reform ] does n’t accomplish the goal of bringing down costs .
Q .
Why not ?
A .
As the cost of health care goes up , the medical liability component of it has stayed fairly constant .
That means it ’s part of the medical price inflation system , but it ’s not driving it .
The number of claims is small relative to actual cases of medical malpractice .
Q .
But critics of the current system say that 10 to 15 percent of medical costs are due to medical malpractice .
A .
That ’s wildly exaggerated .
According to the actuarial consulting firm Towers Perrin , medical malpractice tort costs were $ 30.4 billion in 2007 , the last year for which data are available .
We have a more than a $ 2 trillion health care system .
That puts litigation costs and malpractice insurance at 1 to 1.5 percent of total medical costs .
That ’s a rounding error .
Liability is n’t even the tail on the cost dog .
It ’s the hair on the end of the tail .
Q .
You said the number of claims is relatively small .
Is there a way to demonstrate that ?
A .
We have approximately the same number of claims today as in the late 1980s .
Think about that .
The cost of health care has doubled since then .
The number of medical encounters between doctors and patients has gone up — and research shows a more or less constant rate of errors per hospitalizations .
That means we have a declining rate of lawsuits relative to numbers of injuries .
Q .
Do you have numbers on injuries and claims ?
A .
The best data on medical errors come from three major epidemiological studies on medical malpractice in the 1970s , 1980s and 1990s .
Each found about one serious injury per 100 hospitalizations .
There has n’t been an epidemiological study since then , because people were really persuaded by the data and it ’s also very expensive to do a study of that sort .
These data were the basis of the 1999 report from the Institute of Medicine , “ To Err Is Human . ”
Q .
And what percent of victims make claims ?
A .
Those same studies looked at the rate of claims and found that only 4 to 7 percent of those injured brought a case .
That ’s a small percentage .
And because the actual number of injuries has gone up since those studies were done — while claims have remained steady — the rate of claims is actually going down .
Q .
So the idea that there are lots of frivolous lawsuits is . . .
A .
Ludicrous .
Q .
In those cases that are brought , are jury awards excessive ?
A .
There are already caps on awards in many states .
These tend to be on non-economic damages — not medical expenses or lost wages , but typically on pain and suffering .
The first was in California in the 1970s .
There is pretty good research on that , showing it reduced medical liability payments .
These caps vary from state to state , but they ’re generally set around $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 .
Q .
Many people would think that a quarter - million to a half - million dollars is a lot of money for pain and suffering .
A .
When California adopted its cap in the mid-1970s , it set it at $ 250,000 .
That does n’t mean everyone got that much .
It was the maximum .
But that was considered a fair amount at the time .
Since then , think how much inflation has eaten into that .
These caps typically do n’t index for inflation .
Q .
So a patient can get reimbursed for medical costs , but they ’re limited for pain and suffering .
A . They get reimbursement of medical costs in principle .
But in fact , they do n’t , because the lawyer has to be paid .
These cases can cost $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 to bring , so the patient has to deduct that amount from any award .
Q .
Why are these cases so expensive ?
A .
You need expert witnesses who must be compensated for their time , which is valuable .
You need depositions , which are expensive .
You have to hire investigators .
You have to pay your junior staff .
It ’s not worth bringing a suit if the potential award is less .
Imagine you go to the emergency room with appendicitis .
For whatever reason , they fail to diagnose it .
Your appendix bursts , and you spend a couple weeks in the hospital .
I ’ve had lawyers tell me they would not take a case like that , even if it ’s a slam - dunk .
The damages would n’t be enough — medical expenses , maybe a month of lost salary , although the patient might have short - term disability insurance that would cover a large part of that .
It ’s not enough to justify going to court .
Q .
So you ’re saying that a case has to be serious to be worth trying .
A .
The medical malpractice system only works for serious injuries .
What it does n’t work for is more moderate ones .
Lawyers discourage people from bringing suits if their injuries are not serious in monetary terms — a poor person or an older person who ca n’t claim a lot in lost wages .
That ’s why obstetrician - gynecologists pay such high premiums .
If you injure a baby , you ’re talking about a lifetime - care injury .
Gerontologists ’ premiums are exceedingly low .
That ’s the reason I say if people are serious about tort reform , they should improve compensation for moderate injuries .
Nobody likes that idea , by the way .
They say it would make the system more expensive , not less expensive .
More people would bring claims .
That says to me that the critics are not serious about tort reform .
Q .
But it ’s not just the cost of premiums and litigation .
What about the charge that it causes doctors to practice “ defensive medicine , ” ordering tests that are expensive and unnecessary ?
A .
A 1996 study in Florida found defensive medicine costs could be as high as 5 to 7 percent .
But when the same authors went back a few years later , they found that managed care had brought it down to 2.5 to 3.5 percent of the total .
No one has a good handle on defensive medicine costs .
Liability is supposed to change behavior , so some defensive medicine is good .
Undoubtedly some of it may be unnecessary , but we do n’t have a good way to separate the two .
Q .
Tell me more about the 1996 study .
A .
It was published in The Quarterly Journal of Economics by Stanford economist Daniel Kessler and Dr. Mark McClellan , who was head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services under President George W. Bush .
For two types of heart disease — heart attacks and ischemic heart disease — the authors found that 5 to 7 percent of the additional costs in Florida , compared to other states with lower medical malpractice liability , could be attributed to defensive medicine .
This was based on 1980s data .
Using that estimate , some politicians used to say that medical malpractice cost the system $ 50 billion a year .
But you ca n’t blindly say that all diseases are the same as heart disease , and if you want a nationwide estimate , you ca n’t say every state is the same as Florida .
Furthermore , the second study , published in 2002 in The Journal of Public Economics , found that much of the difference disappeared as managed care took hold in Florida in the 1990s .
Q .
But many doctors complain about having to practice defensive medicine .
A .
Doctors will say that .
But when you dig down , you find that what ’s really happening is that doctors tend to do what other doctors around them do .
They go along with the prevailing standard of care in their region — which in many cases is n’t even a state , but a city or county .
Q .
If medical malpractice does n’t explain the high costs of our health - care system , what does ?
A .
A variety of things .
The American population is aging .
We ’ve had advances in technology that are expensive .
We ’re also a rich nation , and the richer you get , the more money you spend on health care .
And compared to other countries , we have heavy administrative costs from the private - insurance system .
Q .
If it ’s not true that medical malpractice is driving the high cost of medical care in this country , why wo n’t the argument go away ?
A .
It makes sense to people intuitively — in part , because they ’ve been told it so often .
And it ’s a convenient argument for those who want to derail the process .
Maybe it ’s a deep political game .
Maybe they ’re raising it to say , we ’ll back off tort reform if you back off the public option .
Q .
What about former Senator Bill Bradley ’s idea that medical courts with special judges should be established ?
A .
Mr. Bradley has been backing tort reform for as long as I can remember , so this is hardly a compromise for him .
I ’m not saying medical courts would be a bad idea , as long as they ’re not set up in a way that insulates medical providers from responsibility .
That ’s a big caveat .
Q .
What about Senator John Kerry ’s assertion that it ’s “ doable ” to rid the system of frivolous lawsuits ?
A .
I guess it ’s doable because there are n’t very many frivolous suits .

If you have a marital settlement agreement requiring alimony payments in New Jersey , or if the court ordered alimony in your New Jersey divorce case , the court has the power to order changes to the payments under certain conditions .
Unless the alimony order or your agreement provided that neither spouse could request a modification ( change ) , the court can alter the payment amount or end the payments entirely if circumstances change considerably after the initial award .
A decrease in the income of a paying spouse due to uncontrollable factors , such as job loss , can ordinarily be the basis for a modification .
Whether or not retirement calls for a decrease will depend on all of the circumstances in your case .
Normal Retirement Age
A paying spouse who has reached a normal retirement age ( generally considered to be approximately 65 , or the eligibility age for social security retirement benefits ) is entitled to a court hearing to determine whether the retirement has resulted in changed circumstances calling for a reduction in alimony payments to the supported spouse .
The court will look at whether the retirement was reasonable under all the circumstances of the particular case or whether it was motivated primarily by a desire to reduce alimony .
A court can consider any relevant factors , including :
the ages and health of both spouses
the retiring spouse ’s occupation
whether the retirement was mandatory or voluntary
whether the retirement happened earlier than was expected at the time of the initial alimony order or agreement , and
the impact of the retirement on the overall economic circumstances of each spouse .
Early Retirement
When retirement occurs before the usual age of 65 or so , the court will look more closely at the reasons .
In addition to considering the reasonableness of the retirement and the retiring spouse ’s motivation , a New Jersey court will also balance the interests of the retiring spouse against the interests of the supported spouse .
A spouse who has good reasons for retiring early , such as a significant financial incentive , legitimate health concerns , or high physical demands of the former occupation , will not necessarily have to continue paying alimony at the pre-retirement level , especially where the effect of a reduction on the supported spouse would be minimal .
A spouse who simply desires an easier life , on the other hand , will not be permitted to reduce payments if the supported spouse would be left with a considerable shortfall in the ability to cover necessary expenses .
In this situation , the court wo n’t order the paying spouse not to retire , but it also wo n’t relieve the spouse of the payment obligation .
Planning for Retirement
The best course of action is to address potential retirement before a divorce is final .
A marital settlement agreement can and should take into account the paying spouse 's probable age of retirement and ensure that a supported spouse is not taken by surprise with a sudden and unanticipated drop in income .
While it may be difficult to plan for the effects of a future event , it will usually be even more difficult to go through a court proceeding to settle the matter later .
If your agreement or alimony award did n't take retirement into account , the next best course of action is to try to negotiate an acceptable solution , such as a gradual reduction in payments to allow the supported spouse time to adjust .
If negotiations fail , the paying spouse will not ordinarily be able to request a reduction until after the actual retirement , as courts wo n’t order modifications based on future events .
This can make the decision to retire risky .
If you are the one who is planning to retire , try to assess the impact on both you and your former spouse before making any decisions that you may not be able to take back .
While there are no guarantees , you will generally have a much better chance of success with your motion if you have already reached social security retirement age or are retiring because you have no choice in the matter .
If you are n’t certain what the result is likely to be in your particular case , contact an attorney for assistance .

Lead Poisoning Associated with Use of Traditional Ethnic Remedies -- California , 1991 - 1992
Exposure to lead - based paint is the leading cause of high - dose lead exposure among children in the United States .
However , previous reports have documented childhood lead poisoning related to the use of traditional ethnic remedies ( 1 - 4 ) , and such exposures may not be considered routinely .
This article describes a case report of lead poisoning resulting from use of a traditional ethnic remedy and summarizes the identification of this problem as a result of lead poisoning surveillance in California from December 1991 through December 1992 .
Case Report
In March 1992 , a 2 - year - old boy of Mexican origin was tested for lead poisoning as part of a routine well - child examination in Los Angeles .
His blood lead level ( BLL ) was 83 ug / dL , a level classified by CDC as a medical emergency .
The child had no apparent clinical manifestations , and his mother was unaware of obvious sources of lead exposure , including traditional ethnic remedies .
However , when the term " greta " ( a traditional Mexican remedy employed as a laxative ) was used in the interview , the mother acknowledged giving the boy this remedy regularly since he was 8 months of age .
Analysis of Surveillance in California From December 1 , 1991 , through December 31 , 1992 , the California Department of Health Services received reports of 40 cases of BLLs greater than or equal to 20 ug / dL in children who had received traditional ethnic remedies ( Table 1 ) .
BLLs ranged from 20 ug / dL to 86 ug / dL ( median : 33 ug / dL ) .
Ages of the children ranged from 8 months to 5 years ( median : 2 years ) .
Of the 36 children for whom sex was known , 27 ( 75 % ) were male .
Of the 37 children with known surnames , 33 ( 89 % ) had Hispanic surnames ; two ( 5 % ) , Asian / Pacific Islander ; and two ( 5 % ) , Asian Indian .
More than half ( 57 % ) of the children resided in southern California , 24 % in the San Francisco Bay area , 12 % in the Central Valley , and 7 % in rural northern California .
By comparison , 72 % of all publicly funded childhood blood lead screening tests were performed in southern California , 11 % in the Bay area , 14 % in the Central Valley , and 3 % in rural northern California .
Of the 40 children , 24 were asymptomatic ; of these , five had BLLs greater than 50 ug / dL , including two in whom the BLL was greater than 80 ug / dL .
For 36 of the 40 cases , the traditional remedies reported were the Hispanic remedies azarcon or greta .
Other remedies were paylooah ( Southeast Asia , two cases ) , surma ( India , one case ) , and an unnamed ayurvedic substance from Tibet ( one case ) .
In many cases , family members initially denied remedy use but reported such use during subsequent case follow - up efforts .
Results of environmental investigations were available for 18 of the 40 children .
For seven of these children , investigators identified other environmental lead sources at levels that probably contributed to the exposures .
These sources included paint ( levels greater than 5000 parts per million { ppm} , maximum of 150,000 ppm ) , bean pots or other large hollowware ( leaching greater than 1 ppm lead ) , and soil ( lead levels above 500 ppm ) .

Lead Poisoning Prevention Br , Div of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects , National Center for Environmental Health , CDC .
Editorial Note Editorial Note :
In this report , more than half the children had clinically inapparent cases of lead poisoning ; nearly all were identified as a result of routine screening of children that had been initiated in California in late November 1991 .
All of these children had BLLs that substantially exceeded the CDC level of concern ( 10 ug / dL ) ( 5 ) .
Investigation of these cases resulted in the recognition that traditional ethnic medicines may be used not only to treat abdominal complaints but also to prevent illness .
Although neurobehavioral development may be impaired in children with BLLs as low as 10 ug / dL ( 6 - 8 ) , overt manifestations of lead poisoning generally may not be detected until BLLs exceed 50 ug / dL ( 9 ) .
Frank encephalopathy has been noted in children with levels as low as 70 ug / dL ( 10 ) .
The detection of BLLs greater than 50 ug / dL in children who were asymptomatic underscores the role of screening as a means for identifying children with dangerous levels of lead exposure .
The reluctance of family members to report the use of traditional ethnic medicines during initial interviews may reflect factors such as uncertainty about the legality of using such medicines , belief in the effectiveness of these remedies , and concerns regarding responsibility for the child 's elevated BLL .
In addition , because some persons may not consider these substances to be " remedies " or " medicines , " health - care providers and public health investigators should ask about the use of these substances by their common names .
The finding of additional sources of lead probably contributing to exposure in seven cases underscores the importance of searching for all possible sources of lead exposure in cases of lead poisoning .
Health professionals serving communities with high - risk populations should be aware of these high - dose sources of lead exposure .
Education of parents about the risks of administering lead - containing substances to their children should be a routine part of health - care maintenance in such high - risk groups or settings .

Jenny Sanford , South Carolina 's first lady , announces that she is moving out of the governor 's mansion .
Jenny Sanford out of gov's mansion
Jenny Sanford , South Carolina ’s first lady , announced Friday that she is moving out of the governor ’s mansion .
“ I am so thankful for the overwhelming support and prayers we have received from people all across South Carolina .
I am literally in awe of how blessed we are to have such love and support from family and friends , old and new , ” the wife of GOP Gov. Mark Sanford said in a statement .

“ It is with this support , and after much careful and prayerful consideration , that I have decided to move back to our home in Charleston with our sons for the upcoming school year , ” she added .
“ From there , we will work to continue the process of healing our family . ”
The Sanford family just returned from a two - week trip to Europe , for which they left roughly a month after the governor admitted to an affair with an Argentine mistress .
The governor ’s first day back at work was Thursday .
The governor ’s wife played a key role throughout the scandal , taking a primary role in getting Sanford ’s GOP rivals in the state Legislature to quiet calls for his resignation .
Both she and her husband have said repeatedly that they intend to remain married and work out the problems caused by the affair , a sentiment Jenny repeated Friday .
“ While we will be leaving Columbia , we will return often , and I will remain engaged in activities in my role as first lady , acknowledging that my responsibilities to my family come first , ” South Carolina ’s first lady said .
“ Once again , when it comes to personal family matters like this , I respectfully ask that members of the media allow us to go on with our lives in peace . ”

In prepared remarks for a Congressional hearing obtained today by ABC News , former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson admits telling Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis that the Federal Reserve could remove the bank 's board members if they backed out of their proposed merger with Merrill Lynch last December .
On Thursday morning , Paulson will defend his actions before the House Oversight Committee in the last of three hearings that the panel has conducted on the controversial merger .
When Bank of America considered scuttling the merger last December after discovering a $ 12 billion loss at Merrill , Paulson told Lewis that such a decision , citing the " material adverse change " -- or MAC -- clause , would damage the entire financial system and could result in government - imposed changes in management .
" I mentioned the possibility that the Federal Reserve could remove management and the board of Bank of America if the bank invoked the MAC clause .
I believe my remarks to Mr. Lewis were appropriate , " he says .
Click Here To Read Paulson 's Full Prepared Testimony
" I explained to him that the government was supportive of Bank of America , but that it felt very strongly that if Bank of America exercised the MAC clause , such an action would show a colossal lack of judgment and would jeopardize Bank of America , Merrill Lynch , and the financial system , " Paulson continues .
" I intended to send a strong message . "
However , Paulson emphasizes that Fed Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke never asked him to indicate " any specific action the Federal Reserve might take . "
Rather , Paulson says he was simply expressing what he believed was " the strong opinion " held by the Fed -- and shared by the Treasury -- that a Bank of America pull - out was " not a legally viable option … threatened significant harm to Bank of America and to the financial system … [ and ] would raise serious questions about the competence and judgment of Bank of America 's management and board . "
The distinction is crucial because Bernanke told the House panel on June 25 that he had never personally threatened to remove Lewis or the bank 's board members .
In what became to some extent a question of semantics , Bernanke acknowledged that he did have concerns about the bank 's management .
In response , Rep. Jason Chaffetz , R - Utah , stated , " I 'm just not buying that .
I think that 's a threat . "
So did the government 's actions constitute a threat ?
An aide to the House panel 's majority staff said that Paulson 's testimony " supports the theory that Lewis was engaged in a shakedown . "
In the panel 's first hearing on the matter , held June 11 , Lewis gave the committee his impression of the government 's actions .
" I would say they strongly advised and they spoke in strong terms , but I thought it was with good intention , " he said .
Ultimately , Bank of America agreed to proceed with the deal and eventually received another $ 20 billion in taxpayer bailout money .
Whatever took place , Bernanke , Lewis , and Paulson all appear to agree on one thing : the merger was the right move .
" It 's protected our economy and it was a good deal for taxpayers , " Bernanke told the committee last month .
" I have nothing to regret about the whole transaction . "
In his prepared testimony , Paulson echoes those views .
" Bank of America 's completion of the merger , and the subsequent assistance from the government , not only protected our country 's financial system , but also was in the best interest of the shareholders , customers , employees , and creditors of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch , " he says .
Another question is when do the ends justify the means ?
" What we can take away from Mr. Paulson 's testimony is that his threat of removing management and the board of Bank of America was a strong message that he believed was consistent with the beliefs of the Treasury and the Fed , " said Kurt Bardella , spokesperson for Republicans on the House committee .
" The question that remains now is do committee Democrats believe that Secretary Paulson 's use of threats and intimidation were inappropriate or justified ? "
The committee 's ranking member Darrell Issa , R - Ohio , has accused the Fed of orchestrating a " shotgun wedding " and engaging in a " cover - up " to hide its involvement in the merger talks from other government agencies .
Overall , Paulson says that while the government 's responses " were not perfect , " but he adds , " I am confident that our responses were substantially correct and that they saved this nation from great peril . "
" Without the actions taken in 2008 , that suffering would have been far more profound and disturbing , " he says , noting , " The most dire of consequences were averted . "

Dick Bent to RCMP deputy commissioner Al Macintyre , suggests for the first time that the four Mounties who responded to a call at the airport planned to use a Taser against Mr. Dziekanski -- contrary to what they testified during the inquiry .
Mr. Dziekanski , 40 , died after being hit five times with a Taser by RCMP officers in October , 2007 .
The e-mail , dated Nov. 5 , 2007 , said : “ Finally , spoke to Wayne [ Rideout , the former commanding officer in charge of investigating Mr. Dziekanski ’s death ] and he indicated that the members did not articulate that they saw the symptoms of excited delirium , but instead had discussed the response en route and decided that if he did not comply that they would go to CEW [ conducted energy weapon ] .
“ He has asked investigators for a synopsis and should have it by noon tomorrow . ”
Lawyer Helen Roberts , who represents the RCMP , broke into tears as she told retired judge Thomas Braidwood that her office received the e-mail in late April but never opened the CD for the document files until last week .
“ I do say , it was by oversight that this occurred , ” she said .
“ Canada continues , as it has all along , to fully support the work of this commission . ”
Ms. Roberts said Bent was mistaken in his e-mail and that the officers did not formulate a plan to use the Taser as soon as possible .
“ As a result of [ our office ’s discovery ] of this e-mail ... the IHIT [ Integrated Homicide Investigation Team ] file has been searched and there is no evidence in the IHIT file that the members formulated a plan to use the Taser prior to the encounter with Mr. Dziekanski , ” Ms. Roberts explained .
“ It is our conclusion from these interviews that Chief Supt .
Bent must have misunderstood information provided to him by Supt. Rideout . ”
The lawyers for the four RCMP officers said their clients deny they formulated a plan to Taser Mr. Dziekanski .
RCMP Commissioner William Elliott echoed Robert ’s statement that the e-mail was not released to the inquiry due to an “ oversight . ”
“ Unfortunately in an exercise of this magnitude , such an oversight can occur , ” Mr. Elliott said in a news release Friday .
He said the RCMP will “ continue to co-operate fully with the inquiry . ”
Braidwood decided the e-mail will require new testimony , so he adjourned the inquiry until Sept. 22 .
“ I find the delay in disclosing this material to the commission to be appalling , ” Mr. Braidwood said .
Commission counsel Art Vertlieb said the late disclosure of the e-mail as evidence had resulted in a “ complete disruption of the process . ”
“ It ’s a stunning turn of events , ” Don Rosenbloom , the lawyer representing the government of Poland at the inquiry , told reporters after the commissioner ordered the adjournment .
“ The documents that have just come to our attention include a critical e-mail from very high up in the RCMP chain of command , disclosing that the officers decided in a premeditated way , ‘ en route ’ to the scene , to use the Taser if Mr. Dziekanski did not comply . ”
Mr. Rosenbloom said the 11th - hour disclosure “ is totally inconsistent with testimony given under oath . ”
Mr. Rosenbloom added the e-mail goes to the heart of the issue of police fabrication .
During the hearing , he said , “ we were alleging they [ the four Mounties involved in the airport incident ] were fabricating their story . ”
The inquiry was supposed to have ended its public hearings on Friday .
Mr. Dziekanski , who did not speak English , had been travelling for more than 24 hours when he died .
He had been in the airport for more than nine hours , looking for his mother .

Mr Green says he does not want " special treatment " A Tory MP has claimed a " small but significant victory for freedom " after police agreed to delete his DNA record .
But Damian
Green says he wants the same right extended to all innocent people on the police database - rather than " special treatment " for public figures .
The shadow immigration minister was arrested last year as part of a Home Office leak inquiry but never charged .
The Home Office said it was consulting on proposals that " will ensure that the right people are on the database " .
The government has yet to respond to a European Court ruling banning the retention of innocent people 's DNA .
Mr Green , whose arrest in November last year sparked a political storm , told BBC News : " The police have now agreed that they will delete my DNA fingerprint and my police national computer record as I have been requesting ever since I was cleared . "
He described the decision as a " small but significant victory for freedom and privacy in this country - but what is really important now is that I do n't get special treatment just because I am a public figure " .
In a letter to the MP , the Metropolitan Police said his case could be treated as " exceptional " .
' Disgraceful behaviour ' But Mr Green said : " There are hundreds of thousands of other people who were in the same position as me ... where they are completely innocent and yet the police are going to hang on forever to all their details .
" I just think that 's intolerable in a democratic society .
People have a democratic right to privacy and the law needs to be changed . "
Police claim the DNA database is a vital tool in the detection of violent crime - but campaigners say it is an infringement of civil liberties .
Last year , the European Court said rules allowing police in England , Wales and Northern Ireland to retain indefinitely the genetic profiles of everyone arrested for a recordable offence were indiscriminate and must be scrapped .
There are different rules in Scotland .
Our proposals will ensure that the right people are on the database , as well as considering when people should come off
Home Office
The Home Office has just completed a three - month consultation on the European ruling but has yet to issue definitive guidance to police forces .
It could order 850,000 of the 4.5 million DNA profiles held on the police database to be deleted - but details of those cleared of crimes - or never even charged - will still be held for six years , or 12 in cases of serious violent or sexual offences .
A Home Office spokesman told the BBC : " We are clear that the DNA database plays a vital role in helping us protect the public by preventing crime and bringing offenders to justice .
" We are currently consulting on proposals that will comply with the court 's judgment while maintaining public protection .
" Our proposals will ensure that the right people are on the database , as well as considering when people should come off .
" We are committed to putting in place an evidence - based retention regime , which has public support and enhances public protection . "
' More transparency '
The spokesman said to this end the Home Office intend to " make the existing exceptional case procedure more open and transparent " by putting the criteria for early deletion in legislation and by placing reporting requirements on the process .
Mr Green said : " I think the government is behaving pretty disgracefully , they 've been told by the European Court that the current policy is illegal and they are dragging their feet as slowly as possible , supported , I am afraid to say , by senior police . "
And he hit back at claims by supporters of the current rules that DNA has been invaluable in solving thousands of " cold cases " , saying that although it had a role to play retaining the DNA of innocent people risked " alienating the vast majority of respectable people from the police " .
He said the Conservatives wanted to adopt the system used in Scotland where " if you are innocent your details are not kept on the database unless there is a sex crime accusation involved or a particularly violent crime " when it is kept for a maximum of three or five years .
In July , the Association of Chief Police Officers advised forces in England , Wales and Northern Ireland not to remove records from the DNA database until the Home Office has finalised its response .
In a letter to chief constables , seen by the BBC , ACPO says it strongly advises " that decisions to remove records should not be based on proposed changes " .

On July 20 , 1969 , astronauts stepped onto the moon and planted an American flag — not to claim the moon but simply to commemorate the U.S. role in the first moon landing .
Forty years later a Nevada entrepreneur says he owns the moon and that he 's interim president of the first known galactic government .
Dennis Hope , head of the Lunar Embassy Corporation , has sold real estate on the moon and other planets to about 3.7 million people so far .
As his customer base grew , he said , buyers wanted assurances that their property rights would be protected .
So Hope started his own government in 2004 , which has a ratified constitution , a congress , a unit of currency — even a patent office .
" We 're now a fully realized sovereign nation , " Hope said .
The trouble is that , legally , nobody can own the moon or anything else in space , for that matter , said Tanja Masson - Zwaan , president of the International Institute of Space Law , based in the Netherlands .
" What Lunar Embassy is doing does not give people buying pieces of paper the right to ownership of the moon , " she said .
Lunar Loophole ?
The controversy began in 1980 , when Hope registered his claim to the moon with the United Nations .
The claim went unanswered , so he figured his rights were secured .
To date his company has sold more than 2,500,000 1 - acre ( 0.4 - hectare ) plots of lunar land , which Hope says are rich in an isotope of helium that has an earthly price tag of about U.S. $ 125,000 an ounce .
Today a deed for a plot , printed with the buyer 's name , is selling online for $ 22.49 , plus tax .
Legal experts counter that the UN did n't answer because it did n't have to :
The moon is unclaimable under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty , which has so far been ratified by 100 UN member countries , including the United States .
Hope , however , said there 's a loophole .
The treaty prohibits countries from claiming property in space , but " I filed my claim of ownership as an individual . "
The fact that he's now claiming his Galactic Government has legal authority over the moon might seem problematic .
But Hope said that the fledgling regime is n't a member of the UN and so does n't have to abide by its laws .
Regardless of his current stance , Hope 's original claim to the moon is simply not legal , the space - law institute 's Masson - Zwaan asserts .
The UN treaty does apply to governments and their private citizens , which invalidates Hope 's claim to the moon and other celestial bodies , she said .
But that should n't disappoint any prospective moon millionaires .
You do n't need to own a place to make money on it , Masson - Zwaan said .
But you do need a clear legal framework for doing business on the property — something the moon currently lacks .
A separate 1979 treaty known as the Moon Agreement sets up a framework for establishing clearer rules for managing the moon 's natural resources , once the use of those resources becomes feasible .
Such rules would apply to businesses looking to establish hotels , mining operations , and other commercial endeavors on the moon .
That agreement , however , has been ratified by just 13 countries , none of which are major spacefaring states .
Moon " Just Another Continent "
One of the main hang - ups with the 1979 treaty is how countries would share the wealth .
Some scientists think stores of helium - 3 , for example , could make the moon the next Persian Gulf .
The gas , which is rare on Earth , has been tagged as a clean , renewable energy source of the future .
For billions of years the moon , unprotected by an atmosphere , has been showered with particles from the sun .
This includes an as - yet undetermined amount of helium - 3 , which is now trapped in the moon 's soil .
Its use as a fuel , though , hinges on developing a reliable process for fusion , a form of power generation that 's " like a controlled hydrogen bomb explosion , " said Peter Kokh , president of the nonprofit Moon Society .
Other more immediate uses for the moon include mining moondust for lunar construction , launching satellites , and setting up solar - power collectors , Kokh said — projects for the first wave of moon settlers .
The moon " is just another continent across a different kind of sea , " he said .
" We foresee a future in which people will be living on the moon and producing materials for solving Earth 's problems . "
United States of the Moon ?
Kokh personally thinks that the best possible future is one in which the people of the moon rule themselves .
The process of colonizing the moon 's challenging landscape will change the needs and wants of the society that settles there — just as the desires of English colonists changed when they got to the New World .
" Lunar settlers may want to bring the American way of life to the moon , but they will leave Washington , D.C. , at home , " he said .
" In the meantime it'd be better to have UN stewardship , " Kokh said .
" Right now [ the world has ] a working international relationship in the International Space Station ... and that 's a good precedent . "
Space - law expert Masson - Zwaan agrees , saying that the first bases built on the moon should be cooperative projects .
" I do n't think we 'll have people putting in their flags and saying , This is my little square , and I 'm going to build a base here , " she said .
Lunar Embassy 's Hope , meanwhile , already seems to be charging toward establishing an autonomous moon government .
Recently , Hope said , he 's been sending letters on behalf of his government asking other countries not to trespass on the moon without a license .
He 's also battling the International Monetary Fund for official recognition of his government 's currency , called the delta .
" The position of the Galactic Government is that we 're not trying to distance ourselves from other governments .
We just want recognition so we can work together , " Hope said .
An ATM vendor has succeeded in getting a security talk pulled from the upcoming Black Hat conference after a researcher announced he would demonstrate a vulnerability in the system .
Barnaby Jack , a researcher with Juniper Networks , was to present a demonstration showing how he could “ jackpot ” a popular ATM brand by exploiting a vulnerability in its software .
Jack was scheduled to present his talk at the upcoming Black Hat security conference being held in Las Vegas at the end of July .
But on Monday evening , his employer released a statement saying it was canceling the talk due to the vendor ’s intervention .
“ Juniper believes that Jack ’s research is important to be presented in a public forum in order to advance the state of security , ” the statement read .
“ However , the affected ATM vendor has expressed to us concern about publicly disclosing the research findings before its constituents were fully protected .
Considering the scope and possible exposure of this issue on other vendors , Juniper decided to postpone Jack ’s presentation until all affected vendors have sufficiently addressed the issues found in his research . ”
In the description of his talk on the conference web site , Jack wrote that , “ The most prevalent attacks on Automated Teller Machines typically involve the use of card skimmers , or the physical theft of the machines themselves .
Rarely do we see any targeted attacks on the underlying software .
This presentation will retrace the steps I took to interface with , analyze , and find a vulnerability in a line of popular new model ATM’s .
The presentation will explore both local and remote attack vectors , and finish with a live demonstration of an attack on an unmodified , stock ATM … ”
He can present it later .
Missing the thrill of dazzling his peers ai n’t as important as satisfying the goal of communicating security flaws to all concerned parties .
Especially since Juniper participated in that decision .

Charles Wright , a 50 - year - old gay man and former vice - president of
Cleveland ’s National Organization for Women , regularly escorts women
into the Akron Women ’s Medical Group , along with his partner , Tom Reke .
Women seeking care are often confronted by hostile right - wing
protesters opposed to a women ’s right to choose .
But on July 18 , things became violent when Wright was physically
assaulted by one of the right - wingers , who broke six of Wright ’s ribs .
The assailant , whose name is unknown , is a member of the extreme - right
religious group Jericho Riders Motorcycle Ministry , which regularly
preaches homophobic and anti-women rhetoric .
The Jericho Riders arrived
at the Akron , Ohio , clinic to join protesters harassing women seeking
safe abortions .
The assailant saw Charles and Tom embracing each other and began
yelling homophobic slurs at the couple .
When Charles vocally expressed
his offense at the comments , he was assaulted .
His aggressor rode off
on his motorcycle immediately after .

The Akron Police Department , whose precinct is across the street
from the clinic , did not respond until long after the assailant had
left the scene .
The protesters refused to give the name of the
assailant , claiming that they did not know him .
However , Charles and
Tom both witnessed the protesters greeting the assailant with a
familiar " welcome , brother ! "
The Akron police are treating the incident
as simple assault — as opposed to felonious assault — which means they will
make no effort to investigate the crime .
A protest was held on Aug. 1 to demand justice for Wright and call
for an end to the attacks on LGBT and women ’s rights .

Boys Tragic Death Could Have Happened To Any Family With 20 Foot Python
The arrogance of the advice - givers .
One remarkable thing about watching the Middle East is how what ’s celebrated as brilliant in Europe or America is errant nonsense .
Writing such stuff makes people successful and gives them an audience of millions .
What they say is so ridiculous that one wants to laugh , yet so totally accepted as true in Washington and European capitals that the laughter would be laughed at .
The article to which I refer is by Jacob Weisberg in the June 22 Newsweek , entitled , " A Friend in Need : Barack gets tough on Bibi . "
It is far more terrible because Weisberg is neither leftist nor anti-Israel but has simply imbibed what " everyone says . "
Let me quickly add that while I do n't know Weisberg personally , I 'm confident in saying he has no serious training in the Middle East , speaks neither Arabic nor Hebrew , spends little time researching the region , and has no real qualification for making the judgments he does .
Here 's the theme : Israelis are so stupid about their country , situation , and region on the life - and - death issues which they have been dealing with for decades that they must be saved in spite of themselves by people who have no knowledge or experience on any of these things .
No other country in the world is so frequently told this kind of thing which I hear all the time from Europeans , too .
Is it so hard to comprehend that our views and behavior are based on years of experience and study ?
That we know best how to save ourselves and have been doing a far better job of it , against tremendous odds and unhelpful kibbitzers , than many others ?
That heeding their prescriptions would be disastrous , in fact have already proven so ?
After all , the tragic history of the last 20 years has largely resulted from listening to the same advice he gives now .
When one tries to explain these things in conversations , however , you can see their eyes go blank and their ears close up .
Weisberg ’s article follows this pattern .
The United States , he says ( and these are main elements in the rhetoric among supporters of the Obama administration and several European governments ) must show Israel " tough love , " lean " harder on Jews and the Arabs to get serious about a deal , " and stop " fostering Israeli illusions that there [ is ] an alternative to trading land for peace . "
All three of these arguments are based on false premises .
Tough love :
This derives from the late 1980s and early 1990s when the left side of the Israeli spectrum was pushing the land - for - peace and negotiate with the PLO arguments against their rivals on the right .
A little U.S. pressure , they argued , would help get talks going .
A lot has happened since then , however , notably the 1992 -2000 Oslo process .
This proved to the vast majority of Israelis that the Palestinian leadership ( and Syria , too , for that matter ) was n’t ready or interested in peace .
Disillusioned , a lot of these people supported Ariel Sharon and the disengagement from the Gaza Strip , the results of which ( Hamas takeover , rocket fire ) made them even more disenchanted .
That 's why the Labour party­ which invented the land - for - peace argument in the first place and made the Oslo agreement and offered a two - state solution in 2000 ­is now in a coalition government with the Likud party .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not a " right - wing " or " hard - line " leader but someone who speaks for the national consensus , a consensus based on education through painful , bloody experience .
Israel also faces a more hostile Europe , an Iran racing toward nuclear weapons , an intransigent and incompetent Palestinian Authority , plus Hamas and Hizballah .
Today the last thing Israelis need or want is pressure to make more concessions to the Palestinians .
They ’ve already made a lot ; these did n’t lead anywhere good .
What Israel needs today is not " tough love " but real support .
Push " harder on Jews and the Arabs to get serious about a deal " :
The false assumption here is that getting an agreement , any agreement , is a desperate need of the two sides and of the region as a whole .
In fact , Israel is doing very well without any comprehensive peace agreement .
The economy is doing fine ; morale is high ; security improved .
Moreover , this concept pays no attention to the idea that a deal can be a bad one , inherently instable and leading to more violence .
It never enters the minds of these people that a " peace " agreement that was broken or had dangerous provisions ( giving up strategic territory ; east Jerusalem ; empowering a radical regime in a next - door Palestinian state ; opening the door to foreign Arab or Iranian armies entering ; bringing in millions of Palestinian Arabs to Israel ) could leave Israel far worse off .
As for the Palestinian leadership , far from being desperate for a deal it is desperate to avoid one on anything other than its own unrealistic terms .
Stop " fostering Israeli illusions that there [ is ] an alternative to trading land for peace . "
This one makes me laugh .
Everyone in Israel knows that there can be no comprehensive agreement without trading land for peace .
The question is , however , whether any comprehensive agreement on decent terms is possible at this time .
In addition , the question is also which land .
Israel has focused on three to five percent of the West Bank that is strategically important and has large concentrations of Israeli population .
Finally , if someone does n't understand that the barrier to peace is the Palestinians and not Israel , any advice they give Israel is going to be worthless .
As for those giving advice , here ’s what we ’ve seen in the last six months from those who want to " save " others by imposing their own vision :
-- The idea that stopping construction on Jewish settlements would bring some Arab concession has already proven wrong .
-- The idea that engagement with Iran would work has already proven wrong .
-- The idea that the United States could successfully engage Syria in a set of mutual compromises has already proven wrong .
-- The idea that an Obama charm offensive would bring higher levels of Arab support has already proven wrong .
And that 's just in six months !
Let ’s have a little humility and readiness to listen , please , from those who would play with the lives of other people .

That was fiction .
But this is not : a house that looks like it was transported directly from the cartoon world of The Simpsons onto a real world piece of land in Henderson , Nevada .
The house was built in 1997 as part of a contest .
The architects faced some challenges bringing the animated house to life .
It turned out that the TV show house did n’t have any load bearing walls .
The garage of the cartoon house was not physically large enough to contain a car ( much less all the stuff Homer borrowed from Flanders ) .
The land appropriated for the construction could only accommodate a 40 foot wide house — the TV version was deemed to be the equivalent of 50 feet .
And then there was the issue of the house itself changing over the years .
In the end , the architects figured that their real life house managed to incorporate 90 % of the cartoon version .
The house grounds even includes Bart ’s treehouse , a swing set and a back yard barbecue .
We think they did an outstanding job with the design .
Judge for yourself in the photos , below .
Unfortunately , the winner of the house giveaway contest chose an alternative cash prize .
The people who eventually ended up with the house painted the exterior a less cartoony color .
If you were to drive by the house today ( it ’s at 712 Red Bark Lane ) you probably would n’t know it was a Simpsons house . . . unless you were to look down at the sidewalk in front where Matt Groening , the Simpsons creator , drew a picture of Bart and signed his name .

The 4 Most Valuable Things I Learned in Business School
People often ask me if I have an MBA .
“ No , " I reply , “ but I did go to business school . "
I was fortunate enough to participate in the Carl H. Linder Honors - PLUS program at the University of Cincinnati , which is essentially an MBA at the undergraduate level .
As a result , I ’ve had the opportunity to experience what business schools teach without the enormous price tag .
Here are the four most important things I learned in business school :
1. Always Consider Opportunity Costs
Here ’s what I learned in finance class : whenever you choose to invest your time or money , you ’re simultaneously choosing not to do everything else you could potentially do with that investment .
The principle of opportunity cost applies to everything : every choice has hidden costs , whether you ’re buying groceries , quitting your day job , or taking on a new project .
Financial concepts like the “ Time Value of Money " and “ Net Present Value " are essentially methods of quantifying opportunity costs - given a particular timeframe and what you know about your next - best potential return , you can figure out whether or not a particular investment is worth the asking price .
The more you can uncover the implicit costs behind the decisions you intend to make before you move forward , the better your decisions will be .
2. All Prices are Arbitrary , but Must Be Supported
Here ’s what I learned in real estate : every price is ultimately arbitrary - the seller decides what it will be , then adjusts it until someone buys .
I call this the “ Pricing Uncertainty Principle " - you can set any price at any level , for any reason .
Of course , that does n’t mean someone will actually pay it - you must support the prices you set .
There are a few basic ways to estimate what someone else will pay : estimating replacement cost , looking what other people in the market are paying , calculating the value of a series of payments , or figuring out how much subjective value the offer has to the other party .
Think of selling a house - how much should you ask for it ?
You could ( 1 ) figure out how much it ’d cost to re-purchase the land and re-build the same house now , ( 2 ) see what similar houses in the area have recently sold for , ( 3 ) estimate how much you could rent the house for , then discount that series of cashflows to the present , or ( 4 ) sell against a particularly appealing characteristic of the house that makes it even more valuable to particular buyers .
( Example : a market - priced $ 200,000 house can easily sell for $ 2 million or more if it was previously owned by Elvis Presley . )
No matter what strategy is used , however , it ’s ultimately the seller ’s responsibility to assign a price and convince the purchaser that it ’s worth even more .
If you want to put a $ 5 million price tag on something , go right ahead .
Selling is mostly a psychological process of convincing yourself it ’s worth that much so you can then convince prospective buyers .
In that way , every price is fundamentally arbitrary .
3. Never Forget the Expectation Effect
Here ’s what I learned in operations management : every human interaction is influenced by the expectations each party has going in .
If the experience is better than the expectations , the interaction is judged to be pleasant , good , or high - quality .
If the experience is worse than the expectations , the interaction is judged to be disappointing , bad , or poor - quality , even if it ’s demonstrably better than other available options .
This relationship applies to dealing with everyone : your customers , your boss , or your significant other .
The Expectation Effect explains why people can be disappointed after having dinner at the most expensive luxury restaurant in the world , why a particular company ’s stock tanks 20 % after earnings are $ 0.01 less than anticipated , and why most people think the first Matrix movie is better than parts two and three .
The venerable business adage “ under - promise and over - deliver " is a direct statement of how to apply the Expectation Effect - ensure that people are excited enough to move forward but do n’t have inflated expectations going in , then do everything you can to amaze them .
It ’s a difficult balancing act , but it always works .
4. Actual Experience Beats Any Credential
Here ’s what I learned about getting a job : real experience trumps credentials every time .
One of the best features of the Honors - PLUS program was mandatory co-op : the program lasted 5 years , but 1.5 years was invested in doing actual work for an actual company , getting actual experience .
The university has recruiting relationships with hundreds of regional employers , which made it possible to get interviews with major companies in the area .
Co-op is the only reason I was able to work as an Assistant Brand Manager at P&G ( a position that typically requires an Ivy League MBA ) straight out of undergrad - I ’d been working for the company for a year and a half , and the managers knew the quality of the work I did .
I knew the company , I knew the people , and I had real skills that were valuable and needed .
The piece of paper I received after graduation was an afterthought .
If you ’re currently pursuing ( or preparing to enroll in ) an undergraduate college education , co-op or internship experience is critically important .
If your intent is to land a high - paying job after graduation and you ’re not graduating with at least a year of real - world experience under your belt , you ’re probably wasting your time and money .
Real experience is what employers and customers value .

I have updated the reflection package on hackage to use an idea for avoiding dummy arguments posted to the Haskell cafe mailing list by Bertram Felgenhauer , which adapts nicely to the case of handling Reflection .
The reflection package implements the ideas from the Functional Pearl : Implicit Configurations paper by Oleg Kiselyov and Chung - chieh Shan .
Now , you no longer need to use big scary undefineds throughout your code and can instead program with implicit configurations more naturally , using Applicative and Monad sugar .
* Data.Reflection > reify ( + ) ( reflect < *> pure 1 < *> ( reflect < *> pure 2 < *> pure 3 ) ) > 6
The Monad in question just replaces the lambda with a phantom type parameter , enabling the compiler to more readily notice that no instance can actually even try to use the value of the type parameter .
An example from the old API can be seen on the Haskell cafe .
This example can be made appreciably less scary now !
{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses , FlexibleInstances , Rank2 Types , FlexibleContexts , UndecidableInstances #-} import Control .
Applicative import Data .
Reflection import Data .
Monoid import Data .
Tagged newtype M s a = M a instance Reifies s ( a , a → a → a ) ⇒ Monoid ( M s a ) where mempty = tagMonoid $ fst < $> reflect a `mappend` b = tagMonoid $ snd < $ > reflect < *> monoidTag a < *> monoidTag b monoidTag :: M s a → Tagged s a monoidTag ( M a ) = Tagged a tagMonoid :: Tagged s a → M s a tagMonoid ( Tagged a ) = M a withMonoid :: a → ( a → a → a ) → ( ∀s.
Reifies s ( a , a → a → a ) ⇒ M s w ) → w with Monoid e op m = reify ( e , op ) ( monoidTag m )
And with that we can cram a Monoid dictionary -- or any other -- with whatever methods we want and our safety is assured by parametricity due to the rank 2 type , just like with the ST monad .
*> withMonoid 0 ( + ) ( M 5 `mappend` M 4 `mappend` mempty ) 9
[ Edit : factored Tagged out into Data .
Tagged in a separate package , and modified reflection to use that instead , with an appropriate version bump to satisfy the package versioning policy ]
The summit in Mexico was dubbed the meeting of three amigos
US President Barack Obama has praised Mexico 's leaders for their " courage " in fighting drugs cartels .
At a regional summit in Guadalajara , he said Mexico 's President Felipe Calderon had pledged to uphold human rights .
The Mexican military has been accused by rights groups of widespread abuses in its war on drugs traffickers .
In Guadalajara , Mr Obama , Mr Calderon and Canada 's Prime Minister Stephen Harper vowed to fight swine flu and restore growth across North America .
" I heartily commend President Calderon and his government for their determination and courage in taking on these [ drugs ] cartels , " Mr Obama said .
He said he had great confidence that " human rights will be observed " under Mr Calderon .
For his part , Mr Calderon said his government had an " absolute and categorical " commitment to human rights .
Pressing issues
In a final summit statement , the three leaders promised to forge a joint position on climate change and also reaffirmed the need to reject trade protectionism .
The three leaders also reaffirmed their support for ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya , saying he remained the rightful leader of the country .
The summit in Guadalajara had been dubbed the meeting of three amigos , but the leaders apparently failed to resolve several pressing issues .
Mexico is concerned that recent US moves , including a ban on Mexican truckers operating in the US , suggest protectionism and could worsen its economic situation .
At the summit , Mr Harper raised with Mr Obama Canada 's concerns that the Buy America provisions in the multibillion dollar US economic stimulus plan could shut out Canadian companies .
But Mr Obama said that the provisions had not hurt trade with Canada - America 's largest partner .
" This in no way has endangered the billions of dollars in trade taking place between our two countries , " he said .
Mexico has also been unhappy with Canada 's decision to require visas from Mexican visitors to the country .
It 's been a long time since James Carville said the most famous thing he ever said :
It 's the economy , stupid .
That famous phrase was in fact part of a sign hung in the Clinton campaign headquarters in 1992 .
There was a sense among the electorate in the fall of 1992 , not entirely accurate , that the economy was foundering under George H.W. Bush .
Bush lost control of the public 's perception of the economy , and then he lost the presidency .
Why with unemployment heading above 10 % was Barack Obama on TV last night draining a dwindling ...
Yesterday , Alan Grayson ( D - Fla ) said that the Republican health care plan was “ 1 . Do n’t get sick .
2 . If you do get sick …
3 . Die quickly ! ”
Here ’s the video ( short , and pretty funny ) :
Republicans immediately demanded an apology from him .
So today , Grayson apologized :
As Act Blue says , it probably was not the apology they were expecting .
UPDATE : Patrick McHenry ( R - NC ) called on Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) to officially rebuke Grayson , and Tom Price ( R - GA ) said he was going to introduce a resolution reprimanding Grayson and even took to the House floor demanding an apology for saying that Republicans want people to die .
Of course , this is stunningly hypocritical , given all the Republican noise about “ death panels ” , and repeated accusations thrown at the Democrats about killing seniors .
For example , Ginny Brown - Waite ( R - Fla ) saying on the House floor “ Last week Democrats released a health care bill which essentially said to America ’s seniors : Drop dead . ”
UPDATE 2 : Now Grayson is being attacked for using the word “ holocaust ” .
Grayson said “ I apologize to the dead and their families that we have n’t voted sooner to end this holocaust in America . ”
My dictionary defines “ holocaust ” as “ destruction or slaughter on a mass scale ” .
For example “ nuclear holocaust ” .
It goes on to define the specific slaughter of Jews , Gypsies , and other groups by the Germans in WWII as “ The Holocaust ” .
Note that the text of Grayson ’s statement used “ holocaust ” with a lowercase h , not “ The Holocaust ” with caps .
So what ’s the problem ?
Grayson was clearly using the word properly — I think 44,000 people dying every year counts as a holocaust .
UPDATE 3 : An enjoyable rant about all this from The Rude Pundit .
The number of people out of work in Spain fell again for the third straight month , but most of the decline was linked to training programmes and billions in government money being spent on public works to help the beleaguered construction industry .
Spain ’s jobless total fell almost 21,000 in July , but it still has the highest rate in the European Union with just over 3.5 million people claiming unemployment benefit .

Although most sports stars get famous for being great athletes , some also gain a reputation for being just plain weird .
Whether it ’s their odd playing styles , superstitions , or off - field antics , these are some of the players who ’ve been able to win fan support and the attention of the media for reasons other than their athletic skill .
10 . Mark Fidrych
Baseball pitchers are known for being some of the biggest oddballs in sports , and Mark Fidrych was no exception .
Nicknamed “ The Bird ” because his curly hair and lanky build was reminiscent of Big Bird , Fidrych made a name for himself as a pitcher for the Detroit Tigers .
He had a number of odd habits while pitching , among them aiming the ball like a dart , talking to it , and frequently strutting around the field after striking a batter out .
He also had the curious habit of insisting that a ball that “ had hits in it ” be removed from the game , saying , “ I want it to get back in the ball bag and goof around with the other balls in there .
Maybe it ’ll learn some sense and come out as a pop - up next time . ”
Fidrych was a sensation with the fans , who would chant for him to be put in the game , and any time he did start attendance would skyrocket .
For all his antics , Fidrych was known for living very simply in a small apartment , always insisting that if he were n’t a professional ball player he’d be pumping gas in his hometown of Northborough , Massachusetts .
9. Rene Higuita
Still playing professionally at age 42 , Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita is one of the wildest personalities in international soccer .
Higuita is known for his flamboyant style and his tendency to take huge risks .
He often leaves his goal unattended and dribbles the ball far down field in an attempt to score .
This has been disastrous on more than one occasion , and a huge blunder in a 1990 World Cup match led to his earning the nickname “ El Loco ” in the Columbian press .
Higuita is probably most famous for inventing the scorpion kick ( see video ) , which was once voted the greatest soccer trick of all time , and he even executed the kick in an international game against England in 1995 .
Outside of soccer , Higuita has made the news on more than one occasion .
In 1993 , he was arrested for profiting in a kidnapping case involving the famous drug kingpin Pablo Escobar , and eventually served seven months in prison .
More recently , he tested positive for cocaine while playing professionally in Ecuador , and famously appeared on a Spanish - language reality TV show called “ The Island of the Famous : A Pirate Adventure . ”
8. Chad Ochocinco
There ’s not much you can say about a man who ’s willing to legally change his name to his jersey number , but Chad Ochocinco ( formerly Chad Johnson ) is one of the most bizarre athletes to come along in the NFL in some time .
A wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals , Ochocinco has developed a reputation for his wild hairstyles , media stunts , and amazing catches .
He is also known for his creative and often hilarious touchdown celebrations , which have included performing CPR on the ball , mock proposing to a Bengals cheerleader , and pushing a camera man aside and pretending to film the game .
He was fined numerous times by the NFL for these performances , and famously held up a sign after one touchdown that read : “ Dear NFL , Please Do n’t Fine Me Again ! ” which led to yet another fine .
In 2007 , in order to demonstrate his amazing speed and to benefit charity , Ochocinco raced a thoroughbred horse 220 yards on foot and won .
Still , his most famous stunt to date is undoubtedly his recent legal name change to “ Ochocinco , ” the numbers 8 and 5 in Spanish , which has long been his nickname .
Starting in 2009 , this will be the name that appears on the back of his jersey during games .
7. Turk Wendell
A pitcher for a number of different Major League teams from 1993 to 2004 , Turk Wendell was famous for his eccentric personality and tendency to speak his mind .
Wendell was a fan favorite during his time in the major leagues , and was well known for his superstitions and strange behavior on the field .
For example , he insisted that the umpire roll the ball to him instead of throwing it , and anytime his catcher stood up , he would crouch down .
He refused to walk on the baseline , and any time he entered or left the field he would intentionally leap over it .
He was also said to often brush his teeth between innings , and supposedly wore a necklace made of teeth from animals he had killed while hunting .
Wendell had an obsession with the baseball movie Major League , and wore number 99 in a tribute to the film ’s main character , Ricky “ Wild Thing ” Vaughan .
Near the end of his career , Wendell said he hoped to play his last year of baseball for free in order to be “ a testament to the game , ” and insisted that the only things he wanted out of life were “ a wife , children , to play baseball and to hunt deer . ”
6. John Daly
Known , among other things , as “ Wild Thing ” and “ The Lion , ” John Daly is one of the more eccentric players in the otherwise stately world of professional golf .
A big and imposing figure , Daly burst onto the professional golf circuit in 1991 , when he won the PGA Championship despite barely earning a space in the tournament as a last minute alternate .
He is known for his tremendous power , which has seen him average over 300 yards per drive throughout his career , and helped him to win his second major tournament victory in 1995 at the British Open .
Despite his obvious skill , Daly ’s career has been full of huge highs and lows , thanks in large part to a years - long battle with alcohol and gambling addictions .
He has famously claimed to have lost as much as $ 60 million gambling , and has been arrested for his drinking on a number of occasions .
As a result , he is well known for his tendency to blow up halfway through an otherwise strong tournament , and has been disqualified or quit on numerous occasions .
In recent years , he has tried to get himself back on track , though he is still known for his prodigious use of cigarettes and diet coke to calm his nerves while playing , once famously saying that for him “ nicotine plus caffeine equals protein . ”
5. Ricky Williams
Although considered by many to be one of the more talented running backs to come along in some time , Ricky Williams has gained a reputation as one of the oddest players in NFL history .
He gained fame immediately upon his entrance into the league for his quickness , long dreadlocks , and intense shyness , which led him to conduct many post - game interviews with his helmet still on .
Williams famously tested positive for marijuana in NFL drug tests multiple times , and was fined $ 650,000 before unexpectedly announcing his early retirement from the game .
After leaving football , Williams studied holistic medicine and Hinduism and traveled to India and Australia , where he supposedly spent time living in a tent .
He returned to the NFL in 2004 , only to fail a drug test again and be suspended for the season .
While banned from the NFL , Williams played Canadian football for a season while teaching yoga classes on the side .
He finally returned to the NFL in 2007 , and now plays for the Miami Dolphins .
4. Bill Lee
Known for his counterculture personality and unique throwing style , Bill “ Spaceman ” Lee was a pitcher who played for the Boston Red Sox and the Montreal Expos in the 1970s .
Lee often sported a wild mountain - man beard , and was known for his candidness in interviews , openly admitting that he smoked marijuana and offering his opinion on everything from race relations to health food .
His on - field antics were equally famous , and included separating his shoulder in a fight with New York Yankees players in 1976 , and threatening to bite off an umpire ’s ear during a 1975 World Series game .
Lee ’s wild personality and his tendency to speak out against club management endeared him to the fans , and musician Warren Zevon even wrote a song about him , but his outspokenness ultimately got him kicked off of both his major league teams .
After leaving professional baseball , Lee ran for President in 1988 , but he was unable to get on the ballot in any states .
3. Mike Tyson
One of the most feared and explosive fighters in boxing history , Mike Tyson has gained a reputation as one of the unpredictable and downright bizarre athletes of all time .
After a rapid rise to fame , Tyson ’s career took a hit following an upset defeat by Buster Douglas in 1990 , and a subsequent rape conviction saw him spend 3 years behind bars .
After his release , Tyson attempted to make a comeback in boxing by defending one of his titles against Evander Holyfield , but he lost the fight by technical knockout .
The two fought again a year later in one of the highest paying boxing matches of all time .
In what would come to be known as one of the oddest events in sports history , the fight was called in the third round after Tyson bit off a chunk of Holyfield ’s ear , supposedly in retaliation for Holyfield head butting him .
The incident led to a near - riot in the arena , and Tyson was fined millions for it .
After making a number of guest appearances in professional wrestling , Tyson returned to the ring in 2002 for a title fight against Lennox Lewis , and once again made headlines for saying to Lewis , “ I want your heart , I want to eat his children . ”
Tyson lost the fight by knockout , and has since retired from boxing .
2. Dennis Rodman
One of the most famous “ bad boys ” of professional sports , Dennis Rodman is a basketball player who played as a forward for a number of NBA teams throughout the late 80s and 90s .
Also known as “ The Worm ” and “ Dennis the Menace , ” Rodman had a remarkable rebounding ability , collecting nearly 12,000 during his career , but he is best known for his antics both on and off the court .
He famously dyed his hair a variety of colors , head - butted opponents , appeared in public wearing a wedding dress , and seemed to make a habit of being ejected from games .
In 1998 , he briefly married Baywatch star Carmen Electra , and later had a high - profile fling with singer Madonna .
Rodman had a big interest in wrestling , and while still in the NBA he began a side career as a professional wrestler with his friend Hulk Hogan , even going so far as to participate in WCW events while in the middle of the 1998 NBA finals .
He also cultivated another side career as an actor , appearing in the action movie Double Team along with Jean - Claude Van Damme , and later as the star of the film Simon Sez , but both films were huge commercial and critical failures .
1. Joe Namath
Popularly considered to be the first media star in professional football , quarterback Joe Namath has been making a name for himself on and off the field for over forty years .
Namath is most famous his audacious prediction that his underdog New York Jets would win the 1969 Superbowl .
He delivered on his promise , and immediately became one of the most famous athletes in America .
Nicknamed “ Broadway Joe ” for his flamboyant style , Namath would often wear a full - length fur coat while on the sidelines during games , and he enthusiastically appeared in racy television ads for women ’s pantyhose , which caused an uproar in the media at the same time that it helped establish him as a sex symbol .
Namath famously retired from the NFL for a brief stint in 1969 after refusing to sell his stake in a New York City bar called Bachelors III , which the NFL commissioner claimed had become a popular mafia hangout , but he eventually complied and was back for the next season .
Since retiring from football , Namath has appeared in a number of films and television shows , and even hosted his own late night talk show for a short time .
In 2004 , Namath was in the headlines once again when he drunkenly told ESPN reporter Suzy Kolber that he wanted to kiss her during an interview , and he has since gone into treatment for alcoholism .

( CNN ) -- Some
Web designers are staging an online revolt against an old version of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer browser , which they say is hampering the ability of the Web to move forward in a cool and interactive way .
Some Web developers are trying to weed an old version of Internet Explorer from peoples ' computers .
The designers say Internet Explorer 6 , which was released in 2001 and since has been updated twice by Microsoft Corp. , is crippling the Internet 's potential and slowing down the online experience .
They also blame IE 6 for giving webmasters a collective headache , because they have to write special " hacks " into Web code to accommodate an outmoded browser .
An estimated 15 to 25 percent of people still use IE 6 as their portal to the Internet , according to two Web monitors .
In recent months , several Web companies have launched sites devoted to the idea of undermining or killing Internet Explorer 6 .
The most recent site , called " IE 6 No More , " has gained momentum this week on social - media sites like Twitter and Digg in part because a number of respected Internet start - up companies have signed onto the campaign .
The " IE 6 No More " site provides Web developers with a piece of code -- an online hurdle , essentially -- they can install to encourage Internet users to download a new browser before coming back to the site .
" As any Web developer will tell you , working with IE 6 is one of the most difficult and frustrating things they have to deal with on a daily basis , taking up a disproportionate amount of their time , " an introduction on the site says .
" Beyond that , IE 6's support for modern Web standards is very lacking , restricting what developers can create and holding the Web back . "
On the surface , the campaign against IE 6 may seem like a cult of disgruntled techies who are angry at Microsoft or want to gripe about people who lag behind the technological curve .
But that analysis is too simplistic , said Dan Oliver , editor of .net , a UK magazine about Web design .
" This is n't an anti-Microsoft campaign , " he said .
" Microsoft makes some fantastic products .
The latest version of their browser is a good browser .
But with regards to IE 6 ... [ it ] is an awful browser and no one should be using it . "
He added : " Ultimately , we 've kind of waited long enough .
That 's why there 's a big movement of support for it because the geeks out there have known about this for years and have been waiting for big sites to jump on and push it forward . "
In a statement to CNN , Microsoft said it also wants people to turn away from IE 6 .
" Microsoft has consistently recommended that consumers upgrade to the latest version of our browser , " the company said .
" Internet Explorer 8 offers improvements in speed , security and reliability as well as new features designed for the way people use the Web . "
Oliver said his magazine started an anti-IE 6 Web site about three months ago .
The movement has been growing among savvy Web developers for years , he said , but has hit a groundswell since bigger - name Internet companies jumped aboard .
YouTube , for instance , now sends a message to Internet Explorer 6 users who visit the site , asking them to upgrade to another browser like Internet Explorer 8 , Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome .
The video - streaming site will continue to function in a basic way for IE 6 users , according to a statement sent to CNN by YouTube .
But bigger problems for IE 6 may be on the horizon as the Web becomes more complicated .
Developers are already working with a new Web language -- called HTML 5 -- that is expected to make Web sites able to display flashier video , save documents to computers more easily and act more like traditional computer applications .
When that shift comes , IE 6 will doubtlessly perish , said Ben Parr , a writer for the social - networking news blog Mashable .
" We 're about to hit a breaking point where innovation will be stifled if Web sites must continue to cater to this browser , " he wrote in a post titled , " IE 6 Must Die for the Web to Move On . "
The browser 's popularity is declining as newer versions of Internet Explorer become more widely used .
But it 's unclear whether everyone who continues to use IE 6 does so by choice .
Many businesses have built computer applications that run on the browser , and upgrades to those systems can be costly and difficult .
That makes campaigns that tell people to switch their browser ineffective , Mark Trammell , a Digg employee , wrote on the company 's blog .
" Giving them a message saying , ' Hey ! Upgrade ! ' in this case is not only pointless ; it 's sadistic , " he wrote , also noting that Digg likely will stop supporting IE 6 for some of the site 's functions .
That leaves some Web sites trying to find a middle ground .
They want to be cutting - edge , but they also do n't want to alienate IE 6 users and business clients .
Justin.tv , which lets people stream video live online , is among the sites trying to strike a balance .
The company is backing an anti-IE 6 Web site , but Evan Solomon , the site 's vice - president for marketing , said the best thing that will come out of this discussion is that more people will become aware that there are alternatives in Web browsers .
It 's also important to know how much those browsers control a person 's Internet experience , he said .
" It sucks for us if someone comes to the site and has a bad experience and the reason that happens is because they use a browser that was developed 10 years ago , " he said .

" Mr. Atkins , 34 , is the lead game designer for Fable III , " says the announcement , " a video game series produced by Lionhead Studios in Guildford , England . "
While Atkins ' Moby Games page does n't show him as working on Fable 3 as its lead designer , it does confirm his involvement with just about every major Microsoft title since Rise of Nations .
This is the second time that Fable III has recently been discovered by information about those involved with it .
British media personality Jonathan Ross tweeted in March about how he had been asked to provide voice work for the game , sparking a number of rumors about the title .
Of course , when a game 's mentioned as being in development by the New York Times , then the realm of rumor seems to have been left behind .

Multiple experiments reveal materials with single points of north and south .
Researchers may have found the once elusive monopole .
Alamy
One of those facts of life that physicists live with is that every magnet ever made has a north and a south pole .
When researchers try to split the two , they simply get another magnet with poles of its own .
There 's no reason that should be the case , and for decades they have been on the hunt for a single pole , or monopole .
" People have been looking for monopoles in cosmic rays and particle accelerators — even Moon rocks , " says Jonathan Morris , a researcher at the Helmholtz Centre for Materials and Energy in Berlin .
Now Morris and others have found the strongest evidence yet for magnetic monopoles , in small crystals about the size of an ear plug .
When the crystals are chilled to near absolute zero , they seem to fill with tiny single points of north and south .
The points are less than a nanometre apart , and can not be measured directly .
Nevertheless , Morris and other physicists believe they are there .
They make their case in two papers published today in the journal Science1,2 , and other work published on the pre-print server arXiv.org3,4 .
The crystals are made of materials known as ' spin ice ' , because their atoms are arranged in a way similar to those in water ice .
Specifically , its atoms sit at the vertices of four - sided pyramids .
Each atom behaves like a tiny bar magnet , and when the crystal is cooled to near absolute zero , the atom - magnets align .
Sometimes , three of the pyramid's four corners align together and create a region of north or south magnetic charge at the centre of the pyramid .
The charge is n't attached to any physical object , but it behaves just as a monopole would .
Unquestionable evidence ?
Theoretical work had shown that monopoles probably exist , and they have been measured indirectly .
But the Science papers are the first direct experiments to record the monopole 's effects on the spin-ice material .
The papers use neutrons to detect atoms in the crystal aligned into long daisy chains1,2 .
These daisy chains tie each north and south monopole together .
Known as ' Dirac strings ' , the chains , as well as the existence of monopoles , were predicted in the 1930s by the British theoretical physicist Paul Dirac .
Heat measurements in one paper1 also support the monopole argument .
ADVERTISEMENT
The two , as yet unpublished , papers on arXiv add to the evidence .
The first provides additional observations3 , and the second uses a new technique to determine the magnetic charge of each monopole to be 4.6x10 - 13 joules per tesla metre4 .
All together , the evidence for magnetic monopoles " is now overwhelming " , says Steve Bramwell , a materials scientist at University College London and author on one of the Science papers2 and one of the arXiv papers4 .
" This sort of measurement makes monopoles more substantial , at least in my mind , " says Peter Schiffer , a researcher at Pennsylvania State University in University Park .
Whether the monopoles will be seen directly is another question , says Schiffer .
Like any charged particle , opposites attract , and the north and south poles typically cluster together less than a nanometre from each other .
That makes them extremely hard to detect individually .
But , Schiffer says , " I 'm very hesitant to say that anything is impossible . "
Even without directly seeing one , Bramwell says that he is certain that the monopoles are there .
" I do n't think anybody could question it after this flurry of papers , " he says .

It s a funny line , of course , if somewhat harsh .
Ill probably let him out of his room in a few weeks .
But his quip is largely untrue .
Its bite comes from the fact that its not entirely untrue .
It s a strange turn of events , really .
After all , I have always been opposed to healthcare rationing .
But , then , I have always been opposed to aging , too .
I have come to recognize the fundamental similarity between the two .
They are simply unavoidable evils ( pace Chesterton , Cicero , et al . ) .
The best we can do is to manage them with wisdom and compassion .
It s a mistake to think of health care as a right .
It is not a right ; it is a good .
Freedom of speech , by contrast , is a right , as is freedom of religious belief .
They are privileges that inure to individuals as a consequence of the primordial right , free will .
That is why we see them as inalienable .
The exercise of these rights does not depend on any action of government , but rather on its inaction .
Government may not legitimately interfere with their exercise , but nothing mandates that the government provide us with printing press or chapel .
Health care is different .
It is more akin to the other goods which sustain life : food , clothing , and shelter .
A well - ordered society exists to protect its members from the unlawful taking of life , and is structured to facilitate its members  acquisition of these goods .
But health care differs from these other goods :
First , health care is not absolutely essential for all people on a daily basis ; second , there is an insufficient supply in this world to meet the demand of those who would have it .
There is enough food in the world to feed everyone .
Hunger and famine are the result of its inadequate distribution , not its absolute dearth .
There are enough garments in the world to clothe everyone , and enough roofs to protect all from the rain .
Health care , in contrast , is a far scarcer resource .
Descartes once remarked that common sense is the most equitably distributed attribute in the world , because we never see anybody who feels he doesnt have enough .
Health care is not like common sense .
We often see people who feel they dont have enough , or at least cant get enough at a price they re willing or able to pay .
Until modern times , health care in the United States was distributed as most goods of life are distributed ” according to personal wealth .
The rich could afford it , and the poor couldnt .
Most economists would exclude this sort of market allocation as a form of rationing by definition .
Nonetheless , market allocation is a form of distributing goods within a society , and when there are not enough of those goods to go around , the end - result in the short term is much the same .
Limiting health cares availability by the criterion of personal wealth rightly offends our sense of the dignity of the individual .
Are the lives of the poor not of the same intrinsic value of those of the wealthy ?
To be fair , it is rare in the United States that poverty alone prevents the uninsured poor from receiving lifesaving intervention in a healthcare crisis .
A poor man having a heart attack is not turned away from the emergency room , nor is the poor woman in labor sent away to have her baby at home .
( I am not arguing that such enormities never occur , but the fact that such occurrences remain scandalous and newsworthy is a testament to their rarity . )
Yet it is equally undeniable that the poor get a lesser share of the preventive care that can maintain health or of the quotidian care for the less dramatic challenges to their health .
There are two major alternatives to the allocating of health care on the basis of personal wealth .
Both involve a large number of individuals agreeing ( or having imposed on them ) that the amount of health care they receive will not be in strict accord to how much they have paid for it .
The cost will be distributed over the healthy as well as the sick , even though the benefit will inure only to those who are ill or who need health care to prevent illness .
People accept the certainty of a bearable cost to avoid the risk of an unbearable one .
But to the extent that these collective programs sever the connection between paying for health care and receiving it , they generate increased demand for health care .
The individual feels that he has already paid for health care .
When he is sick , or thinks that he is sick , he feels fully entitled to care with no consideration of cost .
After all , he has already paid for it , has nt he ?
Given the limited amount of health care that may be bought with the aggregate funds of the group , this untrammeled demand for it must always result in rationing .
This is true whether the collective effort is a private insurance plan or a government program .
Rationing is inevitable in all collective health care financing schemes .
Rationing must occur , but it need not be admitted .
Denying the truth of rationing is more common in government - run health care schemes than private ones , because the government is reluctant to have the people know this ugly fact .
Government - run programs , therefore , are more likely to disguise the rationing .
This plausibly deniable form of limiting health care is called implicit healthcare rationing , and it assumes many forms .
Rationing by termination occurs when patients are discharged from the hospital earlier than is medically optimal .
Rationing by dilution occurs when second - best rather than first - best treatment is provided .
Rationing by rejection or redirection involves healthcare providers turning away patients whose care will be inadequately reimbursed .
This is commonly seen now in the Medicare and Medicaid programs , because those programs reimburse providers at a rate substantially lower than private insurance plans .
Perhaps more common than those forms of rationing is rationing by delay , as exemplified by the outrageous amount of time patients in Canada must wait for hip replacement surgery or colonoscopy .
The unifying theme in all these forms of implicit rationing is that , without admitting it , they force some patients to forego medical care that they want and are ostensibly entitled to receive .
Private insurance plans sometimes include an element of implicit rationing , but because they are , at heart , contractual agreements between the insurance company and the insured are more likely to ration health care explicitly .
The many pages of the healthcare plan describe what is a covered service , which providers will be reimbursed for services , the duration of coverage , the dollar limit , and so on .
The advantage of explicit over implicit rationing is obvious :
It gives potential customers of the insurance plan information to use when deciding which insurance plan to buy , and gives them clear expectations of services to be delivered .
Implicit rationing , by contrast , may have the sweetness of a promise , but is usually succeeded by the bitterness of a promise broken .
All modern societies ration health care .
A wise society considers the options and chooses a method of doing so which best conforms to its values and capabilities .
Thus we come to the terrible question we would so very much like to avoid :
How shall we ration health care ?
How shall we explicitly ration it ?
So noxious a question is this , so offensive in its tacit assumptions and implications , that most politicians and wishful thinkers will deny that we need to address it at all .
They will argue that the fundamental problem is one of distribution , not one of unmeetable demand .
They will argue , with more enthusiasm than evidence , that an emphasis on preventive care would substantially reduce aggregate demand .
Some will say we must reduce the role of government ; others will argue that we should augment it .
If only we will adopt their plan ” theyll say ” waste , fraud , and abuse will be abolished .
There will be chicken ” or at least chicken soup ” in every pot , and a vaccine in every arm .
People love honesty , but they hate the truth .
To frankly acknowledge and address the ineluctable reality of healthcare rationing is not merely to touch the proverbial third rail of American politics ; it is to lie across the tracks in front of the onrushing train .
Come , let us speak of unpleasant things .
How is health care to be rationed ?
Who gets the short end of the stick ?
There are several rational approaches .
An example of attempted explicit rationing of health care in a government - financed system may be found in Oregon .
In 1994 Oregon implemented a program that would expand the number of poor people covered by Medicaid , but explicitly ration the care they receive .
Oregon chose to priorate the different services that a patient might conceivably want , ranking them in order of how important the procedures were for maintaining life and promoting health .
The legislature determined how much it was willing to spend for the health care of the poor , and then the bureaucrats literally drew a line across the list .
All the services above the line would be covered by the state Medicaid plan ; all those below would not .
Thus , the solons of Oregon determined that treatment of veneral warts would be covered by the Oregon Health Plan ; treatment of chronic anal fissures would not .
In practice , this procedure did not prove to be the efficient money - saver its developers envisioned .
From the beginning , the list did not exclude procedures that were very expensive in the aggregate .
The list needed continual updating and adjusting , often on the basis of nonscientific criteria , since the opinions of the taxpayers ( which is a nice way of saying political pressure ) had to be considered .
In the first six years of the program , costs skyrocketed seventy - seven percent .
Eventually , the state had to resort to admitting new enrollees to the insurance program on the basis of a lottery .
The political reality of the Oregon healthcare rationing is that it could be imposed by the taxpayers on the recipients of their largesse only because it was not being imposed on the taxpayers themselves .
For government to explicitly ration the health care of those who are actually paying for it may be undoable in a democracy .
That explains why healthcare rationing in Medicare and Medicaid is mostly implicit rather than explicit .
It is noteworthy and instructive that no other state has followed Oregons lead in this approach .
An alternative to explicit government mandated healthcare rationing is rationing by private industry .
There is one great advantage that private healthcare rationing has compared with government rationing : competition .
In the private marketplace , there will be a number of insurers , each with its own criteria and implementation of rationing .
A company which is unreasonable or high - handed in its coverage decisions will find that its unhappy customers soon become its former customers .
It s true that millions of Americans have their healthcare plan chosen for them by their employers .
But employees , both as individuals and via unions , certainly have an impact on the choice of company health plans .
Also , it must be kept in mind that the management of the company is almost always covered by the same healthcare plans offered to the rank - and - file employees .
While a variety of insurers , prices , and plans are available , the comparative shopper for healthcare insurance is still unlikely to find any insurance that does not have rationing as part of its processes ; at best , he may find one whose criteria of rationing are more to his liking .
It is to those criteria , the proverbial devilish details , that I now turn .
I am a consultant for one of the largest private healthcare insurers in the United States .
Because chemotherapy agents are among the most expensive medicines that can be prescribed by a physician , the company wanted an experienced medical oncologist to help manage that expensive resource .
When I first accepted the position , I had been worried that I might be pressured to make coverage decisions based on the cost of the medication .
I wondered if I would be mensch enough to stand up to such pressure .
To my relief , I have never been subjected to that kind of pressure .
The pressure I have felt is quite a different one .
My supervisors have frequently adjured me of the importance of being consistent in decision making .
Since all the members of the health plan are paying premiums for the same insurance , they must all receive equal consideration .
The only way to achieve that is by adhering to explicit policies based on sound medical evidence of medical necessity .
Medical necessity is our touchstone .
It is , frankly , the criterion by which we ration health care .
If a service is medically necessary , it is covered .
Otherwise , it is not .
The conundrum is surely obvious :
What do we mean by medical necessity ?
What are the criteria of determining medical necessity ” and who decides ?
The meaning of medical necessity is easy to state , if hard to pin down .
The definition , part of the contract between the insured and the company , is this : services that a medical practitioner , exercising prudent clinical judgment , would provide to a patient to prevent , diagnose , or treat an illness .
The definition further requires that such services be in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice , clinically appropriate for the patient , not primarily for the patients convenience , and not more costly than similar services likely to yield results which are at least as good .
I dont suppose that I could come up with a better definition of medically necessary , but it is surely obvious that this definition requires heaping measures of interpretation .
What is prudent ?
What is generally accepted standards ?
Requiring that services be medically necessary is unavoidable .
Defining the terms is equally unavoidable , but the definition often seems tautological , like loopholes within knots all contorted into a grand Möbius band of potential disputation .
The insurance company assembles panels of experts from within the company , academia , and private practice to meet regularly to assess the state of the art for a multitude of diseases and procedures .
The panels , in turn , create the policies based on the current evidence .
As to who implements the policy , who actually decides what is medical necessity on a case - by - case basis ” that , too , is easy to answer : I do .
I am the healthcare rationer .
I am not the only one , of course .
Like any large bureaucracy we have a large , rational , and , yes , occasionally lumbering system of determining medical necessity .
It would be wasteful for the insurance company to have professionals at the highest pay level authorize all these decisions .
After all , the vast majority of claims are , indeed , for medically necessary services .
Therefore , the initial review of claims is done by nurses or pharmacy technicians .
They make their decision based on a carefully vetted , evidence - based checklist of criteria .
The majority of these initial reviews end in an authorization for the requested service , and are never considered again within the company .
It is important to note that the first - line reviewers have the authority to authorize a service , but not to deny it .
If the claim for payment fails to pass the checklist , the first - line reviewer does not deny it , but rather passes it on to a higher level review by a physician .
Before I became a consultant to the insurance company , I shared the cynical view of most harried physicians .
I believed that , just as luggage at the airport must surely be handled by behind - the - scenes gorillas who jump on the bags in madcap revelry , so medical claims at insurance companies must be handled by high - school dropouts who make their decisions by consulting articles such as  I am Joes Prostate in well - thumbed copies of Readers Digest .
Not so .
The physicians who do the reviews are , for the most part , still in active practice , and , if not leaders in their fields , are clearly several notches above average .
Hiring such qualified personnel is not merely a kindness to the insured members of the insurance plan ; it is simply good management .
If a company makes too many bad decisions , it will suffer in the courtroom , in corporate boardrooms , and on the floor of the stock exchange .
But the fact that good doctors are making decisions for the insurance company does not preclude disagreement between the insurance company and the providers .
These providers of the contested medical services are , for the most part , also good doctors .
When there is a disagreement between the two , who is right ?
We return to the conundrum of determining medical necessity .
On its face , one might think that the question of medical necessity is best answered by the physician who is actually taking care of the patient , rather than one who has never met him and is basing his decisions on a limited amount of information .
But that will not do .
That thought is one of the many illusory ways of denying the inevitability of rationing .
To have the providers determine medical necessity is to have no limits at all on expenditures for health care , since all providers at all times believe ( or at least claim ) that the service they are providing is medically necessary .
To have the providers be the arbiters of medical necessity is to abjure rationing altogether .
The insurance company that does that will be very popular ” very briefly .
Then it will either go bankrupt in short order , or sharply adjust its premiums upward to have its income match its hemorrhaging outflow .
If premiums rise enough , people will not buy the insurance .
The result will quickly be the most generous insurance policy that nobody can afford .
So the insurance company must ration the health care , and must therefore sometimes disagree with the attending physician as to the medical necessity of the proposed treatment .
It does this on the basis of published medical evidence .
This criterion of rationing by medical evidence , like all criteria of rationing , evokes protests from people who do not receive the health care to which they feel entitled .
For example , what shall we do about people who have rare diseases ?
Cancer of the adrenal gland , for example , is a rare malignancy .
On theoretical grounds we might feel that it would respond to an expensive drug like Avastin , but no clinical trial has addressed that question .
It is such a rare disease that there will never be a clinical trial large enough to prove or disprove the benefit of Avastin in treating it .
Are patients who have rare and relatively unstudied diseases never to have access to expensive treatments of theoretical but untested benefit ?
Another consideration is that medical evidence is not an all - or - none affair .
No cure bursts forth onto the medical world fully formed like Athena from the brow of Zeus .
First laboratory or animal models of a disease suggest a line of approach .
Then small studies assess the treatments  toxicity and efficacy in humans .
Larger clinical trials are performed only if these early studies are promising .
These trials are first reported at meetings before the data are mature .
Subsequent reports may apprise clinicians of the progress of the study .
Only when the data are mature are they reported in toto , and it is usually a while after that before the new treatment wins FDA approval .
When is the evidence sufficient ?
Shall we consider the availability of other treatments in making the decision , or weigh the evidence on its own merits alone ?
There is no one right answer .
As a clinician , I may recommend a treatment early in its development , sometimes on little more than a hunch ( with the patients informed consent ) , if the patient has few options and a dismal prognosis .
Years later Ill learn whether the choice was right or not .
But the health plan also must decide :
Shall we authorize this treatment and necessarily restrict another treatment ?
If so , which one ?
I remind the reader : Rationing is inevitable .
Only the criteria of rationing may vary .
While the application of any standard of explicit rationing must be equitable , at heart the criteria themselves cannot escape some element of arbitrariness .
Whether the criteria are age of the patient , life expectancy with or without treatment , cost of the treatment , rigor of evidence , or simply public clamor ” rationing everywhere and always means that someone is denied health care which he believes is necessary for his wellbeing and to which he feels entitled .
Imperfect as it is , using the criterion of medical necessity based on medical evidence is likely the most just and practical way of performing the unavoidable and unpleasant task of rationing health care .
Implicit rationing is dishonest and procrustean , bluntly mismatching resources and needs .
Rationing by age or life expectancy inevitably leads to decision making based on invidious , not to say immoral , comparisons of individual worth .
Rationing primarily by cost obviates the fundamental purpose of having health insurance .
Rationing by public clamor introduces the injustice of preferential treatment for those with the greatest political clout .
The optimist will consider healthcare rationing based on evidence - based medical necessity as the best of all possible ways of doing it ; the pessimist will fear that hes right .
As Congress and the people consider restructuring the American healthcare system , they must keep in mind that rationing health care may not be undeniable , but it is unavoidable .
To claim that Congress will devise a new federal healthcare plan that will not involve rationing is like claiming that it will invent a triangle that doesnt have three sides .
Currently , within the private sector of health care , we have a large number of private insurance companies vying for the business of their customers .
They ration health care on the basis of evidence - based medical necessity .
The Obama health plan , the details of which are still being worked out , will also ration health care .
The alternative to that is an accelerated escalation of aggregate healthcare costs .
But the single - payer system to which Obamas plan will lead will have no competitor and no pressing financial incentive to please its customers .
No competitor for the single payer means no alternative for the patient .
We can reasonably expect that a single - payer system of rationing will be largely implicit rather than explicit , and governed as much by cost and political considerations as by medical evidence .
Such a system would likely combine the fiscal responsibility of the Postal Service , the customer friendliness of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles , and the smooth efficiency of the Immigration and Naturalization Service .
You can bet your life on it .

When the news broke that Oracle wanted to buy Sun , a number of eyebrows were raised over what would happen to Sun ’s open source portfolio .
While the US Department of Justice gave the green light for the deal to go through , the European Commission was among the eye brows raising crowd , and they were quite worried about the future of specifically MySQL .
Oracle is one of the world ’s largestproprietary database software companies , and them buying Sun , the leading open source database company ( because of MySQL ) has the European Commission worried .
“ In the current economic context , all companies are looking for cost - effective ( information - technology ) solutions , and systems based on open - source software are increasingly emerging as viable alternatives to proprietary solutions , ” commissioner Neelie Kroes explained , “ The commission has to ensure that such alternatives would continue to be available . ”
Between then and now , Oracle published a large advertisement in the European edition of The Wall Street Journal , making several promises about the future of Sun ’s SPARC and Solaris departments .
Oracle promises to invest a whole lot more into SPARC and Solaris than Sun ever did .
In addition , Oracle wants to integrate SPARC , Solaris , and Oracle software to provide a complete package .
However , in that advertisement , Oracle had nothing to say about the future of MySQL , the prime reason for the European Commission ’s worries .
One of the possible remedies under investigation by the EC is Oracle spinning off MySQL .
This , Oracle CEO Larry Ellison has stated , will not happen , because MySQL and Oracle do not compete at all .
“ MySQL and Oracle do not compete at all , ” Ellison said , “ If you look at where we compete it ’s with DB2 , Microsoft ’s SQL Server , Sybase , and a long list of others .
We never compete against mySQL , it addresses very different markets . ”
Ellison is worried about the delays , explaining it only hurts Sun .
“ The longer this takes , the more money Sun is going to lose , ” he said .
He also further reiterated Oracle ’s commitment to the SPARC business .
“ We are keeping everything , ” said Ellison , “ We ’re keeping tape .
We ’re keeping storage .
We ’re keeping x86 technology and SPARC technology – and we ’re going to increase the investment in it .
Sun has fantastic technology .
We think it ’s got great microprocessor technology – it needs a little more investment , but we think it can be extremely competitive . ”
Ellison has his sights set on what he calls the ‘ old ’ IBM .
“ I would like us to be the successor to IBM , ” he said , “ Not Gerstner ’s IBM .
Not Palmisano ’s IBM .
But when IBM was the dominant software company in the world and translated that to being the dominant systems company . ”
As silly as this sounds , my little Sun Ultra V , powered by a 64 bit UltraSPARC IIi processor , is very happy .
She may not be used very often , but she ’s happy her offspring will be given an opportunity to grow .

You would think that Homeowners throughout this country and even here in Lakeland , FL these days getting loan modification approved , would make them a happy camper by keeping their homes .
I thought so too until I read the article here that I want to share with you .
“ Unfortunately , the “ Big Three ” credit bureaus – Equifax , Experian and TransUnion – have issued new guidelines that allow lenders to report new mortgage loan modifications as “ partial payment status , ” a designation that could lower an individual ’s credit score by more than 50 points . ”
In my opinion , this is the most ridiculous guideline I ’ve read , while wondering what are they going to do next .
What impact does it have for your future credit buying and what about the credit cards you already have ?
I ’m sure you will be penalized by an increase in their annual percentage rate as well .
What a shame !
Is it worth doing a loan modification now or should I go with a short sale instead and be done with it ?

Cool new stuff .
First release .
And a nice community contribution ...
Hi .
I intend to make the lives of downstream packagers a little easier so I will call my master tags " releases " and provide links to tarballs .
Expect a new release every few weeks or so .
So here is the first uzbl alpha release , version 2009.07.03
This version brings :
A JS object to execute commands ( be sure to read the security implications in the readme )
config file changes : command substitution , variable expansion , javascript substitution
bidirectional socket ( responses come back through the socket now )
reading config from stdin is optional now ( so you can background uzbl )
Makefile compat fix , typos , cookies .
py XDG paths bugfix and more small stuff
For people with crappy window managers or on platforms over which they have very little control ( * cough * you know who you are ) , lazy ones or just those who have n't seen the light yet , there is more good news :
Some people in the community have taken it on them to improve uzbl_tabbed .
py ... a lot !
( uzbl_tabbed.py was the proof of concept script introduced 2 weeks ago to demonstrate the Xembed functionality )
While it is quite new , I must say it is starting to look quite nice ( and configurable ) .
It 's not for everyone , but I think some people will really like it .
You 'll find this updated version in the example scripts directory .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The collapse of Colonial BancGroup poses another hazard to the still - shaky housing market : Mortgages could become even harder to get .
The Southern regional bank , based in Montgomery , Ala. , was the largest remaining player in warehouse lending , which provides short - term financing to independent mortgage bankers .
At one time , these mortgage bankers originated half of all U.S. home loans using these funds .
Today , the warehouse lending market is decimated .
In 2007 it was worth an estimated $ 200 billion ; now there is just $ 25 billion available -- 25 % of which belongs to Colonial .
With Colonial 's failure , those funds could become even more scarce .
" It 's like if they shut down half the concession stands at the baseball game , " said Scott Stern , CEO of the Lenders One mortgage bankers group in St. Louis .
" It means the guy who 's last in line is going to have to wait a lot longer to get a hot dog , and in this market who knows what the price is going to be when he gets there ? "
The money began drying up when investors started shunning mortgages not guaranteed by government - backed agencies such as Fannie Mae .
These loans , made by the independent mortgage bankers , had become closely associated with the worst excesses of the housing bubble .
Among the biggest players in the market were Countrywide , rescued last year by Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , and Washington Mutual , which collapsed last September .
This year , two other prominent lenders had to unwind their warehouse business : National City , the troubled Cleveland bank acquired last fall by PNC ( PNC , Fortune 500 ) ; and Guaranty Bank , the Texas thrift that warned last month that it expects to be taken over by regulators .
To be sure , everyone is n't fleeing the market .
ResCap , a troubled home lender owned by the government - supported GMAC finance company , said earlier this year that it would expand its warehouse lending business .
Citi said this month it expects to put $ 2 billion into warehouse lines this year .
But with small banks failing and pulling back and many larger players , such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo , not aggressively pursuing new business , few expect the new entries to reopen the market .
Thus the industry is lobbying Washington to give government - backed Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae a bigger role in warehouse lending .
But with those entities already backing some 90 % of current U.S. mortgage originations -- and taxpayers on the hook for potentially hundreds of billions of dollars of losses at Fannie and Freddie -- that idea is proving a hard sell .
Still , mortgage bankers are hoping the latest tremors in the banking industry will make Washington more receptive .
" We 're trying to show people how important this is , but I 'm not sure the urgency is there , " said Glen Corso , a longtime mortgage industry executive who now heads the Warehouse Lending Project that 's advocating an expanded federal role .
" We 'd like to see a private solution , obviously , but failing that we need to get something in place to keep financing flowing . "

Get ready for funkyzeit as Austria 's greatest fashionista arrives on the big screen this week .
But how would Bruno advise Gordon Brown , style Obama and deal with the BNP ?
We found out
Bruno – it 's just Bruno – has four major loves in his life : fashion , celebrities , entertainment and homosexuality ( his and everyone else 's ) .
It is , perhaps unsurprisingly , the latter that gets Sacha Baron Cohen 's Austrian TV reporter into the most trouble .
If you thought Borat bringing a plastic bag full of his own excrement to the table was uncomfortable , imagine how the people of Fort Smith in Arkansas felt when they'd bought $ 5 tickets for a Redneck Rumble only to see Bruno and another chap strip down to their smalls and get it on .
Cohen , almost unbelievably , is still alive and his film is set to be the feel - dirty hit of the summer .
But upsetting stupid people is easy - what 's hard is bringing real and lasting change to the world .
So how would Bruno solve some of this season 's biggest issues ?
Hello Bruno , how are you ?

Be honest : could the Guide get away with it ?
Ich do n't think so ; César is pretty choosy , he is not like some dog marking his territory .

Ubuntu Karmic Alpha5 image now offers home directory encryption as an option to all installing users !.
We introduced Encrypted Private Directories in the Ubuntu 8.10 release , using eCryptfs ( an enterprise cryptographic filesystem in the Linux kernel ) on $ HOME / Private .
This release helped " prove " eCryptfs , and helped us identify and fix a number of issues .
This new approach to encrypted private data in Ubuntu provided a safe folder where users could store confidential information , automatically mounted at login , and unmounted at logout .
In Ubuntu 9.04 , we retained the Encrypted Private Directory feature , but additionally offered Encrypted Home Directories to advanced users , through the alternate installer and a special boot parameter .
This release generated quite a bit of interest in the feature and a healthy user community .
Many , many thanks to the Ubuntu users and developers who used this feature , helping to file and fix bugs along the way .

10 Ways to Find the Truth
In my previous post I talked about the problem of determining the truth in current events ( and in other areas ) when we ’re faced with conflicting views from thousands of media and Internet sources .
In this post I ’ll offer some advice for dealing with the problem :
1. Become more conscious of the assumptions that you ’ve been making about truth .
Most of us bury our truth assumptions so deep in our subconscious that we do n’t even realize what we ’re assuming .
We accept things as the truth because people around us believe them or because we were “ brought up that way . ”
That does n’t mean those things are really true .
They might be true , but it ’s important for us to decide for ourselves .
2 . Accept the fact that different people will have different views on many subjects .
Those different views are n’t necessarily right or wrong — they ’re just different .
Everyone is entitled to their own view , even if they disagree with you .
Try to be open - minded and understand where the other views are coming from .
3 . Do n’t commit yourself prematurely to a particular point of view .
It ’s perfectly OK — even a good thing — for you to see and understand the different sides of an issue and to understand how different people can believe different things .
As F. Scott Fitzgerald said , “ The test of a first - rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time , and still retain the ability to function . ”
4 . To understand a view that ’s different from your own , try to focus on similarities rather than differences .
What are you both agreeing on ?
What assumptions are you both making ?
Are you starting out with some of the same objectives but then differing in your methods ?
Are you considering the same methods but disagreeing on how you assign importance to different decision factors ?
Once you sort out similarities and differences then the other view becomes more logical .
You may still disagree , but at least you ’ll understand the basis for your disagreement .
5 . Remember that language and emphasis are at the root of many disagreements .
Often you may find yourself “ in violent agreement ” with someone .
You may use different words , or you may use the same words with different meanings .
But if you really clarify what you ’re both saying , you may find that you ’re trying to say the same thing .
6 . For important issues , ask yourself these questions about the views of the speaker or writer :
Does this make sense ?
Is it likely ?
The more unlikely something is , the more skeptical you should be .
People make outrageous statements because that kind of statement gets them attention or gets them in the news .
Outrageous statements are also more likely to be repeated to others — without validation of course .
Is it hurtful to others ?
If so , then you owe it to those people — even if you do n’t know them — to verify the statement before you repeat it to others .
Is the statement based on facts ?
How do you know ?
What is the source of the alleged facts ?
Is the source trustworthy ?
Where did the source get the information ?
Trace the facts back to their origin to confirm their validity .
If the statement is n’t based on facts , then the speaker or writer is asking you to trust them .
Should you ?
Do you have a basis for that trust ?
Is there any reason the speaker / writer might want to deceive you or to “ spin ” the facts in a self - serving way ?
Watch for loaded words ( e.g. , racist , terrorist , meltdown , bailout , etc. ) that add emotional meaning to an alleged factual statement .
Replace the loaded words with unemotional words and see if the statement still makes sense .
Look for exaggerations that distort the importance of something that ’s otherwise commonplace ( e.g. , “ A recent study shows that half of the people in the world are below average . ” )
Do n’t let statistics fool you .
Adding numbers to something that ’s not true should n’t make it more credible , especially if the numbers are made up or if the numbers come from a biased survey or study .
Verify the source of the statistics , and if the statistics are based on a survey then make sure that the survey questions are n’t misleading ( a common way to bias an answer ) and that the sample used for the survey fairly represents the relevant population .
Watch out for confusion between correlation and cause / effect .
Just because some factor ( e.g. , poverty ) is correlated with another factor ( e.g. , obesity ) does n’t mean that the first factor causes the second factor , or that the second factor causes the first factor .
Both factors may be caused by something else .
But advocates of a particular point of view may use statistics to make it appear that there is a cause / effect relationship between two things when in fact there is only a correlation .
7 . Build a base of sources you trust , and make sure it ’s a solid base .
For media , political and religious sources , look at how other people view your potential source .
If a large number of people view your source as extreme , then reconsider whether the source really ought to be in your base .
8 . Use your base of sources as a “ norm , ” and evaluate other sources of information based on their variation from your norm .
Any source of information that varies a great deal from your norm ought to be subjected to additional scrutiny before you accept that new source as credible .
9 . Do n’t be too volatile in your views .
If a news story suddenly goes off in a crazy direction ( e.g. , a massive conspiracy theory ) , then question it .
Let your response be incremental , in stages , changing your view slowly as you get more and more information to verify the news .
Do n’t overreact .
10 .
Be an extremist only if you want to be .
If your base of sources is considered to be extreme , then you ’ll be an extremist .
But recognize that extremist views are quite different from the norm , that those views are considered by many to be inappropriate , and that extremist views are seen by most people as lacking credibility .
You might want to consider getting some of your news and information from more moderate sources so you ’ll understand mainstream views better .
Conclusion
Everyone has beliefs .
The beliefs may be different from your own , but that does n’t make those people wrong , and it certainly does n’t make those people bad for having those beliefs .
It just makes them individuals .
If the individuals are n’t interfering in the lives of others , and if the beliefs are n’t leading to hurtful or unlawful actions , then let people believe what they want .
Respect the beliefs of others , and maybe they ’ll respect your beliefs as well .
The latest in a long line of charges of war crimes by Israeli forces during January ’s invasion of the Gaza Strip , a new report by Human Rights Watch cites investigations and reports of eyewitnesses who say Israeli soldiers shot 11 unarmed Palestinians , including five women and four children , who were waving white flags at them .
The report urged the Israeli military to conduct a thorough investigation into the charges , but this appears unlikely as the Israeli military publicly condemned Human Rights Watch for releasing the report .
saying that it was unreliable because it included eyewitness accounts and accusing the US - based rights group of unfairly criticizing Israel for an invasion that killed well over 1,000 Palestinians , the vast majority of them civilians .
The Israeli military also claimed that on occasion Gazans had acted illegally in waving white flags , insisting that this had endangered the civilian population .
It did not appear to provide any information to directly dispute the evidence of the particular incident , but merely appeared irked that Human Rights Watch did n’t present it to them before releasing it to the public .
Israel ’s own probes into the Gaza War have largely stalled without result , most notably when it abandoned an investigation stemming from the direct public testimony of several of its own soldiers who reported indiscriminate killing of civilians just days after announcing it .
The military declared that all the testimony was “ hearsay ” and that not a single claim was true .
Senator also wants to see recent study confirming explosives in the debris of the World Trade Center as Fox News propagandizes the report .
By Manny Badillo , nephew of Thomas Joseph Sgroi , written on 06/03/09
NEW YORK , NY -- New York 's junior Senator Kirsten Gillibrand fully supports the victims ’ family members , hero first responders , and all New Yorkers pursuit of justice concerning the events of Sept. 11th , 2001 .
Filling the Senate seat of Secretary Hillary Clinton , Sen .
Gillibrand is one of the first in Congress to speak publicly about her commitment to finding out what really happened during the unsolved mass murder of innocents close to eight years ago in New York , Washington , and Pennsylvania .
After hearing of the recent peer - reviewed and refereed study , which found explosives in the debris of the world trade center , Sen .
Gillibrand said , “ “ Based on what you ’ve just told me , and that 70 % of family members questions were not answered during the commission hearings , I think those questions should be answered . ”
The scientific study is titled ‘ Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe ’ and authored by Niels H. Harrit , Jeffrey Farrer , Steven E. Jones , Kevin R. Ryan , Frank M. Legge , Daniel Farnsworth , Gregg Roberts , James R. Gourley , and Bradley R. Larsen .
Sen .
Gillandbrand continued , “ So if that means another review , or a fuller hearing , or more opportunities for the families , I will support that , because I do think that it ’s important that every family member has every question answered . ”
When asked if she would accept the study for review , she said , “ I will certainly look at the study , and review it - absolutely . ”
Concerning the James Zadroga bill , which would reopen the 9/11 victims compensation fund for sick first responders , Sen .
Gillibrand said she is working on the House side with New York ’s Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney to , “ pass a 9/11 health bill .
It ’s really important the first responders have the health care they need . ”
Sen .
Gillibrand also said , when asked of her support for the petition campaign in New York City to give residents the ability to vote yes or no for a privately - funded investigation with full subpoena power , “ I would very much like to look at that issue , because … the voters really should be part of the discussion .
Would you give me that information , so I can review it ? ”
In response to the report , the entrenched corporate media has been silent save for one mention on Fox News in which the company referred to the interview as being conducted by ‘ conspiracy theorists ’ , even though the family member and fallen loved one were mentioned by name .
Speaking and presenting members of our Congress about citizens ’ issues is our obligation , and our right .
How can Fox News propagandize a loved one ’s simple and heartfelt concerns ?
And why call our Senator gullible when presented with the completely verifiable facts of the matter ?
Sen .
Gillibrand before leaving the venue received a copy of the film ‘ In their Own Words ’ , a follow - up to the documentary ‘ Press for Truth ’ .
Both speak in depth about the family members concerns during the Commission hearings .
So absolutely Senator , we will give to you any and all information desired pertaining to the crime which took my Uncle ’s life and 3,000 others years ago .
We The People thank you for your honesty and integrity when answering questions about an event which begs for investigation and prosecution of those involved .
‘ My husband is NOT Secretary of State - I am ! ' :
Hillary Clinton 's outburst at African student after week of Bill stealing limelight
She has dealt with questions about her husband 's private life with good grace .
She even kept smiling last week when the former president stole her thunder by securing the release of two American journalists during a high - profile trip to North Korea .
But Hillary Clinton decided enough was enough when she was asked what her husband Bill thought about a foreign policy issue .
' I'm the Secretary of State ' : Hillary Clinton gestures to make her point during the session in Kinshasa
Mrs Clinton 's outburst has made headlines around the world
' You want me to tell you what my husband thinks ? ' she snapped back at her questioner .
‘ My husband is not Secretary of State .
I am , ’ she raged after a translator made a mistake and asked what her partner felt about an international matter .
Mrs Clinton , who was speaking at a meeting in the Congolese capital Kinshasa during her first official tour of Africa , looked clearly rattled .
‘ You want me to tell you what my husband thinks ? ’ she replied incredulously when the male student asked her what ‘ Mr Clinton ’ thought of World Bank concerns about a multibillion - dollar Chinese loan offer to the Democratic Republic of Congo .
‘ If you want my opinion , I will tell you my opinion .
I am not going to be channelling my husband . ’
See video of Mrs Clinton 's outburst here
The question was left unanswered as the moderator of the event quickly moved on .
The translator should have asked what ' Mr Obama ' thought as the student 's question was actually about Barack Obama , not Bill Clinton .
Sidelined for weeks after she was injured during a fall this spring , Mrs Clinton returned to a flurry of speculation that she had been shoved to the side as a diplomatic force .
Commentators said she had been overshadowed by globe - trotting President Barack Obama , Vice President Joe Biden and a bevy of heavyweight special envoys assigned to the world ’s critical hotspots .
Mrs Clinton is greeted by members of the government on arrival at the airport in Kinshasa , Congo yesterday - the latest in an 11 - day journey through Africa
Mrs Clinton launched into a series of high - profile speeches and television appearances .
But just as she landed in Africa , her ambitious visit ran into stiff competition from her husband ’s secret mission to North Korea .
He was praised for his role in freeing the two American journalists and talking with the regime ’s leader , Kim Jong Il .
And if previous spats are anything to go by , the Clintons are certain to face further speculation about the state of their marriage .
Divorce rumours peaked in the 1990s when Mr Clinton was in the White House and faced accusations that he had an ‘ improper relationship ’ with secretary Monica Lewinsky .
Headline grabber : Bill Clinton meets North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il
Last year commentators speculated again after Mrs Clinton ’s failed White House run was said to have been derailed by her husband ’s intemperate outbursts .
Since then , however , But Mr Clinton had – until last week ’s foreign foray - kept himself unnoticed and allowed his wife as much limelight as she could garner .
And over the last month she has been grabbing headlines with a major foreign policy address in Washington and travels to India and Thailand .
She is in the middle of a marathon 11 - day tour of Africa , so far visiting seven nations .
Her gruelling schedule includes official meetings and private events that have kept her busy from sunrise to well after sunset .
This weekend I bought new headphones for my iPhone at Mikey 's Hook Up , one of our local computer stores here in Williamsburg .
Everything was good until I saw their absolutely outrageous returns policy in their receipt .

UW Engineers Invent First Tree - Powered Circuit
September 10th , 2009 by Michael Ricciardi
In a first , researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle have developed a completely tree - powered electrical circuit .
The nano - scale device — approximately 130 nanometers [ a nanometer is one billionth of a meter ] in size — consumes just 10 billionths of a watt ( 10 nanowatts ) .
Unlike the legendary science fair experiment in which a potato - based electric circuit is created using two electrodes ( each electrode being a different metal , which react with the starch , causing a potential difference and thus a current ) , the UW device utilizes electrodes comprised of the same metal , and is able to generate ( output ) 1.1 volts .
“ As far as we know , this is the first peer - reviewed paper of someone powering something entirely by sticking electrodes into a tree , ” according to paper co-author Babak Parviz , associate professor of electrical engineering at the UW .
Last year , researchers at MIT discovered that a constant current of about 200 millivolts ( a millivolt is one thousandth of a volt ) is generated between plant and soil .
But that work did not involve attempting to power any device or circuit , which would require making a device capable of running ( performing some function ) on exceedingly low voltages .
The UW researchers sought to apply this knowledge to power an actual device .
In seeking an ideal candidate power source under - graduate student Carlton Himes discovered that the broad - leaf Maple tree ( common in the area ) supplied a steady voltage of a few hundred millivolts .
Despite this , the researchers realized that they would need a bit more juice to power a such circuit .
To solve this challenge , co-author and UW assistant professor of electrical engineering Brian Otis led a team that developed a “ boost converter ” which takes the low incoming voltage and stores it to produce a stronger output .
The device is able to work with voltages as low as 20 millivolts and can output 1.1 volts–enough to power a small sensor that can be used to take the “ pulse ” of the tree ( its periodic pulsing of electrical energy ) which may indicate its overall health .

Dodd praises Choice of Aaron Williams
Senator Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Chairman of its Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere , Peace Corps and Global Narcotics Affairs , released the following statement after the President announced his nomination of Aaron Williams , Vice President for International Business Development with RTI International , to be the Director of the Peace Corps .
Dodd , a returned Peace Corps Volunteer , who served in the Dominican Republic , recently introduced the Peace Corps Improvement and Expansion Act of 2009 , which would combine a reform with growth strategy in order to achieve the goal of doubling the size of a reformed , streamlined and more effective Peace Corps .
" I am excited by Mr. Williams ' nomination to be the new Director of the Peace Corps , " said Dodd .
" It 's exciting to have a nominee who served in the Peace Corps and also has experience in international development and management .
I look forward to discussing the urgent need for broad based reform at the Peace Corps with Mr. Williams at his confirmation hearing and to working with the Obama Administration to strengthen and expand the Peace Corps . "

Senate Subcommittee Holds Confirmation Hearings for Aaron Williams to Become the 18th Director of the Peace Corps
July 29 , 2009 - This is the third set of Confirmation Hearings for a Peace Corps Director that we have reported on and in many ways it was the most sedate and routine .
It is obvious that Senator Dodd is intent on getting Aaron Williams confirmed as Director as soon as possible so that Williams can help convince Dodd 's senate colleagues especially Senator Leahy of Vermont that the agency is in good hands so that when the budgets approved for the Peace Corps by the Senate and the House go to conference in the fall , the House 's expansion budget of $ 450 million for FY 2010 will garner Senate support .
Senator Dodd said at the close of the hearings that he hoped that the senate could move things along and get Williams confirmed before the August recess .
The hearings themselves were a veritable love - fest between Senator Dodd , Senator Isakson of Georgia ( the ranking Republican member of the committee ) , former Senator Harris Wofford who introduced Williams , and Aaron Williams , the Director designee .
The hearings , which lasted a few minutes less than one hour , were long on generalities and good will , and short on specifics of how Williams intends to run the agency .
Although a lot of issues were discussed , what was perhaps most important was what was left unsaid for although Harris Wofford mentioned a bold new Peace Corps and referred to President Obama 's promise to double the Peace Corps , there was no mention by Williams about Obama 's promise to increase the agency 's budget .
What is clear from the hearings is that Williams has the background and the skills to be one of the most effective Peace Corps Directors in the agency 's history .
The challenges are great - our best wishes and support to Mr Williams in meeting them .

There is a lot of disinformation about health insurance reform out there , spanning from control of personal finances to end of life care .
These rumors often travel just below the surface via chain emails or through casual conversation .
Since we ca n’t keep track of all of them here at the White House , we ’re asking for your help .
If you get an email or see something on the web about health insurance reform that seems fishy , send it to flag@whitehouse.gov .
Think it ’s a joke ?
It is n’t .
It ’s a direct quote from whitehouse.gov .
I promise .
It ’s here ( as of this writing ) .
OK , so y’all Obama apologists all right with that ?
Is that just a sensible and prudent measure against the radical right - wing menace ?
Or is it , you know , something like … I do n’t know …an increasingly powerful central state seeking to chill the free flow of information , and inviting you to report your fellow comrade American ?
Who ’s on board ?
Who ’s behind this 100 % ?
Who thinks this is a really neat thing to appear on the web site of the President of the United States ?
Speak up .
Let me hear from you .
Tell me it ’s all right with you for you to read on an official U.S. government web site , essentially : “ yeah , if you see anything that does n’t sound quite right to you , maybe you just better let us know about it , and we ’ll get it all straightened out for you . ”
Ca n’t you feel that comforting arm , which would never hurt you because it is the arm of Your Benevolent Government , slide around you as those words flow into your ear ?
Do you even have a “ too much government ” threshold ?
If so , how close are you to it ?
You want to babble to me some more about how afraid you were of the Bush administration ?

WASHINGTON – Exxon - Mobil Corporation , the world ’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company , pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Denver to violating the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act ( MBTA ) in five states during the past five years , the Justice Department announced today .
The company has agreed to pay fines and community service payments totaling $ 600,000 and will implement an environmental compliance plan over the next three years aimed at preventing bird deaths on the company ’s facilities in the affected states .
According to papers filed in court , the company has already spent over $ 2.5 million to begin implementation of the plan .
The charges stem from the deaths of approximately 85 protected birds , including waterfowl , hawks and owls , at Exxon - Mobil drilling and production facilities in Colorado , Wyoming , Oklahoma , Texas and Kansas between 2004 and 2009 .
According to the charges and other information presented in court , most of the birds died after exposure to hydrocarbons in uncovered natural gas well reserve pits and waste water storage facilities at Exxon - Mobil sites in Colorado , Wyoming , Kansas , Oklahoma and Texas .
The company has entered into a plea agreement with the government , calling for guilty pleas to the five charges and a sentence of $ 400,000 in fines and $ 200,000 in community service payments .
The fines will be deposited into the federally - administered North American Wetlands Conservation Fund .
The community service payments will be made to a non-profit waterfowl rehabilitation foundation in Colorado and the congressionally - chartered National Fish and Wildlife Foundation , designated for waterfowl preservation work in each of the affected states .
During a three - year probationary period , Exxon - Mobil must also implement an " environmental compliance plan " designed to keep birds from coming into contact with oily waters at its facilities in the five affected states .
" The environmental compliance plan that Exxon - Mobil has agreed to in this multi - district plea agreement is an important step in protecting migratory birds in these five states , " said John C. Cruden , Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division .
" We are all responsible for protecting our wildlife , even the largest of corporations , " said Colorado U.S. Attorney David M. Gaouette .
" An important part of this case is the implementation of an environmental compliance plan that will help prevent future migratory bird deaths . "
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act , enacted in 1918 , implements this country ’s commitments under avian protection treaties with Great Britain ( for Canada ) , Mexico , Japan and Russia .
The Act creates a misdemeanor criminal sanction for the unpermitted taking of listed species by any means and in any manner regardless of fault .
The maximum penalty for a corporate taking under the MBTA is $ 15,000 , or twice the gross gain or loss resulting from the offense , and five years probation .
The birds killed in the five cases include ducks , grebes , ibis , passerines , shorebirds , owls , martin and a hawk .
None of these species is listed as endangered or threatened under federal law .
Migratory birds often land on open wastewater ponds at oil and gas facilities and become coated with , or ingest , fatal amounts of hydrocarbons discharged into the water during drilling or production operations .
Such killings can be prevented by scrubbing the water of contaminants before discharge , removing the ponds , placing an obstruction such as netting or plastic " bird balls " over the water to prevent contact , or installing commercially - manufactured electronic hazing devices which detect incoming flights of migratory birds and deploy noise and lights to scare them away from the area .
Exxon - Mobil ’s environmental compliance plan will employ these techniques , tailored to each facility , to prevent future mortality .
The cases were investigated by Special Agents of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and are being prosecuted by Senior Trial Attorney Robert S. Anderson of the Justice Department ’s Environmental Crimes Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Carey of the District of Colorado .
On Friday Jamie King , director of the Steal This Film documentaries , speculated here on TorrentFreak that the brand new OpenBitTorrent tracker could prove to be a replacement for The Pirate Bay if certain conditions were met .
Now , just 48 hours later - has that dream already become reality ?
In his article ‘ Playing Whack - A - Mole With Data : The Pirate Bay Lives On ‘ , Jamie King cut through much of the doom and gloom of the last week and took a refreshingly optimistic view of how the sale of The Old Pirate Bay might not necessarily be the death - touch many people in the BitTorrent community think it is .
Jamie mused : “ What if someone was to simply scrape and copy all The Pirate Bay ’s torrents over to a new tracker and Mininova and all the other indexes currently using the TPB tracker were to change their listings to point to that ?
OpenBitTorrent.com for example , an independent open tracker which started recently . ”
So today we ask this question – was Jamie ’s article incredibly prophetic ?
Or did it provide the spark , the catalyst , the inspiration needed to bring the BitTorrent community out of its premature misery this week , instead prompting it into positive action rather than self - destruction ?
Whatever the truth , whatever the route , today the BitTorrent community has reason for cautious optimism – or possibly a full - scale celebration .
Try this for yourself , do n’t take my word for it .
First of all find a torrent on The Pirate Bay – I chose Montt Mardie ’s “ We Are All The Pirate Bay ” for symbolic demo purposes here .

BNP leader Nick Griffin
VIEWPOINT
With two seats in the European Parliament the BNP has made a leap towards the political mainstream .
But , asks Kenan Malik , should those who have so far shunned the party now engage with them ?
Next month Nick Griffin , leader of the British National Party , will take his seat at the BBC's Question Time table .
Around that table there will be the justice secretary and Labour MP , Jack Straw , and representatives from the other two main political parties .
Question
Time is the BBC 's flagship political debate show Mr Straw 's decision to share a platform with the BNP is a reversal of Labour Party policy and has prompted soul searching among some members .
Until now , Labour has refused to appear alongside the BNP and Home Secretary Alan Johnson has publicly stated that he would not debate with someone he considers to be a racist .
For the BBC , the success of two BNP candidates - including Mr Griffin himself - in the Euro elections in June meant that an invitation to Question Time was inevitable .
Ric Bailey , chief political advisor to the BBC , says that the corporation " cannot discriminate between parties according to their policies .
That would be a breach of impartiality " .
With others , however , the impartiality argument cuts little ice .
Chris Keates , general secretary of Britain 's largest teachers ' union , the NASUWT , which has been running a campaign to stop the BNP , is outraged at the idea of Nick Griffin on Question Time .

Straw joins debate alongside BNP " The BBC can quite legitimately make a distinction between the BNP and other political parties , and not give them a platform to promote racial hatred , intolerance and violence , " she says .
The controversy over Question Time puts in sharp focus a debate that has been brewing since the BNP 's success in the Euro elections : how should a liberal democratic society respond to an organisation such as the BNP ?
Should the political mainstream ostracise the BNP , or engage with it ?
And if engage , how ?
Unlike in other European nations , the far right has never won mass support in Britain , nor tasted electoral success .
Oswald Mosley 's Blackshirts in the 1930s and the National Front in the 1970s were openly racist organisations , many of whose members were involved in violent actions .
Compared with their Continental cousins , however , they were marginal groups , with virtually no political presence .
A fascist protest by the Blackshirts
The roots of today 's BNP lie in that political tradition .
Formed in 1982 , it was , in its early years , very similar to the NF in its ideas , policies and support .
From the late 1990s onwards , however , the party embarked on a programme of " modernisation " under its new leader , Nick Griffin .
Learning from the successes of French Front National , the party tried to give up its skinhead image , swapping bovver boots for sober suits .
Nick Griffin says the bovver boot image of the BNP is " something created mainly by hysterical media lies " and insists the BNP is no longer a racist party .
How genuine the conversion has been may be gauged by the party 's constitution which is still , and I quote from it , " wholly opposed to any form of racial integration between British and non-European peoples " and believes in restoring " the overwhelmingly white make up of the British population that existed in Britain prior to 1948 " .
Osmosis
While one might rightly be cynical about the rebranding of the BNP , what has indubitably changed is the nature of its support .
It shows a lack of trust in the British people to suggest that if they 're exposed to racist views , they 'll all be swayed by them
Philippe Legrain During June 's Euro elections , the polling organisation YouGov conducted a survey of about 32,000 voters , including more than 1,100 BNP supporters .
About half the BNP voters , YouGov found , were out - and - out racists , many of whom would probably have supported the party in its pre-modernization days .
But they 've been joined by a swath of new supporters whose hostility towards immigrants is shaped less by old - fashioned racism than by a new - fangled sense of fear and insecurity .
Many are traditional Labour supporters who now feel abandoned by the political mainstream , anxious about their future and distrustful of any figure of authority .
Little will sway the views of the hard - line racists , YouGov 's Peter Kellner believes .
But those drawn to the BNP because they have become alienated from the mainstream political process should not simply be dismissed as bigots by the mainstream .
It is the failure to engage with them , and with their fears and concerns , that helped pave their way to the far right .
But just as fear is driving many towards the BNP , it is also shaping much of the response to the BNP .
A Rock Against Racism protest in 1978
The result is an incoherent and illiberal reaction , vacillating between demonising the BNP and pandering to its prejudices .
Some critics of the BNP fear that allowing the party into public forums , such as Question Time , can only increase its support .
The writer and economist Philippe Legrain is unimpressed .
" It shows a complete lack of trust in the British people to suggest that if they 're exposed to racist views on television , they 'll all be swayed by them . "
The best way to deal with obnoxious views is through open debate , not censorship , he says .
Others fear that support for the BNP will continue to grow unless mainstream politicians accept that indigenous Britons are being unfairly treated .
It 's a view that has led many politicians who are not racist nevertheless to echo the claims of the far - right .
When Gordon Brown talked of " British jobs for British workers " , he adopted a slogan last heard on National Front demonstrations in the 1980s .
For Mr Legrain , the real problem is not the BNP itself as an over - reaction to its relatively minor electoral successes , an over - reaction that betrays a lack of confidence by mainstream politicians in both the electorate and in basic liberal democratic values .
" I would have more confidence in people and more confidence in the power of the arguments . "
Kenan Malik is a writer on issues of race and multiculturalism .
A selection of your comments appears below .
No matter what we think of the BNP the fact is they won those seats in a free and fair election .
If we refuse to deal with them then we negate the whole principle of democracy .
The way to " win " is to engage not ignore or censor
David Andrew , Penicuik
We must engage with the BNP .
Give them a voice , so they may be judged by what they actually say on a bigger stage .
They do raise the profile of some important issues that mainstream politicians do n't want to face - the lack of integration of many ethnic groups , ( many of which do n't want to integrate in my view ) , immigration policy and disenfranchisement of the white working classes .
While these issues are left unspoken , the BNP will make mischief with them .
Tarek , London
We live in a democratic society .
The BNP are a legitimate political party .
Like them or not , they must be allowed to participate on Question Time and other such platforms .
If other political parties , or their MPs boycott such events , then they are weak and undemocratic , so should not be MPs .
The BBC are absolutely correct to include the BNP in Question Time .
Denken , London Chris Keates needs to remember we live in a democracy and that implies a great many freedoms , some he appears to object to , many sadly being lost .
It is surely the presence of the BNP , and its ability to speak and stand as a representative of parts of the UK that establishes us as a free democracy .
What a sad day if the likes of Ms Keates were able to decide who may speak and what they may say .
That being the case he might consider what differentiates his position with that of the BNP , in particular should they campaign for greater freedom of speech and more democracy .
Simon Mallett , Maidstone Kent I do not want anyone telling me that I am not allowed to hear what the BNP has to say .
I will make up my own mind rather than someone ( in this case ) on the Left doing it for me .
Gary Misinformation and downright lies spread around the media from the mainstream political parties have only increased the interest in the BNP .
The people can see through their lies and with this it has undermined their very presence to represent the voting public of the UK .
You cannot win on lies and misinformation .
Engage in an open forum and if the mainstream parties ' views are true to their word the people will then believe and re-engage with them .
If not , they will be found out and the people will move away .
Have they the guts to do this ...
The people , the voting public are waiting .
Where are you ..
Tony , Walsall
Like it or not , if we are to consider ourselves a truly democratic country , then all views and opinions , no matter how twisted and obnoxious others feel them to be , are as valid , in terms of a debate , as any other .
The " hardline racists " will not be swayed by a debate on Question Time , but those who feel ignored by the mainstream parties , perhaps feeling the BNP is listening and responding to issues which matter to them , such as immigration , will be totally horrified by their openly racist stance .
But what are the BNP 's other policies ?
What of schools , hospitals , transport , welfare , police , the armed forces , the economic crises , Iraq , Afghanistan , the Middle East peace process , the recent flair of trouble in Northern Ireland and all the other major areas which require a competent government .
By censoring the BNP or refusing to meet them , politicians give the impression , whether true or not , that they are afraid to face them in an open debate , fuelling the thought in people 's minds that the BNP maybe ' on to something ' .
Andrew Stratton , Maidstone
What we need to remember here is that a democracy exists to exercise the will of the people - not the will of those already in power .
If the people want the BNP , then unfortunately they have just as much right to be in power as any other group .
If people want to defeat the BNP and stop it 's message of hate , then as Mr Malik so astutely observed , political parties must pander to those who are rallying under the BNP 's flag not due to hatred or bigotry , but due to fear and ignorance .
We must always respect the fact that the BNP has just as much right as any political party .
If we start to persecute their freedom of speech and expression ( however perverse the message they give ) , then we run the risk of becoming something even worse than the BNP .
Evis T , Menai Bridge , Ynys Mon
It is not about being " swayed " as suggested by Legrain , but waking the widespread racism that still exists in Britain today .
Before Harvey Milk , Lesbians and Gay voices were not heard in a democratic political structure .
It needed mainstreaming before an uprise of confidence in the LGBT community .
This is now happening for racists ; and while groups like Stonewall gained a voice to fight oppression , the BNP 's primary aim is to restrict and oppress .
Yong Lee , Maidstone , England I think anyone who thinks that a large proportion of the public who watch this debate wo n't be at least partially convinced by the arguments of the BNP is slightly naïve .
The vast majority of people are egocentric , if not wholly on their own behalf then at least on behalf of their family and friends , and many of the policies of the BNP will appeal to the naturally self - preserving instincts of the public .
We know that this can happen , it certainly has before ( albeit not in this country ) .
This is compounded by the fact that many people have no faith in the mainstream political parties .

Sarah Palin , June 3 :
" We need to be aware of the creation of a fearful population , and fearful lawmakers , being led to believe that big government is the answer , to bail out the private sector , because then government gets to get in there and control it , " she said .
" And mark my words , this is going to be next , I fear , bail out next debt - ridden states .
Then government gets to get in there and control the people . "

Aid Request Spurned By U.S. Officials Push State To Repair Budget
The Obama administration has turned back pleas for emergency aid from one of the biggest remaining threats to the economy -- the state of California .
Top state officials have gone hat in hand to the administration , armed with dire warnings of a fast - approaching " fiscal meltdown " caused by a budget shortfall .
Concern has grown inside the White House in recent weeks as California 's fiscal condition has worsened , leading to high - level administration meetings .
But federal officials are worried that a bailout of California would set off a cascade of demands from other states .
Who knows ?
Perhaps the Palin conspiracy trolling will turn out to be accurate .
But so far , she 's wrong .
While we 're at it , it 's worth noting that ( 1 ) while California gets back $ 0.78 for every dollar it pays in federal taxes , Alaska gets $ 1.84 and ( 2 ) even if the federal government did offer some form of temporary assistance , the notion that providing such aid would mean the " government gets to get in there and control the people " is absolutely crazy .
No wonder she wants to talk about late night comedy shows -- she 's a joke .

Although I wish you well in your transition from the national on - the - air ABC News to the cable based Fox News , I am a bit saddened to see you go .
Your presence on the MSM ABC News was the only Libertarian oasis in a sea of statist reporting .
I believe your public standing and prestige may suffer for moving to Fox , insofar that Fox is often viewed as an extremist right wing network .
My misgivings notwithstanding , I can understand why , on the whole , you are doing so .
After 28 years of ABC ideological friction , it would appear that Fox News is willing to give you an unfettered platform to espouse the Libertarian viewpoint on matters big and small , in a way of depth and breadth never permitted on ABC .
And it is true that Andrew Neopolitano has been treated fairly and been given free reign to espouse undiluted Libertarian perspectives ( albeit not in prime time ) , and that respect bodes well for you .
Additionally as a counterpoint to his show , your style is more intellectual and educational than Andrew's , and it will well fill in the innate substance of Libertarianism , in contrast to his more practical outraged - man - in - the - street approach .
After settling into the rote program dynamics of your new media home , I respectfully submit my fervent recommendation to you and in the furtherance of Libertarian cause and the public view thereof ; I urge the affirmative and thematic distinction be pressed in your presentations , of the viewpoint , precepts , and applied theory of Libertarianism from the Fox News ' incumbent , extremist Right wing , neocon philosophy and political stance .
Republicans , now on political defensive , seek to subsume Libertarianism and its refreshing youthful energy as just an idealistic branch of Republicanism .
In the public mind , Libertarianism is becoming to look like neocon - lite .
The average person does not know or understand that the conclusions wrought from Republican political theory and those wrought from Libertarian political theory stem from two very different pedigrees .
It is thus imperative to emphasize at every turn , the significant differences between Libertarianism and the current incarnation of right - wing , ( neo ) conservative , Republicanism .
Things like legal gay marriage , cross - the - board drug legalization , legalized prostitution , unregulated gambling , stem - cell research ( and arguably abortion ) , our anti-war sentiment and the pulling out of military oversea bases , separation of church and state , pro-immigration viewpoints , competing legal tenders , and more .
These are uber contrare from Fox News and neocon perspectives , and would serve to show that Libertarianism is radically not neocon or Republican .
Populist Republicans are skimming truths off the surface of Libertarianism – ignoring or sidestepping where and how those derivitive truths evolved from Libertarian fundamentals – and then aligning themselves with it to exploit the spirit , energy and community of Libertarianism .
Then , using that platform , they sneak in a plethora of other political ideas that simply are not libertarian , effectuating heresy on the uninformed and corrupting our public image .
John , if you are going to enter the belly of the dragon that is Fox News , then you should take your vantage point , that will be so close to the dragon 's heart , and use it to its best benefit – educating ( or re-educating ) all the lost souls that have consumed Fox 's party - line sophistry , and give them a real basis for believing in liberty – not one supported only by charismatic talking heads , but based on real philosophical fundamentals that do n't change with the prevailing opinion or the political power du jour .
You can further correct the misdirection of neocons ' effort at commandeering the liberty movement as one of rightwing Republicanism .
Re-cast it properly as a Libertarian one .
My reluctance to participate in the political tea parties is exactly due to this , I do n't want to appear to blindly support the Republican Party 's reactionary opposition to all things Obama or Democrat .
I too have issues with both , but it is not caused by or cast from the same mold as the Republicans , as I am sure you can empathize , both of us being Libertarians .
In sum John , although you will lose your national podium as a major newsprogram anchor , please do take advantage of your expanded ability to say what you have wanted to say ; convert the majority viewership of Fox from statist step - in - time sheep , to flexible passionate liberty loving freethinkers , whose allegience is not to a party , but rather to a cause and mission to liberty .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The head of the World Bank on Monday sounded a cautionary note about granting greater regulatory power to the U.S. Federal Reserve and said the dollar ’s future will “ depend heavily on U.S. choices . ”
Slideshow ( 3 images )
“ It should not be a surprise that American democracy is hesitating about authorizing the Fed to supervise systemic banking as well as operating monetary policy , adding to its power , ” World Bank President Robert Zoellick said .
In a speech prepared for delivery at Johns Hopkins University ’s School of Advanced International Studies , Zoellick said the U.S. Congress had a long tradition of viewing banks with suspicion that made it a challenge to beef up the U.S. central bank ’s power after last year ’s financial panic .
Aiming to prevent a repeat of the crisis that pushed the world financial system to the brink of collapse , President Barack Obama has proposed sweeping changes to U.S. regulation that would make the Fed the lead systemic risk regulator .
“ It will be difficult to vest the independent and powerful technocrats at the Federal Reserve with more authority .
My reading of recent crisis management is that the Treasury Department needed greater authority to pull together a bevy of different regulators , ” Zoellick said .
Zoellick , speaking ahead of the annual World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings that open in Istanbul on Sunday , commended central banks for forceful action once the crisis hit .
But he said they face “ reasonable questions ” for failing to prevent asset bubbles -- notably in the U.S. housing market -- and for serious lapses in financial supervision .
“ We have yet to see whether central banks can handle the recovery without letting inflation get out of control , ” he said .
This will be crucial in determining whether the U.S. dollar could retain its lead role as a global reserve currency , he added .
“ Of course , the U.S. dollar is and will remain a major currency .
But the greenback ’s fortunes will depend heavily on U.S. choices .
Will the United States resolve its debt problems without a resort to inflation ? , ” Zoellick asked .
He also cautioned U.S. authorities not to take dollar dominance for granted , and noted that the euro common currency , as well as the yuan of an increasingly powerful China , gave investors more choices to diversify their holdings .
“ The United States would be mistaken to take for granted the dollar ’s place as the world ’s predominant reserve currency .
Looking forward , there will increasingly be other options to the dollar , ” he said .
PHOENIX , Arizona ( CNN ) --
He was to demonstrating his right to bear arms -- and he wanted you to know it .
A man is shown legally carrying a rifle at a protest against President Obama on Monday in Phoenix , Arizona .
Video of the unidentified man toting an assault rifle outside President Obama 's speech to veterans Monday was aired all over the country , causing a buzz about weapons popping up -- legally -- around recent presidential events .
The protester , who refused to give his name , was interviewed by a man carrying a microphone and said , " I am almost always armed . "
The interview , done by Libertarian radio talk show host Ernest Hancock , was staged .
" Absolutely , " Hancock told CNN 's Rick Sanchez Tuesday .
" You guys are so easy .
What we wanted to do was make sure that people around the country knew that law enforcement in Phoenix , Arizona , protects our rights . "
Watch the rifle being legally carried at rally »
The Phoenix - based host of " Declare Your Independence with Ernest Hancock " identified the bespectacled man with the AR - 15 semi-automatic assault rifle as " Chris , " saying he 's known him for two years as part of a younger generation of Libertarians .
" We are up against a tyrannical government that will rob the next generation as long as they can get away with it , " Hancock said .
Chris " understands that his generation is going to be plundered until there is nothing left to plunder , " he added .
And while Hancock admitted the interview was staged , he insisted the protester 's message was not .
Do n't Miss Obama pledges increased support to war veterans
" I come from another state where ' open carry ' is legal , but no one does it , so the police do n't really know about it and they harass people , arrest people falsely , " the protester identified as Chris told Hancock in an interview aired by CNN affiliate KNXV .
" I think that people need to get out and do it more so that they get kind of conditioned to it . "
Video from KNXV shows the man standing with other protesters , with the rifle slung over his right shoulder , a handgun in a holster on his left hip , and a bullet clip in his back pocket .
The same protester told KNXV separately , " I 'm exercising my rights as an American in Arizona . "
The protester was among a dozen other demonstrators carrying unconcealed guns outside the Obama event .
Hancock , who said he was packing a 9 - millimeter Beretta pistol , added that Phoenix police had known about the group 's intent to protest while carrying guns .
" They are the ones standing a few feet away from us " at Monday 's protest , Hancock said .
" Oftentimes , the citizenry are better armed than law enforcement -- they need us on their side . "
Arizona law has nothing in the books regulating assault rifles , and only requires permits for carrying concealed weapons .
So despite the man 's proximity to the president , there were no charges or arrests to be made , according to Phoenix police .
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Andy Hill on Monday said officers explained the law to some people who were upset about the presence of weapons at the protest .
Hill told CNN on Tuesday that the widely broadcast protest was no different than any other for law enforcement , in that investigators with the " community response unit " had communicated with the group ahead of time .
" We try to have as much open communication as possible so we know what to expect and how to prepare , " he said , adding that the police department relayed information about Monday 's to federal law enforcement .
He added that because of Arizona 's open carry law , it 's not uncommon for protesters to pack heat at demonstrations .
Gun-toting protesters have demonstrated around the president before .
Last week , a man protesting outside Obama 's town hall meeting in New Hampshire had a gun strapped to his thigh .
That state also does n't require a license for open carry .
U.S. Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan acknowledged the incidents in New Hampshire and Arizona , but said he was not aware of any other recent events where protesters attended with open weapons .
He said there was no indication that anyone had organized the incidents .
Asked whether the individuals carrying weapons jeopardized the safety of the president , Donovan said , " Of course not . "
The individuals would never have gotten close to the president , regardless of any state laws on openly carrying weapons , he said .
A venue is considered a federal site when the Secret Service is protecting the president , and weapons are not allowed on a federal site , he said .
iReport.com : Gun rights and health care
In both instances , the men carrying weapons were outside the venues where Obama was speaking .
" We pay attention to this obviously ... to someone with a firearm when they open carry even when they are within state law , " Donovan said .
" We work with our law enforcement counterparts to make sure laws and regulations in their states are enforced . "
CNN 's Carol Cratty and Samira Simone contributed to this report .

L'Union européenne est parvenue à accélérer l'engagement des différents constructeurs de téléphonie mobile visant à fournir un chargeur standardisé et compatible avec les futurs mobiles .
À terme , il ne sera plus nécessaire de ranger au placard les vieux chargeurs , un seul sera nécessaire pour recharger n'importe quel appareil .
Bonne nouvelle pour les consommateurs .
La Commission européenne est parvenue à négocier un protocole d’accord avec les constructeurs de téléphones portables pour établir une norme standard pour les chargeurs dès 2010 , au lieu de 2012 comme le prévoyait l’industrie .
Poussés par Bruxelles , les signataires de cet accord ( Apple , Nokia , Sony Ericsson , Samsung , Texas Instrument , LG , NEC , Qualcomm , Motorola et RIM ) devront fournir des chargeurs à connecteur micro-USB compatibles avec l’ensemble des futurs modèles qui seront lancés sur le marché .
Désormais , il sera possible de recharger les batteries des différents téléphones portables avec un seul chargeur standardisé , pour d’une part limiter des dépenses superflues pour le client et l’entassement d’un matériel inutilisable car incompatible , mais aussi pour réduire la masse de déchets engendrée par cette industrie qui produisait des chargeurs propriétaires .
Le Commissaire chargé du dossier Guenter Verheugen a indiqué qu’en plus d’une victoire pour les consommateurs , cet accord est également un bon point pour l’environnement , tout en évitant la modification de la législation grâce à la coopération des différentes sociétés : « les gens n’auront plus à jeter leur vieux chargeur lorsqu’ils achèteront un nouveau téléphone » a indiqué le responsable .
En effet , les différents accessoires indésirables , superflus ou obsolètes représentent plusieurs centaines de tonnes de déchets en Europe .

But defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio said it was too early to make a decision about Young 's status for the Ravens game .

Tell us your food allergies
WE WERE just settling down for our flight when the captain ’s voice came over the PA system .
“ Ladies and gentlemen , I am sorry to disturb you , but we have a passenger on board who has a severe nut allergy .
Could I ask you please not to open or eat any food that contains nuts for the duration of the flight ?
I am sorry for any inconvenience .
We hope you enjoy your flight . ”
It was no coincidence that at the time I was on my way to a conference on food allergy in Vienna , Austria .
Hazel Gowland , food adviser to the The Anaphylaxis Campaign in the UK , was travelling for the same reason , and it was for her benefit that the captain made his request .
While such an announcement may not be an everyday occurrence , most of us are familiar with the idea that peanuts can trigger a life - threatening allergic reaction .
But peanuts are n’t the biggest concern in every country .
Passengers from Greece , where peanut allergy is rather rare , might have been more concerned about the melon in the fruit salad .
A passenger from the south of Italy might have pushed the in - flight apple juice to one side for fear that it might trigger a skin rash and stomach pains , a reaction that would puzzle a compatriot from northern Italy .
Why such regional differences exist is just one of the many mysteries surrounding food allergies .
Why , for example , do some migrants from east Asia develop an allergy to jackfruit when …
Some of the health care legislation being considered by Congress would require insurers to increase their disclosure to patients of possible out - of - network costs .
And President Obama has proposed changing how Medicare sets its payments to doctors and hospitals .
But there are no specific proposals to control prices for out - of - network medical services .
In the survey , patients were insured but saw doctors who were out of their networks of care providers .
Those doctors have no obligation to accept the out - of - network fee from insurers as payment in full .
Patients may then be accountable for the balance .
“ That is what generally happens , ” said Susan Pisano , a spokeswoman for the health insurers ’ group .
“ The consumer is responsible . ”
The survey looked at 10 companies that insure patients in the 30 most populous states ; the companies provided some of the highest bills from 2008 .
Researchers excluded two types of charges that were likely to be erroneous : those that were greater than 10,000 percent of Medicare ’s fees for a procedure , or more than 2,000 percent of Medicare ’s fees and also more than 50 percent higher than the next - highest bill for the same procedure .

State laws protecting patients from getting stuck with medical bills in excess of their normal deductibles or co-payments vary widely , said Betsy M. Pelovitz , the group ’s vice president for state policy .
And , she said , the laws often offer little or no protection to patients who seek care outside their insurance networks .
In New York , patients with managed - care insurers cannot be asked to pay more than the applicable co-payment , deductible or co-insurance for an ambulance regardless of whether the provider is in or out of their network .
In New Jersey , hospital emergency rooms treating Medicaid managed - care patients must accept Medicaid payments as payment in full and cannot bill patients extra .
In Connecticut , a state law says it is “ unfair trade practice ” for medical providers to ask patients to pay more than a deductible or co-payment for services covered by their insurance .
My wife turned to me as the credits rolled and asked , “ Can you sue a production company for inaccurate science in a movie ? ”
“ Hmmm … good point ! ” I said .
“ Unfortunately , though , I think it ’s just called ‘ being creative . ’ ”
But that got me thinking .
Knowing not very much
We ’d just sat through the Nicholas Cage disaster movie Knowing after heavily criticising the last hour of magical solar flares , prophecies , silly religious undertones and complete disregard for a little thing called “ science . ”
Oh , and there were aliens .
Who would have guessed ?!
I would say that apart from these things , it was actually a pretty good film … but I ’d be lying .
Well , a little .
I was actually quite impressed by the assorted disaster CGI and the acting ( I ’m glad Rose Byrne is getting some big roles , as I think she rocked in Damages ) , but generally , I was disappointed .
I think I would have enjoyed it more if the director Alex Proyas did n’t have such a contempt for asking a science advisor for …
I dunno… “ advice . ”
In fact , I ’m not even going to bother researching whether there was a science advisor in the production crew or not , because either a ) the rest of the crew did n’t listen to him / her , b ) the science advisor was lying about his / her credentials or , c ) the science advisor was stoned / drunk while on the set .
Therefore , in my mind , there was n’t a science advisor involved in the making of this film .
Putting the stupid plot , aliens ( double - facepalm ) , Byrne ’s character ’s death and no science advisor to one side , I still cannot understand how they got solar flares so wrong .
Kaboom !
Whoooshhh !
Fizzzzz … .
I ’m not being funny , it ’s as if Proyas did n’t bother to Google “ solar flare , ” just to check to see how solar flares really do work .
Hell , go to the self - explanatory HowStuffWorks.com and do a search for “ Sun . ”
If either one of these things were done during pre-production , the science may actually have been plausable .
In a totally forgettable scene , right toward the end of the movie , the uber - scary solar flare waits to be blasted at Earth .
Cage gets on the phone to his Dad saying something like , “ You know it ’s been pretty hot lately ?
Well , it ’s about to get hotter ! ”
That ’s an epic solar fail already .
For some reason , the world had gotten hotter and everyone just shrugged it off as a warm October ?
I ’m thinking the Sun would need to be whacking out a huge increase in energy , and in which case , those bumbling solar physicists or the N.O.A.A. ( or “ EN - Oh - Ay - Ay ” as the cast painstakingly spells out ) might have noticed ?
I ’m a stickler for realism in movies — so this is just a personal gripe — but why were n’t real images of the Sun from SOHO , TRACE , Yohkoh , Hinode or STEREO ( let alone the countless ground - based solar observatories ) used at all through the entire film ?
Instead , we see a strange blob of CGI graphic , shimmering like a corporate logo on computer screens , being referred to as “ our Sun . ”
I ’m pretty sure NASA would have happily provided some real pictures of “ our Sun ” if they were asked .
Solar flares or cosmic death rays ?
But the best part of the entire movie is when we get hit by the super flare .
Oh dear lord .
If you were n’t terrified of the Sun before , you will be now .
That thing can incinerate cities !
It ’s radiation can penetrate the Earth a mile deep !
Holy cow , it is like a trillion - billion atomic bombs all going off at the same time !!!
Ah , I stand corrected .
The production crew obviously did Google “ solar flare , ” but only read the bit where it says “ … an energy of 100 million Hiroshima bombs is released … ”
That ’s big right ?
Yep , Earth is toast !
Unfortunately , they did n’t read the bit which points out that this huge explosion occurs deep in the solar corona , 100 million miles away ( that ’s a long way away ) .
Also , they did n’t realize that even the biggest solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( the latter was n’t mentioned once for the whole movie ) are deflected by our planet ’s magnetosphere and thick atmosphere .
The only science that was mentioned was that the “ flare ” would hit our atmosphere , destroying our ozone , thereby killing everything on the planet .
In actuality , if you watched the “ flare ” hit Earth , I ’m not sure what the ozone had to do with anything !
That “ flare ” was like a cosmic ray gun , ripping through the atmosphere and the Empire State Building ( oh yes , there was a lot of “ famous landmark shredding ” ) as if it was a hot knife slicing butter .
I do n’t think we need to worry about excessive UV exposure due to lack of ozone when Earth is on fire .
There ’s a list of things that annoyed me about this movie , and I do n’t have the patience to mock all points , but after my wife wondered about suing a movie for bad science , I got to thinking what damage movies do to the perception of science .
Oh yes , I know it ’s sci - fi , I know it ’s “ just a movie , ” I really do know that it ’s not real , but would n’t it be fun to have a disaster flick that uses some real science for a change ?
Real science is sexy too
As I was discussing with solar physicist Alex Young in last week ’s filming of the Discovery Channel 2012 documentary , the real threat of a massive solar flare is actually pretty daunting .
Granted , the Sun is n’t about to fire a cosmic death ray at us ( and let ’s face it , the Sun is n’t going to do anything any time soon ) , setting the planet on fire , but the real physics would be awesome if used in a disaster movie .
Just imagine if we had a disaster movie that depicted a solar flare erupting on the surface of the Sun , just above a highly active region of clustered sunspots and stressed coronal loops .
We could see real movies of intense magnetic activity , and then suddenly the blinding burst of electromagnetic radiation .
This flare could be the biggest the Earth has seen in modern times .
The X - rays from this event knock out solar observatories , stunning the delicate light - collecting CCDs in their cameras .
These X - rays immediately slam into our ionosphere , causing a massive surge of electrons , blocking global communications .
This may have the knock - on effect of causing our atmosphere to heat up and swell , increasing the drag on our orbiting satellites .
In the first moment when we see the flare , already we see global problems .
But this would only be a precursor to something a lot worse …
I can imagine the scene in the perfect movie :
Our brave , and smart solar physicists are looking at live data streaming from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) , a multi- instrument telescope sitting between the Earth and the Sun .
They see an expanding bubble growing well beyond the disk of the Sun .
An alert is sent out to the authorities ; a CME is coming … and it ’s headed straight for us … it will hit in a few hours .
Cue the countdown to CME impact ( the suspense will be tangible , you wo n’t be moving from your seat ) .
But wait !
Communications are patchy , the ionosphere just blocked the satellite link to the US President … time is running out !
Bruce Willis , our hero heliospheric expert , steps in and volunteers to notify the president himself ( with a gun in his pocket , as there ’s bound to be an assassin or terrorist out there to shoot at ) .
Planetary mayhem
But the fun would really begin when the CME slams into our magnetosphere .
The magnetic field of the CME and that of the Earth ’s hit in such a way that they reconnect , flooding the magnetosphere with high energy particles .
The Earth ’s Van Allen belts become supercharged like radioactive reservoirs .
Satellites are overcome by high - energy particle impacts .
Global Positioning Satellites ( GPS ) go offline .
Communication satellites suffer drag and literally start to drop out of the sky .
And it gets worse !
The solar particles are deflected toward the poles , but the solar storm is so intense , particles penetrate deeper , generating vast aurorae at low latitudes .
Even equatorial regions would see vast light shows as the particles flood in from space .
Although amazingly beautiful , this has yet another side - effect , our atmosphere just became a huge conductor , where vast currents flow as electrojets .
These electrojets generate massive magnetic fields , in turn overloading our national grids .
We now have no power and no means to communicate .
We ’re blind and unable to function .
Governments are overwhelmed .
Imagine Katrina - scale events all over the USA … all over the world .
Who can help ?
Suddenly the $ 2 trillion damage estimate made by NASA seems too small … after all , we ’d be plunged back into the dark ages , how can you count costs in dollars when a financial system no longer exists ?
Conclusion
I do n’t expect movies to be totally scientifically accurate .
However , if you are basing an entire storyline on one harbinger of doom , at least get that right .
A solar flare will hit Earth in the future , there ’s even a very good chance that we ’ll get hit by a “ big one ” that could cause some collateral damage .
In fact , if we are very unlucky , a large solar storm could be considered “ civilization ending . ”
Yes , asteroids pose a clear and present danger to life on Earth , but do n’t forget the Sun , it has a history of getting angry when the Earth is in the orbital firing line .
If that is n’t a great plot for a disaster movie , I do n’t know what is .
THE NUMBER of people sent to prison for failing to pay fines or debts jumped by almost 90 per cent last year .
The figures increased from 1,335 in 2007 to 2,520 in 2008 , most likely driven by the recession and rising unemployment .
Overall , the Irish Prison Service ’s annual report for 2008 shows the number of people being sent to jail is rising .
There were 13,600 prisoners on remand ( a 14 per cent increase ) and 8,000 under sentence ( a 25 per cent increase ) over the past year .
In a statement , the service said this was “ attributable to the increasing success of An Garda Síochána in prosecuting criminals and extra court sittings which have resulted in higher committal rates ” .
Most prisons in the State were operating at or near total capacity during last year .
Mountjoy , Castlerea , Cloverhill , Cork , Limerick women ’s prison and Wheatfield were all operating above capacity .
To cope with the growing numbers , prison authorities say an additional 400 spaces will come on stream this year .
There were a total of 759 incidents of violence involving prisoners during 2008 , amounting to about two incidents a day among a population of about 3,500 inmates .
While commentators say violent incidents are linked to chronic overcrowding , the report notes the number of assaults is “ comparatively low ” in the context of the volume and profile of prisoners in custody .
“ No regime can completely eliminate the possibility of violent incidents happening in a prisons setting where we are holding a large number of dangerous and violent offenders , ” the report adds .
It also shows that some 20 per cent of the entire prison population , or 832 prisoners , was segregated for its own protection by December 5th , 2008 .
The report states : “ The majority of prisoners who seek to go on protection do so not because they fear random acts of violence in prison , but rather because of issues which accrued on the outside . ”
In extreme cases , it states a prisoner on protection may be on “ 23 - hour lock - up ” .
But mostly prisoners are accommodated in communal settings with other vulnerable prisoners .
An apparent decline in immigration was also reflected in the number of people detained under the State ’s immigration laws .
There were just over 1,000 committals last year , a 16 per cent drop on the previous year ’s figures .
The average cost of a prison place was € 92,000 , up from € 85,000 the year previously .
This was due mainly to increases in salaries , the annual report notes .
Sick leave is still a thorny issue among staff , with prison staff taking an average of 20 days leave last year .
This is down from 22 days last year .
On foot of tougher security measures , some 2,047 mobile phones were seized from prisoners last year .
Prison authorities are also piloting new mobile phone jamming equipment which they intend to extend across the prison service .
Serious crimes appear to be on the increase , given the rise in numbers serving long sentences .
The number of prisoners serving sentences of 10 years or more increased by almost 40 per cent , driven mainly by drug - related offences .
Committals for road traffic offences also jumped dramatically ( 44 per cent ) .
A recurring difficulty in recent years has been providing appropriate treatment to acutely mentally ill prisoners , the report notes .
A lack of capacity at the Central Mental Hospital for prisoners resulted in a waiting list of about 15 prisoners each week in the second half of last year .
Since health authorities agreed to open an additional 10 beds at the hospital in November 2008 , the report states that much progress has been made in tackling waiting lists .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The government - run health insurance option favored by President Barack Obama is not essential to a healthcare overhaul as long as the final measure boosts competition , a top U.S. health official said on Sunday .
Ernest Sass , 52 , ( L ) winces as he is attended to by Girish Bobby Kapur , M.D. ( R ) in a room used to see patients who do n't require treatment for trauma inside the emergency room at Ben Taub General Hospital in Houston , Texas July 27 , 2009 .

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said a public insurance option was “ not the essential element ” of any overhaul , and non-profit cooperatives being considered by a Senate panel could also fulfill the White House goal of creating more competition on insurance .
“ I think what ’s important is choice and competition , and I ’m convinced that at the end of the day the plan will have both of those -- but that is not the essential element , ” she said of the government - run insurance option on CNN ’s “ State of the Union ” show .
“ The president is just continuing to say let ’s not have this be the only focus of the conversation , ” Sebelius said .
Democratic proposals in Congress for a government - run insurance option have sparked intense opposition from Republicans who argue it would unfairly compete with private plans and would cripple the insurance industry .
The government option has become a key focus of opposition charges that the overhaul , Obama ’s top domestic priority , would amount to a government takeover of healthcare .
Six members of the Senate Finance Committee -- three from each party -- have been negotiating a reform package that would feature member - controlled non-profit cooperatives instead of the government - run plan .
“ I think there will be a competitor to private insurers , ” Sebelius said .
“ That ’s really the essential part , is you do n’t turn over the whole new marketplace to private insurance companies and trust them to do the right thing . ”
‘ BOTTOM LINE ’ CONCERNS
Slideshow ( 2 images )
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs avoided a direct response when asked if the exclusion of a government - run option would be a deal - breaker for Obama .
“ The president believes the option of a government plan is the best way to provide competition , ” he said on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation , ” but he added the White House looked forward to the Finance Committee ’s ideas .
“ The bottom line again is do individuals looking for health insurance in the private market have choice and competition ? ” Gibbs said .
“ If we have that the president will be satisfied . ”
Obama has pushed a healthcare overhaul that he says would rein in costs , improve care and extend coverage to most of the 46 million uninsured Americans , but the measure has run into stiff opposition from Republican and conservative groups and some elements of the healthcare industry .
Lawmakers at home for the August recess have faced vocal and sometimes disruptive critics at healthcare information sessions .
The controversy has driven down Obama ’s approval ratings and possibly jeopardized passage of the healthcare legislation when Congress returns in September .
Obama has intensified his public lobbying for the measure , and held three public “ town hall ” meetings on healthcare last week to counter the criticism .
In a New York Times opinion piece on Sunday , Obama said “ for all the scare tactics out there , what ’s truly scary -- truly risky -- is the prospect of doing nothing . ”
Republican Senator Richard Shelby , a sharp critic of the administration ’s healthcare reform effort , said a public cooperative option would be “ a step in the right direction . ”
“ I think the Democratic administration -- President Obama and his Cabinet -- have read the tea leaves of America right now , ” he said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
Democratic Senator Kent Conrad , a member of the so - called “ Gang of Six ” negotiators on the Finance Committee , said the cooperative model could attract Republican support .
Conrad has argued Democrats do not have enough votes to pass a healthcare overhaul without Republican support , even though Democrats control Congress .
“ Co-ops are very prevalent in our society .
They have been a very successful business model , ” Conrad said .
“ It is the only plan that has bipartisan support in the United States Senate . ”

Apple ’s decision not to include a camera in the new iPod Touch is somewhat surprising .
After all , there is already a perfect camera for the job , and it sits inside the iPhone .
That Apple included a video camera inside the iPod Nano makes this more inexplicable still – the Apple of today is clearly happy to put cameras into its media players ( unlike the first iPhone , whose camera was so poor we thought it was just a petulant capitulation to cellphone norms ) .
Leaving the camera out is also a clear signal not to upgrade the Touch , as – apart from a larger 64 - GB model – the only hardware change is a juiced - up processor , making the iPod Touch run faster like its older brother the iPhone 3GS .
Perhaps Apple is putting the Touch on a two - year update plan like the iPhone , letting people keep their pocket computers for a little longer than usual .
It 's also likely that Apple wants to maintain enough differences between the Touch and the iPhone to give people plenty of reasons to buy the more expensive device .
Had the Touch included a camera , I would be knocking on the store doors right now to buy one , along with 64 GB ready to be filled with photos and video .
So the excitement falls to the Nano , which , sports a new shiny coating , a 640 x 480 video camera ( no stills ) and a larger screen on the outside , and an FM radio on the inside with a Tivo - esque live - pause feature .
The radio itself is odd enough , and the first to be included in any iPod .
More on that in a moment .
The Nano 's video camera was introduced with reference to Flip 's own tiny , no -zoom camcorder .
There are two Flip camcorders at the 8 - GB Nano's $ 150 price : the 2 - GB Mino and the 4 - GB Ultra .
To get 4 GB and 8 GB you jump to $ 200 .
The 16 - GB Nano costs $ 180 .
Why would somebody buy a Flip ?
The easy , one - button recording , perhaps ( with the Nano , you need to go to a menu item to open the video camera application ) , but that 's it .
Take a look at the sample videos at the Apple store and you 'll see that the Nano 's quality is easily " good enough . "
There is another surprise in there , too .
The tiny Nano frame has a chip big enough to add real - time effects to video .
Gimmicky , but as we guess this is aimed at the teenage market , a nice feature .
The Nano is the fitness iPod , too , and in this guise it makes another piece of hardware obsolete : the shoe - mounted Nike + dongle .
The Nano comes with the Nike + software , with workout history , power songs and the like , but the accelerometer now works as a pedometer , counting your steps to flab - loss .
You can also connect it to a Nike +
iPod -compatible cardio machine via the dock connector .
One mystery remains , though .
Why would Apple put an FM tuner into an iPod , something it has refused for almost 10 years ?
The answer comes with iTunes - Tagging .
In addition to live pausing of the radio stream ( and rewinding up to 15 minutes through the buffer ) you can tag tracks by hitting the center button .
If a radio station supports it , the song info is saved and later you can see a list in iTunes alongside , you guessed it , the option to buy the song .
Of course , the fact that the new Zune HD has an HD radio inside may also have influenced Apple 's decision .
So now I 'm torn .
Do I buy a new Touch to replace my current model which has a loose headphone connection , or should I get the Nano , with its video camera and sport - friendly features ?
If Apple had piled the features onto the Touch , the decision would be made , and Apple would have $ 400 of my money .
As it is , I think I 'll wait .

thou shalt not have sex with robots ?
A look inside the secret plot to use porn to ... help replace human women with sex bots because reasons ?
Granted , it ’s been a while since I read the Bible and my education in theology consisted of alternative religions and comparative studies .
However , I ’m pretty sure that there ’s no commandment about laying with robots as one would with a spouse or a cautionary parable about a city of technophillic fornicators who incur the brunt of God ’s wrath .
But that did n’t stop Rich Deem who runs a fundamentalist anti-science site , from writing a long column that warns us about the immortality of sex with machines while heavily borrowing from retro sci- fi novels and anime with techno- romantic overtones .
And along the way , Deem drops the kind of technobabble that would be really funny if you forgot for a moment that he was being completely serious in his ravings .
From the summary of the future given to us over the first half of the article , it becomes abundantly clear that the writer knows pretty much nothing about computers or robotics , casually adding artificial intelligence to future androids , making them out of materials that wo n’t be anywhere close to being ready for mass market use by the time he predicts , and dropping gems of technical incompetence like this …
Besides , the new FACAs were much more realistic than the old ones , since the technology had developed to provide cooling to all the internal computers and simultaneously make the robot warm to the touch by providing fluidics through the computers to dissipate heat through a network of “ capillaries ” located just under the “ skin . ”
How exactly would the same fluid intended to cool the internal computers simultaneously make a robot warm to the touch ?
Clearly the principles of thermodynamics do n’t apply in Deem ’s universe , which is odd because his inability to understand the difference between warm and cold makes you wonder how much research and scholarship went into his articles about the proof for God ’s existence and refutation of evolution .
Generally , if you ca n’t do arithmetic , you should n’t be lecturing people on calculus .
Oh and could somebody tell me why in the world would fluidics be necessary in a machine that relies on digital signals in the first place ?
Deem ’s description of the sex bots makes me think that he just read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ?
or watched the movie Bladerunner , got all excited about the love scene between Rick and Rachel , then decided to type out his cautionary parable and tie it to something else he finds scintillating , but forbidding and immoral in the extreme .
To answer the question of who would develop androids wired for sex with humans , he re-casts a reliable old villain into a mad inventor hell bent on profit by any means necessary …
Not content with merely an online presence , the adult entertainment industry soon realized that androids , properly constructed , could earn them billions of dollars in additional revenue .
Top programmers and engineers were hired away from the automakers and computer companies with offers of up to ten times their average salaries , similar to what had been done with their movie businesses in the late 2010 ’s , when they had hired away Hollywood ’s best CG programmers to turn out realistic - looking virtual pornography movies .
Ah , so it was all a big porn conspiracy !
Ok , I see what he ’s doing here .
After giving us a science fiction parable infused with all the creativity and originality of the fine print for credit card privacy statements , Deem descends into a stereotypical rant against pornography and our gall to tolerate it as an acceptable form of entertainment for adults .
If we disagree , he has a laundry list of nine hackneyed and factually incorrect charges against porn based on nothing more than what ’s already thrown out there by groups that want to control our sexuality .
And again , painful bursts of woeful ignorance come at you from every line of his screed .
Why in the world would adult video outfits , the vast majority of which operate on a small budget and run a tight ship , possibly pay more than ten times the average salary of an expert programmer or a graphic artist ( which would come to about $ 1 million per year ) to create photorealistic renders of something for which they have no lack of volunteers already ?
Today , you can take a small group of erm … actors , film them having sex , edit it in a few days and have a video out by the end of the week .
Meanwhile , recreating this in CG would require a major server farm , millions of dollars of equipment and about a year of production and rendering .
Again , we ’re sitting in a calculus lecture by someone who does n’t know how to add two and two .
And just to complete this unique mix of technophobia , ignorance and self - righteousness , Deem displays what we ’re all supposed to take as a dire warning to go along with this article …
This page is going to seem rather far out and unrealistic , given today ’s moral standards .
However , the standards are rapidly changing , and within a few years the human race will be in a position in which sexual immorality could exist on a widespread scale .
No Rich , it ’s going to seem far out and unrealistic because you have n’t the slightest grasp of the technology or the economics involved and your porn - will - make - you - have - sex - with - robots theory is totally asinine at best and raises all sorts of Freudian questions about the author .
If all the sex toys in the world ca n’t replace a person , a few hundred pounds of heavy machinery with a very rudimentary pretence of AI sure is n’t going to be the death knell to human sexuality as we know it .
And if you really think that any of this is feasible , you really need to get out more or find a hobby .
Preferably one that does n’t involve robots and computers .
Just in case …

Australian men make the worst husbands in the world because they loathe helping out with the housework , a British study claims .
An economist from Oxford University found that women wanting to settle down were better off finding a bloke from Scandinavia , the United States or Britain than Australia .
Study author Dr Almudena Sevilla - Sanz said that based on her study of 12 developed countries , men and women were both more likely to cohabit or marry if they believed their partner would help out with the household chores and child care .
But it appears that when it comes to finding a husband willing to help out , Australian women have a tough time .
Dr Sevilla - Sanz 's study ranked Australia as the least egalitarian society , making its men unattractive marriage partners because they were more unlikely to do household chores .
Norway , Sweden , Great Britain , the US and Northern Ireland were judged to be the most egalitarian countries .
Next were the Netherlands , Ireland , Spain , New Zealand , Japan , Germany , Austria and Australia in last place .
" In egalitarian countries you might , in principle , expect to see women preferring to remain single rather than face the prospect of spending more time doing household chores , " Dr Sevilla - Sanz said .
" However , this study shows that in egalitarian countries there is less social stigma attached to men doing what was traditionally women 's work .
" For instance , if paternity leave is the social norm , more men take it .
" This leads to men in egalitarian societies taking on more of a domestic role , so the likelihood of forming a harmonious household becomes greater , resulting in a higher proportion of couples setting up households in these countries . "
The study 's findings were based on a survey of 13,500 men and women aged 20 to 45 from each of the 12 countries .
Each was asked about their attitudes to gender , housework and childcare responsibilities .
The study found that women living in less egalitarian countries were 20 to 50 per cent less likely to live with a man compared with women in more egalitarian societies .
The study , titled Household Division of Labour and Cross - Country Differences in Household Formation Rates , is due to be published in the Journal of Population Economics .

Himalaya ( dpo ) - Einmal mehr sorgt der Yeti für Aufsehen : Der legendäre Schneemensch behauptete gegenüber dem , er habe ein UFO nicht nur beobachtet , sondern sogar mit seinem iPhone fotografiert .
Zum Beweis legte er ein verwackeltes Foto vor , auf dem eine Art Flugscheibe zu erkennen ist .
Doch für die vermeintliche Sensation scheint es eine völlig harmlose Erklärung zu geben .
Spezialisten , die das Bildmaterial inzwischen ausgewertet haben , sind davon überzeugt , dass es sich bei dem " Unidentifizierbaren Flugobjekt " wohl um einen Wetterballon oder ein chinesisches Militärflugzeug handelt .
" Das Foto ist denkbar unscharf .
Was wir sehen , ist aber sicherlich nicht extraterrestrischen Ursprungs " , bestätigte Prof. Mei Hoao gegenüber dem .
" Welche Art Aliens würde ' Volksrepublik China ' auf die Außenwand ihres Raumschiffes schreiben ?
" Parazoologen sind sich ohnehin einig , dass der Yeti lediglich Aufmerksamkeit schinden will .

Nitroglycerin is moderately easy to detonate , and a hammer is more than enough .
Nitrogen triiodide will detonate if it is breathed on .
It is an explosive with no use other than a novelty .
A few factoids - Nitric acid , the acid shown in the beginning of the video , will cause very deep chemical burns that take weeks to heal after contact of just five seconds .
It also fumes , and the vapor is very choking .
The red gas in the flask is nitrogen dioxide , a very toxic gas that can produce , and be produced from , nitric acid .
Sulfuric acid is also dangerous and very reactive to flesh , but is not close to the danger of nitric acid .
As we near the release of Microsoft 's Windows 7 in October , insiders are now trying to predict just how popular it will be amongst consumers .
A recent report suggests it could be very successful indeed .
According to industry analysts IDC , Windows 7 should account for approximately half of all client operating systems shipped to corporate users by the year 2010 .
IDC predicts that should mean about 58 million copies of the new OS , which is set to ship October 22 , 2009 .
Vista 's Eclipse on Horizon
The prediction means a quick eclipse of Windows Vista and even the long - lasting Windows XP , the operating system many companies have used for years .
Technically , the IDC believes Windows 7 will account for 49.5 percent of all Windows - based operating systems purchased by corporations , with 2007 's much - criticized Vista pulling up far behind at 15 percent ( totaling about 18 million copies ) .
Thus far , Amazon.com reports that pre-sales of Windows 7 have been very hot since the online retailer opened sales up over a week ago .
( Source : pcworld.com )
Win7 : Huge Market Share by 2011 Predicted
If you think Windows 7 's popularity in 2010 sounds impressive , then get this : IDC predicts that by 2011 , the much - anticipated OS should comprise 75 percent of the Windows - based market , with Vista all but gone at 0.5 percent .
Microsoft 's Windows 7 recently moved to manufacturing .
The Redmond - based firm has also appointed a new Windows 7 boss , Steven Sinofsky , who will head the $ 17 billion Windows client division as it approaches the home stretch towards a fall release .

Well , this should pose a problem for devout Catholics everywhere …
The Virgin Mary has been found in a–well , see for yourself :
Of all the places for a virgin to appear …
I would love to know if someone noticed that post - coitum or if they just shaped it that way .
Either way , I ’m disturbed .

*** Update ***:
The image has now been properly linked to Riemann ’s Cut , where it originated .
We get a lot of e-mails every day .
Often , the message carries a subject line that reflects a gross exaggeration ( at best ) of the information contained therein .
So when perusing the e-mail box after taking a workout break ( and then eating a lunch big enough to more than offset the benefits of the workout ) , I shrugged when I saw the following message heading : “ Mike Vick may have already violated terms of NFL reinstatement . ”
Then I opened the message .
It contained a link to an August 16 item in the New York Post .
Brian Costello of the Post writes in the first paragraph of the article that , on the evening after Vick ’s return to the practice field , he “ sat in a corner booth . . . in the Riverbend Bar & Grill ,
sipping on a Grey Goose and pineapple juice and talking with two friends . ”
Grey Goose , for those of you unfamiliar with Maurice Clarett , is vodka .
The problem ?
Vick ’s conditional reinstatement to the NFL contains an express prohibition against the use of drugs and alcohol .
In the July 27 letter communicating to Vick his conditional reinstatement , Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote that “ you are required to abide
by the terms of the supervised release that were imposed on you by the
court , which include not committing any further crime , limits on who
you may associate with , prohibitions regarding drug and alcohol use ,
possession of a firearm or other dangerous weapon , and forbidding you
to own , possess or be involved with the sale of any dog . ”
So , basically , wow .
We ’re certain that , if this becomes an issue , there will be explanations and clarifications and anything but an admission that Vick was drinking alcohol .
Still , the mere fact that Costello wrote that Vick was drinking vodka in public demonstrates the extreme care Vick must exercise not only to stay within his razor - thin margin for error , but also to create a clear perception on the part of others that he has n’t done anything to violate the terms of his reinstatement or , more importantly , his probation .
Update , Aug 18 , 2009 : I ’m amazed at how much attention this post has received .
More than 200 comments on Reddit .
I was just listening to the Why comments are evil episode of Deep Fried Bytes .
The views put forward by the guest , Corey Haines , deeply resonate with me because I believe they ’re what every developer should strive for .
I ’m not advocating that code should be entirely free of comments , but rather that most comments do more harm than good .
Below I ’ve listed the main points of view .
It ’s important to differentiate between code comments and API documentation .
For API documentation , do n’t auto - generate .
Especially do n’t go with tools like GhostDoc .
Take the time to document properly .
Otherwise , you ’re more likely to confuse the developer trying to make sense of your code .
Stop focusing on having the computer understand you and start focusing on the person that comes after you , e.g. , while there ’s some overhead to method calls , unless the profiler tells you otherwise , do n’t hesitate to break down a method into as many smaller methods as it takes to make it more approachable .
Every time you ’re tempted to comment , take the time to think if you can make the code tell its own story , e.g. , instead of some branching condition , extract the condition into a method to emphasize the story of why over how .
Developers comment to explain a confusing part of their code rather than take the time to refactor it by extracting a method or naming a variable properly .
Inevitably the code gets modified and the comment rots .
Parts of a method may be complicated so a comment is added .
Saying part of a method is complicated is in itself a sign that it ’s doing too much .
The prevailing culture among developers is to focus on what it takes to get code working .
It ’s a battle of short - term vs. long - term maintainability and short - term almost always comes out as the winner .
Writing code , ask yourself if you ’re able to immediately understand the code a month from now .
The opinions put forward in the episode are n’t new .
Still , I find them well worth iterating because as developers we tend to not pay enough attention to them .
We tend to focus too little on good software craftsmanship .
Cognitive Deficiencies of Sen. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III
VIDEO : Sessions ' ' checkered past , ' history of baseless minority ' voter fraud ' allegations reviewed ...

" I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life . "
- Judge Sonia Sotomayor , 2001 .
" I want to state up front , unequivocally and without doubt , I do not believe that any ethnic , racial , or gender group has an advantage in sound judging .
I do believe that every person has an equal opportunity to be a good and wise judge regardless of their background or life experiences . "
- Judge Sonia Sotomayor , July 14 , 2009 .
A fair reading of the full context of Judge Sotomayor 's 2001 University of California remarks reveals that the above two statements are not inconsistent .
In the first , Sotomayor was merely giving recognition to what cognitive science has long recognized --- that differences in culture , background , and experience create frames through which our minds process data , or as George Lakoff observes in Don't Think of an Elephant and in greater depth in Moral Politics : " Concepts are not things that can be changed by people telling us a fact .
Frames are needed to make sense of the facts . "
Sotomayor 's personal history suggests a progressive world view , or what Lakoff refers to as the Nurturant Parent Model , which emphasizes concepts like empathy , fairness in opportunity and relativity .
Such concepts were put into stark contrast with those of her lead inquisitor in this week 's Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearings , where Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R - AL ) --- whose " checkered past " includes allegations of racism , a nearly - unprecedented rejection by a Republican - led Judiciary Committee for his appointment to the federal bench and a long track record of obsession with non-existent minority " voter fraud " --- led the ironic attack on her record ...
The " conservative " frame arises from what Lakoff refers to as the Strict Father Morality , which lends itself to a more authoritarian mindset ; a Manichean world - view that sees reality in absolutes .
This thinking prevents some from appreciating , for example , how differences in gender and the concept of empathy can have a legitimate impact upon judicial decisions .
One such example is the recent case involving the issue of whether a strip search of a 13 year old girl was " unreasonable . "
In that case , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg had to explain to her male counterparts something none of them had experienced --- the special sensitivities that come with being a 13 year old girl .
It was a circumstance , only with such an appreciation in mind , that each of her male counterparts could hope to empathize .
Rightwing overreaction finds its embodiment in the opening remarks of Sessions at the Sotomayor confirmation hearings :
Our legal system is at a dangerous cross-road .
Down one path is a traditional American system so admired around the world that judges impartially apply the law to the facts without regard to personal views .
This is the compassionate system because it ’s the fair system … .
Our legal system is based on a firm belief in an ordered universe and objective truth .
The trial is a process by which the impartial and wise judge guides us to truth .
Down the other path , lies a brave new world where words have no true meaning and judges are free to decide what facts they choose to see .
The appointment of a moderate jurist creates " a dangerous cross- road " ?
It appears that Sessions is oblivious to the impact of his own checkered past on how he perceives the world and those with whom he does not agree .
Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III is very much a product of the Jim Crow South .
He was born Dec. 24 , 1946 , and raised in a rural Alabama town .
As revealed by Sarah Wildman in a 2002 New Republic piece , " Closed Sessions , " he would become one of only two Reagan judicial nominees who failed to be confirmed by a then Republican - controlled Senate in 1996 .
He was one of only two in fifty years to have such a distinction .
In a forerunner to more recent scandals , Sessions , as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama , initiated a dubious " voter fraud " prosecution against three civil rights workers in three " Black Belt " counties .
Wildman observed , " Sessions ' focus on these counties to the exclusion of others caused an uproar among civil rights leaders , especially after hours of interrogating black absentee voters produced only 14 allegedly tampered ballots out of more than 1.7 million cast in the state in the 1984 election . "
A former Justice Department employee testified that Sessions had referred to the NAACP & ACLU as " Un- American " and " Communist inspired , " even going so far as to suggest these groups " forced civil rights down the throats of people . "
Per Wildman , " Sessions ... called a white civil rights lawyer a ' disgrace to his race ' for litigating voting rights cases , " and referred to the crucial , and bi-partisan supported 1965 Voting Rights
Act as a " piece of intrusive legislation . "
At one point , Sessions reportedly said he used to think the KKK was " okay , " at least until he learned they might be pot smokers .
The continued impact of his formative years , growing up on the wrong side of the civil rights movement , can be seen in Sessions ' support for George W. Bush 's judicial nominees such as Charles Pickering , who , Wildman reports , " in 1959 wrote a paper defending Mississippi 's anti-miscegenation law , and Judge Dennis Shedd , who dismissed nearly every fair - employment civil rights case brought before him as a federal district court judge . "
The question we are left with , then , is whether Sessions ' perceived " dangerous cross- road " arises simply because he misunderstood Judge Sotomayor 's 2001 " wise Latina " remark or because , at an unconscious level , he can't accept the idea of a Latina jurist who does not share his narrow world - view ?

According to Credo Action , Verizon Wireless has become the latest advertiser to dump Glenn Beck .
In an email , the group confirmed that the nation ’s largest wireless telecommunications network has stopped advertising on Beck ’s Fox News program .
Even a week of vacation has not completely slowed the steam of the Beck advertiser defections .
Becky Bond , the Political Director for Credo Action said , “ I ’m delighted to let you know that we received confirmation today that Verizon Wireless is no longer advertising on the Glenn Beck show .
ColorOfChange.org has done amazing work to bring national awareness to Beck ’s race - baiting commentary on FOX News Channel .
In the last few weeks , over 20 companies including Wal - Mart , CVS , Best Buy , and Travelocity have confirmed with ColorOfChange.org that they have ceased advertising on the show or placed Glenn Beck ’s program on a “ do not air ” list . ”
This is an interesting development as the brass at Fox News were hoping that a week off would help cool some of the heat Beck generated with his advertisers when he called President Obama a racist .
Once again , it is important to point out that Verizon Wireless did not quit advertising on Fox News , but they requested that their ads are not shown during Beck ’s show .
Advertisements
The list of blue chip companies that are still with Beck is starting to dwindle , but there are still enough corporate advertisers lining up to get access to Beck ’s 2 million viewers a night .
I do n’t understand why Beck ’s supporters consider this boycott censorship , instead of the grass roots democratic movement that it is .
If advertisers do n’t want their companies associated with a man who called the president a racist , it is their right to take their dollars elsewhere .
Glenn Beck has a right to make inflammatory statements and advertisers have a right not to support his show .
This is n’t an Obama conspiracy , or censorship .
It is democracy in action .
Widespread internet attacks that hit services at Google , Facebook and Twitter on Thursday could have been the result of an online assault against a single blogger .
According to senior industry figures , the strikes that affected hundreds of millions of web users around the globe on Thursday were part of an attempt to damage just one individual - a controversial Georgian known only as Cyxymu .
Max Kelly , Facebook 's chief security officer , told CNet news that the strike was an attempt to silence Cyxymu - an outspoken critic of last year 's conflict between Georgia and Russia in South Ossetia - as the anniversary of the war approaches .
" It was a simultaneous attack across a number of properties targeting him to keep his voice from being heard , " Kelly said .
" We 're actively investigating the source of the attacks and we hope to be able to find out the individuals involved in the back end and to take action against them if we can . "
The strikes appeared to be one of the most widespread and coordinated attacks ever seen online , shutting down Twitter for significant portions of Thursday , as well as causing serious problems for Facebook and blogging service LiveJournal .
Google , too , was subjected to attacks but said it had been able to prevent any damage - although some users reported some unexpected problems with the internet giant 's services .
It is not clear precisely how the attacks started or who was behind it , but a vast number of spam messages were also sent out simultaneously mentioning the victim .
With a monicker styled after the cyrillic name for the disputed Black Sea city of Sukhumi , Cyxymu runs a blog written in georgianised Russian and subtitled " of Sukhumi , the war and Bolivia " .
In the past , it was a home for controversial opinions on the way the conflict was handled by both the Russian and Georgian governments - last year resulting in a similar attack by opponents which had crashed LiveJournal.com .
Like many internet users , Cyxymu has accounts across a number of social networking services , and yesterday appeared to recognise that he or she may have been a target .
" It became clear that it is a special attack on me or on Georgians , " Cyxymu said in one message .
" In my mailbox are hundreds of spam emails . "
" Spam was being sent on my behalf with an invitation to go to my blog ... I apologise to everyone . "
Security experts had already suggested to the Guardian that the widespread and apparently random nature of the attacks could be evidence of a grudge or personal vendetta rather than an organised criminal act aimed at blackmailing major websites .
The war in South Ossetia officially started on 7 August last year , after several weeks of growing arguments over the future of the territory .
Following support from Russia , Georgian troops began shelling the town of Tskhinvali .
An estimated 25,000 residents of the region were forced to leave their homes as fighting took place , and although the two countries signed a ceasefire agreement a week later , tensions are still high .
At the time , the conflict resulted in an outbreak of hostilities over the internet , with Russian sympathisers attacking Georgian government websites - the same type of attack which appeared to take place on Thursday .
